262913,415082024,1115863,"CA, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2017",2017-01-24,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I am pleased with the strong CFFO growth and healthy operating margin and EPS we delivered in Q3. On a constant currency basis, our revenue in the quarter came in as expected. Foreign currency headwinds negative",1454,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. 
I am pleased with the strong CFFO growth and healthy operating margin and EPS we delivered in Q3. On a constant currency basis, our revenue in the quarter came in as expected. Foreign currency headwinds negatively impacted reported revenue by an additional 1.5 points in Q3 relative to the September 30 rates. 
As discussed last quarter, we faced a difficult year-over-year compare due to the timing of upfront revenue realized in the year-ago period and the continued attrition of our Services revenue. This continued attrition of our Services revenue is due primarily to our ongoing efforts to develop products that are easier to install and easier to manage. The cadence and quality of our product releases continues to improve. While we are making progress across a number of our key strategic imperatives, we are continuing to work to improve the consistency of our performance across business units, customer groups and geographies. For example, our Mainframe business is performing very well, and our North American Platinum team delivered solid results in the quarter. However, performance in our Named and Growth or partner-led business was inconsistent. 
Total new sales and ES new sales declined in the quarter. This was due to a variety of factors, including very large deals in areas like Privileged Access Management, or PAM, and Service Management that closed in the year-ago period, which created a difficult compare. In addition, the pipeline for some of our products like Project and Portfolio Management, or PPM, is more heavily weighted towards Q4 than it was for Q3. Mainframe performed very well in the quarter, reflecting the combination of key competitive wins, healthy renewal performance and our successful partnerships with global service providers. This is the result of our ongoing organic innovation and commitment to customer success. 
This dedication to customer success extends beyond our software. There is no doubt that we live in a highly integrated world where various systems are interdependent. Our solutions are known to be mission critical, highly reliable and 0 downtime. 
Our Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which is an industry standard measure of loyalty, continues to rise on a positive trajectory. Our customer satisfaction score continues to increase, and our customers are rating our product quality higher. With this backdrop, we are pleased but not surprised by the performance of our Mainframe segment, both in Q3 and through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. Our 0 net new defect policy has resulted in considerably lower customer support issues and higher customer satisfaction. In the quarter, 12 new Mainframe releases went into GA, including new SKUs for CA Development Environment for z Systems, Mainframe Operations Intelligence and CA Release Automation Connector for z/OS. 
We have demonstrated a long-standing commitment to innovating on the Mainframe. Due to the value and quality of our systems, customers continue to rely on the Mainframe for mission-critical applications, which continues to drive MIPS growth. And there is an increasing number of customers choosing to standardize on our solutions. All of these factors are driving our success in this market. 
At CA World in November, we introduced the concept of Built to Change. Companies and organizations used to be Built to Last. Now they must adopt the mindset of Built to Change. New opportunities and new threats are emerging at an accelerated pace. This requires a more Agile approach, which provides a framework to pivot quickly and results in more robust, higher-quality solutions. The adoption of Agile across our development organization is enabling us to develop integrations across a number of our product families, improving the seamlessness of our broad portfolio. For example, at CA World, we released new integrations between our APIM and APM solutions with CA Precision API Monitoring. We introduced new Application Lifecycle Conductor, or ALC, integrations with CA Agile Central. And our latest release of CA Identity Service, our new Security SaaS offering, incorporates new integrations with CA's Single Sign On solution. Users can now access all of their cloud and on-premise applications from a single system. 
There is no question that our end-to-end vision is resonating with customers. Our solutions enable customers to plan, develop, test, manage and monitor with seamless security across all environments. Our APIM business, for example, delivered the largest quarter in its history in Q3, with strength across most geographies, products and routes to market. In the quarter, CA was positioned highest for Ability to Execute in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management. CA was also named a leader in the Forrester Wave: API Management Solutions, Q4 2016. 
In addition to the number of new releases announced at CA World, the APIM team also demonstrated CA API Gateway for Microservices. It also demonstrated industry vertical use cases, including a health care mobile app on top of our Healthcare Portal, and a Finance mobile app with Payment Services Directive and open banking. Customers like service NSW, or New South Wales, in Australia are using our API Management solutions to connect millions of citizens to hundreds of services running on different processes and platforms. Our solutions enable every company to be a software company. We are really excited about our position in the APIM space and the opportunities we see going forward. 
Similarly, our overall portfolio of Continuous Delivery solutions had the best new sales quarter in its history, driven by continued strength in Test Data Management. And all product lines in the business unit released new versions in the quarter. The innovation engine at CA is alive and well. 
Code.org, the organization driving to ensure every student has the opportunity to learn computer science, used CA BlazeMeter to synthetically test its site for over 25 million users at its global hour of Code campaign. The event offered tutorials on more than 30 languages and had the capability of reaching tens of millions of students in more than 180 countries. We are passionate about the need to encourage and expand computer science education to reach a broader population of students. We are very proud of our ability to help ensure the success of Code.org and its events. 
Across our portfolio, we are continuing to focus on developing products that are easier to install and easier to manage without compromising functionality for the sake of simplicity. Agile Central, which also experienced new sales growth in the quarter, is a good example of this. In the quarter, we launched significant enhancements, simplifying the user experience with personal navigation. We are also working within and across business units to encourage cross-functional collaboration, which should result in a unique differentiation in our solutions and frictionless experiences for our customers. 
Consistent with our strategy of moving our portfolio of solutions forward and creating opportunities to best serve our customers, we are pleased to have closed the acquisition of Automic last week. We had been in conversations with Automic's management team for well over a year. It is an asset that we had targeted for strategic, operational and financial motivations. So we are excited to welcome Automic employees and customers to CA. Strategically, Automic expands our Workload Automation and DevOps portfolio with its cloud-enabled platform and gives us an end-to-end automation solution. Operationally, it elevates our presence outside North America and strengthens our footprint in the Germanic region, where we were underpenetrated. 
Financially, the acquisition meets our rigorous hurdle rates and was a great opportunity for us to utilize offshore cash. As I look towards the end of our fiscal year and into fiscal 2018, I am pleased with the progress we are continuing to make. Increasingly, we are a company that is Agile and Built to Change, and we continue to pivot to make thoughtful and strategic adjustments to optimize our position. While we are proud of our progress, we are by no means satisfied. We know that we must continue to evolve in order to achieve our potential and consistently deliver long-term sustainable growth. With 1 quarter left to go in the year, we believe we are on track to achieve our objectives in FY '17. 
To provide some insight into how we're thinking about FY '18, including Automic, we expect the level of growth to be in line with what we're experiencing in FY '17. This assumes that Services continues to be a headwind to revenue and that Mainframe performance is consistent with our expectation of low single-digits revenue decline year-over-year. Taking a longer term, holistic view of the business, including both organic and inorganic contributions, we believe that we can deliver low single-digit growth in the medium term. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you"

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q3 total revenue was $1,007,000,000 and was down 3% and 2% in constant currency. Our constant currency revenue performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations due to higher level of upfront revenue recognized in the year-ago period and the decline in Services, as Mike has mentioned. 
The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue by 1.5 points compared to September 30 rates, the last day of the preceding quarter. For year-over-year comparison purposes, the strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue by half a point. 
Q3 Enterprise Solutions revenue declined 2%, Mainframe Solutions declined 1%, and Services declined 12%, as reported and in constant currency. Q3 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-single digits as reported and in constant currency. Q3 renewals were up in the mid-single digits, both as reported and in constant currency. As we previously stated, the year-over-year changes in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. We continue to expect the renewal portfolio in fiscal 2017 to increase in the high teens year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were down in North America due primarily to uneven performance in Named and Growth or partner-led accounts. New sales in Latin America declined due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the region. New sales were flat as reported and increased in constant currency in EMEA. New sales in APJ were down, reflecting the timing of the renewal portfolio in the region. Revenue increased in APJ as reported and in constant currency. In Latin America, revenue increased as reported but was down in constant currency. In EMEA, revenue decreased as reported but was up in constant currency. Revenue declined in North America as reported and in constant currency. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were flat as reported, an increase in the low single digits year-over-year in constant currency. Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter reflects the combinations of competitive wins and customer consolidation onto the CA platform, continued traction with newer, organic products, like Data Content Discovery or DCD; and our ongoing successful partnerships with system integrators or SIs. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased in the high single digits year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Areas such as API Management and Continuous Delivery saw positive new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we've discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing, but contribute to margin and cash flow. 
Services revenue decreased 12% as reported and in constant currency. We expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. We continue to expect this headwind in Services to have a dampening effect on our overall revenue growth in the near term. 
Total revenue backlog was up 3% and up 4% in constant currency. Current revenue backlog declined 1% as reported and was flat in constant currency. As we've said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90 renewal yield. 
Q3 GAAP operating margin was 31% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. GAAP operating margin increased 3 points compared to the year-ago period and is consistent with our medium-term target. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions and negative 4% for Services. Q3 Services margins reflect actions taken during the quarter to rightsize the segment, given our expectation that Services revenue will continue to be a headwind. Our Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 29%. 
Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50, down 4% year-over-year and down 8% in constant currency. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, flat year-over-year and down 2% in constant currency. 
Our Q3 CFFO was $517 million, up $185 million year-over-year. CFFO increased relative to the year-ago period primarily due to the timing of single installment collections. Single installment cash payments were $231 million and up $106 million year-over-year. As we discussed last quarter, we have entered into an agreement-in-principle to settle a long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government. We have accrued for this liability and expect to pay the $45 million in cash during the fiscal fourth quarter.
We ended Q3 with approximately $739 million in net cash. During the third quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. We did not repurchase shares in Q3 due to the timing uncertainty related to our payment of the GSA settlement combined with the rate and pace at which we had executed our share repurchases in the first half of the fiscal year. Generally, we expect to offset dilution with our share repurchases. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2016. The guidance also includes the impact of our acquisition of Automic. As described at the announcement of the acquisition, given the timing of the close, which occurred on January 18, we expect Automic to contribute half a point in revenue as reported and in constant currency. The acquisition is expected to adversely affect GAAP and non-GAAP total company operating margin by 1 percentage point and be dilutive to CFFO as well as GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, both as reported and in constant currency. The impact of the Automic acquisition, combined with the higher level of expenses typically incurred in our fourth fiscal quarter are expected to meaningfully depress ES margins in our fiscal Q4. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to be flat as reported and flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.01 billion to $4.03 billion. We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 1% to 4% as reported and flat to up 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.85. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of flat to up 2% as reported and down 2% to flat in constant currency. This translates to a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.47. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 413 million shares outstanding at a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of a 5% decrease to a 1% decrease as reported, and a 3% decrease to a 1% increase in constant currency. This translates to $990 million to $1.03 billion and includes the anticipated settlement of legal matters related to the agreement-in-principle for the GSA litigation previously discussed. 
As we look ahead to fiscal year '18, we'd like to provide some preliminary headlights into our current view. Including Automic, we expect fiscal '18 growth to be similar to the level of growth we are experiencing in fiscal year '17. We expect Services to continue to be a headwind to revenue and consistent with our longer-term view, we expect Mainframe revenue will decline in the low single digits year-over-year. 
Now with that, we'll open it up for questions."

And then for the Mainframe perspective, Mainframe is actually operated, I'd say, in the high end of our guidance all year long. I think just consistent with how we view the market over the long-term declining in the low single-digits, that's going to contribute the impact of this as well next year.

So when I take a look at our staff and the way that we've trained them and the way that we position them on a global basis, I think we can do a little bit more to match the accounts to the buying patterns that we're seeing in the market. And it took us several quarters to really understand this motion. It's not as fluid and predictable as you would expect. And it wasn't until we look at that data over 4 or 5 quarters that we saw that. The other thing is we are probably maxed a little bit because we had pretty good traction in the SPG space over the last 5 quarters. Like this is the first quarter in 5 that we haven't grown revenue in the [indiscernible] So a combination of maybe a little too optimistic about our progress and then not fully understanding the buying patterns of these distinct customer patterns."

But the ones that are kind of progressing along, we're very happy with. One in particular called 32 I/O. The initial idea of what we were going to use it for didn't work out, but the underlying technology ended up being our whole analytics platform, which we code-named Jarvis, and that's been used in a couple of our products as we went out to market in Ayman's group, our Chief Product Officer. We have another one that we've been working on called Oozoo, which is one that really takes a look at matching skills. We have another one that's doing some very interesting work in machine learning, really understanding how an application functions in the context of the environment it's in. So there's quite a few things going on in there that I'm very pleased with. It's a high-performing team that really takes advantage of Agile and they are truly disciples of lean and really work hard to make sure that they pivot very quickly and go through our process in very quick form. And also  with -- since you're asking about innovation, I think the products groups, which is run by Ayman, has been a phenomenal job. They've put 12 [ph] relatively media releases out this quarter and I can think of several in particular, like Identity Services, which is a great application so that you can come to CA that is #1 in Identity and Access Management especially for high-volume on-prem, but now you can go use the same system and do all the cloud-oriented authentications. There's no company that has the ability to bridge between all of these on-premise systems and robust cloud set of Services. Agile Central did a big release this year, this quarter, where they really trend up the user interface and made the whole Agile methodology much, much more approachable. And I think that's going to drive a lot more usability. But if you think of how a modern software company runs with land-and-expand, making it easier to use just gives you an opportunity, pass the land and start expanding. One on the Mainframe that I think was extraordinarily impressive was intelligent Mainframe management and automation. This is once again only at CA product. We are one of the few companies that are really investing in the Mainframe and this is using machine intelligence to really understand what's happening in the Mainframe environment, whether that be the network, the disk structure, the CPU power. And it's also built -- you don't have to be a Mainframe expert to use it, which is driving this whole notion of ease of use. So I'm very bullish on what's happening at our products organization, code quality is high, customer satisfaction is up and innovation engine is clearly humming here at CA."

And it's not so much that new bookings are down year-over-year because I remember last year, you had a great quarter for new bookings. But it looks like it's really the new bookings don't seem to be able to offset attrition. And when I look at this, forget about the professional Services for a minute, but when I look at subscription, that subscription line is negative in every quarter for, I think, 5 years now. And I know some of that may have shifted to software fees and I know there's some currency effects in there, too. But I look at that and I think about all the things that you've done and your team have done, the sales operations side, which I think is very positive and on the product side and there was a question Matt asked, and I think that's really cool and positive. But maybe given what CA is and half of what CA is, is Mainframe and this slowly melting iceberg, maybe try to grow doesn't really going to work and maybe there are other ways to return value to shareholders. And I'm just wondering if that's anything you're considering, especially given that next year's guidance now implies that organic constant currency growth is going to be negative again."

And part of our relationship with them is the fact that we continue to invest in these products. Mind you, we're very careful with respect to our R&D spend and very limited marketing spend. The next bucket are scale products. These are the ones you see us doing a lot of advertising on, a lot of marketing on. They still get our healthy R&D budget. These are products that we are actively selling across the board. We're selling them into our Platinum accounts, we're selling these into our Names businesses and we're selling them into our growth business. And then we have the third bucket, which is high growth products. Not yet mature, very high R&D cost, scaling marketing cost. And the mix of all 3 of those buckets, we have various products that will back and forth. Once a product gets to a certain level of scale, where it's primarily capacity sales, it will move into enhanced. A product that is new and is starting to ramp up and scale, we put into the scale bucket and the spend and the management of that looks a little different than you would manage a team that is going for a net new products with net new innovation and really working on getting customers at the Agile scrum teams rather than working heavily on deploying.

And a Platinum customer does behave different than a net new customer that we've never done business with before. I think we get those 2 extremes. When it comes into the middle, I think we need to take a harder look of some of the customer segmentation because I think there's a lot of very large customers that actually look a lot more like a Platinum customer. They expect a dedicated sales rep. They expect a different type of service. They are going to competitive bid pretty much all of the work that's out there. And the Platinum team is very good at these long multicountry bids that they've been doing for a number of years. On the flip side of it, there's a whole segment of customers that are looking for point solutions. And 4 years ago or 3 years ago, we didn't really have point solutions. We had very complex on-prem solutions that require high services and a lot of configuration, if not customization. We don't have of those product in the portfolio anymore. We're really pivoted to SaaS, cloud, on-demand, easy to use, easy to install. There's a whole segment of customers that are looking for try and buy and much more digital footprint. And I think we can take a harder look in that and give a little bit more work on customer segmentation and get the customers that look like Platinum to be sold to like a Platinum customer. And then take advantage of this growing group we've built and handling our partnership. Our partnerships did a very nice job multiple quarters in a row, and we're starting to scale that out on a global basis. So I think we can leverage that as well."

Secondly, when you're starting to sell to the Fortune 500 and some of the biggest government in the world, a small company needs a lot of R&D help. And our ability to help that team with our own resources that we understand what a large complex customer is expecting, that's all organic as well. So when you take a look at the kinds of things we buy, we don't buy things just because we want to get revenue. We buy things because we think we can really add value to their product road map and we can add a lot of structure with respect to distribution. So with a combination of those 2 things that you put them together, you're able to drive the kind of growth we're looking for."

We need to get that business in a steady-state up into the high teens. And we are investing a lot obviously in marketing. we're investing an awful lot in R&D. And over time, I think you can see that portfolio move up into the high teens. Now the other thing that's working a little bit against us but that's our job to go figure this out, is everything that we're building is SaaS and it's ratable. So we don't have the luxury of getting that big upfront revenue kick, which is usually a sweet near to our operating margins. On the other hand, we're getting very a bit much profitable revenue stream in our SaaS revenue.

I am pleased with the strong CFFO growth and healthy operating margin and EPS we delivered in Q3. On a constant currency basis, our revenue in the quarter came in as expected. Foreign currency headwinds negative",1454,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. 
I am pleased with the strong CFFO growth and healthy operating margin and EPS we delivered in Q3. On a constant currency basis, our revenue in the quarter came in as expected. Foreign currency headwinds negatively impacted reported revenue by an additional 1.5 points in Q3 relative to the September 30 rates. 
As discussed last quarter, we faced a difficult year-over-year compare due to the timing of upfront revenue realized in the year-ago period and the continued attrition of our Services revenue. This continued attrition of our Services revenue is due primarily to our ongoing efforts to develop products that are easier to install and easier to manage. The cadence and quality of our product releases continues to improve. While we are making progress across a number of our key strategic imperatives, we are continuing to work to improve the consistency of our performance across business units, customer groups and geographies. For example, our Mainframe business is performing very well, and our North American Platinum team delivered solid results in the quarter. However, performance in our Named and Growth or partner-led business was inconsistent. 
Total new sales and ES new sales declined in the quarter. This was due to a variety of factors, including very large deals in areas like Privileged Access Management, or PAM, and Service Management that closed in the year-ago period, which created a difficult compare. In addition, the pipeline for some of our products like Project and Portfolio Management, or PPM, is more heavily weighted towards Q4 than it was for Q3. Mainframe performed very well in the quarter, reflecting the combination of key competitive wins, healthy renewal performance and our successful partnerships with global service providers. This is the result of our ongoing organic innovation and commitment to customer success. 
This dedication to customer success extends beyond our software. There is no doubt that we live in a highly integrated world where various systems are interdependent. Our solutions are known to be mission critical, highly reliable and 0 downtime. 
Our Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which is an industry standard measure of loyalty, continues to rise on a positive trajectory. Our customer satisfaction score continues to increase, and our customers are rating our product quality higher. With this backdrop, we are pleased but not surprised by the performance of our Mainframe segment, both in Q3 and through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. Our 0 net new defect policy has resulted in considerably lower customer support issues and higher customer satisfaction. In the quarter, 12 new Mainframe releases went into GA, including new SKUs for CA Development Environment for z Systems, Mainframe Operations Intelligence and CA Release Automation Connector for z/OS. 
We have demonstrated a long-standing commitment to innovating on the Mainframe. Due to the value and quality of our systems, customers continue to rely on the Mainframe for mission-critical applications, which continues to drive MIPS growth. And there is an increasing number of customers choosing to standardize on our solutions. All of these factors are driving our success in this market. 
At CA World in November, we introduced the concept of Built to Change. Companies and organizations used to be Built to Last. Now they must adopt the mindset of Built to Change. New opportunities and new threats are emerging at an accelerated pace. This requires a more Agile approach, which provides a framework to pivot quickly and results in more robust, higher-quality solutions. The adoption of Agile across our development organization is enabling us to develop integrations across a number of our product families, improving the seamlessness of our broad portfolio. For example, at CA World, we released new integrations between our APIM and APM solutions with CA Precision API Monitoring. We introduced new Application Lifecycle Conductor, or ALC, integrations with CA Agile Central. And our latest release of CA Identity Service, our new Security SaaS offering, incorporates new integrations with CA's Single Sign On solution. Users can now access all of their cloud and on-premise applications from a single system. 
There is no question that our end-to-end vision is resonating with customers. Our solutions enable customers to plan, develop, test, manage and monitor with seamless security across all environments. Our APIM business, for example, delivered the largest quarter in its history in Q3, with strength across most geographies, products and routes to market. In the quarter, CA was positioned highest for Ability to Execute in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management. CA was also named a leader in the Forrester Wave: API Management Solutions, Q4 2016. 
In addition to the number of new releases announced at CA World, the APIM team also demonstrated CA API Gateway for Microservices. It also demonstrated industry vertical use cases, including a health care mobile app on top of our Healthcare Portal, and a Finance mobile app with Payment Services Directive and open banking. Customers like service NSW, or New South Wales, in Australia are using our API Management solutions to connect millions of citizens to hundreds of services running on different processes and platforms. Our solutions enable every company to be a software company. We are really excited about our position in the APIM space and the opportunities we see going forward. 
Similarly, our overall portfolio of Continuous Delivery solutions had the best new sales quarter in its history, driven by continued strength in Test Data Management. And all product lines in the business unit released new versions in the quarter. The innovation engine at CA is alive and well. 
Code.org, the organization driving to ensure every student has the opportunity to learn computer science, used CA BlazeMeter to synthetically test its site for over 25 million users at its global hour of Code campaign. The event offered tutorials on more than 30 languages and had the capability of reaching tens of millions of students in more than 180 countries. We are passionate about the need to encourage and expand computer science education to reach a broader population of students. We are very proud of our ability to help ensure the success of Code.org and its events. 
Across our portfolio, we are continuing to focus on developing products that are easier to install and easier to manage without compromising functionality for the sake of simplicity. Agile Central, which also experienced new sales growth in the quarter, is a good example of this. In the quarter, we launched significant enhancements, simplifying the user experience with personal navigation. We are also working within and across business units to encourage cross-functional collaboration, which should result in a unique differentiation in our solutions and frictionless experiences for our customers. 
Consistent with our strategy of moving our portfolio of solutions forward and creating opportunities to best serve our customers, we are pleased to have closed the acquisition of Automic last week. We had been in conversations with Automic's management team for well over a year. It is an asset that we had targeted for strategic, operational and financial motivations. So we are excited to welcome Automic employees and customers to CA. Strategically, Automic expands our Workload Automation and DevOps portfolio with its cloud-enabled platform and gives us an end-to-end automation solution. Operationally, it elevates our presence outside North America and strengthens our footprint in the Germanic region, where we were underpenetrated. 
Financially, the acquisition meets our rigorous hurdle rates and was a great opportunity for us to utilize offshore cash. As I look towards the end of our fiscal year and into fiscal 2018, I am pleased with the progress we are continuing to make. Increasingly, we are a company that is Agile and Built to Change, and we continue to pivot to make thoughtful and strategic adjustments to optimize our position. While we are proud of our progress, we are by no means satisfied. We know that we must continue to evolve in order to achieve our potential and consistently deliver long-term sustainable growth. With 1 quarter left to go in the year, we believe we are on track to achieve our objectives in FY '17. 
To provide some insight into how we're thinking about FY '18, including Automic, we expect the level of growth to be in line with what we're experiencing in FY '17. This assumes that Services continues to be a headwind to revenue and that Mainframe performance is consistent with our expectation of low single-digits revenue decline year-over-year. Taking a longer term, holistic view of the business, including both organic and inorganic contributions, we believe that we can deliver low single-digit growth in the medium term. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you"

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q3 total revenue was $1,007,000,000 and was down 3% and 2% in constant currency. Our constant currency revenue performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations due to higher level of upfront revenue recognized in the year-ago period and the decline in Services, as Mike has mentioned. 
The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue by 1.5 points compared to September 30 rates, the last day of the preceding quarter. For year-over-year comparison purposes, the strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue by 0.5 point. 
Q3 Enterprise Solutions revenue declined 2%, Mainframe Solutions declined 1%, and Services declined 12%, as reported and in constant currency. Q3 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-single digits as reported and in constant currency. Q3 renewals were up in the mid-single digits, both as reported and in constant currency. As we previously stated, the year-over-year changes in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. We continue to expect the renewal portfolio in fiscal 2017 to increase in the high teens year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were down in North America due primarily to uneven performance in Named and Growth or partner-led accounts. New sales in Latin America declined due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the region. New sales were flat as reported and increased in constant currency in EMEA. New sales in APJ were down, reflecting the timing of the renewal portfolio in the region. Revenue increased in APJ as reported and in constant currency. In Latin America, revenue increased as reported but was down in constant currency. In EMEA, revenue decreased as reported but was up in constant currency. Revenue declined in North America as reported and in constant currency. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were flat as reported, an increase in the low single digits year-over-year in constant currency. Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter reflects the combinations of competitive wins and customer consolidation onto the CA platform, continued traction with newer, organic products, like Data Content Discovery or DCD; and our ongoing successful partnerships with system integrators or SIs. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased in the high single digits year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Areas such as API Management and Continuous Delivery saw positive new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we've discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing, but contribute to margin and cash flow. 
Services revenue decreased 12% as reported and in constant currency. We expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. We continue to expect this headwind in Services to have a dampening effect on our overall revenue growth in the near term. 
Total revenue backlog was up 3% and up 4% in constant currency. Current revenue backlog declined 1% as reported and was flat in constant currency. As we've said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90 renewal yield. 
Q3 GAAP operating margin was 31% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. GAAP operating margin increased 3 points compared to the year-ago period and is consistent with our medium-term target. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions and negative 4% for Services. Q3 Services margins reflect actions taken during the quarter to rightsize the segment, given our expectation that Services revenue will continue to be a headwind. Our Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 29%. 
Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50, down 4% year-over-year and down 8% in constant currency. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, flat year-over-year and down 2% in constant currency. 
Our Q3 CFFO was $517 million, up $185 million year-over-year. CFFO increased relative to the year-ago period primarily due to the timing of single installment collections. Single installment cash payments were $231 million and up $106 million year-over-year. As we discussed last quarter, we have entered into an agreement-in-principle to settle a long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government. We have accrued for this liability and expect to pay the $45 million in cash during the fiscal fourth quarter.
We ended Q3 with approximately $739 million in net cash. During the third quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. We did not repurchase shares in Q3 due to the timing uncertainty related to our payment of the GSA settlement combined with the rate and pace at which we had executed our share repurchases in the first half of the fiscal year. Generally, we expect to offset dilution with our share repurchases. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2016. The guidance also includes the impact of our acquisition of Automic. As described at the announcement of the acquisition, given the timing of the close, which occurred on January 18, we expect Automic to contribute 0.5 point in revenue as reported and in constant currency. The acquisition is expected to adversely affect GAAP and non-GAAP total company operating margin by 1 percentage point and be dilutive to CFFO as well as GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, both as reported and in constant currency. The impact of the Automic acquisition, combined with the higher level of expenses typically incurred in our fourth fiscal quarter are expected to meaningfully depress ES margins in our fiscal Q4. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to be flat as reported and flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.01 billion to $4.03 billion. We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 1% to 4% as reported and flat to up 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.85. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of flat to up 2% as reported and down 2% to flat in constant currency. This translates to a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.47. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 413 million shares outstanding at a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of a 5% decrease to a 1% decrease as reported, and a 3% decrease to a 1% increase in constant currency. This translates to $990 million to $1.03 billion and includes the anticipated settlement of legal matters related to the agreement-in-principle for the GSA litigation previously discussed. 
As we look ahead to fiscal year '18, we'd like to provide some preliminary headlights into our current view. Including Automic, we expect fiscal '18 growth to be similar to the level of growth we are experiencing in fiscal year '17. We expect Services to continue to be a headwind to revenue and consistent with our longer-term view, we expect Mainframe revenue will decline in the low single digits year-over-year. 
Now with that, we'll open it up for questions."

And for the Mainframe perspective, Mainframe is actually operated, I'd say, in the high end of our guidance all year long. I think just consistent with how we view the market over the long term declining in the low single digits. That's going to contribute impact to it as well next year. And then I think just from a clarification perspective, we also think that if FX remains consistent with where we ended in 12/31/16, we think that probably represents about another full point of headwind to us next year as well."

Especially this quarter, I was really disappointed in what happened primarily in Named and North America. I think that when we look across the board on a global basis, what we're seeing is the high end of the Named look a lot more like our Platinum customers, and that's a little bit of a different selling motion. And the lower end of Named, we put a lot of that into Growth is much more like a reseller. So when I take a look at our staff and the way that we've trained them and the way that we position them on a global basis, I think we can do a little bit more to match the accounts to the buying patterns that we're seeing in the market. And it took us several quarters to really understand this motion. It's not as fluid and predictable as you would expect. And it wasn't 'til we look at that data over 4 or 5 quarters that we saw that. The other thing is we are probably masked a little bit because we had pretty good traction in the eSTG space over the last 5 quarters. Like this is the first quarter in 5 that we haven't grown revenue in eSTG. So a combination of maybe a little too optimistic about our progress and then not fully understanding the buying patterns of these distinct customer patterns."

Some of them -- we want to try to hold that a little tight because that's -- because we're still playing around with them, we think it's a competitive advantage. But the ones that are kind of progressing along, we're very happy with. One in particular called 42 I/O. The initial idea of what we were going to use it for didn't work out, but the underlying technology ended up being our whole analytics platform, which we code-named Jarvis, and that's been used in a couple of the products in our -- as we went out to market in Ayman's group, our Chief Product Officer. We have another one that we've been working on called Huzu, which is one that really takes a look at matching skills. We have another one that's doing some very interesting work in machine learning, really understanding how an application functions in the context of the environment it's in. So there's quite a few things going on in there that I'm very pleased with. It's a high-performing team that really takes advantage of Agile and they are truly disciples of lean and really work hard to make sure that they pivot very quickly and go through our process in very quick form. 
And also with -- since you're asking about innovation, I think the products groups, which is run by Ayman, has done a phenomenal job. They put 12 relatively media releases out this quarter, and I can think of several in particular, like Identity Services, which is a great application so that you can come to CA that is #1 in Identity and Access Management, especially for high volume, on-prem, but now you can go use the same system and do all the cloud-oriented authentications. There's no company that has that ability to bridge between all of these on-premise systems and a robust cloud set of Services. Agile Central did a big release this year -- this quarter, where they really trend up the user interface and made the whole Agile methodology much, much more approachable. And I think that's going to drive a lot more usability. And if you think of how a modern software company runs with land and expand, making it easier to use just gives you an opportunity, pass the land to start expanding. One on the Mainframe that, I think, was extraordinarily impressive was Intelligent Mainframe Management and Automation. This is once again an only-at-CA product. We are one of the few companies that are really investing in the Mainframe and this is using machine intelligence to really understand what's happening in the Mainframe environment, whether that be the network, the disk structure, the CPU power. And it's also built -- you don't have to be a Mainframe expert to use it, which is driving this whole notion of ease of use. So I'm very bullish on what's happening at our products organization, code quality is high, customer satisfaction is up and innovation engine is clearly humming here at CA."

And it's not so much that new bookings are down year-over-year because I remember last year, you had a great quarter for new bookings. But it looks like it's really the new bookings don't seem to be able to offset attrition. And when I look at this, forget about the professional services for a minute, but when I look at subscription, that subscription line has been negative in every quarter for, I think, 5 years now. And I know some of it may have shifted to software fees and others, and I know there's some currency effects in there, too. But I look at that and I think about all the things that you've done and your team has done, I mean the sales operations side, which I think are very positive and on the product side and there was a question Matt asked, and I think that's really cool and positive. But maybe given what CA is and half of what CA is and Mainframe and this slowly melting iceberg, maybe trying to grow it isn't really going to work and maybe there are other ways to return value to shareholders.

But even next year's guidance, I mean, if you take out -- and I think making these acquisitions makes sense, but just trying to measure you the way we measure every company on an organic constant currency basis. You aren't going to grow. If you do what you've guided to, if you take out Automic. So I just -- and I believe you added a lot of value in -- CA is a much better company today than it was 5 years ago. But I just wonder if it's just -- I mean, you are trying to make this thing grow and there's some expenditures that go into that and maybe -- maybe, I don't know. People ask me all the time, will they increase the dividend, if this doesn't work? Things like that. And I'm just wondering if now is the time to start to think about it, but it sounds like that's not what you're thinking."

I know this will probably play out over several quarters and things like that, but it's really more about rightsizing it. Over the long term, I think, we feel pretty comfortable that we can drive a business here in the low to mid-single digits.

We have a group of products, which we call Enhance, and those products, we don't sell a lot of net new. We saw a little bit of capacity, but they're very profitable products and our customers use them all day every day. And part of our relationship with them is the fact that we continue to invest in these products. Mind you, we're very careful with respect to our R&D spend and very limited marketing spend. The next bucket are scale products. These are the ones you see us doing a lot of advertising on, a lot of marketing on. They still get our healthy R&D budget. These are products that we are actively selling across the board. We're selling them into our Platinum accounts, we're selling these into our Named businesses and we're selling them into our Growth business. And then we have the third bucket, which is high-growth products. Not yet mature, very high R&D cost, scaling marketing cost. And the mix of all 3 of those buckets, we have various products that move back and forth. Once a product gets to a certain level of scale, where it's primarily capacity sale, it will move into Enhance. A product that is new and is starting to ramp up and scale, we put into the scale bucket and the spend and the management of that looks a little bit different than you would manage a team that is going for a net new products with net new innovation and really working on getting customers at the Agile scrum teams rather than working heavily on deploying.

We've been paying close attention to this for several quarters and you're always trying to optimize your sales force and we do pay pretty close attention to customer satisfaction as well as cost of sales. And a Platinum customer does behave different than a net new customer that we've never done business with before. I think we get those 2 extremes. When it comes into the middle, I think we need to take a harder look at some of the customer segmentation because I think there's a lot of very large customers that actually look a lot more like a Platinum customer. They expect a dedicated sales rep. They expect a different type of service. They are going to competitive bid pretty much all of the work that's out there. And the Platinum team is very good at these long multi-country bids that they've been doing for a number of years. On the flip side of it, there's a whole segment of customers that are looking for Point Solutions. And 4 years ago or 3 years ago, we didn't really have Point Solutions. We had very complex on-prem solutions that require high services and a lot of configuration, if not customization. We don't have a lot of those products in the portfolio anymore. We're really pivoted to SaaS, cloud, on-demand, easy to use, easy to install. There's a whole segment of customers that are looking for try and buy in a much more digital footprint. And I think we can take a harder look in that and give a little bit more work on customer segmentation and get the customers that look like Platinum to be sold to like a Platinum customer. And then take advantage of this growing group we've built in handling our partnership. Our partnerships did a very nice job multiple quarters in a row, and we're starting to scale that out on a global basis. So I think we can leverage that as well."

We've got a very solid balance sheet and being able to use that balance sheet is a competitive weapon for us. Secondly, I do think that there's a little bit of a misunderstanding with respect to organic and inorganic. For example, if you take a look at our purchase of Xceedium, that was a very, very small acquisition and it was a great starter set with respect to Security and Privileged Identity Management. But if you take a look at the rapid revenue growth, that's been done because of our enterprise sales capability, which didn't exist. And so that's not -- that is a complete organic capability that we've brought to a great product set. Secondly, when you're starting to sell to the Fortune 500 and some of the biggest government in the world, a small company needs a lot of R&D help. And our ability to help that team with our own resources that really understand what a large complex customer is expecting, that's all organic as well. So when we take a look at the kinds of things we buy, we don't buy things just because we want to get revenue. We buy things because we think we can really add value to their product road map and we can add a lot of structure with respect to distribution. So it's a combination of those 2 things that you put them together, you're able to drive the kind of growth we're looking for."

It will initially start augmenting our ability to transact here in the U.S. There's also a lot of work we can do with respect to our own products and driving some synergies on a global basis that we want to make sure we capture and that will happen over the course of the next 6 months. We put a very experienced integration lead. He used to run all of Asia for us and prior to that, he's had -- he's been international in LatAm.

I think that's the right mix at that particular space and if you drive those margins up any higher, I think, you isolate yourself from customers. When you take a look at the ES business, we did 14% operating margin this last quarter. It's been hovering in and around the teens. We need to get that business in a steady state up into the high teens. And we are investing a lot obviously in marketing. We're investing an awful lot in R&D. And over time, I think you're going to see that portfolio move up into the high teens. Now the other thing that's working a little bit against us but that's our job to go figure this out, is everything that we're building is SaaS and it's ratable. So we don't have the luxury of getting that big upfront revenue kick, which is usually a sweetener to our operating margins. On the other hand, we're getting very -- a bit much more predictable revenue stream in our SaaS revenue. So between the mix of that business model and our focus on getting those products to market and making sure that those products are sold, I think you'll see the leverage stay with respect to the ES side of the house."

I am pleased with the strong CFFO growth and healthy operating margin and EPS we delivered in Q3. On a constant currency basis, our revenue in the quarter came in as expected. Foreign currency headwinds negatively",1453,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I am pleased with the strong CFFO growth and healthy operating margin and EPS we delivered in Q3. On a constant currency basis, our revenue in the quarter came in as expected. Foreign currency headwinds negatively impacted reported revenue by an additional 1.5 points in Q3 relative to the September 30 rates. 
As discussed last quarter, we faced a difficult year-over-year compare due to the timing of upfront revenue realized in the year-ago period and the continued attrition of our Services revenue. This continued attrition of our Services revenue is due primarily to our ongoing efforts to develop products that are easier to install and easier to manage. The cadence and quality of our product releases continues to improve. While we are making progress across a number of our key strategic imperatives, we are continuing to work to improve the consistency of our performance across business units, customer groups and geographies. For example, our Mainframe business is performing very well, and our North American Platinum team delivered solid results in the quarter. However, performance in our Named and Growth or partner-led business was inconsistent. 
Total new sales and ES new sales declined in the quarter. This was due to a variety of factors, including very large deals in areas like Privileged Access Management, or PAM, and Service Management that closed in the year-ago period, which created a difficult compare. In addition, the pipeline for some of our products like Project and Portfolio Management, or PPM, is more heavily weighted towards Q4 than it was for Q3. Mainframe performed very well in the quarter, reflecting the combination of key competitive wins, healthy renewal performance and our successful partnerships with global service providers. This is the result of our ongoing organic innovation and commitment to customer success. This dedication to customer success extends beyond our software. There is no doubt that we live in a highly integrated world where various systems are interdependent. Our solutions are known to be mission critical, highly reliable and 0 downtime. 
Our Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which is an industry standard measure of loyalty, continues to rise on a positive trajectory. Our customer satisfaction score continues to increase, and our customers are rating our product quality higher. With this backdrop, we are pleased but not surprised by the performance of our Mainframe segment, both in Q3 and through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. Our 0 net new defect policy has resulted in considerably lower customer support issues and higher customer satisfaction. In the quarter, 12 new Mainframe releases went into GA, including new SKUs for CA Development Environment for z Systems, Mainframe Operations Intelligence and CA Release Automation Connector for z/OS. 
We have demonstrated a long-standing commitment to innovating on the Mainframe. Due to the value and quality of our systems, customers continue to rely on the Mainframe for mission-critical applications, which continues to drive MIPS growth. And there is an increasing number of customers choosing to standardize on our solutions. All of these factors are driving our success in this market. 
At CA World in November, we introduced the concept of Built to Change. Companies and organizations used to be Built to Last. Now they must adopt the mindset of Built to Change. New opportunities and new threats are emerging at an accelerated pace. This requires a more Agile approach, which provides a framework to pivot quickly and results in more robust, higher-quality solutions. The adoption of Agile across our development organization is enabling us to develop integrations across a number of our product families, improving the seamlessness of our broad portfolio. For example, at CA World, we released new integrations between our APIM and APM solutions with CA Precision API Monitoring. We introduced new Application Lifecycle Conductor, or ALC, integrations with CA Agile Central. And our latest release of CA Identity Service, our new Security SaaS offering, incorporates new integrations with CA's Single Sign On solution. Users can now access all of their cloud and on-premise applications from a single system. 
There is no question that our end-to-end vision is resonating with customers. Our solutions enable customers to plan, develop, test, manage and monitor with seamless security across all environments. Our APIM business, for example, delivered the largest quarter in its history in Q3, with strength across most geographies, products and routes to market. In the quarter, CA was positioned highest for Ability to Execute in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management. CA was also named a leader in the Forrester Wave: API Management Solutions, Q4 2016. 
In addition to the number of new releases announced at CA World, the APIM team also demonstrated CA API Gateway for Microservices. It also demonstrated industry vertical use cases, including a health care mobile app on top of our Healthcare Portal, and a Finance mobile app with Payment Services Directive and open banking. Customers like Service NSW, or New South Wales, in Australia are using our API Management solutions to connect millions of citizens to hundreds of services running on different processes and platforms. Our solutions enable every company to be a software company. We are really excited about our position in the APIM space and the opportunities we see going forward. 
Similarly, our overall portfolio of Continuous Delivery solutions had the best new sales quarter in its history, driven by continued strength in Test Data Management. And all product lines in the business unit released new versions in the quarter. The innovation engine at CA is alive and well. 
Code.org, the organization driving to ensure every student has the opportunity to learn computer science, used CA BlazeMeter to synthetically test its site for over 25 million users at its global hour of Code campaign. The event offered tutorials on more than 30 languages and had the capability of reaching tens of millions of students in more than 180 countries. We are passionate about the need to encourage and expand computer science education to reach a broader population of students. We are very proud of our ability to help ensure the success of Code.org and its events. 
Across our portfolio, we are continuing to focus on developing products that are easier to install and easier to manage without compromising functionality for the sake of simplicity. Agile Central, which also experienced new sales growth in the quarter, is a good example of this. In the quarter, we launched significant enhancements, simplifying the user experience with personal navigation. We are also working within and across business units to encourage cross-functional collaboration, which should result in a unique differentiation in our solutions and frictionless experiences for our customers. 
Consistent with our strategy of moving our portfolio of solutions forward and creating opportunities to best serve our customers, we are pleased to have closed the acquisition of Automic last week. We had been in conversations with Automic's management team for well over a year. It is an asset that we had targeted for strategic, operational and financial motivations. So we are excited to welcome Automic employees and customers to CA. Strategically, Automic expands our Workload Automation and DevOps portfolio with its cloud-enabled platform and gives us an end-to-end automation solution. Operationally, it elevates our presence outside North America and strengthens our footprint in the Germanic region, where we were underpenetrated. 
Financially, the acquisition meets our rigorous hurdle rates and was a great opportunity for us to utilize offshore cash. As I look towards the end of our fiscal year and into fiscal 2018, I am pleased with the progress we are continuing to make. Increasingly, we are a company that is Agile and Built to Change, and we continue to pivot to make thoughtful and strategic adjustments to optimize our position. While we are proud of our progress, we are by no means satisfied. We know that we must continue to evolve in order to achieve our potential and consistently deliver long-term sustainable growth. With 1 quarter left to go in the year, we believe we are on track to achieve our objectives in FY '17. 
To provide some insight into how we're thinking about FY '18, including Automic, we expect the level of growth to be in line with what we're experiencing in FY '17. This assumes that Services continues to be a headwind to revenue and that Mainframe performance is consistent with our expectation of low single-digits revenue decline year-over-year. Taking a longer-term, holistic view of the business, including both organic and inorganic contributions, we believe that we can deliver low single-digit growth in the medium term. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you"

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q3 total revenue was $1,007,000,000 and was down 3% and 2% in constant currency. Our constant currency revenue performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations due to higher level of upfront revenue recognized in the year-ago period and the decline in Services, as Mike has mentioned. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue by 1.5 points compared to September 30 rates, the last day of the preceding quarter. For year-over-year comparison purposes, the strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue by 0.5 point. 
Q3 Enterprise Solutions revenue declined 2%, Mainframe Solutions declined 1%, and Services declined 12%, as reported and in constant currency. Q3 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-single digits as reported and in constant currency. Q3 renewals were up in the mid-single digits, both as reported and in constant currency. As we previously stated, the year-over-year changes in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. We continue to expect the renewal portfolio in fiscal 2017 to increase in the high teens year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were down in North America due primarily to uneven performance in Named and Growth or partner-led accounts. New sales in Latin America declined due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the region. New sales were flat as reported and increased in constant currency in EMEA. New sales in APJ were down, reflecting the timing of the renewal portfolio in the region. Revenue increased in APJ as reported and in constant currency. In Latin America, revenue increased as reported but was down in constant currency. In EMEA, revenue decreased as reported but was up in constant currency. Revenue declined in North America as reported and in constant currency. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were flat as reported, and increased in the low single digits year-over-year in constant currency. Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter reflects the combinations of competitive wins and customer consolidation onto the CA platform, continued traction with newer, organic products, like Data Content Discovery or DCD; and our ongoing successful partnerships with system integrators or SIs. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased in the high single digits year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Areas such as API Management and Continuous Delivery saw positive new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we've discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing, but contribute to margin and cash flow. 
Services revenue decreased 12% as reported and in constant currency. We expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. We continue to expect this headwind in Services to have a dampening effect on our overall revenue growth in the near term. Total revenue backlog was up 3% and up 4% in constant currency. Current revenue backlog declined 1% as reported and was flat in constant currency. As we've said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90 renewal yield. 
Q3 GAAP operating margin was 31% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. GAAP operating margin increased 3 points compared to the year-ago period and is consistent with our medium-term target. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions and negative 4% for Services. Q3 Services margins reflect actions taken during the quarter to rightsize the segment, given our expectation that Services revenue will continue to be a headwind. Our Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 29%. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50, down 4% year-over-year and down 8% in constant currency. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, flat year-over-year and down 2% in constant currency. 
Our Q3 CFFO was $517 million, up $185 million year-over-year. CFFO increased relative to the year-ago period primarily due to the timing of single installment collections. Single installment cash payments were $231 million and up $106 million year-over-year. As we discussed last quarter, we have entered into an agreement-in-principle to settle a long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government. We have accrued for this liability and expect to pay the $45 million in cash during the fiscal fourth quarter.
We ended Q3 with approximately $739 million in net cash. During the third quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. We did not repurchase shares in Q3 due to the timing uncertainty related to our payment of the GSA settlement combined with the rate and pace at which we had executed our share repurchases in the first half of the fiscal year. Generally, we expect to offset dilution with our share repurchases. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2016. The guidance also includes the impact of our acquisition of Automic. As described at the announcement of the acquisition, given the timing of the close, which occurred on January 18, we expect Automic to contribute 0.5 point in revenue as reported and in constant currency. The acquisition is expected to adversely affect GAAP and non-GAAP total company operating margin by 1 percentage point and be dilutive to CFFO as well as GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, both as reported and in constant currency. The impact of the Automic acquisition, combined with the higher level of expenses typically incurred in our fourth fiscal quarter are expected to meaningfully depress ES margins in our fiscal Q4. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to be flat as reported and flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.01 billion to $4.03 billion. We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 1% to 4% as reported and flat to up 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.85. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of flat to up 2% as reported and down 2% to flat in constant currency. This translates to a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.47. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 413 million shares outstanding at a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of a 5% decrease to a 1% decrease as reported, and a 3% decrease to a 1% increase in constant currency. This translates to $990 million to $1.03 billion and includes the anticipated settlement of legal matters related to the agreement-in-principle for the GSA litigation previously discussed. 
As we look ahead to fiscal year '18, we'd like to provide some preliminary headlights into our current view. Including Automic, we expect fiscal '18 growth to be similar to the level of growth we are experiencing in fiscal year '17. We expect Services to continue to be a headwind to revenue and consistent with our longer-term view, we expect Mainframe revenue will decline in the low single digits year-over-year. 
Now with that, we'll open it up for questions."

And for the Mainframe perspective, Mainframe is actually operated, I'd say, in the high end of our guidance all year long. I think just consistent with how we view the market over the long term declining in the low single digits. That's going to contribute impact to it as well next year. And then I think just from a clarification perspective, we also think that if FX remains consistent with where we ended in 12/31/16, we think that probably represents about another full point of headwind to us next year as well."

Yes, especially this quarter, I was really disappointed in what happened primarily in Named and North America. I think that when we look across the board on a global basis, what we're seeing is the high end of the Named look a lot more like our Platinum customers, and that's a little bit of a different selling motion. And the lower end of Named, we put a lot of that into Growth is much more like a reseller. So when I take a look at our staff and the way that we've trained them and the way that we position them on a global basis, I think we can do a little bit more to match the accounts to the buying patterns that we're seeing in the market. And it took us several quarters to really understand this motion. It's not as fluid and predictable as you would expect. And it wasn't till we look at that data over 4 or 5 quarters that we saw that. The other thing is we are probably masked a little bit because we had pretty good traction in the eSTG space over the last 5 quarters. Like this is the first quarter in 5 that we haven't grown revenue in eSTG. So a combination of maybe a little too optimistic about our progress and then not fully understanding the buying [ph] patterns of these distinct customer patterns."

Some of them I'm -- we want to try to hold that a little tight because that's -- because we're still playing around with them, we think it's a competitive advantage. But the ones that are kind of progressing along, we're very happy with. One in particular called 42 I/O. The initial idea of what we were going to use it for didn't work out, but the underlying technology ended up being our whole analytics platform, which we code-named Jarvis, and that's been used in a couple of the products in our -- as we went out to market in Ayman's group, our Chief Product Officer. We have another one that we've been working on called Huzu, which is one that really takes a look at matching skills. We have another one that's doing some very interesting work in machine learning, really understanding how an application functions in the context of the environment it's in. So there's quite a few things going on in there that I'm very pleased with. It's a high-performing team that really takes advantage of Agile and they are truly disciples of Lean and really work hard to make sure that they pivot very quickly and go through our process in very quick form.  And also with -- since you're asking about innovation, I think the products groups, which is run by Ayman, has done a phenomenal job. They put 12 relatively media releases out this quarter, and I can think of several in particular, like Identity Services, which is a great application so that you can come to CA that is #1 in Identity and Access Management, especially for high volume, on-prem, but now you can go use the same system and do all the cloud-oriented authentications. There's no company that has that ability to bridge between all of these on-premise systems and a robust cloud set of Services. Agile Central did a big release this year -- this quarter, where they really trimmed up the user interface and made the whole Agile methodology much, much more approachable. And I think that's going to drive a lot more usability. And if you think of how a modern software company runs with land and expand, making it easier to use just gives you an opportunity, pass the land to start expanding. One on the Mainframe that, I think, was extraordinarily impressive was Intelligent Mainframe Management and Automation. This is once again an only-at-CA product. We are one of the few companies that are really investing in the Mainframe and this is using machine intelligence to really understand what's happening in a Mainframe environment, whether that be the network, the disk structure, the CPU power. And it's also built -- you don't have to be a Mainframe expert to use it, which is driving this whole notion of ease of use. So I'm very bullish on what's happening at our products organization, code quality is high, customer satisfaction is up and the innovation engine is clearly humming here at CA."

And as we said in the opening comments, we've been talking to Automic for a year. So we don't know when we're going to be able to transact. We're extraordinarily disciplined. We do a great deal of due diligence. And at any given time, we're looking at multiple opportunities with respect to acquisitions. We just really can't control the closing times of it -- of those acquisitions. So we still like those tuck-in type applications in the $40 million to $60 million range.

I know this will probably play out over several quarters and things like that, but it's really more about rightsizing it. Over the long term, I think we feel pretty comfortable that we can drive a business here in the low to mid-single digits. We want to ensure that the services that we put in place are there for deployment and to help our customers make the best use of our software. We're not trying to gouge anyone.

We have a group of products, which we call Enhance, and those products, we don't sell a lot of net new. We saw a little bit of capacity, but they're very profitable products and our customers use them all day every day. And part of our relationship with them is the fact that we continue to invest in these products. Mind you, we're very careful with respect to our R&D spend and very limited marketing spend. The next bucket are scale products. These are the ones you see us doing a lot of advertising on, a lot of marketing on. They still get the healthy R&D budget. These are products that we are actively selling across the board. We're selling them into our Platinum accounts, we're selling these into our Named businesses and we're selling them into our Growth business. And then we have the third bucket, which is high-growth products. Not yet mature, very high R&D cost, scaling marketing cost. And the mix of all 3 of those buckets, we have various products that move back and forth. Once a product gets to a certain level of scale, where it's primarily capacity sale, it'll move into Enhance. A product that is new and is starting to ramp up and scale, we put into the scale bucket and the spend and the management of that looks a little bit different than you would manage a team that is going for a net new products with net new innovation and really working on getting customers at the Agile scrum teams rather than working heavily on deploying.

We've been paying close attention to this for several quarters and you're always trying to optimize your sales force and we do pay pretty close attention to customer satisfaction as well as cost of sales. And a Platinum customer does behave different than a net new customer that we've never done business with before. I think we get those 2 extremes. When it comes into the middle, I think we need to take a harder look at some of the customer segmentation because I think there's a lot of very large customers that actually look a lot more like a Platinum customer. They expect a dedicated sales rep. They expect a different type of service. They are going to competitive bid pretty much all of the work that's out there. And the Platinum team is very good at these long multi-country bids that they've been doing for a number of years. On the flip side of it, there's a whole segment of customers that are looking for Point Solutions. And 4 years ago or 3 years ago, we didn't really have Point Solutions. We had very complex on-prem solutions that require high services and a lot of configuration, if not customization. We don't have a lot of those products in the portfolio anymore. We're really pivoted to SaaS, cloud, on-demand, easy to use, easy to install. There's a whole segment of customers that are looking for try and buy in a much more digital footprint. And I think we can take a harder look in that and give a little bit more work on customer segmentation and get the customers that look like Platinum to be sold to like a Platinum customer. And then take advantage of this growing group we've built in handling our partnership. Our partnerships did a very nice job multiple quarters in a row, and we're starting to scale that out on a global basis. So I think we can leverage that as well."

We've got a very solid balance sheet and being able to use that balance sheet is a competitive weapon for us. Secondly, I do think that there is a little bit of a misunderstanding with respect to organic and inorganic. For example, if you take a look at our purchase of Xceedium, that was a very, very small acquisition and it was a great starter set with respect to Security and Privileged Identity Management. But if you take a look at the rapid revenue growth, that's been done because of our enterprise sales capability, which didn't exist. So that's not -- that is a complete organic capability that we've brought to a great product set. Secondly, when you're starting to sell to the Fortune 500 and some of the biggest governments in the world, a small company needs a lot of R&D help. And our ability to help that team with our own resources that really understand what a large complex customer is expecting, that's all organic as well. So when we take a look at the kinds of things we buy, we don't buy things just because we want to get revenue. We buy things because we think we can really add value to their product road map and we can add a lot of structure with respect to distribution.

When you think about what I said actually with what our guidance when we announced it, we believe that it'll be accretive in fiscal '19. So we get there fairly quickly. It's a good entity, but you have to get through all of these purchase accounting issues and then the integration costs."

And we'll initially start augmenting our ability to transact here in the U.S. There's also a lot of work we can do with respect to our own products and driving some synergies on a global basis that we want to make sure we capture and that'll happen over the course of the next 6 months. We put a very experienced integration lead. He used to run all of Asia for us and prior to that, he's had -- he's been international in LatAm. Been with the company for an awful long time, and I think that, that level of experience and that experience in operating in international theaters will help us not make mistakes.

It seems that you guys have a big enough base of product and especially about Automic coming out to sort of let those run by themselves and see how it plays out. I guess, what am I missing there?

So let's start with that because I think that's where the focus needs to be. I don't think you're going to drive Mainframe operating margins up any higher. I think that that's the right mix at that particular space and if you drive those margins up any higher, I think you isolate yourself from customers. When you take a look at the ES business, we did 14% operating margin this last quarter. It's been hovering in and around the teens. We need to get that business in a steady state up into the high teens. And we are investing a lot, obviously, in marketing. We're investing an awful lot in R&D. And over time, I think you're going to see that portfolio move up into the high teens. Now the other thing that's working a little bit against us but that's our job to go figure this out, is everything that we're building is SaaS and it's ratable. So we don't have the luxury of getting that big upfront revenue kick, which is usually a sweetener to operating margins. On the other hand, we're getting very -- a much more predictable revenue stream in our SaaS revenue. So between the mix of that business model and our focus on getting those products to market and making sure that those products are sold, I think you'll see the leverage stay with respect to the ES side of the house."

I am pleased with the strong CFFO growth and healthy operating margin and EPS we delivered in Q3. On a constant currency basis, our revenue in the quarter came in as expected. Foreign currency headwinds negatively",1453,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I am pleased with the strong CFFO growth and healthy operating margin and EPS we delivered in Q3. On a constant currency basis, our revenue in the quarter came in as expected. Foreign currency headwinds negatively impacted reported revenue by an additional 1.5 points in Q3 relative to the September 30 rates. 
As discussed last quarter, we faced a difficult year-over-year compare due to the timing of upfront revenue realized in the year-ago period and the continued attrition of our Services revenue. This continued attrition of our Services revenue is due primarily to our ongoing efforts to develop products that are easier to install and easier to manage. The cadence and quality of our product releases continues to improve. While we are making progress across a number of our key strategic imperatives, we are continuing to work to improve the consistency of our performance across business units, customer groups and geographies. For example, our Mainframe business is performing very well, and our North American Platinum team delivered solid results in the quarter. However, performance in our Named and Growth or partner-led business was inconsistent. 
Total new sales and ES new sales declined in the quarter. This was due to a variety of factors, including very large deals in areas like Privileged Access Management, or PAM, and Service Management that closed in the year-ago period, which created a difficult compare. In addition, the pipeline for some of our products like Project and Portfolio Management, or PPM, is more heavily weighted towards Q4 than it was for Q3. Mainframe performed very well in the quarter, reflecting the combination of key competitive wins, healthy renewal performance and our successful partnerships with global service providers. This is the result of our ongoing organic innovation and commitment to customer success. This dedication to customer success extends beyond our software. There is no doubt that we live in a highly integrated world where various systems are interdependent. Our solutions are known to be mission critical, highly reliable and 0 downtime. 
Our Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which is an industry standard measure of loyalty, continues to rise on a positive trajectory. Our customer satisfaction score continues to increase, and our customers are rating our product quality higher. With this backdrop, we are pleased but not surprised by the performance of our Mainframe segment, both in Q3 and through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. Our 0 net new defect policy has resulted in considerably lower customer support issues and higher customer satisfaction. In the quarter, 12 new Mainframe releases went into GA, including new SKUs for CA Development Environment for z Systems, Mainframe Operations Intelligence and CA Release Automation Connector for z/OS. 
We have demonstrated a long-standing commitment to innovating on the Mainframe. Due to the value and quality of our systems, customers continue to rely on the Mainframe for mission-critical applications, which continues to drive MIPS growth. And there is an increasing number of customers choosing to standardize on our solutions. All of these factors are driving our success in this market. 
At CA World in November, we introduced the concept of Built to Change. Companies and organizations used to be Built to Last. Now they must adopt the mindset of Built to Change. New opportunities and new threats are emerging at an accelerated pace. This requires a more Agile approach, which provides a framework to pivot quickly and results in more robust, higher-quality solutions. The adoption of Agile across our development organization is enabling us to develop integrations across a number of our product families, improving the seamlessness of our broad portfolio. For example, at CA World, we released new integrations between our APIM and APM solutions with CA Precision API Monitoring. We introduced new Application Lifecycle Conductor, or ALC, integrations with CA Agile Central. And our latest release of CA Identity Service, our new Security SaaS offering, incorporates new integrations with CA's Single Sign On solution. Users can now access all of their cloud and on-premise applications from a single system. 
There is no question that our end-to-end vision is resonating with customers. Our solutions enable customers to plan, develop, test, manage and monitor with seamless security across all environments. Our APIM business, for example, delivered the largest quarter in its history in Q3, with strength across most geographies, products and routes to market. In the quarter, CA was positioned highest for Ability to Execute in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management. CA was also named a leader in the Forrester Wave: API Management Solutions, Q4 2016. 
In addition to the number of new releases announced at CA World, the APIM team also demonstrated CA API Gateway for Microservices. It also demonstrated industry vertical use cases, including a health care mobile app on top of our Healthcare Portal, and a Finance mobile app with Payment Services Directive and open banking. Customers like Service NSW, or New South Wales, in Australia are using our API Management solutions to connect millions of citizens to hundreds of services running on different processes and platforms. Our solutions enable every company to be a software company. We are really excited about our position in the APIM space and the opportunities we see going forward. 
Similarly, our overall portfolio of Continuous Delivery solutions had the best new sales quarter in its history, driven by continued strength in Test Data Management. And all product lines in the business unit released new versions in the quarter. The innovation engine at CA is alive and well. 
Code.org, the organization driving to ensure every student has the opportunity to learn computer science, used CA BlazeMeter to synthetically test its site for over 25 million users at its global hour of Code campaign. The event offered tutorials on more than 30 languages and had the capability of reaching tens of millions of students in more than 180 countries. We are passionate about the need to encourage and expand computer science education to reach a broader population of students. We are very proud of our ability to help ensure the success of Code.org and its events. 
Across our portfolio, we are continuing to focus on developing products that are easier to install and easier to manage without compromising functionality for the sake of simplicity. Agile Central, which also experienced new sales growth in the quarter, is a good example of this. In the quarter, we launched significant enhancements, simplifying the user experience with personal navigation. We are also working within and across business units to encourage cross-functional collaboration, which should result in a unique differentiation in our solutions and frictionless experiences for our customers. 
Consistent with our strategy of moving our portfolio of solutions forward and creating opportunities to best serve our customers, we are pleased to have closed the acquisition of Automic last week. We had been in conversations with Automic's management team for well over a year. It is an asset that we had targeted for strategic, operational and financial motivations. So we are excited to welcome Automic employees and customers to CA. Strategically, Automic expands our Workload Automation and DevOps portfolio with its cloud-enabled platform and gives us an end-to-end automation solution. Operationally, it elevates our presence outside North America and strengthens our footprint in the Germanic region, where we were underpenetrated. 
Financially, the acquisition meets our rigorous hurdle rates and was a great opportunity for us to utilize offshore cash. As I look towards the end of our fiscal year and into fiscal 2018, I am pleased with the progress we are continuing to make. Increasingly, we are a company that is Agile and Built to Change, and we continue to pivot to make thoughtful and strategic adjustments to optimize our position. While we are proud of our progress, we are by no means satisfied. We know that we must continue to evolve in order to achieve our potential and consistently deliver long-term sustainable growth. With 1 quarter left to go in the year, we believe we are on track to achieve our objectives in FY '17. 
To provide some insight into how we're thinking about FY '18, including Automic, we expect the level of growth to be in line with what we're experiencing in FY '17. This assumes that Services continues to be a headwind to revenue and that Mainframe performance is consistent with our expectation of low single-digits revenue decline year-over-year. Taking a longer-term, holistic view of the business, including both organic and inorganic contributions, we believe that we can deliver low single-digit growth in the medium term. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you"

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q3 total revenue was $1,007,000,000 and was down 3% and 2% in constant currency. Our constant currency revenue performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations due to higher level of upfront revenue recognized in the year-ago period and the decline in Services, as Mike has mentioned. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue by 1.5 points compared to September 30 rates, the last day of the preceding quarter. For year-over-year comparison purposes, the strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue by 0.5 point. 
Q3 Enterprise Solutions revenue declined 2%, Mainframe Solutions declined 1%, and Services declined 12%, as reported and in constant currency. Q3 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-single digits as reported and in constant currency. Q3 renewals were up in the mid-single digits, both as reported and in constant currency. As we previously stated, the year-over-year changes in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. We continue to expect the renewal portfolio in fiscal 2017 to increase in the high teens year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were down in North America due primarily to uneven performance in Named and Growth or partner-led accounts. New sales in Latin America declined due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the region. New sales were flat as reported and increased in constant currency in EMEA. New sales in APJ were down, reflecting the timing of the renewal portfolio in the region. Revenue increased in APJ as reported and in constant currency. In Latin America, revenue increased as reported but was down in constant currency. In EMEA, revenue decreased as reported but was up in constant currency. Revenue declined in North America as reported and in constant currency. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were flat as reported, and increased in the low single digits year-over-year in constant currency. Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter reflects the combinations of competitive wins and customer consolidation onto the CA platform, continued traction with newer, organic products, like Data Content Discovery or DCD; and our ongoing successful partnerships with system integrators or SIs. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased in the high single digits year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Areas such as API Management and Continuous Delivery saw positive new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we've discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing, but contribute to margin and cash flow. 
Services revenue decreased 12% as reported and in constant currency. We expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. We continue to expect this headwind in Services to have a dampening effect on our overall revenue growth in the near term. Total revenue backlog was up 3% and up 4% in constant currency. Current revenue backlog declined 1% as reported and was flat in constant currency. As we've said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90 renewal yield. 
Q3 GAAP operating margin was 31% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. GAAP operating margin increased 3 points compared to the year-ago period and is consistent with our medium-term target. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions and negative 4% for Services. Q3 Services margins reflect actions taken during the quarter to rightsize the segment, given our expectation that Services revenue will continue to be a headwind. Our Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 29%. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50, down 4% year-over-year and down 8% in constant currency. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, flat year-over-year and down 2% in constant currency. 
Our Q3 CFFO was $517 million, up $185 million year-over-year. CFFO increased relative to the year-ago period primarily due to the timing of single installment collections. Single installment cash payments were $231 million and up $106 million year-over-year. As we discussed last quarter, we have entered into an agreement-in-principle to settle a long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government. We have accrued for this liability and expect to pay the $45 million in cash during the fiscal fourth quarter.
We ended Q3 with approximately $739 million in net cash. During the third quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. We did not repurchase shares in Q3 due to the timing uncertainty related to our payment of the GSA settlement combined with the rate and pace at which we had executed our share repurchases in the first half of the fiscal year. Generally, we expect to offset dilution with our share repurchases. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2016. The guidance also includes the impact of our acquisition of Automic. As described at the announcement of the acquisition, given the timing of the close, which occurred on January 18, we expect Automic to contribute 0.5 point in revenue as reported and in constant currency. The acquisition is expected to adversely affect GAAP and non-GAAP total company operating margin by 1 percentage point and be dilutive to CFFO as well as GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, both as reported and in constant currency. The impact of the Automic acquisition, combined with the higher level of expenses typically incurred in our fourth fiscal quarter are expected to meaningfully depress ES margins in our fiscal Q4. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to be flat as reported and flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.01 billion to $4.03 billion. We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 1% to 4% as reported and flat to up 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.85. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of flat to up 2% as reported and down 2% to flat in constant currency. This translates to a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.47. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 413 million shares outstanding at a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of a 5% decrease to a 1% decrease as reported, and a 3% decrease to a 1% increase in constant currency. This translates to $990 million to $1.03 billion and includes the anticipated settlement of legal matters related to the agreement-in-principle for the GSA litigation previously discussed. 
As we look ahead to fiscal year '18, we'd like to provide some preliminary headlights into our current view. Including Automic, we expect fiscal '18 growth to be similar to the level of growth we are experiencing in fiscal year '17. We expect Services to continue to be a headwind to revenue and consistent with our longer-term view, we expect Mainframe revenue will decline in the low single digits year-over-year. 
Now with that, we'll open it up for questions."

And for the Mainframe perspective, Mainframe is actually operated, I'd say, in the high end of our guidance all year long. I think just consistent with how we view the market over the long term declining in the low single digits. That's going to contribute impact to it as well next year. And then I think just from a clarification perspective, we also think that if FX remains consistent with where we ended in 12/31/16, we think that probably represents about another full point of headwind to us next year as well."

And the lower end of Named, we put a lot of that into Growth is much more like a reseller. So when I take a look at our staff and the way that we've trained them and the way that we position them on a global basis, I think we can do a little bit more to match the accounts to the buying patterns that we're seeing in the market. And it took us several quarters to really understand this motion. It's not as fluid and predictable as you would expect. And it wasn't till we look at that data over 4 or 5 quarters that we saw that. The other thing is we are probably masked a little bit because we had pretty good traction in the eSTG space over the last 5 quarters. Like this is the first quarter in 5 that we haven't grown revenue in eSTG. So a combination of maybe a little too optimistic about our progress and then not fully understanding the buying [ph] patterns of these distinct customer patterns."

Some of them I'm -- we want to try to hold that a little tight because that's -- because we're still playing around with them, we think it's a competitive advantage. But the ones that are kind of progressing along, we're very happy with. One in particular called 42 I/O. The initial idea of what we were going to use it for didn't work out, but the underlying technology ended up being our whole analytics platform, which we code-named Jarvis, and that's been used in a couple of the products in our -- as we went out to market in Ayman's group, our Chief Product Officer. We have another one that we've been working on called Huzu, which is one that really takes a look at matching skills. We have another one that's doing some very interesting work in machine learning, really understanding how an application functions in the context of the environment it's in. So there's quite a few things going on in there that I'm very pleased with. It's a high-performing team that really takes advantage of Agile and they are truly disciples of Lean and really work hard to make sure that they pivot very quickly and go through our process in very quick form.  And also with -- since you're asking about innovation, I think the products groups, which is run by Ayman, has done a phenomenal job. They put 12 relatively media releases out this quarter, and I can think of several in particular, like Identity Services, which is a great application so that you can come to CA that is #1 in Identity and Access Management, especially for high volume, on-prem, but now you can go use the same system and do all the cloud-oriented authentications. There's no company that has that ability to bridge between all of these on-premise systems and a robust cloud set of Services. Agile Central did a big release this year -- this quarter, where they really trimmed up the user interface and made the whole Agile methodology much, much more approachable. And I think that's going to drive a lot more usability. And if you think of how a modern software company runs with land and expand, making it easier to use just gives you an opportunity, pass the land to start expanding. One on the Mainframe that, I think, was extraordinarily impressive was Intelligent Mainframe Management and Automation. This is once again an only-at-CA product. We are one of the few companies that are really investing in the Mainframe and this is using machine intelligence to really understand what's happening in a Mainframe environment, whether that be the network, the disk structure, the CPU power. And it's also built -- you don't have to be a Mainframe expert to use it, which is driving this whole notion of ease of use. So I'm very bullish on what's happening at our products organization, code quality is high, customer satisfaction is up and the innovation engine is clearly humming here at CA."

And when I look at -- and forget about the professional services for a minute, but when I look at subscription, that subscription line has been negative in every quarter for, I think, 5 years now.

Not making a lot of -- it's not really contributing a lot of profit to us, but not that do we want to lose a lot of money. What you saw this quarter, and I actually referred to it in my script, was actually the cost that we took to really try and realign our resources with what we project the future revenue to be. I know this will probably play out over several quarters and things like that, but it's really more about rightsizing it. Over the long term, I think we feel pretty comfortable that we can drive a business here in the low to mid-single digits. We want to ensure that the services that we put in place are there for deployment and to help our customers make the best use of our software. We're not trying to gouge anyone. We just think that's the right use of it. So yes, absolutely, we can recover here once we get through the next quarter or 2 of just trying to realign our resources."

We have a group of products, which we call Enhance, and those products, we don't sell a lot of net new. We saw a little bit of capacity, but they're very profitable products and our customers use them all day every day. And part of our relationship with them is the fact that we continue to invest in these products. Mind you, we're very careful with respect to our R&D spend and very limited marketing spend. The next bucket are scale products. These are the ones you see us doing a lot of advertising on, a lot of marketing on. They still get the healthy R&D budget. These are products that we are actively selling across the board. We're selling them into our Platinum accounts, we're selling these into our Named businesses and we're selling them into our Growth business. And then we have the third bucket, which is high-growth products. Not yet mature, very high R&D cost, scaling marketing cost. And the mix of all 3 of those buckets, we have various products that move back and forth. Once a product gets to a certain level of scale, where it's primarily capacity sale, it'll move into Enhance. A product that is new and is starting to ramp up and scale, we put into the scale bucket and the spend and the management of that looks a little bit different than you would manage a team that is going for a net new products with net new innovation and really working on getting customers at the Agile scrum teams rather than working heavily on deploying.

We've been paying close attention to this for several quarters and you're always trying to optimize your sales force and we do pay pretty close attention to customer satisfaction as well as cost of sales. And a Platinum customer does behave different than a net new customer that we've never done business with before. I think we get those 2 extremes. When it comes into the middle, I think we need to take a harder look at some of the customer segmentation because I think there's a lot of very large customers that actually look a lot more like a Platinum customer. They expect a dedicated sales rep. They expect a different type of service. They are going to competitive bid pretty much all of the work that's out there. And the Platinum team is very good at these long multi-country bids that they've been doing for a number of years. On the flip side of it, there's a whole segment of customers that are looking for Point Solutions. And 4 years ago or 3 years ago, we didn't really have Point Solutions. We had very complex on-prem solutions that require high services and a lot of configuration, if not customization. We don't have a lot of those products in the portfolio anymore. We're really pivoted to SaaS, cloud, on-demand, easy to use, easy to install. There's a whole segment of customers that are looking for try and buy in a much more digital footprint. And I think we can take a harder look in that and give a little bit more work on customer segmentation and get the customers that look like Platinum to be sold to like a Platinum customer. And then take advantage of this growing group we've built in handling our partnership. Our partnerships did a very nice job multiple quarters in a row, and we're starting to scale that out on a global basis. So I think we can leverage that as well."

We've got a very solid balance sheet and being able to use that balance sheet is a competitive weapon for us. Secondly, I do think that there is a little bit of a misunderstanding with respect to organic and inorganic. For example, if you take a look at our purchase of Xceedium, that was a very, very small acquisition and it was a great starter set with respect to Security and Privileged Identity Management. But if you take a look at the rapid revenue growth, that's been done because of our enterprise sales capability, which didn't exist. So that's not -- that is a complete organic capability that we've brought to a great product set. Secondly, when you're starting to sell to the Fortune 500 and some of the biggest governments in the world, a small company needs a lot of R&D help. And our ability to help that team with our own resources that really understand what a large complex customer is expecting, that's all organic as well. So when we take a look at the kinds of things we buy, we don't buy things just because we want to get revenue. We buy things because we think we can really add value to their product road map and we can add a lot of structure with respect to distribution. So it's a combination of those 2 things that you put them together, you're able to drive the kind of growth we're looking for."

And when you take a look at this particular transaction, the primary focus that they have had has been in Europe and it's one of the things that was very attractive to us. And they have a relatively small presence here in the U.S. I think we'll take our time making sure that we don't lose any of the pipeline that they've built and the strength that they've built in Europe. And we'll initially start augmenting our ability to transact here in the U.S. There's also a lot of work we can do with respect to our own products and driving some synergies on a global basis that we want to make sure we capture and that'll happen over the course of the next 6 months. We put a very experienced integration lead. He used to run all of Asia for us and prior to that, he's had -- he's been international in LatAm. Been with the company for an awful long time, and I think that, that level of experience and that experience in operating in international theaters will help us not make mistakes. Because as you think about a company that's primarily based in Europe, does think a little bit differently than a company that's based in the U.S. We want to make sure we have the right cultural fit.

On the other hand, you guys continue to talk about sort of buying things. And I guess, my question, Mike, is how wide do you want this portfolio to get before you lose sort of focus potentially? Main growth accounts, it sounds like it's more segmentation than sort of focus on a product perspective. But I think we're all sort of wondering, you have a lot of good things going on. When do sort of those organic growth engines start to sort of stand on their own feet versus having to go out and continue to sort of bolt something else on? It seems that you guys have a big enough base of product and especially about Automic coming out to sort of let those run by themselves and see how it plays out. I guess, what am I missing there? Because it seems the internal development engine should be able to take over at some point versus the inorganic acquisition strategy."

So let's start with that because I think that's where the focus needs to be. I don't think you're going to drive Mainframe operating margins up any higher. I think that that's the right mix at that particular space and if you drive those margins up any higher, I think you isolate yourself from customers. When you take a look at the ES business, we did 14% operating margin this last quarter. It's been hovering in and around the teens. We need to get that business in a steady state up into the high teens. And we are investing a lot, obviously, in marketing. We're investing an awful lot in R&D. And over time, I think you're going to see that portfolio move up into the high teens. Now the other thing that's working a little bit against us but that's our job to go figure this out, is everything that we're building is SaaS and it's ratable. So we don't have the luxury of getting that big upfront revenue kick, which is usually a sweetener to operating margins. On the other hand, we're getting very -- a much more predictable revenue stream in our SaaS revenue. So between the mix of that business model and our focus on getting those products to market and making sure that those products are sold, I think you'll see the leverage stay with respect to the ES side of the house."

I am pleased with the strong CFFO growth and healthy operating margin and EPS we delivered in Q3. On a constant currency basis, our revenue in the quarter came in as expected. Foreign currency headwinds negatively",1453,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I am pleased with the strong CFFO growth and healthy operating margin and EPS we delivered in Q3. On a constant currency basis, our revenue in the quarter came in as expected. Foreign currency headwinds negatively impacted reported revenue by an additional 1.5 points in Q3 relative to the September 30 rates. 
As discussed last quarter, we faced a difficult year-over-year compare due to the timing of upfront revenue realized in the year-ago period and the continued attrition of our Services revenue. This continued attrition of our Services revenue is due primarily to our ongoing efforts to develop products that are easier to install and easier to manage. The cadence and quality of our product releases continues to improve. While we are making progress across a number of our key strategic imperatives, we are continuing to work to improve the consistency of our performance across business units, customer groups and geographies. For example, our Mainframe business is performing very well, and our North American Platinum team delivered solid results in the quarter. However, performance in our Named and Growth or partner-led business was inconsistent. 
Total new sales and ES new sales declined in the quarter. This was due to a variety of factors, including very large deals in areas like Privileged Access Management, or PAM, and Service Management that closed in the year-ago period, which created a difficult compare. In addition, the pipeline for some of our products like Project and Portfolio Management, or PPM, is more heavily weighted towards Q4 than it was for Q3. Mainframe performed very well in the quarter, reflecting the combination of key competitive wins, healthy renewal performance and our successful partnerships with global service providers. This is the result of our ongoing organic innovation and commitment to customer success. This dedication to customer success extends beyond our software. There is no doubt that we live in a highly integrated world where various systems are interdependent. Our solutions are known to be mission critical, highly reliable and 0 downtime. 
Our Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which is an industry standard measure of loyalty, continues to rise on a positive trajectory. Our customer satisfaction score continues to increase, and our customers are rating our product quality higher. With this backdrop, we are pleased but not surprised by the performance of our Mainframe segment, both in Q3 and through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. Our 0 net new defect policy has resulted in considerably lower customer support issues and higher customer satisfaction. In the quarter, 12 new Mainframe releases went into GA, including new SKUs for CA Development Environment for z Systems, Mainframe Operations Intelligence and CA Release Automation Connector for z/OS. 
We have demonstrated a long-standing commitment to innovating on the Mainframe. Due to the value and quality of our systems, customers continue to rely on the Mainframe for mission-critical applications, which continues to drive MIPS growth. And there is an increasing number of customers choosing to standardize on our solutions. All of these factors are driving our success in this market. 
At CA World in November, we introduced the concept of Built to Change. Companies and organizations used to be Built to Last. Now they must adopt the mindset of Built to Change. New opportunities and new threats are emerging at an accelerated pace. This requires a more Agile approach, which provides a framework to pivot quickly and results in more robust, higher-quality solutions. The adoption of Agile across our development organization is enabling us to develop integrations across a number of our product families, improving the seamlessness of our broad portfolio. For example, at CA World, we released new integrations between our APIM and APM solutions with CA Precision API Monitoring. We introduced new Application Lifecycle Conductor, or ALC, integrations with CA Agile Central. And our latest release of CA Identity Service, our new Security SaaS offering, incorporates new integrations with CA's Single Sign On solution. Users can now access all of their cloud and on-premise applications from a single system. 
There is no question that our end-to-end vision is resonating with customers. Our solutions enable customers to plan, develop, test, manage and monitor with seamless security across all environments. Our APIM business, for example, delivered the largest quarter in its history in Q3, with strength across most geographies, products and routes to market. In the quarter, CA was positioned highest for Ability to Execute in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management. CA was also named a leader in the Forrester Wave: API Management Solutions, Q4 2016. 
In addition to the number of new releases announced at CA World, the APIM team also demonstrated CA API Gateway for Microservices. It also demonstrated industry vertical use cases, including a health care mobile app on top of our Healthcare Portal, and a Finance mobile app with Payment Services Directive and open banking. Customers like Service NSW, or New South Wales, in Australia are using our API Management solutions to connect millions of citizens to hundreds of services running on different processes and platforms. Our solutions enable every company to be a software company. We are really excited about our position in the APIM space and the opportunities we see going forward. 
Similarly, our overall portfolio of Continuous Delivery solutions had the best new sales quarter in its history, driven by continued strength in Test Data Management. And all product lines in the business unit released new versions in the quarter. The innovation engine at CA is alive and well. 
Code.org, the organization driving to ensure every student has the opportunity to learn computer science, used CA BlazeMeter to synthetically test its site for over 25 million users at its global hour of Code campaign. The event offered tutorials on more than 30 languages and had the capability of reaching tens of millions of students in more than 180 countries. We are passionate about the need to encourage and expand computer science education to reach a broader population of students. We are very proud of our ability to help ensure the success of Code.org and its events. 
Across our portfolio, we are continuing to focus on developing products that are easier to install and easier to manage without compromising functionality for the sake of simplicity. Agile Central, which also experienced new sales growth in the quarter, is a good example of this. In the quarter, we launched significant enhancements, simplifying the user experience with personal navigation. We are also working within and across business units to encourage cross-functional collaboration, which should result in a unique differentiation in our solutions and frictionless experiences for our customers. 
Consistent with our strategy of moving our portfolio of solutions forward and creating opportunities to best serve our customers, we are pleased to have closed the acquisition of Automic last week. We had been in conversations with Automic's management team for well over a year. It is an asset that we had targeted for strategic, operational and financial motivations. So we are excited to welcome Automic employees and customers to CA. Strategically, Automic expands our Workload Automation and DevOps portfolio with its cloud-enabled platform and gives us an end-to-end automation solution. Operationally, it elevates our presence outside North America and strengthens our footprint in the Germanic region, where we were underpenetrated. 
Financially, the acquisition meets our rigorous hurdle rates and was a great opportunity for us to utilize offshore cash. As I look towards the end of our fiscal year and into fiscal 2018, I am pleased with the progress we are continuing to make. Increasingly, we are a company that is Agile and Built to Change, and we continue to pivot to make thoughtful and strategic adjustments to optimize our position. While we are proud of our progress, we are by no means satisfied. We know that we must continue to evolve in order to achieve our potential and consistently deliver long-term sustainable growth. With 1 quarter left to go in the year, we believe we are on track to achieve our objectives in FY '17. 
To provide some insight into how we're thinking about FY '18, including Automic, we expect the level of growth to be in line with what we're experiencing in FY '17. This assumes that Services continues to be a headwind to revenue and that Mainframe performance is consistent with our expectation of low single-digits revenue decline year-over-year. Taking a longer-term, holistic view of the business, including both organic and inorganic contributions, we believe that we can deliver low single-digit growth in the medium term. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you"

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q3 total revenue was $1,007,000,000 and was down 3% and 2% in constant currency. Our constant currency revenue performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations due to higher level of upfront revenue recognized in the year-ago period and the decline in Services, as Mike has mentioned. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue by 1.5 points compared to September 30 rates, the last day of the preceding quarter. For year-over-year comparison purposes, the strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue by 0.5 point. 
Q3 Enterprise Solutions revenue declined 2%, Mainframe Solutions declined 1%, and Services declined 12%, as reported and in constant currency. Q3 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-single digits as reported and in constant currency. Q3 renewals were up in the mid-single digits, both as reported and in constant currency. As we previously stated, the year-over-year changes in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. We continue to expect the renewal portfolio in fiscal 2017 to increase in the high teens year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were down in North America due primarily to uneven performance in Named and Growth or partner-led accounts. New sales in Latin America declined due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the region. New sales were flat as reported and increased in constant currency in EMEA. New sales in APJ were down, reflecting the timing of the renewal portfolio in the region. Revenue increased in APJ as reported and in constant currency. In Latin America, revenue increased as reported but was down in constant currency. In EMEA, revenue decreased as reported but was up in constant currency. Revenue declined in North America as reported and in constant currency. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were flat as reported, and increased in the low single digits year-over-year in constant currency. Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter reflects the combinations of competitive wins and customer consolidation onto the CA platform, continued traction with newer, organic products, like Data Content Discovery or DCD; and our ongoing successful partnerships with system integrators or SIs. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased in the high single digits year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Areas such as API Management and Continuous Delivery saw positive new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we've discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing, but contribute to margin and cash flow. 
Services revenue decreased 12% as reported and in constant currency. We expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. We continue to expect this headwind in Services to have a dampening effect on our overall revenue growth in the near term. Total revenue backlog was up 3% and up 4% in constant currency. Current revenue backlog declined 1% as reported and was flat in constant currency. As we've said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90 renewal yield. 
Q3 GAAP operating margin was 31% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. GAAP operating margin increased 3 points compared to the year-ago period and is consistent with our medium-term target. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions and negative 4% for Services. Q3 Services margins reflect actions taken during the quarter to rightsize the segment, given our expectation that Services revenue will continue to be a headwind. Our Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 29%. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50, down 4% year-over-year and down 8% in constant currency. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, flat year-over-year and down 2% in constant currency. 
Our Q3 CFFO was $517 million, up $185 million year-over-year. CFFO increased relative to the year-ago period primarily due to the timing of single installment collections. Single installment cash payments were $231 million and up $106 million year-over-year. As we discussed last quarter, we have entered into an agreement-in-principle to settle a long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government. We have accrued for this liability and expect to pay the $45 million in cash during the fiscal fourth quarter.
We ended Q3 with approximately $739 million in net cash. During the third quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. We did not repurchase shares in Q3 due to the timing uncertainty related to our payment of the GSA settlement combined with the rate and pace at which we had executed our share repurchases in the first half of the fiscal year. Generally, we expect to offset dilution with our share repurchases. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2016. The guidance also includes the impact of our acquisition of Automic. As described at the announcement of the acquisition, given the timing of the close, which occurred on January 18, we expect Automic to contribute 0.5 point in revenue as reported and in constant currency. The acquisition is expected to adversely affect GAAP and non-GAAP total company operating margin by 1 percentage point and be dilutive to CFFO as well as GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, both as reported and in constant currency. The impact of the Automic acquisition, combined with the higher level of expenses typically incurred in our fourth fiscal quarter are expected to meaningfully depress ES margins in our fiscal Q4. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to be flat as reported and flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.01 billion to $4.03 billion. We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 1% to 4% as reported and flat to up 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.85. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of flat to up 2% as reported and down 2% to flat in constant currency. This translates to a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.47. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 413 million shares outstanding at a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of a 5% decrease to a 1% decrease as reported, and a 3% decrease to a 1% increase in constant currency. This translates to $990 million to $1.03 billion and includes the anticipated settlement of legal matters related to the agreement-in-principle for the GSA litigation previously discussed. 
As we look ahead to fiscal year '18, we'd like to provide some preliminary headlights into our current view. Including Automic, we expect fiscal '18 growth to be similar to the level of growth we are experiencing in fiscal year '17. We expect Services to continue to be a headwind to revenue and consistent with our longer-term view, we expect Mainframe revenue will decline in the low single digits year-over-year. 
Now with that, we'll open it up for questions."

And for the Mainframe perspective, Mainframe is actually operated, I'd say, in the high end of our guidance all year long. I think just consistent with how we view the market over the long term declining in the low single digits. That's going to contribute impact to it as well next year. And then I think just from a clarification perspective, we also think that if FX remains consistent with where we ended in 12/31/16, we think that probably represents about another full point of headwind to us next year as well."

Yes, especially this quarter, I was really disappointed in what happened primarily in Named and North America. I think that when we look across the board on a global basis, what we're seeing is the high end of the Named look a lot more like our Platinum customers, and that's a little bit of a different selling motion. And the lower end of Named, we put a lot of that into Growth is much more like a reseller. So when I take a look at our staff and the way that we've trained them and the way that we position them on a global basis, I think we can do a little bit more to match the accounts to the buying patterns that we're seeing in the market. And it took us several quarters to really understand this motion. It's not as fluid and predictable as you would expect. And it wasn't till we look at that data over 4 or 5 quarters that we saw that. The other thing is we are probably masked a little bit because we had pretty good traction in the eSTG space over the last 5 quarters. Like this is the first quarter in 5 that we haven't grown revenue in eSTG. So a combination of maybe a little too optimistic about our progress and then not fully understanding the buying [ph] patterns of these distinct customer patterns."

Some of them I'm -- we want to try to hold that a little tight because that's -- because we're still playing around with them, we think it's a competitive advantage. But the ones that are kind of progressing along, we're very happy with. One in particular called 42 I/O. The initial idea of what we were going to use it for didn't work out, but the underlying technology ended up being our whole analytics platform, which we code-named Jarvis, and that's been used in a couple of the products in our -- as we went out to market in Ayman's group, our Chief Product Officer. We have another one that we've been working on called Huzu, which is one that really takes a look at matching skills. We have another one that's doing some very interesting work in machine learning, really understanding how an application functions in the context of the environment it's in. So there's quite a few things going on in there that I'm very pleased with. It's a high-performing team that really takes advantage of Agile and they are truly disciples of Lean and really work hard to make sure that they pivot very quickly and go through our process in very quick form.  And also with -- since you're asking about innovation, I think the products groups, which is run by Ayman, has done a phenomenal job. They put 12 relatively media releases out this quarter, and I can think of several in particular, like Identity Services, which is a great application so that you can come to CA that is #1 in Identity and Access Management, especially for high volume, on-prem, but now you can go use the same system and do all the cloud-oriented authentications. There's no company that has that ability to bridge between all of these on-premise systems and a robust cloud set of Services. Agile Central did a big release this year -- this quarter, where they really trimmed up the user interface and made the whole Agile methodology much, much more approachable. And I think that's going to drive a lot more usability. And if you think of how a modern software company runs with land and expand, making it easier to use just gives you an opportunity, pass the land to start expanding. One on the Mainframe that, I think, was extraordinarily impressive was Intelligent Mainframe Management and Automation. This is once again an only-at-CA product. We are one of the few companies that are really investing in the Mainframe and this is using machine intelligence to really understand what's happening in a Mainframe environment, whether that be the network, the disk structure, the CPU power. And it's also built -- you don't have to be a Mainframe expert to use it, which is driving this whole notion of ease of use. So I'm very bullish on what's happening at our products organization, code quality is high, customer satisfaction is up and the innovation engine is clearly humming here at CA."

But it looks like it's really that new bookings don't seem to be able to offset attrition. And when I look at -- and forget about the professional services for a minute, but when I look at subscription, that subscription line has been negative in every quarter for, I think, 5 years now. And I know some of it may have shifted to software fees and others, and I know there's some currency effects in there, too.

We have a group of products, which we call Enhance, and those products, we don't sell a lot of net new. We saw a little bit of capacity, but they're very profitable products and our customers use them all day every day. And part of our relationship with them is the fact that we continue to invest in these products. Mind you, we're very careful with respect to our R&D spend and very limited marketing spend. The next bucket are scale products. These are the ones you see us doing a lot of advertising on, a lot of marketing on. They still get the healthy R&D budget. These are products that we are actively selling across the board. We're selling them into our Platinum accounts, we're selling these into our Named businesses and we're selling them into our Growth business. And then we have the third bucket, which is high-growth products. Not yet mature, very high R&D cost, scaling marketing cost. And the mix of all 3 of those buckets, we have various products that move back and forth. Once a product gets to a certain level of scale, where it's primarily capacity sale, it'll move into Enhance. A product that is new and is starting to ramp up and scale, we put into the scale bucket and the spend and the management of that looks a little bit different than you would manage a team that is going for a net new products with net new innovation and really working on getting customers at the Agile scrum teams rather than working heavily on deploying. Does that give you a little bit of context for how we think about it?"

We've been paying close attention to this for several quarters and you're always trying to optimize your sales force and we do pay pretty close attention to customer satisfaction as well as cost of sales. And a Platinum customer does behave different than a net new customer that we've never done business with before. I think we get those 2 extremes. When it comes into the middle, I think we need to take a harder look at some of the customer segmentation because I think there's a lot of very large customers that actually look a lot more like a Platinum customer. They expect a dedicated sales rep. They expect a different type of service. They are going to competitive bid pretty much all of the work that's out there. And the Platinum team is very good at these long multi-country bids that they've been doing for a number of years. On the flip side of it, there's a whole segment of customers that are looking for Point Solutions. And 4 years ago or 3 years ago, we didn't really have Point Solutions. We had very complex on-prem solutions that require high services and a lot of configuration, if not customization. We don't have a lot of those products in the portfolio anymore. We're really pivoted to SaaS, cloud, on-demand, easy to use, easy to install. There's a whole segment of customers that are looking for try and buy in a much more digital footprint. And I think we can take a harder look in that and give a little bit more work on customer segmentation and get the customers that look like Platinum to be sold to like a Platinum customer. And then take advantage of this growing group we've built in handling our partnership. Our partnerships did a very nice job multiple quarters in a row, and we're starting to scale that out on a global basis. So I think we can leverage that as well."

We've got a very solid balance sheet and being able to use that balance sheet is a competitive weapon for us. Secondly, I do think that there is a little bit of a misunderstanding with respect to organic and inorganic. For example, if you take a look at our purchase of Xceedium, that was a very, very small acquisition and it was a great starter set with respect to Security and Privileged Identity Management. But if you take a look at the rapid revenue growth, that's been done because of our enterprise sales capability, which didn't exist. So that's not -- that is a complete organic capability that we've brought to a great product set. Secondly, when you're starting to sell to the Fortune 500 and some of the biggest governments in the world, a small company needs a lot of R&D help. And our ability to help that team with our own resources that really understand what a large complex customer is expecting, that's all organic as well. So when we take a look at the kinds of things we buy, we don't buy things just because we want to get revenue. We buy things because we think we can really add value to their product road map and we can add a lot of structure with respect to distribution. So it's a combination of those 2 things that you put them together, you're able to drive the kind of growth we're looking for."

And we'll initially start augmenting our ability to transact here in the U.S. There's also a lot of work we can do with respect to our own products and driving some synergies on a global basis that we want to make sure we capture and that'll happen over the course of the next 6 months. We put a very experienced integration lead. He used to run all of Asia for us and prior to that, he's had -- he's been international in LatAm. Been with the company for an awful long time, and I think that, that level of experience and that experience in operating in international theaters will help us not make mistakes. Because as you think about a company that's primarily based in Europe, does think a little bit differently than a company that's based in the U.S. We want to make sure we have the right cultural fit. We want to make sure we take care of our customers. We also want to make sure we get the appropriate fit within the overarching context of CA."

On the other hand, you guys continue to talk about sort of buying things. And I guess, my question, Mike, is how wide do you want this portfolio to get before you lose sort of focus potentially? Main growth accounts, it sounds like it's more segmentation than sort of focus on a product perspective. But I think we're all sort of wondering, you have a lot of good things going on. When do sort of those organic growth engines start to sort of stand on their own feet versus having to go out and continue to sort of bolt something else on? It seems that you guys have a big enough base of product and especially about Automic coming out to sort of let those run by themselves and see how it plays out. I guess, what am I missing there? Because it seems the internal development engine should be able to take over at some point versus the inorganic acquisition strategy."

So let's start with that because I think that's where the focus needs to be. I don't think you're going to drive Mainframe operating margins up any higher. I think that that's the right mix at that particular space and if you drive those margins up any higher, I think you isolate yourself from customers. When you take a look at the ES business, we did 14% operating margin this last quarter. It's been hovering in and around the teens. We need to get that business in a steady state up into the high teens. And we are investing a lot, obviously, in marketing. We're investing an awful lot in R&D. And over time, I think you're going to see that portfolio move up into the high teens. Now the other thing that's working a little bit against us but that's our job to go figure this out, is everything that we're building is SaaS and it's ratable. So we don't have the luxury of getting that big upfront revenue kick, which is usually a sweetener to operating margins. On the other hand, we're getting very -- a much more predictable revenue stream in our SaaS revenue. So between the mix of that business model and our focus on getting those products to market and making sure that those products are sold, I think you'll see the leverage stay with respect to the ES side of the house."

I'm very pleased to report our strong fiscal fourth quarter performance. It was the best sales execution we've seen in our fourth quarter in well over a decade. There is no doubt we ended fiscal year 2017 with sol",1557,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to report our strong fiscal fourth quarter performance. It was the best sales execution we've seen in our fourth quarter in well over a decade. There is no doubt we ended fiscal year 2017 with solid momentum. Our strong fourth quarter performance enabled us to deliver most metrics at the high end of our full year guidance ranges. 
In fiscal 2017, we achieved total revenue growth for the first time since fiscal 2012. Importantly, we did this while maintaining healthy operating margins and cash flow generation. Now we are positioning CA for our next phase, which we believe will accelerate our growth trajectory over time. 
Turning to our Q4 results. Our revenue, new sales, EPS and CFFO were at or above our expectations. The highlight was the strength we saw in new sales across both our Enterprise Solutions and our Mainframe segments. In ES, healthy new sales growth was broad-based and was particularly robust across API Management, Agile central, Security and our Continuous Delivery portfolio with exceptionally strong results in our Test Data Management business. 
In Mainframe, new sales grew meaningfully. It is not surprising that capacity sales declined from the year-ago period, given where we are in the hardware refresh cycle. But our Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter demonstrates how well customers are embracing our new innovations on the platform. In the quarter, strength in Mainframe new sales was driven by organically developed products like data content discovery or DCD as well as Mainframe operational intelligence, or MOI. 
Overall, our Q4 performance was driven by the great execution of our Platinum sales team. They did a very good job of capitalizing on a large renewal portfolio. 
Results from our North American Platinum and public sector teams were particularly strong. The renewal yield in the quarter was in the low 90s, in-line with our longer-term target, and new sales were up dramatically. Our Named and growth for partner-led sales organizations also delivered healthy double-digit new sales growth in the quarter. 
I am pleased to report that the integration of our Automic acquisition is progressing well and we enthusiastically welcome Veracode to the team. We are really excited about the quality of the products, and most importantly, the quality of the people at both Automic and Veracode. These strategically important acquisitions substantially strengthen the growing portion of our ES portfolio. 
For the full year, we delivered results broadly at the higher end of our guidance ranges. Revenue, EPS and CFFO were above the midpoint of the guidance ranges we provided for the full year. Operating margin came in line and reflects the absorption of acquisition-related expenses associated with Automic and Veracode. Notably, for the full year, our ES revenue grew organically, which is a marked improvement over prior years. 
Our Mainframe segment delivered consistently solid performance through the year. For the year, Mainframe performed at the better end of our expectations. We believe our relative outperformance can be attributed to a few things. Our Mainframe business unit was an early adopter of Agile methodology. This has resulted in the completion of nearly 40 releases in the past year with 0 defects. This level of product quality is important to all customers, but is most important to our customers running mission-critical applications. CA continues to invest meaningfully in the Mainframe platform. We believe we offer a broader, more innovative and cost competitive portfolio of solutions. We are also able to leverage our ES development as well as recent acquisitions to provide unique integrations and truly cross-platform solutions that help customers solve complex challenges. Our broad solutions-based portfolio enable us to provide customers with compelling, cost competitive offerings. 
For example, one of the largest retailers in the United States made the decision to partner with us to support its retail corporate systems, credit cards and .com property. Our portfolio of innovative solutions is enabling them to simplify their IT environment, narrow their supplier base and reduce their costs. In conjunction with our partners and our customer's IT operations team, we are helping to deliver a seamless migration to 7 key CA solutions in less than 90 days. Looking ahead, we believe our partnership with IBM on IBM cloud managed services on Z systems, commonly referred to as Z cloud, provides us with a great opportunity to help customers realize the benefit of the cloud while running mission critical, Security Rich Mainframe workloads. This partnership enables CA to provide value to customers that have smaller MIPS consumption where the fixed cost of running a Mainframe platform is challenging. It also gives the option to larger customers to move CapEx to OpEx by turning Mainframe capacity into a service, similar to AWS or Azure. These dynamics have the potential label CA to capture incremental market segment share over time. 
When I look at our business overall, I can confidently say that we are in a good place. We are in a great business and we have absolutely improved our execution. In this industry, we can never rest on last quarter's performance. But when I pause for a moment and look back at the work our teams have done, we have made outstanding progress. First and foremost, CA was recently named one of the world's most ethical companies in 2017 by Ethisphere Institute. This is the second year in a row that CA has received this honor, which recognizes companies that lead with integrity and align principles with action. We at CA take great pride in this recognition that we believe is a reflection of the culture and priorities we have cultivated over the last [ few ] years. 
I'm also pleased that our heightened focus on customer success is reflected in the significant improvement we are seeing in our NPS or Net Promoter Score. This is a standardized measure of customers' willingness to recommend our products to other potential customers. In fiscal 2017, our NPS scores across both our ES and Mainframe segments moved up considerably. 
The spirit of innovation within CA is alive and well. Throughout the organization, our teams understand that organic innovation is critical and is the heart of our strategy. The budding success of our CA accelerator, which is our internal DC-like technology incubator, is certainly helping. In this framework, successful ideas become solutions and begin to build momentum with customers. The objective for these innovations is to exit the CA accelerator into the product organization. The first graduate from the CA accelerator into the CPO organization is a common analytics engine that can be utilized by both our Mainframe and our Enterprise Solutions segments. Company-wide, CA was granted 186 patents in FY '17, up from 157 at prior year. 
Meanwhile, the product portfolio continues to improve. Our products are becoming easier to install, upgrade and manage. And we are pleased to report that our solutions continue to earn recognition from major industry analysts. For example, in Q4, CA was named a leader by Gartner in its 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for governance and administration. We are listening to our customers. This is resulting in improved NPS scores, better products and more efficient business practices. We are furthering our commitment to deliver solutions in a way customers increasingly prefer to buy. We are working to accelerate the velocity of products like Agile Central and BlazeMeter. Looking ahead, we are optimizing our internal processes to build, sell and monetize our subscription-based products more systematically with higher velocity and with greater efficiency. This includes building our common set of best practices, metrics and business architecture across our SaaS solutions. 
Similarly, we are optimizing the way in which we go-to-market. As mentioned last quarter, we've observed that our largest named accounts have preferences and behaviors much like our Platinum customers. At the same time, the investments we've made in our partner channel and our digital sales over the past few years has started to gain momentum. This allows us to now reduce the complexity of our customer stratification. Going forward, we are migrating the Platinum, Named and Growth nomenclature towards 2 sales groups, enterprise and commercial. This aligns with our growing portfolio of next-generation software solutions, and it aligns with how our existing and prospective customers to transact. The enterprise sales team will encompass what has been known as Platinum in addition to the largest 30% or so of the Named sales group. We believe this will enable us to drive deeper penetration in our largest Fortune 2000 opportunities. The commercial sales group will absorb the smaller Named customers and will be entirely served by digital sales and partners. We believe this will enable us to cost effectively serve a much broader set of potential customers globally. Ultimately, we expect this to propel a lower cost, higher velocity go-to-market strategy for CA over time. 
This is an exciting time at CA. This industry is moving quickly, and so are we. We've made incredible progress, and as we look towards the next phase of this company's evolution, and in many ways, we're just getting started. 
As we enter FY '18 and beyond, we are pivoting to enter our next phase as a company that delivers sustainable, long-term growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Kieran to review our fourth quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started the a quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. 
This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. As Mike had previously mentioned, we were very pleased with our sales execution in the fourth quarter. Q4 total new sales increased in the low 40s, while renewals increased in the low 50s. As you have stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Automic contributed approximately mid-single digits to total new sales growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Q4 renewal yield was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term expectations. In Q4, new sales in all regions were up as reported and in constant currency except EMEA, where new sales were flat as reported and up in constant currency, actually the contribution from the Automic acquisition. 
Within our segments, Q4 Mainframe new sales increased in the low 40s despite lower capacity sales, which likely reflects the timing of the hardware cycle. Mainframe new sales performance was driven by organically developed products like data content discovery and Mainframe operational intelligence. 
Q4 Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 40s and mid-40s in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, the strong performance in this segment was driven by products like API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery products, all of which saw a meaningful improvement on a year-over-year basis. Automic contributed approximately high single  digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth in the quarter. 
For the full year, total new sales were up approximately 10%, with Enterprise Solutions new sales up high single digits and Mainframe Solutions new sales up in the mid-teens. Acquisitions contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth, and mid-single digits to total new sales growth for the full year. Even without acquisitions, total new sales would have grown for the full year. 
Our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2017 was up in the mid-teens, and our renewal yield was in the low 90s in each of the 4 quarters. 
Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.01 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Q4 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5% as reported and up 6% in constant currency. Mainframe solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 1% in constant currency, and Services was down 6% as reported and down 5% in constant currency. Automic contributed 2 points as reported and 3 points in constant currency to total revenue growth in our fourth fiscal quarter. More specifically, Automic contributed approximately 6 points Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 4 points to Services revenue in the quarter. 
For the full year, total revenue was $4.04 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 results included 1 quarter of inorganic contribution from our 2016 acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium in addition to our more recent acquisitions of Automic. 
Fiscal 2017 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5%. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 1%, and Services revenue was down 8% as reported and down 7% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 2 points to total revenue growth for the full year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 3 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 3 points to Services revenue for the full year. 
Total revenue backlog increased 11% as reported and 12% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog increased 4% as reported and 6% in constant currency, inclusive of Automic and Veracode. As we said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow with more consistency as we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. 
Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 21% and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, in line with our expectation. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 59% for Mainframe solutions and 1% for Enterprise Solutions. As typical, our Q4 margins were lower. In addition to higher seasonal expenses, an increased level of commissions paid from higher new sales generated in the period negatively impacted Mainframe Solutions segment operating margin in Q4. 
Enterprise Solutions operating margins, which are typically seasonally lower in Q4, we're also adversely impacted by nonrecurring expenses related to our acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. In addition, segment margins were impacted by an increased level of commissions expense commensurate with new sales growth. 
Services margin was negative 3%. As we discussed in the past, as our product portfolio has evolved and our solutions are becoming easier to install and to manage, fewer Services are required. This has resulted in contraction of the structurally lower-margin segment. Our fourth quarter segment margin reflects the continuation of our actions to better align the cost structure with our expected Services revenue run rate going forward. 
Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the fourth quarter were approximately 21% to 25%, respectively. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38, down 7%. Q4 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, down 10% as reported and down 12% in constant currency. For the full year, our GAAP operating margin was 28%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. 
Fiscal 2017 segment operating margins were 61% for Mainframe solutions, 11% for Enterprise Solutions and breakeven for Services. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the full year was approximately 28%. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year was $1.85, up 4% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.48, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. 
Q4 CFFO was [ $419 million, ] down 11%. CFFO in the quarter was impacted by a GSA settlement. We paid $49 million inclusive of legal fees in the quarter to settle a long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government as previously announced. 
Single installment cash collections were $176 million in the quarter, up $46 million from the year-ago period. For the full year, CFFO was $1.04 billion, flat as reported and up 3% in constant currency. CFFO exceeded our expectations due to a higher level of single installment cash collections. Separately, we issued [ $815 million ] in investment-grade bonds, primarily to fund our acquisition of Veracode. We issued a 5-year $500 million tranche at 3.6% and a 10-year [ $350 million ] tranche at 4.7%. We are very pleased with the terms and are comfortable with the tenor of our corporate debt. 
We ended Q4 with approximately $157 million in net debt. During the quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. Due to the acquisition of Veracode and the bond offering, we did not buy back stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect to resume our share repurchases in the near term with the intention to generally at least offset dilution. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates in the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31, 2017. It includes the impact of the Veracode acquisition and includes incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of senior notes in March. No additional material acquisitions are assumed. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 3% as reported and to increase 3% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.12 billion to $4.17 billion. This guidance contemplates our expectation that the overall Mainframe market will decline in the low single digits over the medium term, consistent with what we've said in the past. 
We expect full year GAAP operating margin between 26% to 27% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 36%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 10% to 7% as reported and to decrease 8% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.67 to $1.72. This includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense associated with our March 2017 bond offering. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 5% to 3% as reported and to decrease 4% to 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.40. Again, this includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense from our bond offering mentioned previously. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately [ 415 million ] shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in a range of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.05 to $1.10 billion. The incremental interest expense from the bond offering impacts CFFO by approximately $33 million. 
Our cash flow from operations guidance includes our adoption of ASU 2016-09, titled ""improvements to employee share-based payment accounting."" The adoption of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 requires us to present taxes paid in connection with employee stock within cash flows from financing activities rather than payments within cash flows from operations. The adoption of this accounting standard will be presented retrospectively and is not expected to impact the year-over-year percentage change. 
With regard to Q1, please keep in mind that we renewed a large system integrator in the June quarter of fiscal 2017. This creates a very difficult year-over-year compare that will be particularly evident in our Q1 renewal bookings and new sales. Additionally, the impact from the acquisitions and related integration expenses will be most impactful in the first 2 quarters of the year, particularly in Q1. 
For the full year, we expect the size of the portfolio to be renewal it to be down in the high teens compared to the year-ago period. Even excluding the impact of the large SI we renewed in Q1 last year, our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2018 is back end-loaded. We expect this to heavily influence the linearity of bookings throughout the year. 
To provide an update on ASC 606, the upcoming revenue for commission standard, as you will see in our 10-K filing tomorrow, we expect this change in the revenue resolution standard will have a material impact on our reported financial statements. Specifically, we expect that at point in time rather than ratable recognition of license revenue, we will increase the variability in our quarterly reported results. However, we do not expect that the change in standard will significantly impact the way in which we recognize revenue from maintenance, SaaS and professional Services contracts. And we do not expect it will meaningfully impact customer billings or cash collections from customer billings. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASC 606 on cash tax payments. In general, we do not expect economic value of our transactions to change as a result of ASC 606. We plan to adopt the ASC 606 in our first quarter of fiscal [ 2019, ] and we are continuing to evaluate the transition method we will use. 
As we work through the changes coming with ASC 606, we are also exploring ways in which we can improve the transparency and diversity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business. 
In summary, we are pleased with our performance in Q4, where we met or exceeded our expectations across most financial metrics. As we look ahead to fiscal 2018 and beyond, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our long-term goal of sustainable growth. With that, we'll open it up for questions."

So those products are very attractive to our customer base, and we have a sales team intimately understands these customers, especially the large ones, John, as you all know. And having great product being sold with those renewals, it was bigger than we probably anticipated. But I would credit that with the quality of the products and the interesting nature of the solutions and how the solutions work together. We also have uptick in volume in sales outside of the renewal portfolio. So more deals. But if you think about how the market is mining, it is try and buy, it is land-and-expand. So you're going to see more transaction volume. I think the biggest transaction volume we've ever had for net new clients.

So when were talking to customers, they may not only buy; one product but they can see the vision of how these products work together. Continuous Delivery, for example, you can buy just one product in Continuous Delivery. But if you think about how you're going to evolve your digital footprint over time and build net new innovation and get it to market quickly, you can see as your own internal processes improve, how CA products that work together with little to no integration cost will streamline your ability to turn your self into a software company. So we kind of call this whole packaged together, the stuffware factory. And as we start putting these elements together, I think what's happening is customers start to envision their business in the context of being a software company, and we kind of fit the mold really well there.

And with a lot of the new product introductions that we have coupled with their notion of getting these products to work together, we become much more competitive against single-product companies as we're starting to tell our story because at the end of the day, most of these companies are not thinking about just one product that solve one problem. They're trying to orchestrate a digital remastering of their business. And in order to do that, you're going to need multiple products. Very few companies have multiple products that can work together as well as having those products in their portfolio.

I'm very pleased to report our strong fiscal fourth quarter performance. It was the best sales execution we've seen in our fourth quarter in well over a decade. There is no doubt we ended fiscal year 2017 with sol",1556,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to report our strong fiscal fourth quarter performance. It was the best sales execution we've seen in our fourth quarter in well over a decade. There is no doubt we ended fiscal year 2017 with solid momentum. Our strong fourth quarter performance enabled us to deliver most metrics at the high end of our full year guidance ranges. 
In fiscal 2017, we achieved total revenue growth for the first time since fiscal 2012. Importantly, we did this while maintaining healthy operating margins and cash flow generation. Now we are positioning CA for our next phase, which we believe will accelerate our growth trajectory over time. 
Turning to our Q4 results. Our revenue, new sales, EPS and CFFO were at or above our expectations. The highlight was the strength we saw in new sales across both our Enterprise Solutions and our Mainframe segments. In ES, healthy new sales growth was broad-based and was particularly robust across API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery portfolio with exceptionally strong results in our Test Data Management business. 
In Mainframe, new sales grew meaningfully. It is not surprising that capacity sales declined from the year ago period, given where we are in the hardware refresh cycle. But our Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter demonstrates how well customers are embracing our new innovations on the platform. In the quarter, strength in Mainframe new sales was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery or DCD as well as Mainframe Operational Intelligence or MOI. 
Overall, our Q4 performance was driven by the great execution of our Platinum sales team. They did a very good job of capitalizing on a large renewal portfolio. 
Results from our North American Platinum and public sector teams were particularly strong. The renewal yield in the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term target, and new sales were up dramatically. Our Named and Growth or Partner-led sales organizations also delivered healthy double-digit new sales growth in the quarter. 
I am pleased to report that the integration of our Automic acquisition is progressing well, and we enthusiastically welcome Veracode to the team. We are really excited about the quality of the products, and most importantly, the quality of the people at both Automic and Veracode. These strategically important acquisitions substantially strengthen the growing portion of our ES portfolio. 
For the full year, we delivered results broadly at the higher end of our guidance ranges. Revenue, EPS and CFFO were above the midpoint of the guidance ranges we provided for the full year. Operating margin came in line and reflects the absorption of acquisition-related expenses associated with Automic and Veracode. Notably, for the full year, our ES revenue grew organically, which is a marked improvement over prior years. 
Our Mainframe segment delivered consistently solid performance through the year. For the year, Mainframe performed at the better end of our expectations. We believe our relative outperformance can be attributed to a few things. Our Mainframe business unit was an early adopter of the Agile methodology. This has resulted in the completion of nearly 40 releases in the past year with 0 defects. This level of product quality is important to all customers, but is most important to our customers running mission-critical applications. CA continues to invest meaningfully in the Mainframe platform. We believe we offer a broader, more innovative and cost competitive portfolio of solutions. We are also able to leverage our ES development as well as recent acquisitions to provide unique integrations and truly cross-platform solutions that help customers solve complex challenges. Our broad solutions-based portfolio enables us to provide customers with compelling, cost competitive offerings. 
For example, one of the largest retailers in the United States made the decision to partner with us to support its retail corporate systems, credit cards and dot com property. Our portfolio of innovative solutions is enabling them to simplify their IT environment, narrow their supplier base and reduce their costs. In conjunction with our partners and our customers' IT operations team, we are helping to deliver a seamless migration to 7 key CA solutions in less than 90 days. 
Looking ahead, we believe our partnership with IBM on IBM cloud managed services on z Systems, commonly referred to zCloud, provides us with a great opportunity to help customers realize the benefit of the cloud while running mission critical, security-rich Mainframe workloads. This partnership enables CA to provide value to customers that have smaller MIPS consumption where the fixed cost of running a Mainframe platform is challenging. It also gives the option to larger customers to move CapEx to OpEx by turning Mainframe capacity into a service, similar to AWS or Azure. These dynamics have the potential to enable CA to capture incremental market segment share over time. 
When I look at our business overall, I can confidently say that we are in a good place. We are in a great business and we have absolutely improved our execution. In this industry, we can never rest on last quarter's performance. But when I pause for a moment and look back at the work our teams have done, we have made outstanding progress. First and foremost, CA was recently named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies in 2017 by Ethisphere Institute. This is the second year in a row that CA has received this honor, which recognizes companies that lead with integrity and align principles with action. We at CA take great pride in this recognition that we believe is a reflection of the culture and priorities we have cultivated over the last few years. 
I'm also pleased that our heightened focus on customer success is reflected in the significant improvement we are seeing in our NPS or Net Promoter Score. This is a standardized measure of customers' willingness to recommend our products to other potential customers. In fiscal 2017, our NPS scores across both our ES and Mainframe segments moved up considerably. 
The spirit of innovation within CA is alive and well. Throughout the organization, our teams understand that organic innovation is critical and is the heart of our strategy. The budding success of our CA Accelerator, which is our internal VC-like technology incubator, is certainly helping. In this framework, successful ideas become solutions and begin to build momentum with customers. The objective for these innovations is to exit the CA Accelerator into the product organization. The first graduate from the CA Accelerator to the CPO organization is a common analytics engine that can be utilized by both our Mainframe and our Enterprise Solutions segment. Company-wide, CA was granted 186 patents in FY '17, up from 157 the prior year. 
Meanwhile, the product portfolio continues to improve. Our products are becoming easier to install, upgrade and manage. And we are pleased to report that our solutions continue to earn recognition from major industry analysts. For example, in Q4, CA was named a leader by Gartner in its 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Governance and Administration. 
We are listening to our customers. This is resulting in improved NPS scores, better products and more efficient business practices. We are furthering our commitment to deliver solutions in a way customers increasingly prefer to buy. We are working to accelerate the velocity of products like Agile Central and BlazeMeter. Looking ahead, we are optimizing our internal processes to build, sell and monetize our subscription-based products more systematically with higher velocity and with greater efficiency. This includes building our common set of best practices, metrics and business architecture across our SaaS solutions. 
Similarly, we are optimizing the way in which we go-to-market. As mentioned last quarter, we've observed that our largest named accounts have preferences and behaviors much like our Platinum customers. At the same time, the investments we've made in our partner channel and our digital sales over the past few years has started to gain momentum. This allows us to now reduce the complexity of our customer stratification. Going forward, we are migrating the Platinum, Named and Growth nomenclature towards 2 sales groups, Enterprise and Commercial. This aligns with our growing portfolio of next-generation software solutions, and it aligns with how our existing and prospective customers transact. 
The Enterprise sales team will encompass what has been known as Platinum in addition to the largest 30% or so of the Named sales group. We believe this will enable us to drive deeper penetration in our largest Fortune 2000 opportunities. The Commercial sales group will absorb the smaller Named customers and will be entirely served by digital sales and partners. We believe this will enable us to cost effectively serve a much broader set of potential customers globally. Ultimately, we expect this to propel a lower cost, higher velocity go-to-market strategy for CA over time. 
This is an exciting time at CA. This industry is moving quickly, and so are we. We've made incredible progress, and as we look towards the next phase of this company's evolution, and in many ways, we're just getting started. As we enter FY '18 and beyond, we are pivoting to enter our next phase as a company that delivers sustainable, long-term growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Kieran to review our fourth quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance in",1995,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. 
This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As Mike had previously mentioned, we were very pleased with our sales execution in the fourth quarter. Q4 total new sales increased in the low 40s, while renewals increased in the low 50s. As we stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis, due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Automic contributed approximately mid-single digits to total new sales growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Q4 renewal yield was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term expectations. In Q4, new sales in all regions were up as reported and in constant currency except EMEA, where new sales were flat as reported and up in constant currency, including the contribution from the Automic acquisition. 
Within our segments, Q4 Mainframe new sales increased in the low 40s, despite lower capacity sales which likely reflects the timing of the hardware cycle. Mainframe new sales performance was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operational Intelligence. 
Q4 Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 40s and mid-40s in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, the strong performance in this segment was driven by products like API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery products, all of which saw a meaningful improvement on a year-over-year basis. Automic contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth in the quarter. 
For the full year, total new sales were up approximately 10%, with Enterprise Solutions new sales up high single digits and Mainframe Solutions new sales up in the mid-teens. Acquisitions contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth, and mid-single digits to total new sales growth for the full year. Even without acquisitions, total new sales would have grown for the full year. 
Our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2017 was up in the mid-teens, and our renewal yield was in the low 90s in each of the 4 quarters. 
Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.01 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Q4 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5% as reported and up 6% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 1% in constant currency, and Services was down 6% as reported and down 5% in constant currency. Automic contributed 2 points as reported and 3 points in constant currency to total revenue growth in our fourth fiscal quarter. More specifically, Automic contributed approximately 6 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 4 points to Services revenue in the quarter. 
For the full year, total revenue was $4.04 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 results included 1 quarter of inorganic contribution from our 2016 acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, in addition to our more recent acquisitions of Automic. 
Fiscal 2017 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5%, Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 1% and Services revenue was down 8% as reported and down 7% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 2 points to total revenue growth for the full year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 3 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 3 points to Services revenue for the full year. 
Total revenue backlog increased 11% as reported and 12% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog increased 4% as reported and 6% in constant currency, inclusive of Automic and Veracode. As we said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow with more consistency as we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. 
Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 21% and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, in line with our expectation. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 59% for Mainframe Solutions and 1% for Enterprise Solutions. As typical, our Q4 margins were lower. In addition to higher seasonal expenses, an increased level of commissions paid from higher new sales generated in the period negatively impacted Mainframe Solutions segment operating margin in Q4. 
Enterprise Solutions operating margins, which are typically seasonally lower in Q4, we're also adversely impacted by nonrecurring expenses related to our acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. In addition, segment margins were impacted by an increased level of commissions expense commensurate with new sales growth. 
Services margin was negative 3%. As we discussed in the past, as our product portfolio has evolved and our solutions are becoming easier to install and to manage, fewer services are required. This has resulted in contraction of the structurally lower margin segment. Our fourth quarter segment margin reflects the continuation of our actions to better align the cost structure with our expected Services revenue run rate going forward. 
Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the fourth quarter were approximately 21% and 25%, respectively. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38, down 7%. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, down 10% as reported and down 12% in constant currency. For the full year, our GAAP operating margin was 28%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. 
Fiscal 2017 segment operating margins were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 11% for Enterprise Solutions and breakeven for Services. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the full year was approximately 28%. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year was $1.85, up 4% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.48, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. 
Q4 CFFO was $419 million, down 11%. CFFO in the quarter was impacted by a GSA settlement. We paid $49 million inclusive of legal fees in the quarter to settle a long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government as previously announced. 
Single installment cash collections were $176 million in the quarter, up $46 million from the year ago period. For the full year, CFFO was $1.04 billion, flat as reported and up 3% in constant currency. CFFO exceeded our expectations due to a higher level of single installment cash collections. 
Separately, we issued $850 million in investment-grade bonds, primarily to fund our acquisition of Veracode. We issued a 5-year $500 million tranche at 3.6% and a 10-year $350 million tranche at 4.7%. We are very pleased with the terms and are comfortable with the tenor of our corporate debt. 
We ended Q4 with approximately $157 million in net debt. During the quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. Due to the acquisition of Veracode and the bond offering, we did not buy back stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect to resume our share repurchases in the near term with the intention to generally at least offset dilution. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates in the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31, 2017. It includes the impact of the Veracode acquisition and includes the incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of senior notes in March. No additional material acquisitions are assumed. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 3% as reported and to increase 3% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.12 billion to $4.17 billion. This guidance contemplates our expectation that the overall Mainframe market will decline in the low single digits over the medium term, consistent with what we've said in the past. 
We expect full year GAAP operating margin between 26% to 27% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 36%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 10% to 7% as reported and to decrease 8% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.67 to $1.72. This includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense associated with our March 2017 bond offering. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 5% to 3% as reported and to decrease 4% to 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.40. Again, this includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense from our bond offering mentioned previously. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. 
Cash flow from operations is expected to be in a range of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.05 billion to $1.10 billion. The incremental interest expense from the bond offering impacts CFFO by approximately $33 million. 
Our cash flow from operations guidance includes our adoption of ASU 2016-09, titled ""Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."" The adoption of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 requires us to present taxes paid in connection with employee stock within cash flows from financing activities rather than payments within cash flows from operations. The adoption of this accounting standard will be presented retrospectively and is not expected to impact the year-over-year percentage change. 
With regard to Q1, please keep in mind that we renewed a large system integrator in the June quarter of fiscal 2017. This creates a very difficult year-over-year compare that will be particularly evident in our Q1 renewal bookings and new sales. Additionally, the impact from the acquisitions and related integration expenses will be most impactful in the first 2 quarters of the year, particularly in Q1. 
For the full year, we expect the size of the portfolio to be renewed to be down in the high teens compared to the year ago period. Even excluding the impact of the large SI we renewed in Q1 last year, our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2018 is back end-loaded. We expect this to heavily influence the linearity of bookings throughout the year. 
To provide an update on ASC 606, the upcoming revenue recognition standard, as you will see in our 10-K filing tomorrow, we expect this change in the revenue recognition standard will have a material impact on our reported financial statements. Specifically, we expect that the point in time rather than ratable recognition of license revenue will increase the variability in our quarterly reported results. However, we do not expect that the change in standard will significantly impact the way in which we recognize revenue from maintenance, SaaS and professional services contracts. And we do not expect it will meaningfully impact customer billings or cash collections from customer billings. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASC 606 on cash tax payments. In general, we do not expect the economic value of our transactions to change as a result of ASC 606. We plan to adopt the ASC 606 in our first quarter of fiscal 2019, and we are continuing to evaluate the transition method we will use. 
As we work through the changes coming with ASC 606, we're also exploring ways in which we can improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business. 
In summary, we are pleased with our performance in Q4, where we met or exceeded our expectations across most financial metrics. As we look ahead to fiscal 2018 and beyond, we believe we're well positioned to achieve our long-term goal of sustainable growth. With that, we'll open it up for questions."

We finally felt coming out of Q3, Q4 performance that they were mature enough, had enough process and experience where they can service those customers. That coupled with the portfolio, as you know, we've been rapidly moving towards more SaaS solutions, try and buy, land and expand. Those solutions lend themselves well to digital sales. And then strategically, as we know that our Enterprise portfolio will, in the relatively mid-term, exceed the Mainframe portfolio. We have to take into consideration our cost structure on sales and try to use a very expensive sales force at a segment of the market that could easily be served by a broader sales force is in the best interest for CA, both tactically and strategically."

And what we're looking at are really looking for metrics that we'll be able to add to the top line reported numbers to try and give a sense of the continuity of the business as we move through time. That said, when we go back and we take a look at our ability to build our customers and collect cash from our customers, we don't see anything there. And quite frankly, we are not making changes to our contractual relationships to our customer. The customer is at the center of our business, and we don't think it's right to go and impact the customers for changes that are being driven by accounting. And from what we can see right now, we don't think the true fundamental economics are going to change, although license at any given period will be more volatile."

Well, first, we didn't naturally pull any deals forward in Q4 so it was pretty much standard practice. Nothing outstanding or nothing special there. The new business inside the renewal, it's just a function of the quality of the products. I think we have almost every one of our products, either up in the Magic Quadrant or in the highest ranking of our Top 8 new focused products. So those products are very attractive to our customer base, and we have a sales team that intimately understands these customers, especially the large ones, John, as you all know. And having great product being sold into -- with those renewals, it was bigger than we probably anticipated. But I would credit that with the quality of the products and the interesting nature of the solutions and how the solutions work together. We also have uptick in volume in sales outside of the renewal portfolio. So more deals. But if you think about how the market is buying, it is try and buy, it is land and expand. So you're going to see more transaction volume. I think it was the biggest transaction volume we've ever had for net new clients, but the size of the transaction are relatively small compared to what we would sell into the renewal base.

Well, if I had my way in the world, what I'd love to do is by just these acquisitions that we made. We're very excited about them. But as you know, acquisitions take work, and I've always preferred, given my choice, to do smaller acquisitions in the $50 million to $80 million range that have good base technology that needs organic engineering from us to get those products to scale and then put it through our marketing and distribution engine. Unfortunately, we don't get to choose how these things work. If you take a look at Automic, for example, that was a 2-year courting period, and it finally came to conclusion. It just so happened that Veracode, which we've been looking at for a long period of time, that happened in the relatively near time frame to Automic. Given my choice, I would have rather spread those out over time. But when you have an opportunity, properties like that at the price that we feel is right for value, you want to be able to execute. Now having said that, I think that our view on value is probably going to get a little tougher because we don't feel we need to be out in the market. Now if something that was extraordinary was to come along, we want the flexibility to go ahead and do that. But right now, I'd like to digest what we have and just keep our eyes wide open for small tuck-ins that fit our strategy and hope that nothing material hits the market that we are really interested in."

And coming out of Q3 and Q4 with a lot of land deals, that gives us an opportunity to expand and that will all show up as organic.

They're trying to orchestrate a digital remastering of their business. And in order to do that, you're going to need multiple products.

I'm very pleased to report our strong fiscal fourth quarter performance. It was the best sales execution we've seen in our fourth quarter in well over a decade. There is no doubt we ended fiscal year 2017 with sol",1557,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to report our strong fiscal fourth quarter performance. It was the best sales execution we've seen in our fourth quarter in well over a decade. There is no doubt we ended fiscal year 2017 with solid momentum. Our strong fourth quarter performance enabled us to deliver most metrics at the high end of our full year guidance ranges. 
In fiscal 2017, we achieved total revenue growth for the first time since fiscal 2012. Importantly, we did this while maintaining healthy operating margins and cash flow generation. Now we are positioning CA for our next phase, which we believe will accelerate our growth trajectory over time. 
Turning to our Q4 results. Our revenue, new sales, EPS and CFFO were at or above our expectations. The highlight was the strength we saw in new sales across both our Enterprise Solutions and our Mainframe segments. In ES, healthy new sales growth was broad-based and was particularly robust across API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery portfolio with exceptionally strong results in our Test Data Management business. 
In Mainframe, new sales grew meaningfully. It is not surprising that capacity sales declined from the year ago period, given where we are in the hardware refresh cycle. But our Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter demonstrates how well customers are embracing our new innovations on the platform. In the quarter, strength in Mainframe new sales was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery or DCD as well as Mainframe Operational Intelligence or MOI. 
Overall, our Q4 performance was driven by the great execution of our Platinum sales team. They did a very good job of capitalizing on a large renewal portfolio. 
Results from our North American Platinum and public sector teams were particularly strong. The renewal yield in the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term target, and new sales were up dramatically. Our Named and Growth or Partner-led sales organizations also delivered healthy double-digit new sales growth in the quarter. 
I am pleased to report that the integration of our Automic acquisition is progressing well, and we enthusiastically welcome Veracode to the team. We are really excited about the quality of the products, and most importantly, the quality of the people at both Automic and Veracode. These strategically important acquisitions substantially strengthen the growing portion of our ES portfolio. 
For the full year, we delivered results broadly at the higher end of our guidance ranges. Revenue, EPS and CFFO were above the midpoint of the guidance ranges we provided for the full year. Operating margin came in line and reflects the absorption of acquisition-related expenses associated with Automic and Veracode. Notably, for the full year, our ES revenue grew organically, which is a marked improvement over prior years. 
Our Mainframe segment delivered consistently solid performance through the year. For the year, Mainframe performed at the better end of our expectations. We believe our relative outperformance can be attributed to a few things. Our Mainframe business unit was an early adopter of the Agile methodology. This has resulted in the completion of nearly 40 releases in the past year with 0 defects. This level of product quality is important to all customers, but is most important to our customers running mission-critical applications. CA continues to invest meaningfully in the Mainframe platform. We believe we offer a broader, more innovative and cost competitive portfolio of solutions. We are also able to leverage our ES development as well as recent acquisitions to provide unique integrations and truly cross-platform solutions that help customers solve complex challenges. Our broad solutions-based portfolio enables us to provide customers with compelling, cost competitive offerings. 
For example, one of the largest retailers in the United States made the decision to partner with us to support its retail corporate systems, credit cards and dot com property. Our portfolio of innovative solutions is enabling them to simplify their IT environment, narrow their supplier base and reduce their costs. In conjunction with our partners and our customers' IT operations team, we are helping to deliver a seamless migration to 7 key CA solutions in less than 90 days. 
Looking ahead, we believe our partnership with IBM on IBM cloud managed services on z Systems, commonly referred to zCloud, provides us with a great opportunity to help customers realize the benefit of the cloud while running mission critical, security-rich Mainframe workloads. This partnership enables CA to provide value to customers that have smaller MIPS consumption where the fixed cost of running a Mainframe platform is challenging. It also gives the option to larger customers to move CapEx to OpEx by turning Mainframe capacity into a service, similar to AWS or Azure. These dynamics have the potential to enable CA to capture incremental market segment share over time. 
When I look at our business overall, I can confidently say that we are in a good place. We are in a great business and we have absolutely improved our execution. In this industry, we can never rest on last quarter's performance. But when I pause for a moment and look back at the work our teams have done, we have made outstanding progress. First and foremost, CA was recently named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies in 2017 by Ethisphere Institute. This is the second year in a row that CA has received this honor, which recognizes companies that lead with integrity and align principles with action. We at CA take great pride in this recognition that we believe is a reflection of the culture and priorities we have cultivated over the last few years. 
I'm also pleased that our heightened focus on customer success is reflected in the significant improvement we are seeing in our NPS or Net Promoter Score. This is a standardized measure of customers' willingness to recommend our products to other potential customers. In fiscal 2017, our NPS scores across both our ES and Mainframe segments moved up considerably. 
The spirit of innovation within CA is alive and well. Throughout the organization, our teams understand that organic innovation is critical and is the heart of our strategy. The budding success of our CA Accelerator, which is our internal VC-like technology incubator, is certainly helping. In this framework, successful ideas become solutions and begin to build momentum with customers. The objective for these innovations is to exit the CA Accelerator into the product organization. The first graduate from the CA Accelerator to the CPO organization is a common analytics engine that can be utilized by both our Mainframe and our Enterprise Solutions segment. Company-wide, CA was granted 186 patents in FY '17, up from 157 the prior year. 
Meanwhile, the product portfolio continues to improve. Our products are becoming easier to install, upgrade and manage. And we are pleased to report that our solutions continue to earn recognition from major industry analysts. For example, in Q4, CA was named a leader by Gartner in its 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Governance and Administration. 
We are listening to our customers. This is resulting in improved NPS scores, better products and more efficient business practices. We are furthering our commitment to deliver solutions in a way customers increasingly prefer to buy. We are working to accelerate the velocity of products like Agile Central and BlazeMeter. Looking ahead, we are optimizing our internal processes to build, sell and monetize our subscription-based products more systematically with higher velocity and with greater efficiency. This includes building on a common set of best practices, metrics and business architecture across our SaaS solutions. 
Similarly, we are optimizing the way in which we go-to-market. As mentioned last quarter, we've observed that our largest named accounts have preferences and behaviors much like our Platinum customers. At the same time, the investments we've made in our partner channel and our digital sales over the past few years has started to gain momentum. This allows us to now reduce the complexity of our customer stratification. Going forward, we are migrating the Platinum, Named and Growth nomenclature towards 2 sales groups, Enterprise and Commercial. This aligns with our growing portfolio of next-generation software solutions, and it aligns with how our existing and prospective customers transact. 
The Enterprise sales team will encompass what has been known as Platinum in addition to the largest 30% or so of the Named sales group. We believe this will enable us to drive deeper penetration in our largest Fortune 2000 opportunities. The Commercial sales group will absorb the smaller Named customers and will be entirely served by digital sales and partners. We believe this will enable us to cost effectively serve a much broader set of potential customers globally. Ultimately, we expect this to propel a lower cost, higher velocity go-to-market strategy for CA over time. 
This is an exciting time at CA. This industry is moving quickly, and so are we. We've made incredible progress, and as we look towards the next phase of this company's evolution, and in many ways, we're just getting started. As we enter FY '18 and beyond, we are pivoting to enter our next phase as a company that delivers sustainable, long-term growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Kieran to review our fourth quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. 
This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As Mike had previously mentioned, we were very pleased with our sales execution in the fourth quarter. Q4 total new sales increased in the low 40s, while renewals increased in the low 50s. As we stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Automic contributed approximately mid-single digits to total new sales growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Q4 renewal yield was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term expectations. In Q4, new sales in all regions were up as reported and in constant currency except EMEA, where new sales were flat as reported and up in constant currency, including the contribution from the Automic acquisition. 
Within our segments, Q4 Mainframe new sales increased in the low 40s, despite lower capacity sales which likely reflects the timing of the hardware cycle. Mainframe new sales performance was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operational Intelligence. 
Q4 Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 40s and mid-40s in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, the strong performance in this segment was driven by products like API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery products, all of which saw a meaningful improvement on a year-over-year basis. Automic contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth in the quarter. 
For the full year, total new sales were up approximately 10%, with Enterprise Solutions new sales up high single digits and Mainframe Solutions new sales up in the mid-teens. Acquisitions contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth, and mid-single digits to total new sales growth for the full year. Even without acquisitions, total new sales would have grown for the full year. 
Our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2017 was up in the mid-teens, and our renewal yield was in the low 90s in each of the 4 quarters. 
Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.01 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Q4 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5% as reported and up 6% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 1% in constant currency, and Services was down 6% as reported and down 5% in constant currency. Automic contributed 2 points as reported and 3 points in constant currency to total revenue growth in our fourth fiscal quarter. More specifically, Automic contributed approximately 6 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 4 points to Services revenue in the quarter. 
For the full year, total revenue was $4.04 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 results included 1 quarter of inorganic contribution from our 2016 acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, in addition to our more recent acquisition of Automic. 
Fiscal 2017 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5%, Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 1% and Services revenue was down 8% as reported and down 7% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 2 points to total revenue growth for the full year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 3 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 3 points to Services revenue for the full year. 
Total revenue backlog increased 11% as reported and 12% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog increased 4% as reported and 6% in constant currency, inclusive of Automic and Veracode. As we said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow with more consistency as we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. 
Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 21% and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, in line with our expectation. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 59% for Mainframe Solutions and 1% for Enterprise Solutions. As typical, our Q4 margins were lower. In addition to higher seasonal expenses, an increased level of commissions paid from higher new sales generated in the period negatively impacted Mainframe Solutions segment operating margin in Q4. 
Enterprise Solutions operating margins, which are typically seasonally lower in Q4, were also adversely impacted by nonrecurring expenses related to our acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. In addition, segment margins were impacted by an increased level of commissions expense commensurate with new sales growth. 
Services margin was negative 3%. As we discussed in the past, as our product portfolio has evolved and our solutions are becoming easier to install and to manage, fewer services are required. This has resulted in contraction of the structurally lower margin segment. Our fourth quarter segment margin reflects the continuation of our actions to better align the cost structure with our expected Services revenue run rate going forward. 
Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the fourth quarter were approximately 21% and 25%, respectively. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38, down 7%. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, down 10% as reported and down 12% in constant currency. For the full year, our GAAP operating margin was 28%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. 
Fiscal 2017 segment operating margins were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 11% for Enterprise Solutions and breakeven for Services. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the full year was approximately 28%. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year was $1.85, up 4% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.48, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. 
Q4 CFFO was $419 million, down 11%. CFFO in the quarter was impacted by the GSA settlement. We paid $49 million inclusive of legal fees in the quarter to settle a long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government as previously announced. 
Single installment cash collections were $176 million in the quarter, up $46 million from the year ago period. For the full year, CFFO was $1.04 billion, flat as reported and up 3% in constant currency. CFFO exceeded our expectations due to a higher level of single installment cash collections. 
Separately, we issued $850 million in investment-grade bonds, primarily to fund our acquisition of Veracode. We issued a 5-year $500 million tranche at 3.6% and a 10-year $350 million tranche at 4.7%. We are very pleased with the terms and are comfortable with the tenor of our corporate debt. 
We ended Q4 with approximately $157 million in net debt. During the quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. Due to the acquisition of Veracode and the bond offering, we did not buy back stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect to resume our share repurchases in the near term with the intention to generally at least offset dilution. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31, 2017. It includes the impact of the Veracode acquisition and includes the incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of senior notes in March. No additional material acquisitions are assumed. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 3% as reported and to increase 3% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.12 billion to $4.17 billion. This guidance contemplates our expectation that the overall Mainframe market will decline in the low single digits over the medium term, consistent with what we've said in the past. 
We expect full year GAAP operating margin between 26% to 27% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 36%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 10% to 7% as reported and to decrease 8% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.67 to $1.72. This includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense associated with our March 2017 bond offering. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 5% to 3% as reported and to decrease 4% to 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.40. Again, this includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense from our bond offering mentioned previously. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. 
Cash flow from operations is expected to be in a range of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.05 billion to $1.10 billion. The incremental interest expense from the bond offering impacts CFFO by approximately $33 million. 
Our cash flow from operations guidance includes our adoption of ASU 2016-09, titled ""Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."" The adoption of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 requires us to present taxes paid in connection with employee stock within cash flows from financing activities rather than payments within cash flows from operations. The adoption of this accounting standard will be presented retrospectively and is not expected to impact the year-over-year percentage change. 
With regard to Q1, please keep in mind that we renewed a large system integrator in the June quarter of fiscal 2017. This creates a very difficult year-over-year compare that will be particularly evident in our Q1 renewal bookings and new sales. Additionally, the impact from the acquisitions and related integration expenses will be most impactful in the first 2 quarters of the year, particularly in Q1. 
For the full year, we expect the size of the portfolio to be renewed to be down in the high teens compared to the year ago period. Even excluding the impact of the large SI we renewed in Q1 last year, our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2018 is back-end-loaded. We expect this to heavily influence the linearity of bookings throughout the year. 
To provide an update on ASC 606, the upcoming revenue recognition standard, as you will see in our 10-K filing tomorrow, we expect this change in the revenue recognition standard will have a material impact on our reported financial statements. Specifically, we expect that the point in time rather than ratable recognition of license revenue will increase the variability in our quarterly reported results. However, we do not expect that the change in standard will significantly impact the way in which we recognize revenue from maintenance, SaaS and professional services contracts. And we do not expect it will meaningfully impact customer billings or cash collections from customer billings. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASC 606 on cash tax payments. In general, we do not expect the economic value of our transactions to change as a result of ASC 606. We plan to adopt the ASC 606 in our first quarter of fiscal 2019, and we are continuing to evaluate the transition method we will use. 
As we work through the changes coming with ASC 606, we're also exploring ways in which we can improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business. 
In summary, we are pleased with our performance in Q4, where we met or exceeded our expectations across most financial metrics. As we look ahead to fiscal 2018 and beyond, we believe we're well positioned to achieve our long-term goal of sustainable growth. With that, we'll open it up for questions."

But as you can all expect, we're a business that has been growing primarily ratable, a very small amount of upfront revenue. You can see that within the SFO accounts that we have. So converting the licensed content, which is obviously quite material in both the ES and the Mainframe business, will add a volatility in any 1 given quarter. We think it smoothes itself out over time. The length of time is maybe somewhat debatable, but I think that's what we're in the process of really sizing here. And what we're looking at are really looking for metrics that we'll be able to add to the top line reported numbers to try and give a sense of the continuity of the business as we move through time. That said, when we go back and we take a look at our ability to bill our customers and collect cash from our customers, we don't see anything there. And quite frankly, we are not making changes to our contractual relationships to our customer. The customer is at the center of our business, and we don't think it's right to go and impact the customers for changes that are being driven by accounting.

Even if you normalize through duration, I think bookings were up something in the double digits. Mike, you mentioned the strong renewals and strong new sales, and you also doubled the number of large deals. So I guess, I have 2 questions. One -- and I know your deals, like we try to model like when they're supposed to renew. But I know that it seems to round a lot. So I'm just curious, were there more deals that were signed early more than normal. I know that happens every quarter. Did that happen this quarter? And then secondly, it sounds like you're -- the attaching of new business to renewals is working really well and that's great. But how about -- how's progress in signing new deals outside of a renewal cycle whether it's with existing customers or new customers?"

Well, first, we didn't naturally pull any deals forward in Q4 so it was pretty much standard practice. Nothing outstanding or nothing special there. The new business inside the renewal, it's just a function of the quality of the products. I think we have almost every one of our products, either up in the Magic Quadrant or in the highest ranking of our Top 8 new focused products. So those products are very attractive to our customer base, and we have a sales team that intimately understands these customers, especially the large ones, John, as you all know. And having great products being sold into -- with those renewals, it was bigger than we probably anticipated. But I would credit that with the quality of the products and the interesting nature of the solutions and how the solutions work together. We also have uptick in volume in sales outside of the renewal portfolio. So more deals. But if you think about how the market is buying, it is try and buy, it is land and expand. So you're going to see more transaction volume. I think it was the biggest transaction volume we've ever had for net new clients, but the size of the transactions are relatively small compared to what we would sell into the renewal base. And I think over time, the land and expand, those now are footprints for expand. Kieran, maybe you have a thought on that as well?"

Well, if I had my way in the world, what I'd love to do is by just these acquisitions that we made. We're very excited about them. But as you know, acquisitions take work and I've always preferred, given my choice, to do smaller acquisitions in the $50 million to $80 million range that have good base technology that needs organic engineering from us to get those products to scale and then put it through our marketing and distribution engine. Unfortunately, we don't get to choose how these things work. If you take a look at Automic, for example, that was a 2-year courting period, and it finally came to conclusion. It just so happened that Veracode, which we've been looking at for a long period of time, that happened in the relatively near timeframe to Automic. Given my choice, I would have rather spread those out over time. But when you have an opportunity to get properties like that at the price that we feel is right for value, you want to be able to execute. Now having said that, I think that our view on value is probably going to get a little tougher because we don't feel we need to be out in the market. Now if something that was extraordinary was to come along, we want the flexibility to go ahead and do that.

Continuous Delivery, for example, you can buy just one product in Continuous Delivery. But if you think about how you're going to evolve your digital footprint over time and build net new innovation and get it to market quickly, you can see as your own internal processes improve, how CA products that work together with little to no integration cost will streamline your ability to turn yourself into a software company. So we kind of call this whole package together the software factory. And as we start putting these elements together, I think what's happening is customers are starting to envision their business in the context of being a software company, and we kind of fit the mold really well there.

262913,427415515,1208652,"CA, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, May 11, 2017",2017-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to report our strong fiscal fourth quarter performance. It was the best sales execution we've seen in our fourth quarter in well over a decade. There is no doubt we ended fiscal year 2017 with sol",1557,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to report our strong fiscal fourth quarter performance. It was the best sales execution we've seen in our fourth quarter in well over a decade. There is no doubt we ended fiscal year 2017 with solid momentum. Our strong fourth quarter performance enabled us to deliver most metrics at the high end of our full year guidance ranges. 
In fiscal 2017, we achieved total revenue growth for the first time since fiscal 2012. Importantly, we did this while maintaining healthy operating margins and cash flow generation. Now we are positioning CA for our next phase, which we believe will accelerate our growth trajectory over time. 
Turning to our Q4 results. Our revenue, new sales, EPS and CFFO were at or above our expectations. The highlight was the strength we saw in new sales across both our Enterprise Solutions and our Mainframe segments. In ES, healthy new sales growth was broad-based and was particularly robust across API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery portfolio with exceptionally strong results in our Test Data Management business. 
In Mainframe, new sales grew meaningfully. It is not surprising that capacity sales declined from the year ago period, given where we are in the hardware refresh cycle. But our Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter demonstrates how well customers are embracing our new innovations on the platform. In the quarter, strength in Mainframe new sales was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery or DCD as well as Mainframe Operational Intelligence or MOI. 
Overall, our Q4 performance was driven by the great execution of our Platinum sales team. They did a very good job of capitalizing on a large renewal portfolio. 
Results from our North American Platinum and public sector teams were particularly strong. The renewal yield in the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term target, and new sales were up dramatically. Our Named and Growth or Partner-led sales organizations also delivered healthy double-digit new sales growth in the quarter. 
I am pleased to report that the integration of our Automic acquisition is progressing well, and we enthusiastically welcome Veracode to the team. We are really excited about the quality of the products, and most importantly, the quality of the people at both Automic and Veracode. These strategically important acquisitions substantially strengthen the growing portion of our ES portfolio. 
For the full year, we delivered results broadly at the higher end of our guidance ranges. Revenue, EPS and CFFO were above the midpoint of the guidance ranges we provided for the full year. Operating margin came in line and reflects the absorption of acquisition-related expenses associated with Automic and Veracode. Notably, for the full year, our ES revenue grew organically, which is a marked improvement over prior years. 
Our Mainframe segment delivered consistently solid performance through the year. For the year, Mainframe performed at the better end of our expectations. We believe our relative outperformance can be attributed to a few things. Our Mainframe business unit was an early adopter of the Agile methodology. This has resulted in the completion of nearly 40 releases in the past year with 0 defects. This level of product quality is important to all customers, but is most important to our customers running mission-critical applications. CA continues to invest meaningfully in the Mainframe platform. We believe we offer a broader, more innovative and cost competitive portfolio of solutions. We are also able to leverage our ES development as well as recent acquisitions to provide unique integrations and truly cross-platform solutions that help customers solve complex challenges. Our broad solutions-based portfolio enables us to provide customers with compelling, cost competitive offerings. 
For example, one of the largest retailers in the United States made the decision to partner with us to support its retail corporate systems, credit cards and dot com property. Our portfolio of innovative solutions is enabling them to simplify their IT environment, narrow their supplier base and reduce their costs. In conjunction with our partners and our customers' IT operations team, we are helping to deliver a seamless migration to 7 key CA solutions in less than 90 days. 
Looking ahead, we believe our partnership with IBM on IBM cloud managed services on z Systems, commonly referred to zCloud, provides us with a great opportunity to help customers realize the benefit of the cloud while running mission critical, security-rich Mainframe workloads. This partnership enables CA to provide value to customers that have smaller MIPS consumption where the fixed cost of running a Mainframe platform is challenging. It also gives the option to larger customers to move CapEx to OpEx by turning Mainframe capacity into a service, similar to AWS or Azure. These dynamics have the potential to enable CA to capture incremental market segment share over time. 
When I look at our business overall, I can confidently say that we are in a good place. We are in a great business and we have absolutely improved our execution. In this industry, we can never rest on last quarter's performance. But when I pause for a moment and look back at the work our teams have done, we have made outstanding progress. First and foremost, CA was recently named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies in 2017 by Ethisphere Institute. This is the second year in a row that CA has received this honor, which recognizes companies that lead with integrity and align principles with action. We at CA take great pride in this recognition that we believe is a reflection of the culture and priorities we have cultivated over the last few years. 
I'm also pleased that our heightened focus on customer success is reflected in the significant improvement we are seeing in our NPS or Net Promoter Score. This is a standardized measure of customers' willingness to recommend our products to other potential customers. In fiscal 2017, our NPS scores across both our ES and Mainframe segments moved up considerably. 
The spirit of innovation within CA is alive and well. Throughout the organization, our teams understand that organic innovation is critical and is the heart of our strategy. The budding success of our CA Accelerator, which is our internal VC-like technology incubator, is certainly helping. In this framework, successful ideas become solutions and begin to build momentum with customers. The objective for these innovations is to exit the CA Accelerator into the product organization. The first graduate from the CA Accelerator to the CPO organization is a common analytics engine that can be utilized by both our Mainframe and our Enterprise Solutions segment. Company-wide, CA was granted 186 patents in FY '17, up from 157 the prior year. 
Meanwhile, the product portfolio continues to improve. Our products are becoming easier to install, upgrade and manage. And we are pleased to report that our solutions continue to earn recognition from major industry analysts. For example, in Q4, CA was named a leader by Gartner in its 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Governance and Administration. 
We are listening to our customers. This is resulting in improved NPS scores, better products and more efficient business practices. We are furthering our commitment to deliver solutions in a way customers increasingly prefer to buy. We are working to accelerate the velocity of products like Agile Central and BlazeMeter. Looking ahead, we are optimizing our internal processes to build, sell and monetize our subscription-based products more systematically with higher velocity and with greater efficiency. This includes building on a common set of best practices, metrics and business architecture across our SaaS solutions. 
Similarly, we are optimizing the way in which we go-to-market. As mentioned last quarter, we've observed that our largest named accounts have preferences and behaviors much like our Platinum customers. At the same time, the investments we've made in our partner channel and our digital sales over the past few years has started to gain momentum. This allows us to now reduce the complexity of our customer stratification. Going forward, we are migrating the Platinum, Named and Growth nomenclature towards 2 sales groups, Enterprise and Commercial. This aligns with our growing portfolio of next-generation software solutions, and it aligns with how our existing and prospective customers transact. 
The Enterprise sales team will encompass what has been known as Platinum in addition to the largest 30% or so of the Named sales group. We believe this will enable us to drive deeper penetration in our largest Fortune 2000 opportunities. The Commercial sales group will absorb the smaller Named customers and will be entirely served by digital sales and partners. We believe this will enable us to cost effectively serve a much broader set of potential customers globally. Ultimately, we expect this to propel a lower cost, higher velocity go-to-market strategy for CA over time. 
This is an exciting time at CA. This industry is moving quickly, and so are we. We've made incredible progress, and as we look towards the next phase of this company's evolution, and in many ways, we're just getting started. As we enter FY '18 and beyond, we are pivoting to enter our next phase as a company that delivers sustainable, long-term growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Kieran to review our fourth quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. 
This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As Mike had previously mentioned, we were very pleased with our sales execution in the fourth quarter. Q4 total new sales increased in the low 40s, while renewals increased in the low 50s. As we stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Automic contributed approximately mid-single digits to total new sales growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Q4 renewal yield was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term expectations. In Q4, new sales in all regions were up as reported and in constant currency except EMEA, where new sales were flat as reported and up in constant currency, including the contribution from the Automic acquisition. 
Within our segments, Q4 Mainframe new sales increased in the low 40s, despite lower capacity sales which likely reflects the timing of the hardware cycle. Mainframe new sales performance was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operational Intelligence. 
Q4 Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 40s and mid-40s in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, the strong performance in this segment was driven by products like API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery products, all of which saw a meaningful improvement on a year-over-year basis. Automic contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth in the quarter. 
For the full year, total new sales were up approximately 10%, with Enterprise Solutions new sales up high single digits and Mainframe Solutions new sales up in the mid-teens. Acquisitions contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth, and mid-single digits to total new sales growth for the full year. Even without acquisitions, total new sales would have grown for the full year. 
Our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2017 was up in the mid-teens, and our renewal yield was in the low 90s in each of the 4 quarters. 
Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.01 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Q4 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5% as reported and up 6% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 1% in constant currency, and Services was down 6% as reported and down 5% in constant currency. Automic contributed 2 points as reported and 3 points in constant currency to total revenue growth in our fourth fiscal quarter. More specifically, Automic contributed approximately 6 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 4 points to Services revenue in the quarter. 
For the full year, total revenue was $4.04 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 results included 1 quarter of inorganic contribution from our 2016 acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, in addition to our more recent acquisition of Automic. 
Fiscal 2017 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5%, Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 1% and Services revenue was down 8% as reported and down 7% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 2 points to total revenue growth for the full year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 3 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 3 points to Services revenue for the full year. 
Total revenue backlog increased 11% as reported and 12% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog increased 4% as reported and 6% in constant currency, inclusive of Automic and Veracode. As we said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow with more consistency as we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. 
Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 21% and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, in line with our expectation. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 59% for Mainframe Solutions and 1% for Enterprise Solutions. As typical, our Q4 margins were lower. In addition to higher seasonal expenses, an increased level of commissions paid from higher new sales generated in the period negatively impacted Mainframe Solutions segment operating margin in Q4. 
Enterprise Solutions operating margins, which are typically seasonally lower in Q4, were also adversely impacted by nonrecurring expenses related to our acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. In addition, segment margins were impacted by an increased level of commissions expense commensurate with new sales growth. 
Services margin was negative 3%. As we discussed in the past, as our product portfolio has evolved and our solutions are becoming easier to install and to manage, fewer services are required. This has resulted in contraction of the structurally lower margin segment. Our fourth quarter segment margin reflects the continuation of our actions to better align the cost structure with our expected Services revenue run rate going forward. 
Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the fourth quarter were approximately 21% and 25%, respectively. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38, down 7%. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, down 10% as reported and down 12% in constant currency. For the full year, our GAAP operating margin was 28%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. 
Fiscal 2017 segment operating margins were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 11% for Enterprise Solutions and breakeven for Services. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the full year was approximately 28%. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year was $1.85, up 4% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.48, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. 
Q4 CFFO was $419 million, down 11%. CFFO in the quarter was impacted by the GSA settlement. We paid $49 million inclusive of legal fees in the quarter to settle a long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government as previously announced. 
Single installment cash collections were $176 million in the quarter, up $46 million from the year ago period. For the full year, CFFO was $1.04 billion, flat as reported and up 3% in constant currency. CFFO exceeded our expectations due to a higher level of single installment cash collections. 
Separately, we issued $850 million in investment-grade bonds, primarily to fund our acquisition of Veracode. We issued a 5-year $500 million tranche at 3.6% and a 10-year $350 million tranche at 4.7%. We are very pleased with the terms and are comfortable with the tenor of our corporate debt. 
We ended Q4 with approximately $157 million in net debt. During the quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. Due to the acquisition of Veracode and the bond offering, we did not buy back stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect to resume our share repurchases in the near term with the intention to generally at least offset dilution. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31, 2017. It includes the impact of the Veracode acquisition and includes the incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of senior notes in March. No additional material acquisitions are assumed. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 3% as reported and to increase 3% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.12 billion to $4.17 billion. This guidance contemplates our expectation that the overall Mainframe market will decline in the low single digits over the medium term, consistent with what we've said in the past. 
We expect full year GAAP operating margin between 26% to 27% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 36%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 10% to 7% as reported and to decrease 8% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.67 to $1.72. This includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense associated with our March 2017 bond offering. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 5% to 3% as reported and to decrease 4% to 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.40. Again, this includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense from our bond offering mentioned previously. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. 
Cash flow from operations is expected to be in a range of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.05 billion to $1.10 billion. The incremental interest expense from the bond offering impacts CFFO by approximately $33 million. 
Our cash flow from operations guidance includes our adoption of ASU 2016-09, titled ""Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."" The adoption of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 requires us to present taxes paid in connection with employee stock within cash flows from financing activities rather than payments within cash flows from operations. The adoption of this accounting standard will be presented retrospectively and is not expected to impact the year-over-year percentage change. 
With regard to Q1, please keep in mind that we renewed a large system integrator in the June quarter of fiscal 2017. This creates a very difficult year-over-year compare that will be particularly evident in our Q1 renewal bookings and new sales. Additionally, the impact from the acquisitions and related integration expenses will be most impactful in the first 2 quarters of the year, particularly in Q1. 
For the full year, we expect the size of the portfolio to be renewed to be down in the high teens compared to the year ago period. Even excluding the impact of the large SI we renewed in Q1 last year, our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2018 is back-end-loaded. We expect this to heavily influence the linearity of bookings throughout the year. 
To provide an update on ASC 606, the upcoming revenue recognition standard, as you will see in our 10-K filing tomorrow, we expect this change in the revenue recognition standard will have a material impact on our reported financial statements. Specifically, we expect that the point in time rather than ratable recognition of license revenue will increase the variability in our quarterly reported results. However, we do not expect that the change in standard will significantly impact the way in which we recognize revenue from maintenance, SaaS and professional services contracts. And we do not expect it will meaningfully impact customer billings or cash collections from customer billings. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASC 606 on cash tax payments. In general, we do not expect the economic value of our transactions to change as a result of ASC 606. We plan to adopt the ASC 606 in our first quarter of fiscal 2019, and we are continuing to evaluate the transition method we will use. 
As we work through the changes coming with ASC 606, we're also exploring ways in which we can improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business. 
In summary, we are pleased with our performance in Q4, where we met or exceeded our expectations across most financial metrics. As we look ahead to fiscal 2018 and beyond, we believe we're well positioned to achieve our long-term goal of sustainable growth. With that, we'll open it up for questions."

But as you can all expect, we're a business that has been growing primarily ratable, a very small amount of upfront revenue. You can see that within the SFO accounts that we have.

We think it smoothes itself out over time. The length of time is maybe somewhat debatable, but I think that's what we're in the process of really sizing here. And what we're looking at are really looking for metrics that we'll be able to add to the top line reported numbers to try and give a sense of the continuity of the business as we move through time. That said, when we go back and we take a look at our ability to bill our customers and collect cash from our customers, we don't see anything there. And quite frankly, we are not making changes to our contractual relationships to our customer. The customer is at the center of our business, and we don't think it's right to go and impact the customers for changes that are being driven by accounting.

Well, first, we didn't naturally pull any deals forward in Q4 so it was pretty much standard practice. Nothing outstanding or nothing special there. The new business inside the renewal, it's just a function of the quality of the products. I think we have almost every one of our products, either up in the Magic Quadrant or in the highest ranking of our Top 8 new focused products. So those products are very attractive to our customer base, and we have a sales team that intimately understands these customers, especially the large ones, John, as you all know. And having great products being sold into -- with those renewals, it was bigger than we probably anticipated. But I would credit that with the quality of the products and the interesting nature of the solutions and how the solutions work together. We also have uptick in volume in sales outside of the renewal portfolio. So more deals. But if you think about how the market is buying, it is try and buy, it is land and expand. So you're going to see more transaction volume. I think it was the biggest transaction volume we've ever had for net new clients, but the size of the transactions are relatively small compared to what we would sell into the renewal base. And I think over time, the land and expand, those now are footprints for expand. Kieran, maybe you have a thought on that as well?"

Well, if I had my way in the world, what I'd love to do is by just these acquisitions that we made. We're very excited about them. But as you know, acquisitions take work and I've always preferred, given my choice, to do smaller acquisitions in the $50 million to $80 million range that have good base technology that needs organic engineering from us to get those products to scale and then put it through our marketing and distribution engine. Unfortunately, we don't get to choose how these things work. If you take a look at Automic, for example, that was a 2-year courting period, and it finally came to conclusion. It just so happened that Veracode, which we've been looking at for a long period of time, that happened in the relatively near timeframe to Automic. Given my choice, I would have rather spread those out over time. But when you have an opportunity to get properties like that at the price that we feel is right for value, you want to be able to execute.

So when we're talking to customers, they might only want to buy one product but they can see the vision of how these products work together. Continuous Delivery, for example, you can buy just one product in Continuous Delivery. But if you think about how you're going to evolve your digital footprint over time and build net new innovation and get it to market quickly, you can see as your own internal processes improve, how CA products that work together with little to no integration cost will streamline your ability to turn yourself into a software company. So we kind of call this whole package together the software factory. And as we start putting these elements together, I think what's happening is customers are starting to envision their business in the context of being a software company, and we kind of fit the mold really well there. So it's not any one thing. It's great sales execution supported by great product with a marketing team that's really helping tell a much broader, more sophisticated story. And Kieran, maybe you can answer the back part."

I think, when we take a look at new sales, we have more wind in our sails than we've had in the past, especially on the organic piece. A lot of our new sales are land and expand. And coming out of Q3 and Q4 with a lot of land deals, that gives us an opportunity to expand and that will all show up as organic. And with a lot of the new product introductions that we have coupled with this notion of getting these products to work together, we become much more competitive against single-product companies as we're starting to tell our story because at the end of the day, most of these companies are not thinking about just one product to solve one problem. They're trying to orchestrate a digital remastering of their business. And in order to do that, you're going to need multiple products. Very few companies have multiple products that can work together as well as having those products in their portfolio. So we feel somewhat bullish that we're going to be able to get the organic growth engine moving and have that growing consistently.

We will not respond to any questions about rumored M&A transactions or speculate about future transactions. 
Now turning to our first quarter performance. I am pleased that the momentum from fiscal year 2017 continued into our first fiscal quarter. Revenue, operating margin, earnings and CFFO all came in above our expectations. Following strong performance in fiscal 2017, our first quarter revenue and earnings results have given us a great start to the new year. Our Q1 performance increases our confidence, and we are very pleased to be in a position to raise our fiscal 2018 guidance. 
The upside relative to our expectations was driven largely by better than anticipated performance from our recent acquisitions as well as continued discipline around expense control. As expected, all of our bookings-related metrics, including new sales, were significantly impacted by the very difficult compare relative to the year-ago period. Recall that in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we renewed a large system integrator early at the customer's request. It's worth mentioning that even outside of the large SI, our renewal portfolio in the quarter was smaller than in the year-ago period. While new sales were down because of this dynamic, total new sales, Enterprise Solutions new sales and organic Enterprise Solutions new sales all outperformed the year-over-year decline in the renewal portfolio. Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the mid-90s. 
Mainframe new sales were particularly impacted by the difficult year-over-year compare. That said, we are very pleased with the continued strong performance from newer products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence. 
The pivot we have made towards more of a solutions-based sale is gaining traction as we are now more succinctly articulating our ability to help customers [indiscernible] specific challenges. Our focus on quality, our 0 defect policy and our SKUs simplification efforts with our Mainframe business unit reflect our ongoing commitment to drive continuous improvement. 
The investments we are making in customer experience and customer success has consistently increased CA's Net Promoter Score, or NPS, an industry standard measure of customer loyalty. In Q1, CA's NPS score improved dramatically compared to the year-ago period. The percentage of customers that consider CA to be a strategic partner increased, our customer satisfaction scores continue to rise and customers are rating our product quality higher. 
Leading industry analysts are also recognizing CA's innovative product development and strong ability to execute. In the quarter, CA was positioned as a leader in the June 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for access management worldwide. The report evaluated CA's broad Identity and Access Management portfolio along with the company's ability to execute and completeness of vision. CA was also named a leader in the May 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for project portfolio management worldwide. The report evaluated CA project and portfolio management and position CA highest in the leader's quadrant for Ability to Execute. Also in the quarter, CA was named a leader in the April 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for enterprise Agile planning tools. This report evaluated CA Agile Central, an enterprise class platform purpose built for scaling Agile development practices. This recognition is great validation of the work our development teams are doing every day. 
In the quarter, our API Management team, which delivered very strong new sales growth, released new versions of API developer portal and API Management SaaS. By integrating the data analytics engine that exited the CA Accelerator, our VC-like technology incubator, the total cost of ownership is lowered. Its single, cloud native code base enables same-day delivery for SaaS, hybrid cloud and on-premise versions. The team also launched a micro services solution to help developers and enterprise architects create and deploy micro services and manage the APIs that connect and orchestrate micro services. Docker container deployment options are now available across a number of products within the API Management portfolio, and expanded integrations have been made across CA's product portfolio to address management, security and advanced monitoring of APIs for modern architectures across any enterprise or cloud environment. 
Now turning to our recent acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with the rate and pace of integration and the Q1 performance of both Automic and Veracode. This upside relative to our expectations drove better-than-expected performance for CA overall in our fiscal first quarter. Today, the Automic team has already built integrations across a number of CA products, including Agile Central, Continuous Delivery director, Service Desk, test data manager, BlazeMeter, and Service Virtualization. There will be more to come. Campaigns are now underway to promote these solutions to both historical Automic customers and historical CA customers to leverage existing relationships and cross sell. 
The response we've seen in these early days is very encouraging. The Automic platform integrated across CA's portfolio is highly synergistic and has the opportunity to create tremendous value. Similarly, the Veracode development team has been working very closely with its CA counterparts to further build out its platform to complement CA's portfolio and accelerate volume across the Veracode platform. The strategic alignment with the Veracode acquisition is ideal as it sits squarely at the intersection between DevOps and Security. We are very happy with the progress made so far, and we're thrilled by the opportunities that lie ahead. 
After making some minor tweaks to the sales organization at the beginning of the quarter, we did not see any meaningful consequence of the sales productivity. As expected, new sales for the enterprise sales group, formerly referred to as our Platinum sales team plus our largest named customer group, declined year-over-year due to the large SI that renewed in the year-ago period. New sales for the enterprise customer group were significantly impacted by Mainframe capacity. We are pleased that both the public sector and the global Commercial accounts grew new sales at a healthy clip. 
As we've said in the past, we are an agile organization. Following the pivot we made in the sales organization last quarter, we are actively looking for opportunities to improve the way in which we operate. We are wholly committed to the concept of continuous improvement and are convinced that we can drive even stronger profitability and cash flow in the years ahead. 
I'd also like to be the first to invite you to CA World in Las Vegas. It's a great opportunity to see the breadth of our product portfolio, talk to our customers and spend time with the broader executive team. We will host an analyst event there on November 15. We hope to see many of you there. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance and our ability to take our full year guidance higher. As the momentum from the very strong fiscal Q4 and fiscal year 2017 has continued into the early part of fiscal 2018, we have increased confidence that these positive data points are beginning to form a trend. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported, unless otherwise indicated. 
This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As Mike mentioned, overall, we were very pleased with our fiscal first quarter performance. Revenue, operating margin, EPS and CFFO all came in above our expectations. 
As noted on our last quarter's earnings call, we faced a very difficult compare in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the renewal of a large transaction with a system integrator in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This was particularly evident in all of our bookings-related metrics, including new sales in the quarter. Renewal portfolio size and duration heavily influenced booking metrics, given the opportunity renewals provide to generate new product sales. 
Q1 total new sales were down in the mid-20s, and organic new sales were down in the mid-30s. Excluding the impact of the large SI, total new sales were up approximately 10%, and organic new sales were down in the high single digits. Total organic new sales, excluding the large SI, were impacted by the lighter renewal portfolio compared to the year-ago period and commensurate lower Mainframe capacity. The total renewal portfolio was down in the high 50s compared to the year-ago period. As we have stated in our prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. As Mike mentioned, even excluding the large SI, the size of the renewal portfolio was lower by approximately 30% as reported and high 20s in constant currency. Our renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-90s percent range. 
Organic new sales declined year-over-year across all regions due to the lighter renewal portfolio in the quarter compounded by the large SI renewal in the year-ago period. Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were down in the mid-50s. Mainframe new sales were negatively impacted by the size of the renewal portfolio and related capacity sales in the period. Nevertheless, we are very pleased with the ongoing strength of our organically developed Mainframe products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence, both of which contributed to Mainframe new product sales in the quarter. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales were down in the low single digits and organically were down in the low 20s. Excluding the impact from the large SI, organic Enterprise Solutions new sales were up slightly in the quarter in spite of the lighter renewal portfolio. We believe this dynamic demonstrates the recent improvements we've made both from a product go-to-market perspective are beginning to materialize. 
As Mike mentioned, the recent acquisitions of Automic and Veracode performed very well in the quarter and exceeded our expectations. We are very pleased by the rate and pace of both product and operational integrations and are enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead for both acquisitions. 
Total revenue for the first quarter was $1.025 billion, up 3% as reported and up 4% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 6 points to total revenue growth in the quarter. 
From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 12% both as reported and in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency, in-line with our longer-term expectation for the overall Mainframe market. 
Services revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. As our solutions have become easier to install, deploy and manage, by design, our Services revenue has been impacted. That said, we believe the rate of decline in Services revenue will begin to abate in the second half of the year. 
Total revenue backlog was up 2%, while current revenue backlog improved 6%, both as reported and in constant currency. Around 4% of the current backlog increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. The remaining 2% was driven by organic factors, including the size of the renewal portfolio coming due in the next 12 months. 
As we've said on prior earnings calls, we expect that current revenue backlog will grow with more consistency after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. 
Q1 GAAP operating margin was 26%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. Segment operating margin in the quarter was [ 65% ] for Mainframe Solutions, 8% for Enterprise Solutions and 1% for Services. 
In the quarter, Enterprise Solutions margins were impacted by acquisition-related factors. Mainframe margins came in above our longer-term target. This reflects company-wide efforts to decrease corporate level expenses that result in generally improved margins across all segments as well as the revenue mix shift and associated expenses to the Enterprise Solutions segment. 
Our Q1 GAAP tax rate was 25%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 28%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.42, down 11% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was [ $0.61 ] down 5% as reported and down 3% in constant currency. 
Our Q1 CFFO was $298 million, up 54% as reported and up 52% in constant currency. The improvement in CFFO is primarily attributable to single installment cash payments, which were $194 million in the quarter and up meaningfully over the prior year. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $44 million in net cash. We paid $107 million in dividends in the quarter. We did not execute any share repurchases in the quarter. As such, we have [ $650 million ] remaining of our original [ $750 million ] share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect that we will at least offset dilution with our share repurchase program. 
With regard to ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard that we intend to adopt in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019, you will see in our 10-Q filing tomorrow that we currently plan to use the modified retrospective transition method. Additionally, as we mentioned last quarter, we are simultaneously considering ways in which to improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2017. No additional material acquisitions are assumed in our guidance. Given the continued momentum and the outperformance of most key metrics relative to our expectations in the first quarter, we are pleased to raise our guidance for the full year. For the full year, we now expect total revenue to increase by approximately 4%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.20 billion to $4.23 billion and compares to our previous guidance of up 2% to 3% as reported and up 3% to 4% in constant currency. 
In terms of revenue linearity throughout the year, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in constant currency will be between 3% and 4% in the first half of the fiscal year, with the second half of the year average in constant currency between 4% and 5%. We expect our full year GAAP operating margin to be between 26% and 27% and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36% and 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. We expect our GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease 8% to 5%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76 and compares to our previous guidance of down 10% to 7% as reported and down 8% to 6% in constant currency. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be down 2% to flat, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48, and compares to our previous guidance of down 5% to 3% as reported and down 4% to 2% in constant currency. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be up 1% to 5% as reported and flat to up 4% in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.09 billion to $1.14 billion and compares to our previous guidance of down 2% to up 2% both as reported and in constant currency. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

Some of them have become public and we welcome them to the ongoing issues of being public, which means you have to be very specific about what your product does and you can't really expand -- extrapolate the performance of your products. Having said that, we spent an awful lot of time on R&D. And if you take a look at various analyst reports, we're in the upper quadrant in every aspect of ability to perform, ability to execute as well as the leadership position with respect to innovation. The ones that I would call out in particular with respect to Security is our Privileged Identity Management. As you've mentioned, Michael, this is an extraordinarily important piece of technology. We think we have a competitive edge with respect to product functionality and, most importantly, product scale. One of the reasons why we win so much with that product is we have an unbelievable reference base, and the references we have are very large multinational huge deployments. So when it comes to scale and the functionality required to scale, I think you see us at the top tier. The other area is an area that we've been dominating for an awful long time, and that's the whole concept for single sign on. We also launched a product that not only does single sign on for on-prem, but we have single sign on in the cloud. So this puts us in a unique position to really pay attention to customers and what customers want, whether they want to be managing that single sign on or that Identity management solution holistically in their own data centers, whether they want to be managing it in the cloud or in many cases, what we're seeing is a hybrid environment, where they'll use our product both in the cloud and on-prem depending on the usage and what that application is doing and the Security in and around that application.

We will not respond to any questions about rumored M&A transactions or speculate about future transactions. 
Now turning to our first quarter performance. I am pleased that the momentum from fiscal year 2017 continued into our first fiscal quarter. Revenue, operating margin, earnings and CFFO all came in above our expectations. Following strong performance in fiscal 2017, our first quarter revenue and earnings results have given us a great start to the new year. Our Q1 performance increases our confidence, and we are very pleased to be in a position to raise our fiscal 2018 guidance. 
The upside relative to our expectations was driven largely by better-than-anticipated performance from our recent acquisitions as well as continued discipline around expense control. As expected, all of our bookings-related metrics, including new sales, were significantly impacted by the very difficult compare relative to the year-ago period. Recall that in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we renewed a large system integrator early at the customer's request. It's worth mentioning that even outside of the large SI, our renewal portfolio in the quarter was smaller than in the year-ago period. While new sales were down because of this dynamic, total new sales, Enterprise Solutions new sales and organic Enterprise Solutions new sales all outperformed the year-over-year decline in the renewal portfolio. Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the mid-90s. 
Mainframe new sales were particularly impacted by the difficult year-over-year compare. That said, we are very pleased with the continued strong performance from newer products, like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence. 
The pivot we have made towards more of a solutions-based sale is gaining traction as we are now more succinctly articulating our ability to help customers solve specific challenges. Our focus on quality, our zero defect policy and our SKU simplification efforts with our Mainframe business unit reflect our ongoing commitment to drive continuous improvement. 
The investments we are making in customer experience and customer success has consistently increased CA's Net Promoter Score, or NPS, an industry standard measure of customer loyalty. In Q1, CA's NPS score improved dramatically compared to the year-ago period. The percentage of customers that consider CA to be a strategic partner increased, our customer satisfaction scores continue to rise and customers are rating our product quality higher. 
Leading industry analysts are also recognizing CA's innovative product development and strong ability to execute. In the quarter, CA was positioned as a leader in the June 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide. The report evaluated CA's broad identity and Access Management portfolio along with the company's ability to execute and completeness of vision. CA was also named a leader in the May 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Project Portfolio Management, Worldwide. The report evaluated CA Project and Portfolio Management and positioned CA highest in the leaders quadrant for Ability to Execute. Also in the quarter, CA was named a leader in the April 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Agile Planning Tools. This report evaluated CA Agile Central, an enterprise class platform purpose-built for scaling agile development practices. This recognition is great validation of the work our development teams are doing every day. 
In the quarter, our API Management team, which delivered very strong new sales growth, released new versions of API Developer Portal and API Management SaaS. By integrating the data analytics engine that exited the CA Accelerator, our VC-like technology incubator, the total cost of ownership is lowered. Its single, cloud-native code base enables same-day delivery for SaaS, hybrid cloud and on-premise versions. The team also launched a Microservices Solution to help developers and enterprise architects create and deploy Microservices and manage the APIs that connect and orchestrate Microservices. Docker container deployment options are now available across a number of products within the API Management portfolio, and expanded integrations have been made across CA's product portfolio to address management, security and advanced monitoring of APIs for modern architectures across any enterprise or cloud environment. 
Now turning to our recent acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with the rate and pace of integration and the Q1 performance of both Automic and Veracode. This upside relative to our expectations drove better-than-expected performance for CA overall in our fiscal first quarter. To date, the Automic team has already built integrations across a number of CA products, including Agile Central, Continuous Delivery Director, Service Desk, Test Data Manager, BlazeMeter and Service Virtualization. There will be more to come. Campaigns are now under way to promote these solutions to both historical Automic customers and historical CA customers to leverage existing relationships and cross sell. 
The response we've seen in these early days is very encouraging. The Automic platform integrated across CA's portfolio is highly synergistic and has the opportunity to create tremendous value. Similarly, the Veracode development team has been working very closely with its CA counterparts to further build out its platform to complement CA's portfolio and accelerate volume across the Veracode platform. The strategic alignment with the Veracode acquisition is ideal as it sits squarely at the intersection between DevOps and Security. We are very happy with the progress made so far, and we're thrilled by the opportunities that lie ahead. 
After making some minor tweaks to the sales organization at the beginning of the quarter, we did not see any meaningful consequences to sales productivity. As expected, new sales for the Enterprise sales group, formerly referred to as our Platinum sales team plus our largest Named customer group, declined year-over-year due to the large SI that renewed in the year-ago period. New sales for the Enterprise customer group were significantly impacted by Mainframe capacity. We are pleased that both the public sector and the global commercial accounts grew new sales at a healthy clip. 
As we've said in the past, we are an agile organization. Following the pivot we made in the sales organization last quarter, we are actively looking for opportunities to improve the way in which we operate. We are wholly committed to the concept of continuous improvement and are convinced that we can drive even stronger profitability and cash flow in the years ahead. 
I'd also like to be the first to invite you to CA World in Las Vegas. It's a great opportunity to see the breadth of our product portfolio, talk to our customers and spend time with the broader executive team. We will host an analyst event there on November 15. We hope to see many of you there. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance and our ability to take our full year guidance higher. As the momentum from the very strong fiscal Q4 and fiscal year 2017 has continued into the early part of fiscal 2018, we have increased confidence that these positive data points are beginning to form a trend. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As Mike mentioned, overall, we were very pleased with our fiscal first quarter performance. Revenue, operating margin, EPS and CFFO all came in above our expectations. 
As noted on our last quarter's earnings call, we faced a very difficult compare in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the renewal of a large transaction with a system integrator in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This was particularly evident in all of our bookings-related metrics, including new sales in the quarter. Renewal portfolio size and duration heavily influenced booking metrics, given the opportunity renewals provide to generate new product sales. 
Q1 total new sales were down in the mid-20s, and organic new sales were down in the mid-30s. Excluding the impact of the large SI, total new sales were up approximately 10%, and organic new sales were down in the high single digits. Total organic new sales, excluding the large SI, were impacted by the lighter renewal portfolio compared to the year-ago period and commensurate lower Mainframe capacity. The total renewal portfolio was down in the high 50s compared to the year-ago period. As we have stated in our prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. As Mike mentioned, even excluding the large SI, the size of the renewal portfolio was lower by approximately 30% as reported and high 20s in constant currency. Our renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-90s percent range. 
Organic new sales declined year-over-year across all regions due to the lighter renewal portfolio in the quarter compounded by the large SI renewal in the year-ago period. Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were down in the mid-50s. Mainframe new sales were negatively impacted by the size of the renewal portfolio and related capacity sales in the period. Nevertheless, we are very pleased with the ongoing strength of our organically developed Mainframe products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence, both of which contributed to Mainframe new product sales in the quarter. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales were down in the low single digits and organically were down in the low 20s. Excluding the impact from the large SI, organic Enterprise Solutions new sales were up slightly in the quarter in spite of the lighter renewal portfolio. We believe this dynamic demonstrates the recent improvements we've made, both from a product and go-to-market perspective, are beginning to materialize. 
As Mike mentioned, the recent acquisitions of Automic and Veracode performed very well in the quarter and exceeded our expectations. We are very pleased by the rate and pace of both product and operational integrations and are enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead for both acquisitions. 
Total revenue for the first quarter was $1.025 billion, up 3% as reported and up 4% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 6 points to total revenue growth in the quarter. 
From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 12% both as reported and in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency, in line with our longer-term expectation for the overall Mainframe market. 
Services revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. As our solutions have become easier to install, deploy and manage, by design, our Services revenue has been impacted. That said, we believe the rate of decline in Services revenue will begin to abate in the second half of the year. 
Total revenue backlog was up 2%, while current revenue backlog improved 6%, both as reported and in constant currency. Around 4% of the current backlog increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. The remaining 2% was driven by organic factors, including the size of the renewal portfolio coming due in the next 12 months. 
As we've said on prior earnings calls, we expect that current revenue backlog will grow with more consistency after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. 
Q1 GAAP operating margin was 26%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. Segment operating margin in the quarter was 65% for Mainframe Solutions, 8% for Enterprise Solutions and 1% for Services. 
In the quarter, Enterprise Solutions margins were impacted by acquisition-related factors. Mainframe margins came in above our longer-term target. This reflects company-wide efforts to decrease corporate-level expenses that result in generally improved margins across all segments as well as the revenue mix shift and associated expenses to the Enterprise Solutions segment. 
Our Q1 GAAP tax rate was 25%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 28%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.42, down 11% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.61, down 5% as reported and down 3% in constant currency. 
Our Q1 CFFO was $298 million, up 54% as reported and up 52% in constant currency. The improvement in CFFO is primarily attributable to single-installment cash payments, which were $194 million in the quarter and up meaningfully over the prior year. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $44 million in net cash. We paid $107 million in dividends in the quarter. We did not execute any share repurchases in the quarter. As such, we have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect that we will at least offset dilution with our share repurchase program. 
With regard to ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard that we intend to adopt in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019, you will see in our 10-Q filing tomorrow that we currently plan to use the modified retrospective transition method. Additionally, as we mentioned last quarter, we are simultaneously considering ways in which to improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2017. No additional material acquisitions are assumed in our guidance. Given the continued momentum and the outperformance of most key metrics relative to our expectations in the first quarter, we are pleased to raise our guidance for the full year. 
For the full year, we now expect total revenue to increase by approximately 4%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.20 billion to $4.23 billion and compares to our previous guidance of up 2% to 3% as reported and up 3% to 4% in constant currency. 
In terms of revenue linearity throughout the year, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in constant currency will be between 3% and 4% in the first half of the fiscal year, with the second half of the year average in constant currency between 4% and 5%. We expect our full year GAAP operating margin to be between 26% and 27% and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36% and 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. We expect our GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease 8% to 5%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76 and compares to our previous guidance of down 10% to 7% as reported and down 8% to 6% in constant currency. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be down 2% to flat, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48, and compares to our previous guidance of down 5% to 3% as reported and down 4% to 2% in constant currency. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be up 1% to 5% as reported and flat to up 4% in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.09 billion to $1.14 billion and compares to our previous guidance of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

Yes, Security is a big focus for us. It's a big part of our portfolio. And we are highly, highly competitive in that space. There's a lot of players in that space. Some of them have become public and we welcome them to the ongoing issues of being public, which means you have to be very specific about what your product does and you can't really -- extrapolate the performance of your products. Having said that, we spend an awful lot of time on R&D. And if you take a look at various analyst reports, we're in the upper quadrant in every aspect of ability to perform, Ability to Execute as well as a leadership position with respect to innovation. The ones that I would call out in particular with respect to Security is our Privileged Identity Management. As you've mentioned, Michael, this is an extraordinarily important piece of technology. We think we have a competitive edge with respect to product functionality and, most importantly, product scale. One of the reasons why we win so much with that product is we have an unbelievable reference base, and the references we have are very large multinational huge deployments. So when it comes to scale and the functionality required to scale, I think you see us at the top tier. The other area is an area that we've been dominating for an awful long time, and that's the whole concept of Single Sign On. We also launched a product that not only does Single Sign On for on-prem, but we have Single Sign On in the cloud. So this puts us in a unique position to really pay attention to customers and what customers want, whether they want to be managing that Single Sign On or that Identity Management solution holistically in their own data centers, whether they want to be managing it in the cloud or, in many cases, what we're seeing is a hybrid environment, where they'll use our product both in the cloud and on-prem, depending on the usage and what that application is doing and the security in and around that application.

Management and the board regularly evaluate and pressure test our assumptions and consider risk-adjusted strategies to realize long-term shareholder value. We will not respond to any questions about rumored M&A transactions or speculate about future transactions. 
Now turning to our first quarter performance. I am pleased that the momentum from fiscal year 2017 continued into our first fiscal quarter. Revenue, operating margin, earnings and CFFO all came in above our expectations. Following strong performance in fiscal 2017, our first quarter revenue and earnings results have given us a great start to the new year. Our Q1 performance increases our confidence, and we are very pleased to be in a position to raise our fiscal 2018 guidance. 
The upside relative to our expectations was driven largely by better-than-anticipated performance from our recent acquisitions as well as continued discipline around expense control. As expected, all of our bookings-related metrics, including new sales, were significantly impacted by the very difficult compare relative to the year-ago period. Recall that in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we renewed a large system integrator early at the customer's request. It's worth mentioning that even outside of the large SI, our renewal portfolio in the quarter was smaller than in the year-ago period. While new sales were down because of this dynamic, total new sales, Enterprise Solutions new sales and organic Enterprise Solutions new sales all outperformed the year-over-year decline in the renewal portfolio. Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the mid-90s. 
Mainframe new sales were particularly impacted by the difficult year-over-year compare. That said, we are very pleased with the continued strong performance from newer products, like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence. 
The pivot we have made towards more of a solutions-based sale is gaining traction as we are now more succinctly articulating our ability to help customers solve specific challenges. Our focus on quality, our zero defect policy and our SKU simplification efforts with our Mainframe business unit reflect our ongoing commitment to drive continuous improvement. 
The investments we are making in customer experience and customer success has consistently increased CA's Net Promoter Score, or NPS, an industry standard measure of customer loyalty. In Q1, CA's NPS score improved dramatically compared to the year-ago period. The percentage of customers that consider CA to be a strategic partner increased, our customer satisfaction scores continue to rise and customers are rating our product quality higher. 
Leading industry analysts are also recognizing CA's innovative product development and strong ability to execute. In the quarter, CA was positioned as a leader in the June 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide. The report evaluated CA's broad identity and Access Management portfolio along with the company's ability to execute and completeness of vision. CA was also named a leader in the May 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Project Portfolio Management, Worldwide. The report evaluated CA Project and Portfolio Management and positioned CA highest in the leaders quadrant for Ability to Execute. Also in the quarter, CA was named a leader in the April 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Agile Planning Tools. This report evaluated CA Agile Central, an enterprise class platform purpose-built for scaling agile development practices. This recognition is great validation of the work our development teams are doing every day. 
In the quarter, our API Management team, which delivered very strong new sales growth, released new versions of API Developer Portal and API Management SaaS. By integrating the data analytics engine that exited the CA Accelerator, our VC-like technology incubator, the total cost of ownership is lowered. Its single, cloud-native code base enables same-day delivery for SaaS, hybrid cloud and on-premise versions. The team also launched a Microservices Solution to help developers and enterprise architects create and deploy Microservices and manage the APIs that connect and orchestrate Microservices. Docker container deployment options are now available across a number of products within the API Management portfolio, and expanded integrations have been made across CA's product portfolio to address management, security and advanced monitoring of APIs for modern architectures across any enterprise or cloud environment. 
Now turning to our recent acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with the rate and pace of integration and the Q1 performance of both Automic and Veracode. This upside relative to our expectations drove better-than-expected performance for CA overall in our fiscal first quarter. To date, the Automic team has already built integrations across a number of CA products, including Agile Central, Continuous Delivery Director, Service Desk, Test Data Manager, BlazeMeter and Service Virtualization. There will be more to come. Campaigns are now underway to promote these solutions to both historical Automic customers and historical CA customers to leverage existing relationships and cross-sell. 
The response we've seen in these early days is very encouraging. The Automic platform integrated across CA's portfolio is highly synergistic and has the opportunity to create tremendous value. Similarly, the Veracode development team has been working very closely with its CA counterparts to further build out its platform to complement CA's portfolio and accelerate volume across the Veracode platform. The strategic alignment with the Veracode acquisition is ideal as it sits squarely at the intersection between DevOps and Security. We are very happy with the progress made so far, and we're thrilled by the opportunities that lie ahead. 
After making some minor tweaks to the sales organization at the beginning of the quarter, we did not see any meaningful consequences to sales productivity. As expected, new sales for the Enterprise sales group, formerly referred to as our Platinum sales team, plus our largest Named customer group declined year-over-year due to the large SI that renewed in the year-ago period. New sales for the Enterprise customer group were significantly impacted by Mainframe capacity. We are pleased that both the public sector and the global commercial accounts grew new sales at a healthy clip. 
As we've said in the past, we are an agile organization. Following the pivot we made in the sales organization last quarter, we are actively looking for opportunities to improve the way in which we operate. We are wholly committed to the concept of continuous improvement and are convinced that we can drive even stronger profitability and cash flow in the years ahead. 
I'd also like to be the first to invite you to CA World in Las Vegas. It's a great opportunity to see the breadth of our product portfolio, talk to our customers and spend time with the broader executive team. We will host an analyst event there on November 15. We hope to see many of you there. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance and our ability to take our full year guidance higher. As the momentum from the very strong fiscal Q4 and fiscal year 2017 has continued into the early part of fiscal 2018, we have increased confidence that these positive data points are beginning to form a trend. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported, unless otherwise indicated. 
This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As Mike mentioned, overall, we were very pleased with our fiscal first quarter performance. Revenue, operating margin, EPS and CFFO all came in above our expectations. 
As noted on our last quarter's earnings call, we faced a very difficult compare in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the renewal of a large transaction with a system integrator in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This was particularly evident in all of our bookings-related metrics, including new sales in the quarter. Renewal portfolio size and duration heavily influenced booking metrics, given the opportunity renewals provide to generate new product sales. 
Q1 total new sales were down in the mid-20s, and organic new sales were down in the mid-30s. Excluding the impact of the large SI, total new sales were up approximately 10%, and organic new sales were down in the high single digits. Total organic new sales, excluding the large SI, were impacted by the lighter renewal portfolio compared to the year-ago period and commensurate lower Mainframe capacity. The total renewal portfolio was down in the high 50s compared to the year-ago period. As we have stated in our prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. As Mike mentioned, even excluding the large SI, the size of the renewal portfolio was lower by approximately 30% as reported and high 20s in constant currency. Our renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-90s percent range. 
Organic new sales declined year-over-year across all regions due to the lighter renewal portfolio in the quarter compounded by the large SI renewal in the year-ago period. Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were down in the mid-50s. Mainframe new sales were negatively impacted by the size of the renewal portfolio and related capacity sales in the period. Nevertheless, we are very pleased with the ongoing strength of our organically developed Mainframe products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence, both of which contributed to Mainframe new product sales in the quarter. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales were down in the low single digits and organically were down in the low 20s. Excluding the impact from the large SI, organic Enterprise Solutions new sales were up slightly in the quarter in spite of the lighter renewal portfolio. We believe this dynamic demonstrates the recent improvements we've made, both from a product and go-to-market perspective, are beginning to materialize. 
As Mike mentioned, the recent acquisitions of Automic and Veracode performed very well in the quarter and exceeded our expectations. We are very pleased by the rate and pace of both product and operational integrations and are enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead for both acquisitions. 
Total revenue for the first quarter was $1.025 billion, up 3% as reported and up 4% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 6 points to total revenue growth in the quarter. 
From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 12% both as reported and in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency, in line with our longer-term expectation for the overall Mainframe market. 
Services revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. As our solutions have become easier to install, deploy and manage, by design, our Services revenue has been impacted. That said, we believe the rate of decline in Services revenue will begin to abate in the second half of the year. 
Total revenue backlog was up 2%, while current revenue backlog improved 6%, both as reported and in constant currency. Around 4% of the current backlog increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. The remaining 2% was driven by organic factors, including the size of the renewal portfolio coming due in the next 12 months. 
As we've said on prior earnings calls, we expect the current revenue backlog will grow with more consistency after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. 
Q1 GAAP operating margin was 26%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. Segment operating margin in the quarter was 65% for Mainframe Solutions, 8% for Enterprise Solutions and 1% for Services. 
In the quarter, Enterprise Solutions margins were impacted by acquisition-related factors. Mainframe margins came in above our longer-term target. This reflects company-wide efforts to decrease corporate-level expenses that result in generally improved margins across all segments as well as the revenue mix shift and associated expenses to the Enterprise Solutions segment. 
Our Q1 GAAP tax rate was 25%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 28%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.42, down 11% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.61, down 5% as reported and down 3% in constant currency. 
Our Q1 CFFO was $298 million, up 54% as reported and up 52% in constant currency. The improvement in CFFO is primarily attributable to single-installment cash payments, which were $194 million in the quarter and up meaningfully over the prior year. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $44 million in net cash. We paid $107 million in dividends in the quarter. We did not execute any share repurchases in the quarter. As such, we have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect that we will at least offset dilution with our share repurchase program. 
With regard to ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard that we intend to adopt in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019, you will see in our 10-Q filing tomorrow that we currently plan to use the modified retrospective transition method. Additionally, as we mentioned last quarter, we are simultaneously considering ways in which to improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2017. No additional material acquisitions are assumed in our guidance. Given the continued momentum and the outperformance of most key metrics relative to our expectations in the first quarter, we are pleased to raise our guidance for the full year. 
For the full year, we now expect total revenue to increase by approximately 4%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.20 billion to $4.23 billion and compares to our previous guidance of up 2% to 3% as reported and up 3% to 4% in constant currency. 
In terms of revenue linearity throughout the year, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in constant currency will be between 3% and 4% in the first half of the fiscal year, with the second half of the year average in constant currency between 4% and 5%. We expect our full year GAAP operating margin to be between 26% and 27% and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36% and 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. We expect our GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease 8% to 5%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76 and compares to our previous guidance of down 10% to 7% as reported and down 8% to 6% in constant currency. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be down 2% to flat, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48, and compares to our previous guidance of down 5% to 3% as reported and down 4% to 2% in constant currency. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be up 1% to 5% as reported and flat to up 4% in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.09 billion to $1.14 billion and compares to our previous guidance of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

I also think that, that probably had a little bit to do with some of the softness in Mainframe capacity that happened in the last quarter. With respect to anything happening in Mainframe, I think you're seeing a few things that are going our way. As both Kieran and I pointed out in our prepared remarks, we had 2 products that were organically built that are selling very well and we tend to be on the right side of competitive replacements and have been for the last several quarters."

Yes, Security is a big focus for us. It's a big part of our portfolio. And we are highly, highly competitive in that space. There's a lot of players in that space. Some of them have become public and we welcome them to the ongoing issues of being public, which means you have to be very specific about what your product does and you can't really expand -- extrapolate the performance of your products. Having said that, we spend an awful lot of time on R&D. And if you take a look at various analyst reports, we're in the upper quadrant in every aspect of ability to perform, Ability to Execute as well as a leadership position with respect to innovation. The ones that I would call out in particular with respect to Security is our Privileged Identity Management. As you've mentioned, Michael, this is an extraordinarily important piece of technology. We think we have a competitive edge with respect to product functionality and, most importantly, product scale. One of the reasons why we win so much with that product is we have an unbelievable reference base, and the references we have are very large multinational huge deployments. So when it comes to scale and the functionality required to scale, I think you see us at the top tier. The other area is an area that we've been dominating for an awful long time, and that's the whole concept of Single Sign On. We also launched a product that not only does Single Sign On for on-prem, but we have Single Sign On in the cloud. So this puts us in a unique position to really pay attention to customers and what customers want, whether they want to be managing that Single Sign On or that Identity Management solution holistically in their own data centers, whether they want to be managing it in the cloud or, in many cases, what we're seeing is a hybrid environment, where they'll use our product both in the cloud and on-prem, depending on the usage and what that application is doing and the security in and around that application.

Now turning to our first quarter performance. I am pleased that the momentum from fiscal year 2017 continued into our first fiscal quarter. Revenue, operating margin, earnings and CFFO all came in above our expectations. Following strong performance in fiscal 2017, our first quarter revenue and earnings results have given us a great start to the new year. Our Q1 performance increases our confidence, and we are very pleased to be in a position to raise our fiscal 2018 guidance. 
The upside relative to our expectations was driven largely by better-than-anticipated performance from our recent acquisitions as well as continued discipline around expense control. As expected, all of our bookings-related metrics, including new sales, were significantly impacted by the very difficult compare relative to the year-ago period. Recall that in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we renewed a large system integrator early at the customer's request. It's worth mentioning that even outside of the large SI, our renewal portfolio in the quarter was smaller than in the year-ago period. While new sales were down because of this dynamic, total new sales, Enterprise Solutions new sales and organic Enterprise Solutions new sales all outperformed the year-over-year decline in the renewal portfolio. Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the mid-90s. 
Mainframe new sales were particularly impacted by the difficult year-over-year compare. That said, we are very pleased with the continued strong performance from newer products, like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence. 
The pivot we have made towards more of a solutions-based sale is gaining traction as we are now more succinctly articulating our ability to help customers solve specific challenges. Our focus on quality, our zero defect policy and our SKU simplification efforts with our Mainframe business unit reflect our ongoing commitment to drive continuous improvement. 
The investments we are making in customer experience and customer success has consistently increased CA's Net Promoter Score, or NPS, an industry standard measure of customer loyalty. In Q1, CA's NPS score improved dramatically compared to the year-ago period. The percentage of customers that consider CA to be a strategic partner increased, our customer satisfaction scores continue to rise and customers are rating our product quality higher. 
Leading industry analysts are also recognizing CA's innovative product development and strong ability to execute. In the quarter, CA was positioned as a leader in the June 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide. The report evaluated CA's broad identity and Access Management portfolio along with the company's ability to execute and completeness of vision. CA was also named a leader in the May 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Project Portfolio Management, Worldwide. The report evaluated CA Project and Portfolio Management and positioned CA highest in the leaders quadrant for Ability to Execute. Also in the quarter, CA was named a leader in the April 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Agile Planning Tools. This report evaluated CA Agile Central, an enterprise class platform purpose-built for scaling agile development practices. This recognition is great validation of the work our development teams are doing every day. 
In the quarter, our API Management team, which delivered very strong new sales growth, released new versions of API Developer Portal and API Management SaaS. By integrating the data analytics engine that exited the CA Accelerator, our VC-like technology incubator, the total cost of ownership is lowered. Its single, cloud-native code base enables same-day delivery for SaaS, hybrid cloud and on-premise versions. The team also launched a Microservices Solution to help developers and enterprise architects create and deploy Microservices and manage the APIs that connect and orchestrate Microservices. Docker container deployment options are now available across a number of products within the API Management portfolio, and expanded integrations have been made across CA's product portfolio to address management, security and advanced monitoring of APIs for modern architectures across any enterprise or cloud environment. 
Now turning to our recent acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with the rate and pace of integration and the Q1 performance of both Automic and Veracode. This upside relative to our expectations drove better-than-expected performance for CA overall in our fiscal first quarter. To date, the Automic team has already built integrations across a number of CA products, including Agile Central, Continuous Delivery Director, Service Desk, Test Data Manager, BlazeMeter and Service Virtualization. There will be more to come. Campaigns are now underway to promote these solutions to both historical Automic customers and historical CA customers to leverage existing relationships and cross-sell. 
The response we've seen in these early days is very encouraging. The Automic platform integrated across CA's portfolio is highly synergistic and has the opportunity to create tremendous value. Similarly, the Veracode development team has been working very closely with its CA counterparts to further build out its platform to complement CA's portfolio and accelerate volume across the Veracode platform. The strategic alignment with the Veracode acquisition is ideal as it sits squarely at the intersection between DevOps and Security. We are very happy with the progress made so far, and we're thrilled by the opportunities that lie ahead. 
After making some minor tweaks to the sales organization at the beginning of the quarter, we did not see any meaningful consequences to sales productivity. As expected, new sales for the Enterprise sales group, formerly referred to as our Platinum sales team, plus our largest Named customer group declined year-over-year due to the large SI that renewed in the year-ago period. New sales for the Enterprise customer group were significantly impacted by Mainframe capacity. We are pleased that both the public sector and the global commercial accounts grew new sales at a healthy clip. 
As we've said in the past, we are an agile organization. Following the pivot we made in the sales organization last quarter, we are actively looking for opportunities to improve the way in which we operate. We are wholly committed to the concept of continuous improvement and are convinced that we can drive even stronger profitability and cash flow in the years ahead. 
I'd also like to be the first to invite you to CA World in Las Vegas. It's a great opportunity to see the breadth of our product portfolio, talk to our customers and spend time with the broader executive team. We will host an analyst event there on November 15. We hope to see many of you there. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance and our ability to take our full year guidance higher. As the momentum from the very strong fiscal Q4 and fiscal year 2017 has continued into the early part of fiscal 2018, we have increased confidence that these positive data points are beginning to form a trend. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported, unless otherwise indicated. 
This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As Mike mentioned, overall, we were very pleased with our fiscal first quarter performance. Revenue, operating margin, EPS and CFFO all came in above our expectations. 
As noted on our last quarter's earnings call, we faced a very difficult compare in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the renewal of a large transaction with a system integrator in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This was particularly evident in all of our bookings-related metrics, including new sales in the quarter. Renewal portfolio size and duration heavily influenced booking metrics, given the opportunity renewals provide to generate new product sales. 
Q1 total new sales were down in the mid-20s, and organic new sales were down in the mid-30s. Excluding the impact of the large SI, total new sales were up approximately 10%, and organic new sales were down in the high single digits. Total organic new sales, excluding the large SI, were impacted by the lighter renewal portfolio compared to the year-ago period and commensurate lower Mainframe capacity. The total renewal portfolio was down in the high 50s compared to the year-ago period. As we have stated in our prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. As Mike mentioned, even excluding the large SI, the size of the renewal portfolio was lower by approximately 30% as reported and high 20s in constant currency. Our renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-90s percent range. 
Organic new sales declined year-over-year across all regions due to the lighter renewal portfolio in the quarter compounded by the large SI renewal in the year-ago period. Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were down in the mid-50s. Mainframe new sales were negatively impacted by the size of the renewal portfolio and related capacity sales in the period. Nevertheless, we are very pleased with the ongoing strength of our organically developed Mainframe products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence, both of which contributed to Mainframe new product sales in the quarter. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales were down in the low single digits and organically were down in the low 20s. Excluding the impact from the large SI, organic Enterprise Solutions new sales were up slightly in the quarter in spite of the lighter renewal portfolio. We believe this dynamic demonstrates the recent improvements we've made, both from a product and go-to-market perspective, are beginning to materialize. 
As Mike mentioned, the recent acquisitions of Automic and Veracode performed very well in the quarter and exceeded our expectations. We are very pleased by the rate and pace of both product and operational integrations and are enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead for both acquisitions. 
Total revenue for the first quarter was $1.025 billion, up 3% as reported and up 4% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 6 points to total revenue growth in the quarter. 
From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 12% both as reported and in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency, in line with our longer-term expectation for the overall Mainframe market. 
Services revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. As our solutions have become easier to install, deploy and manage, by design, our Services revenue has been impacted. That said, we believe the rate of decline in Services revenue will begin to abate in the second half of the year. 
Total revenue backlog was up 2%, while current revenue backlog improved 6%, both as reported and in constant currency. Around 4% of the current backlog increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. The remaining 2% was driven by organic factors, including the size of the renewal portfolio coming due in the next 12 months. 
As we've said on prior earnings calls, we expect the current revenue backlog will grow with more consistency after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. 
Q1 GAAP operating margin was 26%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. Segment operating margin in the quarter was 65% for Mainframe Solutions, 8% for Enterprise Solutions and 1% for Services. 
In the quarter, Enterprise Solutions margins were impacted by acquisition-related factors. Mainframe margins came in above our longer-term target. This reflects company-wide efforts to decrease corporate-level expenses that result in generally improved margins across all segments as well as the revenue mix shift and associated expenses to the Enterprise Solutions segment. 
Our Q1 GAAP tax rate was 25%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 28%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.42, down 11% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.61, down 5% as reported and down 3% in constant currency. 
Our Q1 CFFO was $298 million, up 54% as reported and up 52% in constant currency. The improvement in CFFO is primarily attributable to single-installment cash payments, which were $194 million in the quarter and up meaningfully over the prior year. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $44 million in net cash. We paid $107 million in dividends in the quarter. We did not execute any share repurchases in the quarter. As such, we have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect that we will at least offset dilution with our share repurchase program. 
With regard to ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard that we intend to adopt in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019, you will see in our 10-Q filing tomorrow that we currently plan to use the modified retrospective transition method. Additionally, as we mentioned last quarter, we are simultaneously considering ways in which to improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2017. No additional material acquisitions are assumed in our guidance. Given the continued momentum and the outperformance of most key metrics relative to our expectations in the first quarter, we are pleased to raise our guidance for the full year. 
For the full year, we now expect total revenue to increase by approximately 4%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.20 billion to $4.23 billion and compares to our previous guidance of up 2% to 3% as reported and up 3% to 4% in constant currency. 
In terms of revenue linearity throughout the year, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in constant currency will be between 3% and 4% in the first half of the fiscal year, with the second half of the year average in constant currency between 4% and 5%. We expect our full year GAAP operating margin to be between 26% and 27% and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36% and 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. We expect our GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease 8% to 5%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76 and compares to our previous guidance of down 10% to 7% as reported and down 8% to 6% in constant currency. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be down 2% to flat, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48, and compares to our previous guidance of down 5% to 3% as reported and down 4% to 2% in constant currency. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be up 1% to 5% as reported and flat to up 4% in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.09 billion to $1.14 billion and compares to our previous guidance of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

I also think that, that probably had a little bit to do with some of the softness in Mainframe capacity that happened in the last quarter. With respect to anything happening in Mainframe, I think you're seeing a few things that are going our way. As both Kieran and I pointed out in our prepared remarks, we had 2 products that were organically built that are selling very well and we tend to be on the right side of competitive replacements and have been for the last several quarters."

Yes, Security is a big focus for us. It's a big part of our portfolio. And we are highly, highly competitive in that space. There's a lot of players in that space. Some of them have become public and we welcome them to the ongoing issues of being public, which means you have to be very specific about what your product does and you can't really expand -- extrapolate the performance of your products. Having said that, we spend an awful lot of time on R&D. And if you take a look at various analyst reports, we're in the upper quadrant in every aspect of ability to perform, Ability to Execute as well as a leadership position with respect to innovation. The ones that I would call out in particular with respect to Security is our Privileged Identity Management. As you've mentioned, Michael, this is an extraordinarily important piece of technology. We think we have a competitive edge with respect to product functionality and, most importantly, product scale. One of the reasons why we win so much with that product is we have an unbelievable reference base, and the references we have are very large multinational huge deployments. So when it comes to scale and the functionality required to scale, I think you see us at the top tier. The other area is an area that we've been dominating for an awful long time, and that's the whole concept of Single Sign On. We also launched a product that not only does Single Sign On for on-prem, but we have Single Sign On in the cloud. So this puts us in a unique position to really pay attention to customers and what customers want, whether they want to be managing that Single Sign On or that Identity Management solution holistically in their own data centers, whether they want to be managing it in the cloud or, in many cases, what we're seeing is a hybrid environment, where they'll use our product both in the cloud and on-prem, depending on the usage and what that application is doing and the security in and around that application.

I'm pleased with the healthy operating margin and strong CFFO Growth we delivered in our second fiscal quarter. We are very pleased that the contribution from our SaaS business continues to grow at a rapid pace. T",1172,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased with the healthy operating margin and strong CFFO Growth we delivered in our second fiscal quarter. We are very pleased that the contribution from our SaaS business continues to grow at a rapid pace. Total new sales, Enterprise Solutions new sales and Mainframe new sales all outperformed the year-over-year decline in the renewal portfolio. This, combined with our revenue backlog, gives me confidence in our full year guidance. 
That said, it is not lost on me that we have work to do. Our sales execution in Q2 was disappointing and revenue came in below our expectations. In particular, velocity in sales outside of the renewal cycle of Enterprise Solutions products was short of our expectations. There are a few primary factors underlying this. First, the renewal portfolio was smaller in the second quarter than in the year ago period as expected. The lighter renewal portfolio creates a natural headwind for all of our bookings-related metrics. However, our expectation is that we should be able to consistently sell outside of our renewals regardless of the timing of the renewal portfolio. Any failure to do so erodes opportunity to recognize upfront revenue that directly ties to our quarterly revenue results. After demonstrating success in selling outside of our renewal portfolio, we got complacent. Growth in our ES freestanding new sales requires a level of sales leadership and focus across the team that did not materialize in Q2. We expect to return to a more consistent level of performance in the second half of our fiscal year. 
Another factor that impacted our Q2 organic revenue performance was the result of a conscious decision we made to prioritize new sales of the Automic automation platform. Unifying CA's organic automation solutions into an integrated automation platform negatively impacts our organic revenue in the near term, particularly in the Enterprise Solutions segment. We believe the long-term benefit to all of our stakeholders more than offsets the organic headwinds this creates in the near term. Over time, our customers will benefit from the clarity of a single platform with robust integrations across our product portfolio. For our customers, this decreases their development dollars, integration efforts and simplifies their broader IT environment. We will continue to make decisions that are in the best interest of our customers and long-term shareholders, even at the expense of near-term optics. 
We remain pleased with the strategic nature of our recent acquisitions. The importance of our Veracode acquisition, which elegantly bridges our Security portfolio to our DevOps portfolio, could not have been more evident this quarter with very well publicized recent data breaches. Security continues to be top of mind among business leaders and individuals. Looking back at the breaches that have happened in the recent past and looking ahead to GDPR or the EU's general data protection regulation, which goes into effect in May of next year, it's clear that security continues to be critically important. 
Today, there is an extraordinary amount of code that's written. This proliferation accelerates the need to ensure that code is written securely to prevent hacks and compromises that can severely impact consumers, tarnishing the reputation of corporations and their executives. Fixing faulty code earlier in the cycle with a SaaS-based tool before its released is efficient, cost-effective and is in everyone's best interest. Veracode's value proposition precisely is the sweet spot. 
When I look at our identity-centric Security portfolio, I am incredibly proud of CA's partnership with customers like NASDAQ and the state of Louisiana's Office of Technology Services. With the latter, we are implementing Identity and Access Management solutions across government agencies to further digitize and better protect state and citizen information. It is working to modernize and standardize IT Services across the state's 16 government agencies in order to streamline processes and enable engineers to more efficiently and more securely run services and applications across networks. 
In the second quarter, we announced the release of CA Privileged Access Management or CA PAM 3.0. This gives companies and organizations the ability to scale their PAM deployments across multiple departments and provides managed service providers a helpful way to manage multiple instances of the products for their customer base across platforms and infrastructures. The scalability of a PAM solution is critical to ensure organizations can address and control cyber risk coming from trusted users in any environment. Customers need to manage access across departments, geographies, heterogeneous IT environments and considerate complex architectural requirements. CA PAM supports these needs with enhanced features that enable greater control across the spectrum of user access points. 
Last month, we announced Day 1 support for IBM z14 for our key Mainframe Solutions. Our continued investment in the Mainframe and partnership with IBM helps to ensure the Mainframe remains a system of trust with its elevated level of encryption and security. In addition, our solutions, which leverage the new z14 platform, greatly decrease the risks of data breaches that can arise from the degradation of performance associated with increasing encryption needs. We are collectively providing unifying enterprise security that helps to increase an organization's compliance structure across new and existing mainframes. This is of increased importance as organizations prepare for the implementation of new regulations that focus on data privacy like GDPR. Strength in Mainframe new sales, despite a smaller renewal portfolio in the quarter was driven by our newer products, including Mainframe Operations Intelligence, Data Content Discovery and dynamic capacity intelligence. 
Across our product portfolio, we continue to earn the recognition of third-party industry analysts. CA was recently named a leader in the IDC Marketscape Worldwide Agile PPM 2017 vendor assessment, enabling adaptive planning for emerging markets, DevOps and ILT. CA was also named a leader in the Forrester Wave for Continuous Delivery and release automation Q3 2017. And CA was positioned as a leader in the 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation. We are well positioned in great markets, and our solutions are solving real problems for our customers. This feeds my optimism as I look ahead. 
In the near term, we believe we are on track to achieve our fiscal year 2018 guidance. Additionally, we are working on an ongoing plan to improve the efficiency of our OpEx spend across the organization. Longer term, we are working on a plan to drive accelerated improvement in our organic revenue trajectory. Concurrently, we are putting in place improvements to drive sustainable Growth and expand profitability over time. We are optimistic that we have a path to improve the long-term health of the company and our shareholder returns. I look forward to seeing many of you at CA World next month. Our financial analyst track will take place on November 15th. There is no better place for you to see the breadth and depth of CA's portfolio of solutions and hear firsthand from our customers how they are deploying CA solutions. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance in",1148,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. 
This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Q2 total new sales were up, mid-single digits as reported and low single digits in constant currency. And organic new sales were down approximately 10% as reported and low teens in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, while we were pleased by the continuing strong performance of our SaaS products, we were disappointed by our overall slower sales velocity in the quarter. 
The total renewal portfolio was down mid-single digits as reported and high single digits in constant currency compared to the year-ago period. As we stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Our renewal yield for the quarter was greater than 90%. 
Organic new sales declined year-over-year across all regions due to the lighter renewal portfolio in the quarter. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were up in the low 20s and were positively impacted by both product and capacity sales in the period. Specifically, we saw a strong demand for new products such as dynamic capacity intelligence, which optimizes Mainframe capacity utilization; new sales contributions from Mainframe Operations Intelligence, which embeds machine learning to improve operational performance; and Data Content Discovery, which addresses Security and compliance challenges were also drivers in the quarter. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales were down in the low single digits and organically were down approximately 20%. As mentioned, we were pleased by the performance of our work SaaS products, which continue to grow at a rapid pace in the quarter. Our recent acquisitions also contributed meaningfully to our results in the quarter. 
Total revenue for the second quarter was $1.034 billion, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 5 points to total revenue Growth in the quarter. From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 7% as reported and 6% and in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 3% in constant currency, in line with our longer-term expectations for the overall Mainframe market. Services revenue was flat as reported and in constant currency. 
Total revenue backlog was up 2% as reported and 1% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog improved 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Approximately 4% of the current backlog increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode, while the remaining balance was driven by organic factors. In general, the size of the renewal portfolio coming due in the next 12 months is a driver of our current revenue backlog. 
Q2 GAAP operating margin was 27% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Segment operating margins in the quarter was 55% for Mainframe Solutions, 10% for Enterprise Solutions and 1% for Services. 
Our Q2 GAAP tax rate was 28.7% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 28.5%. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.44, down 12% as reported and down 10% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was [ $0.62, ] down 7% as reported and down 6% in constant currency. Our Q2 CFFO was [ $37 million, ] up $90 million compared to the year-ago period. 
Single installment cash payments were $80 million in the quarter and  meaningfully over the prior year. Recall that in the year-ago period, single installments were unusually low. 
We ended the second quarter with approximately $100 million in net debt. We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $90 million worth of our shares outstanding in the quarter. We have $560 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect that we will at least offset dilution with our share repurchase program. Consistent with what we've said in the past few quarters, we'd like to provide some incremental disclosure with regard to our upcoming adoption of ASC 606. Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard under the modified retrospective method, we expect that a significant portion of deferred revenue and revenue backlog booked in accordance with the current standard, ASC 605, will not be recognized as revenue following our adoption of ASC 606. Instead, it will become part of the cumulative effect adjustment within retained earnings. 
Said another way, the license component of bookings recognized in the current standard will fall out of deferred revenue and revenue backlog. Instead, it will be captured in retained earnings on the balance sheet. As a consequence of this adjustment, we expect to see an acceleration of the timing of income taxes payable. We are still evaluating the amount and timing of those payments upon adoption and awaiting updates from regulatory agencies. As a reminder, we do not expect the new standard to significantly impact billings and cash collections from billings. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2017. No additional material acquisitions are assumed in our guidance. As a reminder, please keep in mind that our renewal portfolio for the year is heavily weighted toward the fourth fiscal quarter. Typical seasonality for CA implies bookings and revenue to be stronger in the fourth fiscal quarter as well. 
Operating margin in the third quarter will be impacted by the timing of spend related to CA World and, therefore, should be the lowest operating margin of the year. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase by approximately 5% as reported and 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.22 billion to $4.25 billion. We also expect our full year GAAP operating margin to be between 26% and 27% and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36% and 37%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. We expect our GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease by 8% to 5%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76. We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be down 2% to flat, both as reported and constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48. At end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. We expect cash flow from operations to be up 2% to 6% as reported, and flat to up 4% at constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.8 billion to $1.15 billion. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

And then you start thinking about how we look at the full year on the Mainframe. There is strong system shipments that you've seen from IBM last week, and that gives us confidence in the strength of the hardware cycle. And historically, our capacity sales lag the z Systems hardware by a few quarters. And despite the renewal portfolio headwind, Mainframe new sales, both product and capacity, were quite strong, driven by the newer products like dynamic capacity intelligence, Mainframe Operations Intelligence and the content discovery. So we are confident that the revenue declines will remain within our medium-term targets for the foreseeable future."

And then, of course, we have the seasonality of our stand-alone sales are back end-loaded, driving more upfront revenue in the second half compared to the first half. And once again, I think from an execution perspective, I think we got the attention that everybody in the company after getting to organic growth for a few quarters, [indiscernible] over the last several quarters, this is not a sometimes thing. We expect it to be an all-time thing. And I think it's given everybody a little bit result of what it takes to be excellent in selling and the products and the marketing and the whole company rallying around that motion. So it's been an opportunity for us to really evaluate what does it take to be a successful software company and consistently grow."

And as anyone who's been in software for an awful long time, when you got a very strong heritage in direct sales, it takes a while to get the channels working. When you take a look at the global system providers, I think we're doing really, really well with them. When you take a look at the system integrators, I think that's a strong spot. When you get into resellers, especially in the United States and, in some cases, outside the United States, that's an area where I'd like to see a lot more improvement. When you take a look at the point solution providers that we compete against, many of them have never had an opportunity to get out there and build a global direct sales force. And the only that they've been able to get their product to market is through distributors. So we have to help distributors understand that we're a better play, that our software is better than the competition and that the overall value proposition of CA and the breadth of our solutions can help them be more successful than just talking a point product. So a lot of work can be done there, that's going to take multiple quarters to get done. On the Commercial side of the equation, that's about 3 or 4 different motions. Number one is we have to have an effective go-to-market cost and go-to-market and that's going to be sales and really working through our digital demand. So by the time we drop in a very expensive, very qualified sales professional to help sell a product, we've already moved down the buying motion at a more accelerated pace. When we have very expensive sales resources and there's only so many of them any one company can have, getting in too early in the sales cycle and not taking advantage of modern technology, I think, we put ourselves at a disadvantage. So there's a lot of effort in that Commercial sector to get that to be more effective and more efficient. Is that helpful, Brad?"

And we also have heard of some reorganization around your channel sales. I think the area used to call Growth. I just wonder how are you going -- if, in fact, you have made those changes, how are you going to maintain the interest of these channel partners, which is an area where you could leverage because CA really hasn't been able to do that historically?"

I'll do my very best in this call to help you understand it and everybody else for that matter. First of all, the concept of Growth, that was just, a nomenclature on our part. I mean, if you would have -- if I could go back in time, I never would have used that word. It all meant one segment so that kind of got people a little bit more confused, but it really didn't have anything to do with a particular market. What it is to your point is getting into these resellers and, quite frankly, I think we've been kind of like Lucy with the football than Charlie Brown. We're into it, we're not into it, we're into it, we're not into it. And if you take a look at the history of almost 15 to 20 years, we've been down that path. So we have to earn our way back with these partners and make sure that they understand that we're very serious about having a focus channel. Now how do you do that? I think there's 3 ways. Number one, we've got very hard lines between where direct sales force can go and where a reseller can go. And to the extent that we are very adamant about holding on to those lines. And if you look at in the previous iterations of CA, we would have a tough quarter. We would want to get a deal that and we will go in with a direct sales force and accelerate that deal than a partner was doing. That is just bad hygiene. There's no tolerance for that in CA anymore. We won't pay a sales professional direct commission if they do that and a sales manager to let that behavior permeate through the company is one that we think is probably not going to be having a strong leadership future in our company. So we're very serious about that and I use very strong language because it has to be that way. To change a decade-long history, you have to put in a lot of structure and you have to be very serious and the tone from the top matters. Secondly, products matter. If you have products that are difficult to sell via channel and there's no way that you have helped that channel in either the lead generation or the understanding of how to sell that product and help it -- help that partner competitively differentiate with other products we compete with and other partners that they compete with, I think that you are going to have a less than stellar results. So what we've done, and to your question of why is there a little bit of noise in the system, we've been very diligent. We used to have something like 300 to 400 partners that we said we were partnering with. We've pared that down to somewhere in the 60 to 80 total partners on a global basis. And we're putting the marketing and training dollars on a much smaller base, and we're really working collaboratively with these focused partners to make sure that they're getting the right kind of lead generation and they are able to articulate how to use our products to differentiate against competition. I don't think that gets fixed in a short period of time, and it has to be something we're committed to for the long haul."

We spent a lot of time as well ensuring that the programmatic lead basis and [indiscernible] that we have with our partners is much more aligned with what we see in the industry now.

And for us to get to where we want to be, which is organic growth in ES, we have to sell with the renewal for sure. We've demonstrated [ 4 ] years we know how to do that. For us to really get and brush up against our potential, we've got to be able to sell outside the renewal and add net new customers. We did that pretty well. I was happy with Q4. I was happy with Q1. And when I take a look at Q2, I just think that we were a little complacent and we backed off the amount of rigor and the amount of energy and the amount of thoughtfulness you have to put in place to get a customer to decide to buy your product over a competitor's product and to buy your product as opposed to the 20 other things that they could spend money on. Why does this matter? When you take a look at the modern software factory metaphor that we're using in our ad campaign, and I'm talking to senior executives, they absolutely understand the modern software factory. Why is it that we're not getting some of the traction of the tools that enable the modern software factory and other technology purchases are being made? It's because we have to do a very good job of articulating that this software needs to be bought above all other software. It's not like I saw deals [indiscernible] in the quarter. I saw way too many deals push and some of the reasons for it gave me pause. They had decided that this wasn't top of mind. Well, if you really want to survive in the modern business infrastructure, you have to be very adept at software. I can't think of a single company that's not going through a digital transformation. If you're going through that digital transformation, you should definitely understand how to build your modern software factory. When you take a look at CA and our product portfolio, we are the true link to build your modern software factory. That message has to be said emphatically and almost evangelically in each and every sales pursuant. To the extent that we did that, I think there's opportunities for us to improve."

262913,539711760,1319980,"CA, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2017",2017-10-25,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased with the healthy operating margin and strong CFFO Growth we delivered in our second fiscal quarter. We are very pleased that the contribution from our SaaS business continues to grow at a rapid pace. T",1170,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased with the healthy operating margin and strong CFFO Growth we delivered in our second fiscal quarter. We are very pleased that the contribution from our SaaS business continues to grow at a rapid pace. Total new sales, Enterprise Solutions new sales and Mainframe new sales all outperformed the year-over-year decline in the renewal portfolio. This, combined with our revenue backlog, gives me confidence in our full year guidance. 
That said, it is not lost on me that we have work to do. Our sales execution in Q2 was disappointing and revenue came in below our expectations. In particular, velocity in sales outside of the renewal cycle of Enterprise Solutions products was short of our expectations. There are a few primary factors underlying this. 
First, the renewal portfolio was smaller in the second quarter than in the year ago period as we expected. The lighter renewal portfolio creates a natural headwind for all of our bookings-related metrics. However, our expectation is that we should be able to consistently sell outside of our renewals regardless of the timing of the renewal portfolio. Any failure to do so erodes opportunity to recognize upfront revenue that directly ties to our quarterly revenue results. After demonstrating success in selling outside of our renewal portfolio, we got complacent. Growth in our ES freestanding new sales requires a level of sales leadership and focus across the team that did not materialize in Q2. We expect to return to a more consistent level of performance in the second half of our fiscal year. 
Another factor that impacted our Q2 organic revenue performance was the result of a conscious decision we made to prioritize new sales of the Automic automation platform. Unifying CA's organic automation solutions into an integrated automation platform negatively impacts our organic revenue in the near term, particularly in the Enterprise Solutions segment. We believe the long-term benefit to all of our stakeholders more than offsets the organic headwinds this creates in the near term. 
Over time, our customers will benefit from the clarity of a single platform with robust integrations across our product portfolio. For our customers, this decreases their development dollars, integration efforts and simplifies their broader IT environment. We will continue to make decisions that are in the best interest of our customers and long-term shareholders, even at the expense of near-term optics. 
We remain pleased with the strategic nature of our recent acquisitions. The importance of our Veracode acquisition, which elegantly bridges our Security portfolio to our DevOps portfolio, could not have been more evident this quarter with very well-publicized recent data breaches. Security continues to be top of mind among business leaders and individuals. Looking back at the breaches that have happened in the recent past and looking ahead to GDPR or the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May of next year, it's clear that security continues to be critically important. 
Today, there's an extraordinary amount of code that's written. This proliferation accelerates the need to ensure that code is written securely to prevent hacks and compromises that can severely impact consumers, tarnishing the reputation of corporations and their executives. Fixing faulty code earlier in the cycle with a SaaS-based tool before its released is efficient, cost-effective and is in everyone's best interest. Veracode's value proposition precisely is the sweet spot. 
When I look at our identity-centric Security portfolio, I am incredibly proud of CA's partnership with customers like NASDAQ and the State of Louisiana's Office of Technology Services. With the latter, we are implementing Identity and Access Management solutions across government agencies to further digitize and better protect state and citizen information. It is working to modernize and standardize IT services across the state's 16 government agencies in order to streamline processes and enable engineers to more efficiently and more securely run services and applications across networks. 
In the second quarter, we announced the release of CA Privileged Access Management or CA PAM 3.0. This gives companies and organizations the ability to scale their PAM deployments across multiple departments and provides managed service providers a helpful way to manage multiple instances of the product for their customer base across platforms and infrastructures. The scalability of a PAM solution is critical to ensure organizations can address and control cyber risk coming from trusted users in any environment. Customers need to manage access across departments, geographies, heterogeneous IT environments and consider complex architectural requirements. CA PAM supports these needs with enhanced features that enable greater control across the spectrum of user access points. 
Last month, we announced Day One support for IBM z14 for our key mainframe solutions. Our continued investment in the mainframe and partnership with IBM helps to ensure the mainframe remains a system of trust with its elevated level of encryption and security. In addition, our solutions, which leverage the new z14 platform, greatly decrease the risks of data breaches that can arise from the degradation of performance associated with increasing encryption needs. We are collectively providing unified enterprise security that helps to increase an organization's compliance structure across new and existing mainframes. This is of increased importance as organizations prepare for the implementations of new regulations that focus on data privacy like GDPR. 
Strength in Mainframe new sales, despite a smaller renewal portfolio in the quarter, was driven by our newer products, including Mainframe Operations Intelligence, Data Content Discovery and Dynamic Capacity Intelligence. 
Across our product portfolio, we continue to earn the recognition of third-party industry analysts. CA was recently named a leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Agile PPM 2017 Vendor Assessment, Enabling Adaptive Planning for Emerging Markets, DevOps and IoT. CA was also named a leader in The Forrester Wave for Continuous Delivery And Release Automation, Q3 2017. And CA was positioned as a leader in the 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation. 
We are well positioned in great markets, and our solutions are solving real problems for our customers. This feeds my optimism as I look ahead. 
In the near term, we believe we are on track to achieve our fiscal year 2018 guidance. Additionally, we are working on an ongoing plan to improve the efficiency of our OpEx spend across the organization. Longer term, we are working on a plan to drive accelerated improvement in our organic revenue trajectory. Concurrently, we are putting in place improvements to drive sustainable growth and expand profitability over time. We are optimistic that we have a path to improve the long-term health of the company and our shareholder returns. 
I look forward to seeing many of you at CA World next month. Our financial analyst track will take place on November 15th. There is no better place for you to see the breadth and depth of CA's portfolio of solutions and hear firsthand from our customers how they are deploying CA solutions. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our second quarter financials and full-year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported, unless otherwise indicated. 
This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Q2 total new sales were up, mid-single digits as reported and low single digits in constant currency. And organic new sales were down approximately 10% as reported and low teens in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, while we were pleased by the continuing strong performance of our SaaS products, we were disappointed by our overall slower sales velocity in the quarter. 
The total renewal portfolio was down mid-single digits as reported and high single digits in constant currency compared to the year-ago period. As we've stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Our renewal yield for the quarter was greater than 90%. 
Organic new sales declined year-over-year across all regions due to the lighter renewal portfolio in the quarter. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were up in the low 20s and were positively impacted by both product and capacity sales in the period. Specifically, we saw a strong demand for new products such as Dynamic Capacity Intelligence, which optimizes Mainframe capacity utilization. New sales contributions from Mainframe Operations Intelligence, which embeds machine learning to improve operational performance; and Data Content Discovery, which addresses Security and compliance challenges were also drivers in the quarter. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales were down in the low single digits and organically were down approximately 20%. As mentioned, we were pleased with the performance of our SaaS products, which continue to grow at a rapid pace in the quarter. Our recent acquisitions also contributed meaningfully to our results in the quarter. 
Total revenue for the second quarter was $1.034 billion, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 5 points to total revenue growth in the quarter. 
From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 7% as reported and 6% and in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 3% in constant currency, in line with our longer-term expectation for the overall Mainframe market. Services revenue was flat as reported and in constant currency. 
Total revenue backlog was up 2% as reported and 1% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog improved 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Approximately 4% of the current backlog increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode, while the remaining balance was driven by organic factors. In general, the size of the renewal portfolio coming due in the next 12 months is a driver of our current revenue backlog. 
Q2 GAAP operating margin was 27%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 55% for Mainframe Solutions, 10% for Enterprise Solutions and 1% for Services. 
Our Q2 GAAP tax rate was 28.7%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 28.5%. 
Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.44, down 12% as reported and down 10% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.62, down 7% as reported and down 6% in constant currency. 
Our Q2 CFFO was $37 million, up $90 million compared to the year-ago period. 
Single installment cash payments were $80 million in the quarter and up meaningfully over the prior year. Recall that in the year-ago period, single installments were unusually low. 
We ended the second quarter with approximately $100 million in net debt. 
We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $90 million worth of our shares outstanding in the quarter. We have $560 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect that we will at least offset dilution with our share repurchase program. 
Consistent with what we've said in the past few quarters, we'd like to provide some incremental disclosure with regard to our upcoming adoption of ASC 606. Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard under the modified retrospective method, we expect that a significant portion of deferred revenue and revenue backlog booked in accordance with the current standard, ASC 605, will not be recognized as revenue following our adoption of ASC 606. Instead, it will become part of the cumulative effect adjustment within retained earnings. 
Said another way, the license component of bookings recognized under the current standard will fall out of deferred revenue and revenue backlog. Instead, it will be captured in retained earnings on the balance sheet. 
As a consequence of this adjustment, we expect to see an acceleration of the timing of income taxes payable. We are still evaluating the amount and timing of those payments upon adoption and awaiting updates from regulatory agencies. As a reminder, we do not expect the new standard to significantly impact billings and cash collections from billings. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2017. No additional material acquisitions are assumed in our guidance. 
As a reminder, please keep in mind that our renewal portfolio for the year is heavily weighted toward the fourth fiscal quarter. Typical seasonality for CA implies bookings and revenue to be stronger in the fourth fiscal quarter as well. Operating margin in the third quarter will be impacted by the timing of spend related to CA World and, therefore, should be the lowest operating margin of the year. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase by approximately 5% as reported and 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.22 billion to $4.25 billion. 
We also expect our full-year GAAP operating margin to be between 26% and 27%, and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36% and 37%. 
We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. We expect our GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease by 8% to 5%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76. 
We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be down 2% to flat, both as reported and constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48. 
At end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. 
We expect cash flow from operations to be up 2% to 6% as reported and flat to up 4% at constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.8 billion to $1.15 billion. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

And as anyone who's been in software for an awful long time, when you've got a very strong heritage in direct sales, it takes a while to get the channels working. When you take a look at the global system providers, I think we're doing really, really well with them. When you take a look at the system integrators, I think that's a strong spot. When you get into resellers, especially in the United States and, in some cases, outside the United States, that's an area where I'd like to see a lot more improvement. When you take a look at the point solution providers that we compete against, many of them have never had an opportunity to get out there and build a global direct sales force. And the only that they've been able to get their product to market is through distributors. So we have to help distributors understand that we're a better play, that our software is better than the competition, and that the overall value proposition of CA and the breadth of our solutions can help them be more successful than just hawking a point product. So a lot of work can be done there. That's going to take multiple quarters to get done. On the Commercial side of the equation, that's about 3 or 4 different motions. Number one is we have to have an effective go-to-market, cost go-to-market, and that's going to be telesales, and really working through our digital demand. So by the time we drop in a very expensive, very qualified sales professional to help sell a product, we've already moved down the buying motion at a more accelerated pace. When we have very expensive sales resources, and there's only so many of them any one company can have, getting in too early in a sales cycle and not taking advantage of modern technology, I think, we put ourselves at a disadvantage.

And just a follow-up to Brad. Especially on the channel stuff, I mean, CA has attempted to leverage reseller channels, partners several -- I mean, many times over the last 10 to 20 years and it's been difficult. And one of the things that I think leaves a question mark in resellers' minds and your channel partners is that CA has come in and then they've sort of left. And we also have heard of some reorganization around your channel sales. I think the area you used to call Growth. And I just wonder how are you going -- if, in fact, you have made those changes, how are you going to maintain the interest of these channel partners, which is an area where you could leverage because CA really hasn't been able to do that historically?"

First of all, the concept of Growth, that",584,"Thanks, John. First of all, you're hitting on a very salient topic and one that requires a very thoughtful response. I'll do my very best in this call to help you understand it and everybody else for that matter. First of all, the concept of Growth, that was just nomenclature on our part. I mean, if you would have -- if I could go back in time, I never would have used that word. It all meant one segment. So that kind of got people a little bit more confused, but it really didn't have anything to do with a particular market. What it is, to your point, is getting into these resellers and, quite frankly, I think we've been kind of like Lucy with the football than Charlie Brown. We're into it, we're not into it, we're into it, we're not into it. And if you take a look at the history of almost 15 to 20 years, we've been down that path. So we have to earn our way back with these partners and make sure that they understand that we're very serious about having a focus channel. Now how do you do that? I think there's 3 ways. Number one, we've got very hard lines between where direct sales force can go and where a reseller can go. And to the extent that we are very adamant about holding onto those lines, if you look at -- in the previous iterations of CA, we would have a tough quarter, we would want to get a deal done and we will go in with a direct sales force and accelerate that deal than a partner was doing. That is just bad hygiene. There's no tolerance for that in CA anymore. We won't pay a sales professional direct commission if they do that. And a sales manager to let that behavior permeate through the company is one that we think is probably not going to be having a strong leadership future in our company. So we're very serious about that, and I use very strong language because it has to be that way. To change a decade-long history, you have to put in a lot of structure and you have to be very serious, and the tone from the top matters. Secondly, products matter. If you have products that are difficult to sell via channel and there's no way that you have helped that channel in either the lead generation or the understanding of how to sell that product and help it -- help that partner competitively differentiate with other products we compete with and other partners that they compete with, I think that you are going to have a less-than-stellar result. So what we've done, and to your question of why is there a little bit of noise in the system, we've been very diligent. We used to have something like 300 to 400 partners that we said we were partnering with, we've pared that down to somewhere in the 60 to 80 total partners on a global basis. And we're putting the marketing and training dollars on a much smaller base, and we're really working collaboratively with these focused partners to make sure that they're getting the right kind of lead generation and they're able to articulate how to use our products to differentiate against competition. I don't think that gets fixed in a short period of time, and it has to be something we're committed to for the long haul."

We spent a lot of time as well ensuring that the programmatic lead-based incentives that we have with our partners is much more aligned with what they see in the industry now. We recognize that the partner has to make money as well, and I think the programs that we put in place over the last year, I think, are really starting to narrow what my experience has been as well. And I think we'll start to get traction with that. As we go through, we'll constantly be evaluating, do we have the right partners? Are we getting traction with them? What more needs to be done? And that 60 to 80 that Mike talked about, as we find traction with some, we may decide that we'll narrow it even further, if that makes sense, as we look at it product by product. So it is taking probably longer than any of us would like, but I do think programmatically, we're there, and I do think Mike was spot on with the discipline inside the company and in our reinforcement of that with our partners overall trying to get them comfortable to believe in us."

Obviously, our experience last year was we grew very modestly, about 2 points. I'd expect modest growth again this year. I do think our ES growth will accelerate organically next year, especially driven by the good baseline of SaaS business that we've been generating in the past year.

We've demonstrated for years we know how to do that. For us to really get and brush up against our potential, we've got to be able to sell outside the renewal and add net new customers. We did that pretty well. I was happy with Q4. I was happy with Q1. And when I take a look at Q2, I just think that we were a little complacent and we backed off the amount of rigor and the amount of energy and the amount of thoughtfulness you have to put in place to get a customer to decide to buy your product over a competitor's product and to buy your product as opposed to the 20 other things that they could spend money on. Why does this matter? When you take a look at the modern software factory metaphor that we're using in our ad campaign, and I'm talking to senior executives, they absolutely understand the modern software factory. Why is it that we're not getting some of the traction of the tools that enable the modern software factory and other technology purchases are being made? It's because we have to do a very good job of articulating that this software needs to be bought above all other software. It's not like I saw deals lose in the quarter, I saw way too many deals push, and some of the reasons for it gave me pause. They had decided that this wasn't top of mind. Well, if you really want to survive in the modern business infrastructure, you have to be very adept at software. I can't think of a single company that's not going through a digital transformation. If you're going through that digital transformation, you should definitely understand how to build your modern software factory. When you take a look at CA and our product portfolio, we are the tooling to build your modern software factory. That message has to be said emphatically and almost evangelically in each and every sales pursuit. To the extent that we did that, I think there's opportunities for us to improve."

I'm pleased with the healthy operating margin and strong CFFO Growth we delivered in our second fiscal quarter. We are very pleased that the contribution from our SaaS business continues to grow at a rapid pace. T",1170,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased with the healthy operating margin and strong CFFO Growth we delivered in our second fiscal quarter. We are very pleased that the contribution from our SaaS business continues to grow at a rapid pace. Total new sales, Enterprise Solutions new sales and Mainframe new sales all outperformed the year-over-year decline in the renewal portfolio. This, combined with our revenue backlog, gives me confidence in our full year guidance. 
That said, it is not lost on me that we have work to do. Our sales execution in Q2 was disappointing and revenue came in below our expectations. In particular, velocity in sales outside of the renewal cycle of Enterprise Solutions products was short of our expectations. There are a few primary factors underlying this. 
First, the renewal portfolio was smaller in the second quarter than in the year ago period as we expected. The lighter renewal portfolio creates a natural headwind for all of our bookings-related metrics. However, our expectation is that we should be able to consistently sell outside of our renewals regardless of the timing of the renewal portfolio. Any failure to do so erodes opportunity to recognize upfront revenue that directly ties to our quarterly revenue results. After demonstrating success in selling outside of our renewal portfolio, we got complacent. Growth in our ES freestanding new sales requires a level of sales leadership and focus across the team that did not materialize in Q2. We expect to return to a more consistent level of performance in the second half of our fiscal year. 
Another factor that impacted our Q2 organic revenue performance was the result of a conscious decision we made to prioritize new sales of the Automic automation platform. Unifying CA's organic automation solutions into an integrated automation platform negatively impacts our organic revenue in the near term, particularly in the Enterprise Solutions segment. We believe the long-term benefit to all of our stakeholders more than offsets the organic headwinds this creates in the near term. 
Over time, our customers will benefit from the clarity of a single platform with robust integrations across our product portfolio. For our customers, this decreases their development dollars, integration efforts and simplifies their broader IT environment. We will continue to make decisions that are in the best interest of our customers and long-term shareholders, even at the expense of near-term optics. 
We remain pleased with the strategic nature of our recent acquisitions. The importance of our Veracode acquisition, which elegantly bridges our Security portfolio to our DevOps portfolio, could not have been more evident this quarter with very well-publicized recent data breaches. Security continues to be top of mind among business leaders and individuals. Looking back at the breaches that have happened in the recent past and looking ahead to GDPR or the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May of next year, it's clear that security continues to be critically important. 
Today, there's an extraordinary amount of code that's written. This proliferation accelerates the need to ensure that code is written securely to prevent hacks and compromises that can severely impact consumers, tarnishing the reputation of corporations and their executives. Fixing faulty code earlier in the cycle with a SaaS-based tool before it's released is efficient, cost-effective and is in everyone's best interest. Veracode's value proposition precisely is the sweet spot. 
When I look at our identity-centric Security portfolio, I am incredibly proud of CA's partnership with customers like NASDAQ and the State of Louisiana's Office of Technology Services. With the latter, we are implementing Identity and Access Management solutions across government agencies to further digitize and better protect state and citizen information. It is working to modernize and standardize IT services across the state's 16 government agencies in order to streamline processes and enable engineers to more efficiently and more securely run services and applications across networks. 
In the second quarter, we announced the release of CA Privileged Access Management or CA PAM 3.0. This gives companies and organizations the ability to scale their PAM deployments across multiple departments and provides managed service providers a helpful way to manage multiple instances of the product for their customer base across platforms and infrastructures. The scalability of a PAM solution is critical to ensure organizations can address and control cyber risk coming from trusted users in any environment. Customers need to manage access across departments, geographies, heterogeneous IT environments and consider complex architectural requirements. CA PAM supports these needs with enhanced features that enable greater control across the spectrum of user access points. 
Last month, we announced Day One support for IBM z14 for our key mainframe solutions. Our continued investment in the mainframe and partnership with IBM helps to ensure the mainframe remains a system of trust with its elevated level of encryption and security. In addition, our solutions, which leverage the new z14 platform, greatly decrease the risks of data breaches that can arise from the degradation of performance associated with increasing encryption needs. We are collectively providing unified enterprise security that helps to increase an organization's compliance structure across new and existing mainframes. This is of increased importance as organizations prepare for the implementations of new regulations that focus on data privacy like GDPR. 
Strength in Mainframe new sales, despite a smaller renewal portfolio in the quarter, was driven by our newer products, including Mainframe Operations Intelligence, Data Content Discovery and Dynamic Capacity Intelligence. 
Across our product portfolio, we continue to earn the recognition of third-party industry analysts. CA was recently named a leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Agile PPM 2017 Vendor Assessment, Enabling Adaptive Planning for Emerging Markets, DevOps and IoT. CA was also named a leader in The Forrester Wave for Continuous Delivery And Release Automation, Q3 2017. And CA was positioned as a leader in the 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation. 
We are well positioned in great markets, and our solutions are solving real problems for our customers. This feeds my optimism as I look ahead. 
In the near term, we believe we are on track to achieve our fiscal year 2018 guidance. Additionally, we are working on an ongoing plan to improve the efficiency of our OpEx spend across the organization. Longer term, we are working on a plan to drive accelerated improvement in our organic revenue trajectory. Concurrently, we are putting in place improvements to drive sustainable growth and expand profitability over time. We are optimistic that we have a path to improve the long-term health of the company and our shareholder returns. 
I look forward to seeing many of you at CA World next month. Our financial analyst track will take place on November 15th. There is no better place for you to see the breadth and depth of CA's portfolio of solutions and hear firsthand from our customers how they are deploying CA solutions. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our second quarter financials and full-year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported, unless otherwise indicated. 
This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Q2 total new sales were up mid-single digits as reported and low single digits in constant currency. And organic new sales were down approximately 10% as reported and low teens in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, while we were pleased by the continuing strong performance of our SaaS products, we were disappointed by our overall slower sales velocity in the quarter. 
The total renewal portfolio was down mid-single digits as reported and high single digits in constant currency compared to the year-ago period. As we've stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Our renewal yield for the quarter was greater than 90%. 
Organic new sales declined year-over-year across all regions due to the lighter renewal portfolio in the quarter. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were up in the low 20s and were positively impacted by both product and capacity sales in the period. Specifically, we saw a strong demand for new products such as Dynamic Capacity Intelligence, which optimizes Mainframe capacity utilization. New sales contributions from Mainframe Operations Intelligence, which embeds machine learning to improve operational performance; and Data Content Discovery, which addresses Security and compliance challenges were also drivers in the quarter. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales were down in the low single digits and organically were down approximately 20%. As mentioned, we were pleased with the performance of our SaaS products, which continue to grow at a rapid pace in the quarter. Our recent acquisitions also contributed meaningfully to our results in the quarter. 
Total revenue for the second quarter was $1.034 billion, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 5 points to total revenue growth in the quarter. 
From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 3% in constant currency, in line with our longer-term expectation for the overall Mainframe market. Services revenue was flat as reported and in constant currency. 
Total revenue backlog was up 2% as reported and 1% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog improved 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Approximately 4% of the current backlog increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode, while the remaining balance was driven by organic factors. In general, the size of the renewal portfolio coming due in the next 12 months is a driver of our current revenue backlog. 
Q2 GAAP operating margin was 27%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 65% for Mainframe Solutions, 10% for Enterprise Solutions and 1% for Services. 
Our Q2 GAAP tax rate was 28.7%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 28.5%. 
Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.44, down 12% as reported and down 10% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.62, down 7% as reported and down 6% in constant currency. 
Our Q2 CFFO was $37 million, up $90 million compared to the year-ago period. 
Single installment cash payments were $80 million in the quarter and up meaningfully over the prior year. Recall that in the year-ago period, single installments were unusually low. 
We ended the second quarter with approximately $100 million in net debt. 
We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $90 million worth of our shares outstanding in the quarter. We have $560 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect that we will at least offset dilution with our share repurchase program. 
Consistent with what we've said in the past few quarters, we'd like to provide some incremental disclosure with regard to our upcoming adoption of ASC 606. Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard under the modified retrospective method, we expect that a significant portion of deferred revenue and revenue backlog booked in accordance with the current standard, ASC 605, will not be recognized as revenue following our adoption of ASC 606. Instead, it will become part of the cumulative effect adjustment within retained earnings. 
Said another way, the license component of bookings recognized under the current standard will fall out of deferred revenue and revenue backlog. Instead, it will be captured in retained earnings on the balance sheet. 
As a consequence of this adjustment, we expect to see an acceleration of the timing of income taxes payable. We are still evaluating the amount and timing of those payments upon adoption and awaiting updates from regulatory agencies. As a reminder, we do not expect the new standard to significantly impact billings and cash collections from billings. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2017. No additional material acquisitions are assumed in our guidance. 
As a reminder, please keep in mind that our renewal portfolio for the year is heavily weighted toward the fourth fiscal quarter. Typical seasonality for CA implies bookings and revenue to be stronger in the fourth fiscal quarter as well. Operating margin in the third quarter will be impacted by the timing of spend related to CA World and, therefore, should be the lowest operating margin of the year. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase by approximately 5% as reported and 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.22 billion to $4.25 billion. 
We also expect our full-year GAAP operating margin to be between 26% and 27%, and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36% and 37%. 
We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. We expect our GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease by 8% to 5%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76. 
We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be down 2% to flat, both as reported and constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48. 
At end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. 
We expect cash flow from operations to be up 2% to 6% as reported and flat to up 4% at constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.0 billion to $1.15 billion. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

And then as you start thinking about how we look at the full year on the Mainframe, there's strong system shipments that you've seen from IBM last week, and that gives us confidence in the strength of the hardware cycle. And historically, our capacity sales lag the z Systems hardware by a few quarters. And despite the renewal portfolio headwind, Mainframe new sales, both product and capacity, were quite strong, driven by the newer products like Dynamic Capacity Intelligence, Mainframe Operations Intelligence and Data Content Discovery. So we're confident that the revenue declines will remain within our medium-term target for the foreseeable future."

We expect our Q4 FY '17 acquisitions to contribute slightly more in the second half than the first half. We expect the Services headwind to moderately abate in the second half. And then, of course, we have seasonality of our standalone sales that are back end-loaded, driving more upfront revenue in the second half compared to the first half. And once again, I think from an execution perspective, I think we got the attention to everybody in the company after getting to organic growth for a few quarters, [indiscernible] over the last several quarters, this is not a sometimes thing. We expect it to be an all-time thing. And I think it's given everybody a little bit of resolve of what it takes to be excellent in selling and the products and the marketing and the whole company rallying around that motion.

And as anyone who's been in software for an awful long time, when you've got a very strong heritage in direct sales, it takes a while to get the channels working. When you take a look at the global system providers, I think we're doing really, really well with them. When you take a look at the system integrators, I think that's a strong spot. When you get into resellers, especially in the United States and, in some cases, outside the United States, that's an area where I'd like to see a lot more improvement. When you take a look at the point solution providers that we compete against, many of them have never had an opportunity to get out there and build a global direct sales force. And the only that they've been able to get their product to market is through distributors. So we have to help distributors understand that we're a better play, that our software is better than the competition, and that the overall value proposition of CA and the breadth of our solutions can help them be more successful than just hawking a point product. So a lot of work can be done there. That's going to take multiple quarters to get done. On the Commercial side of the equation, that's about 3 or 4 different motions. Number one is we have to have an effective go-to-market, cost go-to-market, and that's going to be telesales, and really working through our digital demand. So by the time we drop in a very expensive, very qualified sales professional to help sell a product, we've already moved down the buying motion at a more accelerated pace. When we have very expensive sales resources, and there's only so many of them any one company can have, getting in too early in a sales cycle and not taking advantage of modern technology, I think, we put ourselves at a disadvantage. So there's a lot of effort in that Commercial sector to get that to be more effective and more efficient. Is that helpful, Brad?"

And just a follow-up to Brad. Especially on the channel stuff, I mean, CA has attempted to leverage reseller channels, partners several -- I mean, many times over the last 10 to 20 years and it's been difficult. And one of the things that I think leaves a question mark in resellers' minds and your channel partners is that CA has come in and then they've sort of left. And we also have heard of some reorganization around your channel sales. I think the area you used to call Growth. And I just wonder how are you going -- if, in fact, you have made those changes, how are you going to maintain the interest of these channel partners, which is an area where you could leverage because CA really hasn't been able to do that historically?"

I'll do my very best in this call to help you understand it and everybody else for that matter. First of all, the concept of Growth, that was just nomenclature on our part. I mean, if you would have -- if I could go back in time, I never would have used that word. It all meant one segment. So that kind of got people a little bit more confused, but it really didn't have anything to do with a particular market. What it is, to your point, is getting into these resellers and, quite frankly, I think we've been kind of like Lucy with the football with Charlie Brown. We're into it, we're not into it, we're into it, we're not into it. And if you take a look at the history of almost 15 to 20 years, we've been down that path. So we have to earn our way back with these partners and make sure that they understand that we're very serious about having a focus channel. Now how do you do that? I think there's 3 ways. Number one, we've got very hard lines between where direct sales force can go and where a reseller can go. And to the extent that we are very adamant about holding onto those lines, if you look at -- in the previous iterations of CA, we would have a tough quarter, we would want to get a deal done and we will go in with a direct sales force and accelerate that deal that a partner was doing. That is just bad hygiene. There's no tolerance for that in CA anymore. We won't pay a sales professional direct commission if they do that. And a sales manager to let that behavior permeate through the company is one that we think is probably not going to be having a strong leadership future in our company. So we're very serious about that, and I use very strong language because it has to be that way. To change a decade-long history, you have to put in a lot of structure and you have to be very serious, and the tone from the top matters. Secondly, products matter. If you have products that are difficult to sell via channel and there's no way that you have helped that channel in either the lead generation or the understanding of how to sell that product and help it -- help that partner competitively differentiate with other products we compete with and other partners that they compete with, I think that you are going to have a less-than-stellar result. So what we've done, and to your question of why is there a little bit of noise in the system, we've been very diligent. We used to have something like 300 to 400 partners that we said we were partnering with, we've pared that down to somewhere in the 60 to 80 total partners on a global basis. And we're putting the marketing and training dollars on a much smaller base, and we're really working collaboratively with these focused partners to make sure that they're getting the right kind of lead generation and they're able to articulate how to use our products to differentiate against competition. I don't think that gets fixed in a short period of time, and it has to be something we're committed to for the long haul."

We spent a lot of time as well ensuring that the programmatic lead-based incentives that we have with our partners is much more aligned with what they see in the industry now. We recognize that the partner has to make money as well, and I think the programs that we put in place over the last year, I think, are really starting to narrow what my experience has been as well. And I think we'll start to get traction with that. As we go through, we'll constantly be evaluating, do we have the right partners? Are we getting traction with them? What more needs to be done? And that 60 to 80 that Mike talked about, as we find traction with some, we may decide that we'll narrow it even further, if that makes sense, as we look at it product by product. So it is taking probably longer than any of us would like, but I do think programmatically, we're there, and I do think Mike was spot on with the discipline inside the company and in our reinforcement of that with our partners overall trying to get them comfortable to believe in us."

We did that pretty well. I was happy with Q4. I was happy with Q1. And when I take a look at Q2, I just think that we were a little complacent and we backed off the amount of rigor and the amount of energy and the amount of thoughtfulness you have to put in place to get a customer to decide to buy your product over a competitor's product and to buy your product as opposed to the 20 other things that they could spend money on. Why does this matter? When you take a look at the modern software factory metaphor that we're using in our ad campaign, and I'm talking to senior executives, they absolutely understand the modern software factory. Why is it that we're not getting some of the traction of the tools that enable the modern software factory and other technology purchases are being made? It's because we have to do a very good job of articulating that this software needs to be bought above all other software. It's not like I saw deals lose in the quarter, I saw way too many deals push, and some of the reasons for it gave me pause. They had decided that this wasn't top of mind. Well, if you really want to survive in the modern business infrastructure, you have to be very adept at software. I can't think of a single company that's not going through a digital transformation. If you're going through that digital transformation, you should definitely understand how to build your modern software factory. When you take a look at CA and our product portfolio, we are the tooling to build your modern software factory. That message has to be said emphatically and almost evangelically in each and every sales pursuit. To the extent that we did that, I think there's opportunities for us to improve."

262913,539711760,1321618,"CA, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2017",2017-10-25,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased with the healthy operating margin and strong CFFO Growth we delivered in our second fiscal quarter.

I'm pleased with the healthy operating margin and strong CFFO Growth we delivered in our second fiscal quarter. We are very pleased that the contribution from our SaaS business continues to grow at a rapid pace. Total new sales, Enterprise Solutions new sales and Mainframe new sales all outperformed the year-over-year decline in the renewal portfolio. This, combined with our revenue backlog, gives me confidence in our full year guidance. 
That said, it is not lost on me that we have work to do. Our sales execution in Q2 was disappointing and revenue came in below our expectations. In particular, velocity in sales outside of the renewal cycle of Enterprise Solutions products was short of our expectations. There are a few primary factors underlying this. 
First, the renewal portfolio was smaller in the second quarter than in the year ago period as we expected. The lighter renewal portfolio creates a natural headwind for all of our bookings-related metrics. However, our expectation is that we should be able to consistently sell outside of our renewals regardless of the timing of the renewal portfolio. Any failure to do so erodes opportunity to recognize upfront revenue that directly ties to our quarterly revenue results. After demonstrating success in selling outside of our renewal portfolio, we got complacent. Growth in our ES freestanding new sales requires a level of sales leadership and focus across the team that did not materialize in Q2. We expect to return to a more consistent level of performance in the second half of our fiscal year. 
Another factor that impacted our Q2 organic revenue performance was the result of a conscious decision we made to prioritize new sales of the Automic automation platform. Unifying CA's organic automation solutions into an integrated automation platform negatively impacts our organic revenue in the near term, particularly in the Enterprise Solutions segment. We believe the long-term benefit to all of our stakeholders more than offsets the organic headwinds this creates in the near term. 
Over time, our customers will benefit from the clarity of a single platform with robust integrations across our product portfolio. For our customers, this decreases their development dollars, integration efforts and simplifies their broader IT environment. We will continue to make decisions that are in the best interest of our customers and long-term shareholders, even at the expense of near-term optics. 
We remain pleased with the strategic nature of our recent acquisitions. The importance of our Veracode acquisition, which elegantly bridges our Security portfolio to our DevOps portfolio, could not have been more evident this quarter with very well-publicized recent data breaches. Security continues to be top of mind among business leaders and individuals. Looking back at the breaches that have happened in the recent past and looking ahead to GDPR or the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May of next year, it's clear that security continues to be critically important. 
Today, there's an extraordinary amount of code that's written. This proliferation accelerates the need to ensure that code is written securely to prevent hacks and compromises that can severely impact consumers, tarnishing the reputation of corporations and their executives. Fixing faulty code earlier in the cycle with a SaaS-based tool before it's released is efficient, cost-effective and is in everyone's best interest. Veracode's value proposition precisely is the sweet spot. 
When I look at our identity-centric Security portfolio, I am incredibly proud of CA's partnership with customers like NASDAQ and the State of Louisiana's Office of Technology Services. With the latter, we are implementing Identity and Access Management solutions across government agencies to further digitize and better protect state and citizen information. It is working to modernize and standardize IT services across the state's 16 government agencies in order to streamline processes and enable engineers to more efficiently and more securely run services and applications across networks. 
In the second quarter, we announced the release of CA Privileged Access Management or CA PAM 3.0. This gives companies and organizations the ability to scale their PAM deployments across multiple departments and provides managed service providers a helpful way to manage multiple instances of the product for their customer base across platforms and infrastructures. The scalability of a PAM solution is critical to ensure organizations can address and control cyber risk coming from trusted users in any environment. Customers need to manage access across departments, geographies, heterogeneous IT environments and consider complex architectural requirements. CA PAM supports these needs with enhanced features that enable greater control across the spectrum of user access points. 
Last month, we announced Day One support for IBM z14 for our key mainframe solutions. Our continued investment in the mainframe and partnership with IBM helps to ensure the mainframe remains a system of trust with its elevated level of encryption and security. In addition, our solutions, which leverage the new z14 platform, greatly decrease the risks of data breaches that can arise from the degradation of performance associated with increasing encryption needs. We are collectively providing unified enterprise security that helps to increase an organization's compliance structure across new and existing mainframes. This is of increased importance as organizations prepare for the implementations of new regulations that focus on data privacy like GDPR. 
Strength in Mainframe new sales, despite a smaller renewal portfolio in the quarter, was driven by our newer products, including Mainframe Operations Intelligence, Data Content Discovery and Dynamic Capacity Intelligence. 
Across our product portfolio, we continue to earn the recognition of third-party industry analysts. CA was recently named a leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Agile PPM 2017 Vendor Assessment, Enabling Adaptive Planning for Emerging Markets, DevOps and IoT. CA was also named a leader in The Forrester Wave for Continuous Delivery And Release Automation, Q3 2017. And CA was positioned as a leader in the 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation. 
We are well positioned in great markets, and our solutions are solving real problems for our customers. This feeds my optimism as I look ahead. 
In the near term, we believe we are on track to achieve our fiscal year 2018 guidance. Additionally, we are working on an ongoing plan to improve the efficiency of our OpEx spend across the organization. Longer term, we are working on a plan to drive accelerated improvement in our organic revenue trajectory. Concurrently, we are putting in place improvements to drive sustainable growth and expand profitability over time. We are optimistic that we have a path to improve the long-term health of the company and our shareholder returns. 
I look forward to seeing many of you at CA World next month. Our financial analyst track will take place on November 15th. There is no better place for you to see the breadth and depth of CA's portfolio of solutions and hear firsthand from our customers how they are deploying CA solutions. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our second quarter financials and full-year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported, unless otherwise indicated. 
This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Q2 total new sales were up mid-single digits as reported and low single digits in constant currency. And organic new sales were down approximately 10% as reported and low teens in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, while we were pleased by the continuing strong performance of our SaaS products, we were disappointed by our overall slower sales velocity in the quarter. 
The total renewal portfolio was down mid-single digits as reported and high single digits in constant currency compared to the year-ago period. As we've stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Our renewal yield for the quarter was greater than 90%. 
Organic new sales declined year-over-year across all regions due to the lighter renewal portfolio in the quarter. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were up in the low 20s and were positively impacted by both product and capacity sales in the period. Specifically, we saw a strong demand for new products such as Dynamic Capacity Intelligence, which optimizes Mainframe capacity utilization. New sales contributions from Mainframe Operations Intelligence, which embeds machine learning to improve operational performance; and Data Content Discovery, which addresses Security and compliance challenges were also drivers in the quarter. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales were down in the low single digits and organically were down approximately 20%. As mentioned, we were pleased with the performance of our SaaS products, which continue to grow at a rapid pace in the quarter. Our recent acquisitions also contributed meaningfully to our results in the quarter. 
Total revenue for the second quarter was $1.034 billion, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 5 points to total revenue growth in the quarter. 
From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 3% in constant currency, in line with our longer-term expectation for the overall Mainframe market. Services revenue was flat as reported and in constant currency. 
Total revenue backlog was up 2% as reported and 1% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog improved 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Approximately 4% of the current backlog increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode, while the remaining balance was driven by organic factors. In general, the size of the renewal portfolio coming due in the next 12 months is a driver of our current revenue backlog. 
Q2 GAAP operating margin was 27%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 65% for Mainframe Solutions, 10% for Enterprise Solutions and 1% for Services. 
Our Q2 GAAP tax rate was 28.7%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 28.5%. 
Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.44, down 12% as reported and down 10% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.62, down 7% as reported and down 6% in constant currency. 
Our Q2 CFFO was $37 million, up $90 million compared to the year-ago period. 
Single installment cash payments were $80 million in the quarter and up meaningfully over the prior year. Recall that in the year-ago period, single installments were unusually low. 
We ended the second quarter with approximately $100 million in net debt. 
We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $90 million worth of our shares outstanding in the quarter. We have $560 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect that we will at least offset dilution with our share repurchase program. 
Consistent with what we've said in the past few quarters, we'd like to provide some incremental disclosure with regard to our upcoming adoption of ASC 606. Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard under the modified retrospective method, we expect that a significant portion of deferred revenue and revenue backlog booked in accordance with the current standard, ASC 605, will not be recognized as revenue following our adoption of ASC 606. Instead, it will become part of the cumulative effect adjustment within retained earnings. 
Said another way, the license component of bookings recognized under the current standard will fall out of deferred revenue and revenue backlog. Instead, it will be captured in retained earnings on the balance sheet. 
As a consequence of this adjustment, we expect to see an acceleration of the timing of income taxes payable. We are still evaluating the amount and timing of those payments upon adoption and awaiting updates from regulatory agencies. As a reminder, we do not expect the new standard to significantly impact billings and cash collections from billings. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2017. No additional material acquisitions are assumed in our guidance. 
As a reminder, please keep in mind that our renewal portfolio for the year is heavily weighted toward the fourth fiscal quarter. Typical seasonality for CA implies bookings and revenue to be stronger in the fourth fiscal quarter as well. Operating margin in the third quarter will be impacted by the timing of spend related to CA World and, therefore, should be the lowest operating margin of the year. 
For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase by approximately 5% as reported and 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.22 billion to $4.25 billion. 
We also expect our full-year GAAP operating margin to be between 26% and 27%, and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36% and 37%. 
We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. We expect our GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease by 8% to 5%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76. 
We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be down 2% to flat, both as reported and constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48. 
At end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. 
We expect cash flow from operations to be up 2% to 6% as reported and flat to up 4% at constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.0 billion to $1.15 billion. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

So there's a bunch of puts and takes, and sometimes there's an impact from rounding. So the quarterly results were within our expectations. And then as you start thinking about how we look at the full year on the Mainframe, there's strong system shipments that you've seen from IBM last week, and that gives us confidence in the strength of the hardware cycle. And historically, our capacity sales lag the z Systems hardware by a few quarters. And despite the renewal portfolio headwind, Mainframe new sales, both product and capacity, were quite strong, driven by the newer products like Dynamic Capacity Intelligence, Mainframe Operations Intelligence and Data Content Discovery. So we're confident that the revenue declines will remain within our medium-term target for the foreseeable future."

And then, of course, we have seasonality of our standalone sales that are back end-loaded, driving more upfront revenue in the second half compared to the first half. And once again, I think from an execution perspective, I think we got the attention to everybody in the company after getting to organic growth for a few quarters, [indiscernible] over the last several quarters, this is not a sometimes thing. We expect it to be an all-time thing. And I think it's given everybody a little bit of resolve of what it takes to be excellent in selling and the products and the marketing and the whole company rallying around that motion.

And as anyone who's been in software for an awful long time, when you've got a very strong heritage in direct sales, it takes a while to get the channels working. When you take a look at the global system providers, I think we're doing really, really well with them. When you take a look at the system integrators, I think that's a strong spot. When you get into resellers, especially in the United States and, in some cases, outside the United States, that's an area where I'd like to see a lot more improvement. When you take a look at the point solution providers that we compete against, many of them have never had an opportunity to get out there and build a global direct sales force. And the only that they've been able to get their product to market is through distributors. So we have to help distributors understand that we're a better play, that our software is better than the competition, and that the overall value proposition of CA and the breadth of our solutions can help them be more successful than just hawking a point product. So a lot of work can be done there. That's going to take multiple quarters to get done. On the Commercial side of the equation, that's about 3 or 4 different motions. Number one is we have to have an effective go-to-market, cost go-to-market, and that's going to be telesales, and really working through our digital demand. So by the time we drop in a very expensive, very qualified sales professional to help sell a product, we've already moved down the buying motion at a more accelerated pace. When we have very expensive sales resources, and there's only so many of them any one company can have, getting in too early in a sales cycle and not taking advantage of modern technology, I think, we put ourselves at a disadvantage. So there's a lot of effort in that Commercial sector to get that to be more effective and more efficient. Is that helpful, Brad?"

And we also have heard of some reorganization around your channel sales. I think the area you used to call Growth.

I'll do my very best in this call to help you understand it and everybody else for that matter. First of all, the concept of Growth, that was just nomenclature on our part. I mean, if you would have -- if I could go back in time, I never would have used that word. It all meant one segment. So that kind of got people a little bit more confused, but it really didn't have anything to do with a particular market. What it is, to your point, is getting into these resellers and, quite frankly, I think we've been kind of like Lucy with the football with Charlie Brown. We're into it, we're not into it, we're into it, we're not into it. And if you take a look at the history of almost 15 to 20 years, we've been down that path. So we have to earn our way back with these partners and make sure that they understand that we're very serious about having a focus channel. Now how do you do that? I think there's 3 ways. Number one, we've got very hard lines between where direct sales force can go and where a reseller can go. And to the extent that we are very adamant about holding onto those lines, if you look at -- in the previous iterations of CA, we would have a tough quarter, we would want to get a deal done and we will go in with a direct sales force and accelerate that deal that a partner was doing. That is just bad hygiene. There's no tolerance for that in CA anymore. We won't pay a sales professional direct commission if they do that. And a sales manager to let that behavior permeate through the company is one that we think is probably not going to be having a strong leadership future in our company. So we're very serious about that, and I use very strong language because it has to be that way. To change a decade-long history, you have to put in a lot of structure and you have to be very serious, and the tone from the top matters. Secondly, products matter. If you have products that are difficult to sell via channel and there's no way that you have helped that channel in either the lead generation or the understanding of how to sell that product and help it -- help that partner competitively differentiate with other products we compete with and other partners that they compete with, I think that you are going to have a less-than-stellar result. So what we've done, and to your question of why is there a little bit of noise in the system, we've been very diligent. We used to have something like 300 to 400 partners that we said we were partnering with, we've pared that down to somewhere in the 60 to 80 total partners on a global basis. And we're putting the marketing and training dollars on a much smaller base, and we're really working collaboratively with these focused partners to make sure that they're getting the right kind of lead generation and they're able to articulate how to use our products to differentiate against competition. I don't think that gets fixed in a short period of time, and it has to be something we're committed to for the long haul."

And I think we'll start to get traction with that. As we go through, we'll constantly be evaluating, do we have the right partners? Are we getting traction with them? What more needs to be done? And that 60 to 80 that Mike talked about, as we find traction with some, we may decide that we'll narrow it even further, if that makes sense, as we look at it product by product. So it is taking probably longer than any of us would like, but I do think programmatically, we're there, and I do think Mike was spot on with the discipline inside the company and in our reinforcement of that with our partners overall trying to get them comfortable to believe in us."

Obviously, our experience last year was we grew very modestly, about 2 points. I'd expect modest growth again this year. I do think our ES growth will accelerate organically next year, especially driven by the good baseline of SaaS business that we've been generating in the past year. I do think it's a little early for me to say declaratively on the company as a whole. If we'll be in a position to do that, we'd obviously like to see [ the backlog ] numbers coming out of the year. But I do think, from an ES perspective, that we should see a strong acceleration in the organic portion of ES next year."

It is definitely top of mind. And strategically, we started getting this message out, now that we are fully integrated with Veracode and they understand our full Security stack and we have a better understanding of their full Security stack, and we've got the marketing machine of CA starting to work the strategic nature of this. And the message that if you can fix the security breach when the code is being written before it gets into production is absolutely and positively resonating on a global basis with just about every company. So I do think that Veracode is going to see some level of uptick. We've obviously factored that into our guidance, but I'm very happy with their performance so far. It is a very great team. It's a great technology, and they worked very well and collaborated within the confines of CA."

When I take a look at execution, I think if I take a look at Q4 -- coming out of Q4, I was very happy with our ability to sell outside the renewal. Once again, Q1 definitely showed progress in that space. And for us to get to where we want to be, which is organic growth in ES, we have to sell with the renewal for sure. We've demonstrated for years we know how to do that. For us to really get and brush up against our potential, we've got to be able to sell outside the renewal and add net new customers. We did that pretty well. I was happy with Q4. I was happy with Q1. And when I take a look at Q2, I just think that we were a little complacent and we backed off the amount of rigor and the amount of energy and the amount of thoughtfulness you have to put in place to get a customer to decide to buy your product over a competitor's product and to buy your product as opposed to the 20 other things that they could spend money on. Why does this matter? When you take a look at the modern software factory metaphor that we're using in our ad campaign, and I'm talking to senior executives, they absolutely understand the modern software factory. Why is it that we're not getting some of the traction of the tools that enable the modern software factory and other technology purchases are being made? It's because we have to do a very good job of articulating that this software needs to be bought above all other software. It's not like I saw deals lose in the quarter, I saw way too many deals push, and some of the reasons for it gave me pause. They had decided that this wasn't top of mind. Well, if you really want to survive in the modern business infrastructure, you have to be very adept at software. I can't think of a single company that's not going through a digital transformation. If you're going through that digital transformation, you should definitely understand how to build your modern software factory. When you take a look at CA and our product portfolio, we are the tooling to build your modern software factory. That message has to be said emphatically and almost evangelically in each and every sales pursuit. To the extent that we did that, I think there's opportunities for us to improve."
