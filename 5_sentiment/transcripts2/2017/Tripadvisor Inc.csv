Also, our IR website contains a supplemental financial information document, which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call as well as other performance metrics. 
Instead of reading prepared remarks on this call, Steve will provide a couple of thoughts about the quarter and our recent progress, as well Ernst, and then we'll jump into Q&A.

Hopefully, you've had a chance to read our prepared remarks that we published last night after market close. I'll summarize by saying 2016 was an important year for TripAdvisor. We continued on our journey towards our north star, building the best end-to-end user experience in travel. While our accelerated Instant Booking launch garnered most of the headlines during the year, it was but one of many ongoing initiatives that positions our business for long-term growth. 
At $1.3 trillion in global spend, the travel opportunity is large and growing and remains intensely competitive. We have a lot of work to do to capture our fair share, but we believe we are now very well positioned. 
As we move into 2017, we see faster revenue growth ahead. We are considering certain marketing investments to accelerate the user perception shift of TripAdvisor as not only the best review site but also the best place to compare prices and book.

As expected, 2016 was a challenging year financially with consolidated revenues, GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA down 1%, 39% and 24%, respectively. 
Coming out of this transition year, we are encouraged by recent trends, particularly in our U.S. market, where we have completely lapped our Instant Booking rollout. We will lap the majority of the international rollout this quarter and will continue to invest behind improving monetization trends to enhance revenue growth. 
Amidst the competitive travel landscape, we are prioritizing revenue growth as opposed to profit growth this year. We believe this journey will pay off financially, but, as I have mentioned before, it will take time. We're moving fast, we're learning and improving and we believe that we're on the path to maximize long-term shareholder value and long-term growth.

When we think of Expedia as an Instant Book client, we think of a number of different pieces. It's Expedia and Hotels.com and Wotif and Hotwire and Travelocity and Orbitz and all the different brands. That's one component. And there's how much inventory do we get from each of the brands, and then there's how active can they be in our auction in each market. So the most important thing to us, and I think the most important thing to Expedia -- or I'll just speak for us -- the most important thing to us is to actually have all of the best pricing from all of the Expedia brands. And we are -- we have that in the U.S. now, and we're well on our way to getting that in the rest of the world. Most of the brands are online now. I don't think all of them are, but we're getting the biggest bang for the buck from our perspective in terms of the pricing -- when they have excellent pricing, we're able to show it in our store. I think part of the confusion is the limitations that we have in terms of rolling out Expedia and enabling them as a OTA partner to compete in each and every auction around the globe. And some of that has been alluded to before. It's just a question of timing. We think the biggest impact that Expedia, Instant Book for us is already evident in the market that it's rolled out in, and it will continue to roll out in other markets over the course of the year. So we're very pleased, and, of course, Expedia is looking forward to being able to participate in more auctions over time and drive more bookings from us as a platform. So 2 thumbs up on that one. When it comes to the brand marketing, we're excited by what we've seen in terms of improvements once we lapped IB in fourth quarter and into January. When we look at all the different pieces of the puzzle, we want to make sure that the product is solid not just in Instant Book pricing but also in the entire flow. We want to make sure that our message is resonating with consumers, and we will be evaluating the scope and timing. So to be clear, we're in evaluation mode, so that tells you we're serious about it. But we won't be spending in Q1, and we'll give you an update as we move forward with that decision process."

Especially in our display business, the end of the year is lumpy, and we saw some softness in that, that we don't necessarily project going forward.

We have a phen",326,"Sure. So when we look at the opportunity on TV, and as you know, we've been on TV in years past, we do have to note [indiscernible] to the fact that other players in the industry have been on TV in many years and it's been working for them. We have a phenomenal amount of unaided and aided brand awareness in most parts of the world. And so our challenge with TV is a little bit different and some might say easier, some might say harder. Of course, it's the challenge of delivering a different message as people love us for reviews, I would overly generalize, and teaching them with the brand campaign that we're the best spot for price comparison and booking and not necessarily completing the transaction on TripAdvisor with Instant Book but what I really mean is with the campaign to educate folks are that we're the site that they should come back to or come to when they're ready to make a transaction. And if they click off our meta auction to one of our great partners, amen. If they follow through and book on Instant Booking, that works just as well. And in general, we like to think of ourselves as reasonably indifferent in the 2 with Instant Booking providing probably more strategic advantage to us on the phone. So I think to the question of the impact on margins, it's clearly an opportunity for us to invest because if we can shift the perception of all of the folks that are already coming to TripAdvisor, let alone drive some new traffic, our revenue per shopper and the rest of our core metrics can potentially rise, fueling a lot of the additional growth in spend. So we don't see a reason why margins would end up at current Trivago levels. That would be silly for a company of our size, but we do see it being a reasonable opportunity for us."

And we think that TV advertising could help -- very importantly help move that user perception and increase the monetization that we can get from our hotel shoppers, increase our revenue per shopper over time and thereby improve our economics. So as we think about our long-term economics, and we look at it in absolute EBITDA terms, we believe that our current strategy and -- potentially enhanced by brand marketing will allow us to grow profitability over the longer term."

So we have the best variability to count, the biggest and best supply for attractions. And so while there's many different ways to research, we have a heck of a lot of traffic and we have the best booking capabilities in most parts of the world. So as users learn how to explore and book online, those transactions are more likely than not going to flow through us, even if they happen to start on the Google.

But I'll rephrase the question because from my thinking, it's not really an Instant Book product priority, it is a hotel shopping experience priority, and that spans all devices. We really want to make it as smooth as possible, as easy as possible to find the best price because we have a phenomenal price comparison engine that's pooling prices of from 200-plus sites all around the web. We have great relationships with hotel chains, with all of the major online travel agencies in basically every market around the globe. So how can we do a better job demonstrating to our travelers that we've done the hard work for you, we found the best price, we're putting it in front of you. And when the TripAdvisor booking option happens to have the best price and if you've already stored the credit card with TripAdvisor, super, Instant Book makes for a very easy and smooth transaction. But it's fine if you go down the route of clicking off to a phenomenal partner like Expedia or Priceline. We still collect the referral fee, our monetization still improves. And so long as we can attract more top-of-funnel shoppers, turn those shoppers into higher intent bookers because we helped them decide that this is the right hotel for them, which is the content we have, plus of the great price comparison, then we've done our job in the funnel, qualified somebody and sent them downstream. So I think over the past 6 months, you've seen meaningful improvements in sort of the price transparency on the site. I think you'll continue to see over the next several quarters more of that plus just a smoother shopping experience to delight our travelers."

So the second part of the question with performance channel -- so we're using, we pretty much use them all. I think we're very strong in almost every global market in any sort of performance marketing channels. If you know of one that you don't see us in, let me know, it's an oversight, not a strategic decision. Obviously, the big ones are search engines and social networks. And if that platform has scaled, then we're using it. In terms of how we decide who's providing the Instant Booking, again, I caution you on the -- that may be -- that is very important and valid question that our partners want to know because they're eager to gain share in our Instant Booking marketplace, but the commission deltas or selection isn't critical in our overall monetization. So when we look at growing now throughout 2017 and beyond, we look at the overall picture of how we translate the top-of-funnel hotel shopper into that clicker when they click on Instant Book or meta. And so it's more significant for us, for instance, to figure out how to drive higher qualified leads by providing better content about hotels, better photos, et cetera, downstream to our OTA partners or the chain partners, then see if we can eke out a few more basis points of commissions via an auction. So the IB, to more specifically answer the question about the Instant Book auction, primary factor is which of our partners offers us the best price to book the room because we know our travelers care most about the price. And so it's usually the lowest price is going to win the auction. When you have a supplier brand plus an OTA brand offering the same price for a particular property, we have the calculation that it tends to understand the likely conversion rate between the branded player and the OTA times the commission rate, and that gives us an effective CPC. It's more nuanced that, but for the sake of this call, that's the general game plan."

Hopefully, you've had a chance to read our prepared remarks that we published last night after market close. I'll summarize by saying 2016 was an important year for TripAdvisor. We continued on our journey towards our north star, building the best end-to-end user experience in travel. While our accelerated Instant Booking launch garnered most of the headlines during the year, it was but one of many ongoing initiatives that positions our business for long-term growth. 
At $1.3 trillion in global spend, the travel opportunity is large and growing and remains intensely competitive. We have a lot of work to do to capture our fair share, but we believe we are now very well positioned. 
As we move into 2017, we see faster revenue growth ahead. We are considering certain marketing investments to accelerate the user perception shift of TripAdvisor as not only the best review site but also the best place to compare prices and book.

When we think of Expedia as an Instant Book client, we think of a number of different pieces. It's Expedia and Hotels.com and Wotif and Hotwire and Travelocity and Orbitz and all the different brands. That's one component. And there's how much inventory do we get from each of the brands, and then there's how active can they be in our auction in each market. So the most important thing to us, and I think the most important thing to Expedia -- or I'll just speak for us -- the most important thing to us is to actually have all of the best pricing from all of the Expedia brands. And we are -- we have that in the U.S. now, and we're well on our way to getting that in the rest of the world. Most of the brands are online now. I don't think all of them are, but we're getting the biggest bang for the buck from our perspective in terms of the pricing -- when they have excellent pricing, we're able to show it in our store. I think part of the confusion is the limitations that we have in terms of rolling out Expedia and enabling them as a OTA partner to compete in each and every auction around the globe. And some of that has been alluded to before. It's just a question of timing. We think the biggest impact that Expedia, Instant Book for us is already evident in the market that it's rolled out in, and it will continue to roll out in other markets over the course of the year. So we're very pleased, and, of course, Expedia is looking forward to being able to participate in more auctions over time and drive more bookings from us as a platform. So 2 thumbs up on that one. When it comes to the brand marketing, we're excited by what we've seen in terms of improvements once we lapped IB in fourth quarter and into January. When we look at all the different pieces of the puzzle, we want to make sure that the product is solid not just in Instant Book pricing but also in the entire flow. We want to make sure that our message is resonating with consumers, and we will be evaluating the scope and timing. So to be clear, we're in evaluation mode, so that tells you we're serious about it. But we won't be spending in Q1, and we'll give you an update as we move forward with that decision process."

We have a phenomena",328,"Sure. So when we look at the opportunity on TV, and, as you know, we've been on TV in years past, we do have to note, tip our hat to the fact that other players in the industry have been on TV many years and it's been working for them. We have a phenomenal amount of unaided and aided brand awareness in most parts of the world. And so our challenge with TV is a little bit different and some might say easier, some might say harder. Of course, it's the challenge of delivering a different message as people love us for reviews, I would overly generalize, and teaching them with a brand campaign that we're the best spot for a price comparison and booking. And not necessarily completing the transaction on TripAdvisor with Instant Book, but what I really mean is with a campaign to educate folks that we're the site that they should come back to or come to when they're ready to make a transaction. And if they click off in our meta auction to one of our great partners, amen. If they follow through and book on Instant Booking, that works just as well. And in general, we like to think of ourselves as reasonably indifferent in the 2 with Instant Booking providing a probably more strategic advantage to us on the phone. So I think to the question of impact on margins, it's clearly an opportunity for us to invest because if we can shift the perception of all of the folks that are already coming to TripAdvisor, let alone drive some new traffic, our revenue per shopper and the rest of our core metrics can potentially rise, fueling a lot of the additional growth in spend. So we don't see a reason why margins would end up at current Trivago levels. That would be silly for a company of our size. But we do see it being a reasonable opportunity for us."

So when we look at the Attractions space and the things that Expedia is doing and Google is doing, we kind of view it as wonderful validation that the online community is ready for more booking before they actually arrive at a destination or, if they're using our app, booking while they are in market. So we have, to the best of our ability, become the biggest and best supply for Attractions. And so while there's many different ways to research, we have a heck of a lot of traffic and we have the best booking capabilities in most parts of the world. So as users learn how to explore and book online, those transactions are, more likely than not, going to flow through us even if they happen to start on a Google. Expedia is able to help someone who they already have, going to a location, to a very popular location, find something to book, but we really have the -- I would argue we have the long tail and plenty of top-of-funnel traffic to really fly in that category."

And the profile is different in the sense of the objectives that we have with it, which is much more around positioning us as a brand and moving user perception as well as creating new traffic. And it will have in all likelihood a slightly different financial profile with a longer-term payback period and performance paid marketing. That's why we differentiate between the 2. So the forward-looking statement that we have given about our EBITDA for 2017, flat to down year-on-year, incorporates the significant step-up of performance paid marketing.

But I'll rephrase the question because from my thinking, it's not really an Instant Book product priority, it is a hotel shopping experience priority. And that spans all devices. We really want to make it as smooth as possible, as easy as possible to find the best price because we have a phenomenal price comparison engine that's pooling prices from 200-plus sites all around the web. We have great relationships with hotel chains, with all the major online travel agencies in basically every market around the globe. So how can we do a better job demonstrating to our travelers that we've done the hard work for you, we found the best price, we're putting it in front of you. And when the TripAdvisor booking option happens to have the best price and if you've already stored your credit card with TripAdvisor, super. Instant Book makes for a very easy and smooth transaction. But it's fine if you go down the route of clicking off to a phenomenal partner like Expedia or Priceline. We still collect the referral fee. Our monetization still improves. And so long as we can attract more top-of-funnel shoppers, turn those shoppers into higher-intent bookers because we've helped them decide that this is the right hotel for them, which is the content we have, plus the great price comparison, then we've done our job in the funnel, qualified somebody and sent them downstream. So I think over the past 6 months you've seen meaningful improvements in sort of the price transparency on the site. I think you'll continue to see over the next several quarters more of that plus a -- plus just a smoother shopping experience to delight our travelers."

So the second part of the question what performance channels are we using, we pretty much use them all. I think we're very strong in almost every global market in any sort of performance marketing channels. If you know of one that you don't see us in, let me know. It's an oversight, not a strategic decision. Obviously, the big ones are search engines and social networks. And if that platform has scaled, then we're using it. In terms of how we decide who's providing the Instant Booking, again I caution you on the -- that may be -- that is a very important and valid question that our partners want to know because they're eager to gain share in our Instant Booking marketplace. But the commission deltas or that selection isn't critical in our overall monetization. So when we look at growing now throughout 2017 and beyond, we look at the overall picture of how we translate the top-of-funnel hotel shopper into that clicker when they click on Instant Book or meta. And so it's more significant for us, for instance, to figure out how to drive higher qualified leads by providing better content about hotels, better photos, et cetera, downstream to our OTA partners or the chain partners than see if we can eke out a few more basis points of commission via an auction. So the IB -- to more specifically answer the question about the Instant Book auction, a primary factor is which of our partners offers us the best price to book the room because we know our travelers care most about the price. And so it's usually a -- who has the lowest price is going to win the auction. When you have a supplier brand plus a OTA brand offering the same price for a particular property, we have a calculation that attempts to understand the likely conversion rate between the branded player and the OTA times the commission rate, and that gives us an effective CPC. It's more nuanced than that, but for the sake of this call, that's the general game plan."

Do we have the best price in IB? It's more likely that we put IB in front. Do we have the best price in meta? More likely that we put the meta option in front. So we will privilege IB versus meta depending on a number of factors. So it's not necessarily just a side-by-side and one compares such and one compares the other. And so we are much more focused on the overall. Having said that, as we said, we've improved IB over time, especially in the U.S. Likely to keep improving it outside, not necessarily at the same pace. And we will see it the same on the phone.

Hopefully, you've had a chance to read our prepared remarks that we published last night after market close. I'll summarize by saying 2016 was an important year for TripAdvisor. We continued on our journey towards our north star, building the best end-to-end user experience in travel. While our accelerated Instant Booking launch garnered most of the headlines during the year, it was but one of many ongoing initiatives that positions our business for long-term growth. 
At $1.3 trillion in global spend, the travel opportunity is large and growing and remains intensely competitive. We have a lot of work to do to capture our fair share, but we believe we are now very well positioned. 
As we move into 2017, we see faster revenue growth ahead. We are considering certain marketing investments to accelerate the user perception shift of TripAdvisor as not only the best review site but also the best place to compare prices and book.

When we think of Expedia as an Instant Book client, we think of a number of different pieces. It's Expedia and Hotels.com and Wotif and Hotwire and Travelocity and Orbitz and all the different brands. That's one component. And there's how much inventory do we get from each of the brands, and then there's how active can they be in our auction in each market. So the most important thing to us, and I think the most important thing to Expedia -- or I'll just speak for us -- the most important thing to us is to actually have all of the best pricing from all of the Expedia brands. And we are -- we have that in the U.S. now, and we're well on our way to getting that in the rest of the world. Most of the brands are online now. I don't think all of them are, but we're getting the biggest bang for the buck from our perspective in terms of the pricing -- when they have excellent pricing, we're able to show it in our store. I think part of the confusion is the limitations that we have in terms of rolling out Expedia and enabling them as a OTA partner to compete in each and every auction around the globe. And some of that has been alluded to before. It's just a question of timing. We think the biggest impact that Expedia, Instant Book for us is already evident in the market that it's rolled out in, and it will continue to roll out in other markets over the course of the year. So we're very pleased, and, of course, Expedia is looking forward to being able to participate in more auctions over time and drive more bookings from us as a platform. So 2 thumbs up on that one. When it comes to the brand marketing, we're excited by what we've seen in terms of improvements once we lapped IB in fourth quarter and into January. When we look at all the different pieces of the puzzle, we want to make sure that the product is solid not just in Instant Book pricing but also in the entire flow. We want to make sure that our message is resonating with consumers, and we will be evaluating the scope and timing. So to be clear, we're in evaluation mode, so that tells you we're serious about it.

You're correct to highlight those lines, and they were relatively soft in the fourth quarter compared to the full year trends and also compared to our anticipation going forward in '17. The drivers were a little different. On our subscription and display business, there was some seasonality. Sometimes, especially in our display business, the end of the year is lumpy, and we saw some softness in that, that we don't necessarily project going forward. Our other Hotel revenue is mostly driven by our SmarterTravel brands, and here also we saw some softness that was mostly traffic related for them. Other revenue as a category was up for us for the full year. It was meaningfully down, of course, in the fourth quarter.

So when we look at the opportunity on TV, and, as you know, we've been on TV in years past, we do have to note, tip our hat to the fact that other players in the industry have been on TV many years and it's been working for them. We have a phenomenal amount of unaided and aided brand awareness in most parts of the world. And so our challenge with TV is a little bit different and some might say easier, some might say harder. Of course, it's the challenge of delivering a different message as people love us for reviews, I would overly generalize, and teaching them with a brand campaign that we're the best spot for a price comparison and booking. And not necessarily completing the transaction on TripAdvisor with Instant Book, but what I really mean is with a campaign to educate folks that we're the site that they should come back to or come to when they're ready to make a transaction. And if they click off in our meta auction to one of our great partners, amen. If they follow through and book on Instant Booking, that works just as well. And in general, we like to think of ourselves as reasonably indifferent in the 2 with Instant Booking providing a probably more strategic advantage to us on the phone. So I think to the question of impact on margins, it's clearly an opportunity for us to invest because if we can shift the perception of all of the folks that are already coming to TripAdvisor, let alone drive some new traffic, our revenue per shopper and the rest of our core metrics can potentially rise, fueling a lot of the additional growth in spend. So we don't see a reason why margins would end up at current Trivago levels. That would be silly for a company of our size. But we do see it being a reasonable opportunity for us."

And so while there's many different ways to research, we have a heck of a lot of traffic and we have the best booking capabilities in most parts of the world. So as users learn how to explore and book online, those transactions are, more likely than not, going to flow through us even if they happen to start on a Google. Expedia is able to help someone who they already have, going to a location, to a very popular location, find something to book, but we really have the -- I would argue we have the long tail and plenty of top-of-funnel traffic to really fly in that category."

But I'll rephrase the question because from my thinking, it's not really an Instant Book product priority, it is a hotel shopping experience priority. And that spans all devices.

We have great relationships with hotel chains, with all the major online travel agencies in basically every market around the globe. So how can we do a better job demonstrating to our travelers that we've done the hard work for you, we found the best price, we're putting it in front of you. And when the TripAdvisor booking option happens to have the best price and if you've already stored your credit card with TripAdvisor, super. Instant Book makes for a very easy and smooth transaction. But it's fine if you go down the route of clicking off to a phenomenal partner like Expedia or Priceline. We still collect the referral fee. Our monetization still improves. And so long as we can attract more top-of-funnel shoppers, turn those shoppers into higher-intent bookers because we've helped them decide that this is the right hotel for them, which is the content we have, plus the great price comparison, then we've done our job in the funnel, qualified somebody and sent them downstream.

I think we're very strong in almost every global market in any sort of performance marketing channels. If you know of one that you don't see us in, let me know. It's an oversight, not a strategic decision. Obviously, the big ones are search engines and social networks. And if that platform has scale, then we're using it. In terms of how we decide who's providing the Instant Booking, again I caution you on the -- that may be -- that is a very important and valid question that our partners want to know because they're eager to gain share in our Instant Booking marketplace. But the commission deltas or that selection isn't critical in our overall monetization. So when we look at growing now throughout 2017 and beyond, we look at the overall picture of how we translate the top-of-funnel hotel shopper into that clicker when they click on Instant Book or meta. And so it's more significant for us, for instance, to figure out how to drive higher qualified leads by providing better content about hotels, better photos, et cetera, downstream to our OTA partners or the chain partners than see if we can eke out a few more basis points of commission via an auction. So the IB -- to more specifically answer the question about the Instant Book auction, a primary factor is which of our partners offers us the best price to book the room because we know our travelers care most about the price. And so it's usually a -- who has the lowest price is going to win the auction. When you have a supplier brand plus a OTA brand offering the same price for a particular property, we have a calculation that attempts to understand the likely conversion rate between the branded player and the OTA times the commission rate, and that gives us an effective CPC. It's more nuanced than that, but for the sake of this call, that's the general game plan."

We've recently seen growth over 20% in the U.S. market. Now we are this quarter going to lap everywhere else, and we do expect to see -- that to mean that we can improve the growth rates relative to 2016. We want to be careful, though, in just extrapolating what we saw in the U.S. to every other market outside of the U.S. Every market is different. Our U.S. is our strongest market, and the lapping will be -- will show different results in different markets. So although we believe it will mean improvement, we want to be sort of conservative in our outlook of -- if it's going to be close to the U.S. or not. The U.S. will, in all likelihood, throughout the year lead all these other markets in terms of revenue growth. In terms of CPCs, we don't give any particular guidance on where we see CPCs go. CPCs are volatile throughout the year. It's the output of an auction, not an input of our pricing decision and, therefore, fluctuates over time. It all comes together in a revenue per shopper for us, which is a metric that we look at much more closely, but we don't give specific guidance to either CPC or revenue per shopper. We have a number of initiatives in place to drive a better user experience, improve our conversion rates. That, when successful, should help us get better CPCs and better revenue per shopper, but we don't give any particular guidance to it."

While our accelerated Instant Booking launch garnered most of the headlines during the year, it was but one of many ongoing initiatives that positions our business for long-term growth.

And when someone does, in fact, go down the Instant Book path, they do, in fact, come back more frequently to TripAdvisor. If they hadn't booked first time around, then the second time. When we look at the Instant Book conversion, because we now have better pricing in the store, because we've done our optimizations, we've seen the -- kind of the raw numbers increase about 20% year-on-year for U.S. desktop. So we're pleased with that. We still have a ways to go, though. When we look at -- or the second part of your question with respect to -- sorry, the second part of the question was?"

When we think of Expedia as an Instant Book client, we think of a number of different pieces. It's Expedia and Hotels.com and Wotif and Hotwire and Travelocity and Orbitz and all the different brands. That's one component. And there's how much inventory do we get from each of the brands, and then there's how active can they be in our auction in each market. So the most important thing to us, and I think the most important thing to Expedia -- or I'll just speak for us -- the most important thing to us is to actually have all of the best pricing from all of the Expedia brands. And we are -- we have that in the U.S. now, and we're well on our way to getting that in the rest of the world. Most of the brands are online now. I don't think all of them are, but we're getting the biggest bang for the buck from our perspective in terms of the pricing -- when they have excellent pricing, we're able to show it in our store. I think part of the confusion is the limitations that we have in terms of rolling out Expedia and enabling them as a OTA partner to compete in each and every auction around the globe. And some of that has been alluded to before. It's just a question of timing. We think the biggest impact that Expedia, Instant Book for us is already evident in the market that it's rolled out in, and it will continue to roll out in other markets over the course of the year. So we're very pleased, and, of course, Expedia is looking forward to being able to participate in more auctions over time and drive more bookings from us as a platform. So 2 thumbs up on that one. When it comes to the brand marketing, we're excited by what we've seen in terms of improvements once we lapped IB in fourth quarter and into January. When we look at all the different pieces of the puzzle, we want to make sure that the product is solid not just in Instant Book pricing but also in the entire flow. We want to make sure that our message is resonating with consumers, and we will be evaluating the scope and timing. So to be clear, we're in evaluation mode, so that tells you we're serious about it. But we won't be spending in Q1, and we'll give you an update as we move forward with that decision process."

So when we look at the opportunity on TV, and, as you know, we've been on TV in years past, we do have to note, tip our hat to the fact that other players in the industry have been on TV many years and it's been working for them. We have a phenomenal amount of unaided and aided brand awareness in most parts of the world. And so our challenge with TV is a little bit different and some might say easier, some might say harder. Of course, it's the challenge of delivering a different message as people love us for reviews, I would overly generalize, and teaching them with a brand campaign that we're the best spot for a price comparison and booking. And not necessarily completing the transaction on TripAdvisor with Instant Book, but what I really mean is with a campaign to educate folks that we're the site that they should come back to or come to when they're ready to make a transaction. And if they click off in our meta auction to one of our great partners, amen. If they follow through and book on Instant Booking, that works just as well. And in general, we like to think of ourselves as reasonably indifferent in the 2 with Instant Booking providing a probably more strategic advantage to us on the phone. So I think to the question of impact on margins, it's clearly an opportunity for us to invest because if we can shift the perception of all of the folks that are already coming to TripAdvisor, let alone drive some new traffic, our revenue per shopper and the rest of our core metrics can potentially rise, fueling a lot of the additional growth in spend. So we don't see a reason why margins would end up at current Trivago levels. That would be silly for a company of our size. But we do see it being a reasonable opportunity for us."

And so while there's many different ways to research, we have a heck of a lot of traffic and we have the best booking capabilities in most parts of the world.

And when the TripAdvisor booking option happens to have the best price and if you've already stored your credit card with TripAdvisor, super. Instant Book makes for a very easy and smooth transaction. But it's fine if you go down the route of clicking off to a phenomenal partner like Expedia or Priceline. We still collect the referral fee. Our monetization still improves. And so long as we can attract more top-of-funnel shoppers, turn those shoppers into higher-intent bookers because we've helped them decide that this is the right hotel for them, which is the content we have, plus the great price comparison, then we've done our job in the funnel, qualified somebody and sent them downstream.

So the second part of the question what performance channels are we using, we pretty much use them all. I think we're very strong in almost every global market in any sort of performance marketing channels. If you know of one that you don't see us in, let me know. It's an oversight, not a strategic decision. Obviously, the big ones are search engines and social networks. And if that platform has scale, then we're using it. In terms of how we decide who's providing the Instant Booking, again I caution you on the -- that may be -- that is a very important and valid question that our partners want to know because they're eager to gain share in our Instant Booking marketplace. But the commission deltas or that selection isn't critical in our overall monetization. So when we look at growing now throughout 2017 and beyond, we look at the overall picture of how we translate the top-of-funnel hotel shopper into that clicker when they click on Instant Book or meta. And so it's more significant for us, for instance, to figure out how to drive higher qualified leads by providing better content about hotels, better photos, et cetera, downstream to our OTA partners or the chain partners than see if we can eke out a few more basis points of commission via an auction. So the IB -- to more specifically answer the question about the Instant Book auction, a primary factor is which of our partners offers us the best price to book the room because we know our travelers care most about the price. And so it's usually a -- who has the lowest price is going to win the auction. When you have a supplier brand plus a OTA brand offering the same price for a particular property, we have a calculation that attempts to understand the likely conversion rate between the branded player and the OTA times the commission rate, and that gives us an effective CPC. It's more nuanced than that, but for the sake of this call, that's the general game plan."

Our U.S. is our strongest market, and the lapping will be -- will show different results in different markets. So although we believe it will mean improvement, we want to be sort of conservative in our outlook of -- if it's going to be close to the U.S. or not. The U.S. will, in all likelihood, throughout the year lead all these other markets in terms of revenue growth. In terms of CPCs, we don't give any particular guidance on where we see CPCs go. CPCs are volatile throughout the year. It's the output of an auction, not an input of our pricing decision and, therefore, fluctuates over time.

We filed our 10-Q, and we made available our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com. In the release, you will find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. Also, our IR site contains a supplemental file information documents, which include certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call as well as other performance metrics. 
Instead of reading our prepared remarks on this call, Steve will jump into a couple of thoughts, and then we'll jump right into Q&A.

Hopefully you've had a chance to read our prepared remarks that we published last night after market close. I'll summarize by saying that 2017 is off to a productive start. In hotels, we are rapidly aligning products, supply and marketing is what drive towards long-term growth and profitability. In a few weeks, we will rollout our streamlined hotel shopping experience, and soon thereafter, we'll launch our new brand advertising campaign, leveraging our strong global brand to build user awareness of TripAdvisor as a great place to find the lowest prices when you are ready to book. 
In non-hotels our continued strong demand growth in supply investments are really starting to payoff. And while focus remains our top line growth, this segment is already beginning to exhibit attractive profit potential. 
We are addressing large growth opportunities ahead and making great progress building end-to-end products that travelers love, a bigger and better platform for advertisers and a bigger and better business over the long term. Ernst?"

We saw strong growth recovery as the first quarter consolidated total revenue growth improved to 6% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. This revenue growth also improved from our fourth quarter results, driven by improvements in our TripAdvisor branded click-based transaction business. We are encouraged by the significant recovery we saw in this click-based and transaction revenue growth over the past few quarters and the continued strong growth of our non-hotel segment. Notably, we reiterate our revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook now inclusive of our brand advertising investment. We are able to maintain this outlook by reallocating some less efficient online marketing dollars, as well as expected profit favorability in our non-hotel segment towards our brand advertising.

So we all think back to Amazon that started at books and now did books and music, and books, music and of course, now they do everything, and they were able to do that because they have positioned themselves as a shopping site. Well, TripAdvisor is a travel site. You come to plan your trip. So we have the credibility to be able to play in the number of different aspects in that travel planning. But I couldn't go that we wouldn't be able to sell you a pair of shoes, that's kind of not what people associate TripAdvisor. So it comes from the strength reviews, as Amazon had come from a strength books, but it's well within what users are using the site for to extend it to something else. And in our case, moving into that price comparison. So we have a large portion of our current audience and have, for the past decade, come to TripAdvisor, read reviews and move into our price comparison engine and then click off to our partners, so use Instant Book to book. So that's an already established behavior pattern for a large portion of our users.  Our challenge isn't, ""Hey, is that even possible? Will users do that sort of thing?"" They do it. It's a huge business for us. The question is, can the TV campaign accelerate the move of the people who don't currently use us for that to join sort of the crowd that does. And a lot of people, when we ask will say, ""Yes, I use it for reviews. I didn't know that you have a price comparison."" And, of course, I hear that, and I think how could you miss that on our site? Oh my goodness, it's all over the place. But you have to accept what users are telling you. When we go on TV and we talk very clearly about price comparison, find the lowest price, help save you some money as a traveler. And we repeat that TV ad numerous times, we hope to educate that individual that the site that they already know and love can now be used for this new part of the hotel shopping experience, which they are already on TripAdvisor for. So we don't view it as a big leap or a big change. And when we look at our last TV campaign, it was focus less around the benefit of comparing prices and more teaching about teaching users specifically that they can now book on TripAdvisor. So we've tweaked that message, we'll be back out to the marketplace at a heavier weight with a more streamlined user experience that's focused around that hotel shopping. Think of it as less distractions on the page, more point how can we help you save some money in your shopping experience, how can we give you the best value for the hotel that you're looking for, not just the highest rated, but the best rated in your price point, those sorts of things. And we're giving ourselves time to make that message sink in through things like TV and any other online campaigns. So I view our past TV as very instructive, useful lessons to get us to where we are now, but we have a very compelling plan to achieve these objectives that we have in front of us now."

And so part of the new shopping experience helps pull people down that funnel of putting in your dates and actually getting to see our prices, and noting that we've scoured the web and found you a great price. The thing that's not new in this quarter or in this new design is where Instant Book fits into that mix, because we have been talking for several quarters about Instant Booking earning its position in our hotel shopping experience so that we put it in front of users when we think they are most likely use it, either for price, because Instant Book might have the best price or convenience, particularly on the phone, if it's something you've used before. So we want to build that great shopping experience. Instant Booking is a clear tool that help us do that and is a way that we can get better pricing in front of our consumers and make it more convenient, especially on the phone. But as we look forward in 2017, '18, if Instant Book -- if as some people [indiscernible] well, Instant Book is not as prominent as it once was, and that's because our customers are telling us they are indifferent as to whether they are choosing to use it versus something else, and that's okay with us, tends the comment on indifferent.

If you compare, for instance, the pound, the U.K. being our largest non-U.S. markets a year ago versus today. And then the mobile shift has tended to happen faster outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And then there are many market-by-market differences. But generally, the overall market, the robustness of our auction, the level of competition is more favorable in the U.S. than in many places outside of the U.S. And so our anticipation is that the U.S. will remain the pace car in terms of growth in the foreseeable future that we believe that in the long-term international markets can be robust growers for us.

We don't see a reason why people won't be able to get there in the hotel space. And to do that, you need something that kind of looks like Instant Book or something pretty close. So if we fast-forward to the time when Instant Book really does have the best pricing available on the web, it's kind of matched the lowest price from anywhere, there is going to be in our prediction a set of travelers who love the TripAdvisor hotel shopping experience, they put in their credit cards and have now formed up a habit, where they are a frequent repeat user of our apps because it's just simpler and you always get the lowest price. We're not forcing that on people to be clear right now, but we see that as a wonderful endgame as the world moves to mobile. And if you're using us for price comparison, there isn't an obvious benefit of clicking out versus continuing your purchase on our site, unless someone else gives you the better price. And that's the challenge for the Instant Book team is always making sure that piece of the product has the best price. When we do that, we'll earn more than our fair share, more convenience. Where we don't, our business funnel says, will help the customers save the dollar by clicking them off to wherever does have the lowest price."

Last year, we made a number of smaller investments, but a number of investments there as well. And we'll continue to look at opportunities that may present itself in the M&A space. And then there's share repurchase as an opportunity as well. And as you say, we clearly, in 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017, have seen an opportunity to buy back some of our shares. The program is reviewed by the Board from time to time in January. The Board approved refreshing the $250 million allocation that we had for share repurchases. And we have a 10b5 program in place with different triggers that we don't want to go into detail.

We send a few quarters ago already that we, in the U.S., Instant Booking was no longer dilutive to the overall offering, and we've been improving both meta and IB since then. So I think it's a combination of factors, but it's just a sign that after incorporating -- fully incorporating in some booking in the U.S. now we're off we are no better off than we were in '14 and we continue to show impressive growth to our revenue per shopper. In terms of the desktop monetization gap, we said in the past, if mobile monetizes roughly at 1/3 of desktop and those trends change a little quarter-over-quarter, but not dramatically, we saw a quarter in the first quarter where there was revenue per shopper improvements on mobile and we had 35%, about 35% growth of our phone the revenues and about 25% growth on the shopper line. And so we're very pleased with that, and we continue to plug away making sure that we make that gap as small as we can. And in terms of your last question it's about the Q2. Again with mobile as with the general comments I was making quarter-to-quarter, there may be some volatility in revenue per shopper or in monetization of mobile, but the long-term trend is pretty stable."

But it will have a near-term drag on EBITDA just the TV campaign itself, which is offset by these 2 drivers that I talked about, partly by reallocating some of our online spend. So we look in our total portfolio of advertising spend and said, TV doesn't necessarily have to be a bolt on. We look at what does that mean for our online, and we have been allocating some expendables of the margin less efficient than the average and the located that's for his TV. And then as we highlighted, we have upgraded our outlook on profitability of our non-hotel segment. And those 2 factors together for '17 happen to be roughly equivalent to the EBITDA loss we expect from the TV campaign. So together, taken together, do not have been poorly impact on their with of the business would be famous ago was a good brand advertising campaign.

And then rubber meets the road or the questions most relevant when you have a parity price with other providers. At which point, look, some users we fully expect to be loyal to a different booking site, I think TripAdvisor for finding them the best price. That best price might be on Booking.com, and they click over to Booking.com, and they're happy with that experience, and we're fine with that, we get update on the quick and we help drive the booking. Other folks, because they're in the habit of booking on TripAdvisor, using our Instant Book with our stored credit card, we'll prefer the TripAdvisor option because it's literally fewer clicks to actually finish that booking. No need to switch. So our wealth of product capabilities here allows us to tailor the experience to what we think that individual traveler is looking for. And we think that's a great option.

In Hotels, we're rapidly aligning products, supply and marketing as we drive towards long-term growth and profitability. In a few weeks, we will roll out our streamlined hotel shopping experience, and soon thereafter, we'll launch our new brand advertising campaign, leveraging our strong global brand to build user awareness of TripAdvisor as a great place to find the lowest prices when you are ready to book. 
In Non-hotel, our continued strong demand growth in supply investments are really starting to payoff. And while focus remains on top line growth, this segment is already beginning to exhibit attractive profit potential. 
We are addressing large growth opportunities ahead and making great progress building end-to-end products that travelers love, a bigger and better platform for advertisers and a bigger and better business over the long term.

It is true that if we reallocate marketing dollars from online to TV is you get a positive impact in revenue on TV and potentially, a negative impact on online. We have done quite a bit of work over the last 3 months in studying the different markets that we're going to dealing with TV, studying our historical patterns of impact of TV that we have found. And although there is some volatility around the results there, we feel good about the projections that we're making and good about reiterating this double-digit growth this year on our transaction-based business for TripAdvisor.

So we all think back to Amazon that started at books and now did books and music -- and books, music. And of course, now they do everything. And they were able to do that because they had positioned themselves as a shopping site. Well, TripAdvisor is a travel site. You come to plan your trip. So we have the credibility to be able to play in a number of different aspects in that travel planning. But I couldn't go -- we wouldn't be able to sell you a pair of shoes, that's kind of not what people associate TripAdvisor. So we come from a strength reviews, as Amazon had come from a strength books, but it's well within what users are using the site for to extend it to something else, and in our case, moving into that price comparison. So we have a large portion of our current audience and have, for the past decade, come to TripAdvisor, read reviews and move into our price comparison engine and then click off to our partners or use Instant Book to book. So that's an already established behavior pattern for a large portion of our users. Our challenge isn't, ""Hey, is that even possible? Will users do that sort of thing?"" They do it. It's a huge business for us. The question is, can the TV campaign accelerate the move of the people who don't currently use us for that to join sort of the crowd that does? And a lot of people, when we ask will say, ""Well, yes. I use it for reviews. I didn't know that you had price comparison."" And of course, I hear that and I think how could you miss that on our site. Oh my goodness, it's plastered all over the place. But you have to accept what users are telling you. When we go on TV and we talk very clearly about price comparison, find the lowest price, help save you some money as a traveler, and we repeat that TV ad numerous times, we hope to educate that individual that the site that they already know and love can now be used for this new part of the travel -- the hotel shopping experience, which they're already on TripAdvisor for. So we don't view it as a big leap or a big change. And when we look at our last TV campaign, it was focused less around the benefit of comparing prices and more teaching about teaching users specifically that they can now book on TripAdvisor. So we've tweaked that message. We'll be back out to the marketplace at a heavier weight with a more streamlined user experience that's focused around that hotel shopping. Think of it as less distractions on the page, more point how can we help you save some money in your shopping experience, how can we give you the best value for the hotel that you're looking for, not just the highest rated, but the best rated in your price point, those sorts of things. And we're giving ourselves time to make that message sink in through things like TV and in our other online campaigns. So I view our past TV as very instructive, useful lessons to get us to where we are now, but we have a very compelling plan to achieve these objectives that we have in front of us now."

Now the next thing the consumer absolutely needs is to get the best deal on that hotel. And so part of the new shopping experience helps pull people down that funnel of putting in your dates and actually getting to see our prices and noting that we've scoured the web and found you a great price. The thing that's not new in this quarter or in this new design is where Instant Book fits into that mix because we have been talking for several quarters about Instant Booking earning its position in our hotel shopping experience, so that we put it in front of users when we think they're most likely use it, either for price, because Instant Book might have the best price, or convenience, particularly on the phone, if it's something you've used before. So we want to build that great shopping experience. Instant Booking is a clear tool to help us do that and is a way that we can get better pricing in front of our consumers and make it more convenient, especially on the phone. But as we look forward in 2017, '18, if Instant Book -- if as some people are competent, well, Instant Book is not as prominent as it once was. That's because our customers are telling us they're indifferent as to whether they are choosing to use it versus something else, and that's okay with us, hence, the comment on indifferent. We want to do what's best for our travelers. And we believe that Instant Book plays a key role in that, though not as a big a role as we had anticipated a couple of years ago."

Part of the differential in growth rate is attributable to timing in IB and lapping of IB, but that's not the full story. Currency is one of the factors. If you compare, for instance, the pound, the U.K. being our largest non-U.S. market a year ago versus today, and then the mobile shift has tended to happen faster outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And then there are many -- there's many market-by-market differences. But generally, the overall market, the robustness of our auction, the level of competition is more favorable in the U.S. than in many places outside of the U.S. And so our anticipation is that the U.S. will remain the pace car in terms of growth in the foreseeable future that, we believe, that in the long term, international markets can be robust growers for us, too. But the pattern will be -- the pattern of growth recovery is likely to be a little slower than we've seen in the U.S., and therefore, lag the U.S. more than just the lagging of the IB rollout."

And there is a click-off model that works quite well for us and others, but they're certainly a wonderful convenience of being able to essentially buy it with a single click, as sites like Amazon have shown. We don't see a reason why we won't be able to get there in the hotel space. And to do that, you need something that kind of looks like Instant Book or something pretty close. So if we fast forward to the time when Instant Book really does have the best pricing available on the web, it's kind of match the lowest price from anywhere, there's going to be, in our prediction, a set of travelers who love the TripAdvisor hotel shopping experience, had put in their credit cards and have now formed a habit, where they're a frequent repeat user of our app because it's just simpler and you always get the lowest price. We're not forcing that on people, to be clear, right now. But we see that as a wonderful endgame as the world moves to mobile. And if you're using us for price comparison, there isn't an obvious benefit of clicking out versus continuing your purchase on our site, unless someone else gives you the better price. And that's the challenge for the Instant Book team, is always making sure that piece of the product has the best price. When we do that, we'll earn more than our fair share for convenience. Where we don't, our business funnel says, we'll help the customer save the dollar by clicking them off to whoever does have the lowest price."

So I wouldn't say there's anything particularly different in our organic search trends. Google continues to take more space on search result pages on all devices for their own products and for other paid ads. There's nothing new in that statement. I've been say something like it for several years now. When we look at our overall marketing mix, we have more and more sort of brand traffic. We have paid traffic. We have organic traffic. We have our CRM program. And our focus, at this point, is on building, what we call, that branded direct traffic focused with a offline TV campaign in order to build more brand direct, build more loyalty to Trip when a user is in mind for shopping. So I wouldn't say it's that shift is any result of any -- it is not a result of any specific organic search trend, but it is a change for us. And it's -- we view a pretty meaningful one in terms of building the business for the long term on a large component of brand-direct channels."

Last year, in the first quarter, we posted, from memory, I believe, 14% growth for Non-Hotel, which was substantially lower than the rest of the year. And indeed, we said in our prepared remarks that we expect for the full year, Non-Hotel growth will be approaching the levels that we had for the full year of last year. So implied in that indeed is that we expect growth to be better in the rest of the year than in the first quarter. Other than underlying some of the seasonality we've seen in Vacation Rentals for instance, a continued shift to free-to-list model, which means we get paid on booking, which tends to happen in the summer rather than early on -- rather than at the time of -- at damp days or rather than at the time of booking. And then there's some currency issues in there. Our -- again, our Vacation Rentals, but also our Attractions business are, for a large part, pound driven. And of course, we had Brexit and the adjustment to the pound happening in the second quarter of last year. So all in all, a number of factors why we believe Q1 should be a lower point compared to the full year in terms of Non-Hotel growth."

And that effectively, the negative impact on EBITDA we expect from TV, you said it's ROI negative -- we believe it's ROI negative in the near term. In the long term, we think it's very much ROI positive. But it will have a near-term drag on EBITDA, just the TV campaign itself, which is offset by these 2 drivers that I talked about, partly by reallocating some of our online spend. So we've looked at our total portfolio of advertising spend and said, ""TV doesn't necessarily have to be just a bolt on."" We have looked at what does that mean for our online. And we have been allocating some spend that was on the margin less efficient than the average and allocated that for TV. And then as we highlighted, we have upgraded our outlook on profitability of our Non-Hotel segment. And those 2 factors, together for '17, happen to be roughly equivalent to the EBITDA loss we expect from the TV campaign. So together -- taken together do not have a meaningful impact on where we thought the business would be 3 months ago without this brand advertising campaign. And therefore, we are reiterating the same guidance, flat to down, that we did a quarter ago."

They think TripAdvisor for finding them the best price. That best price might be on Booking.com, and they click over to Booking.com. And they're happy with that experience. And we're fine with that. We got paid on the click and we helped drive the booking.

Hopefully, you've had a chance to read our prepared remarks that we published last night after market close. I'll summarize by saying 2017 is off to a productive start. 
In Hotels, we're rapidly aligning products, supply and marketing as we drive towards long-term growth and profitability. In a few weeks, we will roll out our streamlined hotel shopping experience, and soon thereafter, we'll launch our new brand advertising campaign, leveraging our strong global brand to build user awareness of TripAdvisor as a great place to find the lowest prices when you are ready to book. 
In Non-Hotel, our continued strong demand growth and supply investments are really starting to payoff. And while focus remains on top line growth, this segment is already beginning to exhibit attractive profit potential. 
We are addressing large growth opportunities ahead and making great progress building end-to-end products that travelers love, a bigger and better platform for advertisers and a bigger and better business over the long term.

So we all think back to Amazon that started at books and now did books and music -- and books, music. And of course, now they do everything. And they were able to do that because they had positioned themselves as a shopping site. Well, TripAdvisor is a travel site. You come to plan your trip. So we have the credibility to be able to play in a number of different aspects in that travel planning. But I couldn't go -- we wouldn't be able to sell you a pair of shoes, that's kind of not what people associate TripAdvisor. So we come from a strength, reviews, as Amazon had come from the strength books, but it's well within what users are using the site for to extend it to something else, and in our case, moving into that price comparison. So we have a large portion of our current audience and have, for the past decade, come to TripAdvisor, read reviews and move into our price comparison engine and then click off to our partners or use Instant Book to book. So that's an already established behavior pattern for a large portion of our users. Our challenge isn't, ""Hey, is that even possible? Will users do that sort of thing?"" They do. It's a huge business for us. The question is, can the TV campaign accelerate the move of the people who don't currently use us for that to join sort of the crowd that does? And a lot of people, when we ask, will say, ""Well, yes. I use it for reviews. I didn't know that you had price comparison."" And of course, I hear that and I think how could you miss that on our site. Oh my goodness, it's plastered all over the place. But you have to accept what users are telling you. When we go on TV and we talk very clearly about price comparison, find the lowest price, help save you some money as a traveler, and we repeat that TV ad numerous times, we hope to educate that individual that the site that they already know and love can now be used for this new part of the travel -- the hotel shopping experience, which they're already on TripAdvisor for. So we don't view it as a big leap or a big change. And when we look at our last TV campaign, it was focused less around the benefit of comparing prices and more teaching about -- teaching users specifically that they can now book on TripAdvisor. So we've tweaked that message. We'll be back out to the marketplace at a heavier weight with a more streamlined user experience that's focused around that hotel shopping. Think of it as less distractions on the page, more point how can we help you save some money in your shopping experience, how can we give you the best value for the hotel that you're looking for, not just the highest rated, but the best rated in your price point, those sorts of things. And we're giving ourselves time to make that message sink in through things like TV and in our other online campaigns. So I view our past TV as very instructive, useful lessons to get us to where we are now, but we have a very compelling plan to achieve these objectives that we have in front of us now."

And so part of the new shopping experience helps pull people down that funnel of putting in your dates and actually getting to see our prices and noting that we've scoured the web and found you a great price. The thing that's not new in this quarter or in this new design is where Instant Book fits into that mix, because we have been talking for several quarters about Instant Booking earning its position in our hotel shopping experience, so that we put it in front of users when we think they're most likely use it, either for price, because Instant Book might have the best price, or convenience, particularly on the phone, if it's something you've used before. So we want to build that great shopping experience. Instant Booking is a clear tool to help us do that and is a way that we can get better pricing in front of our consumers and make it more convenient, especially on the phone. But as we look forward in 2017, '18, if Instant Book -- if as some people commented, ""Well, Instant Book is not as prominent as it once was."" That's because our customers are telling us they're indifferent as to whether they are choosing to use it versus something else, and that's okay with us, hence, the comment on indifferent. We want to do what's best for our travelers. And we believe that Instant Book plays a key role in that, though not as a big a role as we had anticipated a couple of years ago."

So the U.S. is roughly half of our revenues and the other half is outside of the U.S. The U.K. is our largest market, but it's a long tail of many, many markets internationally. Part of the differential in growth rate is attributable to timing in IB and lapping of IB, but that's not the full story. Currency is one of the factors. If you compare, for instance, the pound, the U.K. being our largest non-U.S. market a year ago versus today, and then the mobile shift has tended to happen faster outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And then there are many -- there's many market-by-market differences. But generally, the overall market, the robustness of our auction, the level of competition is more favorable in the U.S. than in many places outside of the U.S. And so our anticipation is that the U.S. will remain the pace car in terms of growth in the foreseeable future, that, we believe, that in the long term, international markets can be robust growers for us, too. But the pattern will be -- the pattern of growth recovery is likely to be a little slower than we've seen in the U.S., and therefore, lag the U.S. more than just the lagging of the IB rollout."

And there is a click-off model that works quite well for us and others, but there's certainly a wonderful convenience of being able to essentially buy it with a single click, as sites like Amazon have shown. We don't see a reason why we won't be able to get there in the hotel space. And to do that, you need something that kind of looks like Instant Book or something pretty close. So if we fast forward to the time when Instant Book really does have the best pricing available on the web, it's kind of match the lowest price from anywhere, there's going to be, in our prediction, a set of travelers who love the TripAdvisor hotel shopping experience, have put in their credit cards and have now formed a habit where they're a frequent repeat user of our app because it's just simpler and you always get the lowest price. We're not forcing that on people, to be clear, right now. But we see that as a wonderful endgame as the world moves to mobile. And if you're using us for price comparison, there isn't an obvious benefit of clicking out versus continuing your purchase on our site, unless someone else gives you the better price. And that's the challenge for the Instant Book team, is always making sure that piece of the product has the best price. When we do that, we'll earn more than our fair share for convenience. Where we don't, our business funnel says we'll help the customer save the dollar by clicking them off to whoever does have the lowest price."

In terms of the desktop monetization gap, we've said in the past, it's -- mobile monetizes roughly at 1/3 of desktop, and those trends changed a little quarter-over-quarter, but not dramatically. We saw a quarter in the first quarter where there was revenue-per-shopper improvement on mobile. We had 35% -- about 35% growth of our phone revenues and about 25% growth of -- on the shopper line.

In the long term, we think it's very much ROI positive. But it will have a near-term drag on EBITDA, just the TV campaign itself, which is offset by these 2 drivers that I talked about, partly by reallocating some of our online spend. So we've looked at our total portfolio of advertising spend and said, ""TV doesn't necessarily have to be just a bolt-on."" We have looked at what does that mean for our online. And we have been allocating some spend that was on the margin less efficient than the average and allocated that towards TV. And then as we highlighted, we have upgraded our outlook on profitability of our Non-Hotel segment. And those 2 factors, together for '17, happen to be roughly equivalent to the EBITDA loss we expect from the TV campaign. So together -- taken together do not have a meaningful impact on where we thought the business would be 3 months ago without this brand advertising campaign.

Where Instant Book has a worse price for whatever reason, we're not pushing it on you because we're not asking you to spend more money for the privilege of using this path. And then rubber meets the road or the question's most relevant when you have a parity price with other providers, at which point, look, some users, we fully expect to be loyal to a different booking site. They thank TripAdvisor for finding them the best price. That best price might be on Booking.com, and they click over to Booking.com. And they're happy with that experience. And we're fine with that. We got paid on the click and we helped drive the booking. Other folks, because they're in the habit of booking on TripAdvisor, using our Instant Book with our stored credit card, will prefer the TripAdvisor option because it's literally fewer clicks to actually finish that booking. No need to switch. So our wealth of product capabilities here allows us to tailor the experience to what we think that individual traveler is looking for. And we think that's a great option. So Instant Book on the phone, when it has the better price, it's clearly a better experience than meta because it saved money. When it's a worse price, you're probably not going to see it a whole lot. And when it's a price parity, the user gets to decide, if you will, and we make our suggestion in terms of order based upon what we think the user wants to see."

In Hotels, we're rapidly aligning products, supply and marketing as we drive towards long-term growth and profitability. In a few weeks, we will roll out our streamlined hotel shopping experience, and soon thereafter, we'll launch our new brand advertising campaign, leveraging our strong global brand to build user awareness of TripAdvisor as a great place to find the lowest prices when you are ready to book. 
In Non-Hotel, our continued strong demand growth and supply investments are really starting to payoff. And while focus remains on top line growth, this segment is already beginning to exhibit attractive profit potential.

Number two, as you do sort of decommission inefficient spend, redeploying it into the brand, anything we should be aware of in the quarter-to-quarter cadence of marketing that might buck some of the usual seasonality trends on marketing?"

In terms of the long-term efficiency profile of our paid marketing spend, we expect from TV to create much more lifetime value of users that we acquire and influence from TV than we are going to be able to get with online marketing. And so with our online marketing, we have managed to, pretty short term, roughly breakeven as a channel. The ongoing benefit is more limited and difficult to prove. With TV, with a real shift of brand perception as TripAdvisor as a -- from a place just to use for planning, to use for planning plus price comparison and booking, we can get much more lasting impact on our user group. And therefore, over time, that should actually benefit our marketing efficiency profile. In terms of the seasonality of marketing spend cadence, not so much. I mean, the marketing will still be aligned very much to the seasonality of the business, which doesn't change by doing advertising."

So we all think back to Amazon that started at books and now did books and music -- and books, music. And of course, now they do everything. And they were able to do that because they had positioned themselves as a shopping site. Well, TripAdvisor is a travel site. You come to plan your trip. So we have the credibility to be able to play in a number of different aspects in that travel planning. But I couldn't go -- we wouldn't be able to sell you a pair of shoes, that's kind of not what people associate TripAdvisor. So we come from a strength, reviews, as Amazon had come from the strength books, but it's well within what users are using the site for to extend it to something else, and in our case, moving into that price comparison. So we have a large portion of our current audience and have, for the past decade, come to TripAdvisor, read reviews and move into our price comparison engine and then click off to our partners or use Instant Book to book. So that's an already established behavior pattern for a large portion of our users. Our challenge isn't, ""Hey, is that even possible? Will users do that sort of thing?"" They do. It's a huge business for us. The question is, can the TV campaign accelerate the move of the people who don't currently use us for that to join sort of the crowd that does? And a lot of people, when we ask, will say, ""Well, yes. I use it for reviews. I didn't know that you had price comparison."" And of course, I hear that and I think how could you miss that on our site. Oh my goodness, it's plastered all over the place. But you have to accept what users are telling you. When we go on TV and we talk very clearly about price comparison, find the lowest price, help save you some money as a traveler, and we repeat that TV ad numerous times, we hope to educate that individual that the site that they already know and love can now be used for this new part of the travel -- the hotel shopping experience, which they're already on TripAdvisor for. So we don't view it as a big leap or a big change. And when we look at our last TV campaign, it was focused less around the benefit of comparing prices and more teaching about -- teaching users specifically that they can now book on TripAdvisor. So we've tweaked that message. We'll be back out to the marketplace at a heavier weight with a more streamlined user experience that's focused around that hotel shopping. Think of it as less distractions on the page, more point how can we help you save some money in your shopping experience, how can we give you the best value for the hotel that you're looking for, not just the highest rated, but the best rated in your price point, those sorts of things. And we're giving ourselves time to make that message sink in through things like TV and in our other online campaigns. So I view our past TV as very instructive, useful lessons to get us to where we are now, but we have a very compelling plan to achieve these objectives that we have in front of us now."

And so part of the new shopping experience helps pull people down that funnel of putting in your dates and actually getting to see our prices and noting that we've scoured the web and found you a great price. The thing that's not new in this quarter or in this new design is where Instant Book fits into that mix, because we have been talking for several quarters about Instant Booking earning its position in our hotel shopping experience, so that we put it in front of users when we think they're most likely use it, either for price, because Instant Book might have the best price, or convenience, particularly on the phone, if it's something you've used before. So we want to build that great shopping experience. Instant Booking is a clear tool to help us do that and is a way that we can get better pricing in front of our consumers and make it more convenient, especially on the phone. But as we look forward in 2017, '18, if Instant Book -- if as some people commented, ""Well, Instant Book is not as prominent as it once was."" That's because our customers are telling us they're indifferent as to whether they are choosing to use it versus something else, and that's okay with us, hence, the comment on indifferent. We want to do what's best for our travelers. And we believe that Instant Book plays a key role in that, though not as a big a role as we had anticipated a couple of years ago."

So the U.S. is roughly half of our revenues and the other half is outside of the U.S. The U.K. is our largest market, but it's a long tail of many, many markets internationally. Part of the differential in growth rate is attributable to timing in IB and lapping of IB, but that's not the full story. Currency is one of the factors. If you compare, for instance, the pound, the U.K. being our largest non-U.S. market a year ago versus today, and then the mobile shift has tended to happen faster outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And then there are many -- there's many market-by-market differences. But generally, the overall market, the robustness of our auction, the level of competition is more favorable in the U.S. than in many places outside of the U.S. And so our anticipation is that the U.S. will remain the pace car in terms of growth in the foreseeable future, that, we believe, that in the long term, international markets can be robust growers for us, too. But the pattern will be -- the pattern of growth recovery is likely to be a little slower than we've seen in the U.S., and therefore, lag the U.S. more than just the lagging of the IB rollout."

And there is a click-off model that works quite well for us and others, but there's certainly a wonderful convenience of being able to essentially buy it with a single click, as sites like Amazon have shown. We don't see a reason why we won't be able to get there in the hotel space. And to do that, you need something that kind of looks like Instant Book or something pretty close. So if we fast forward to the time when Instant Book really does have the best pricing available on the web, it's kind of match the lowest price from anywhere, there's going to be, in our prediction, a set of travelers who love the TripAdvisor hotel shopping experience, have put in their credit cards and have now formed a habit where they're a frequent repeat user of our app because it's just simpler and you always get the lowest price. We're not forcing that on people, to be clear, right now. But we see that as a wonderful endgame as the world moves to mobile. And if you're using us for price comparison, there isn't an obvious benefit of clicking out versus continuing your purchase on our site, unless someone else gives you the better price. And that's the challenge for the Instant Book team, is always making sure that piece of the product has the best price. When we do that, we'll earn more than our fair share for convenience.

So the U.S., I think it's a little bit difficult to untangle after so many years of how much of the RPS is this or the other. I do want to comment is that the -- we make continuous improvements on our revenue per shopper on desktop and in mobile. And in the U.S., we have been able to do that. And we've been making continuous improvements on Instant Booking. We said a few quarters ago already that we -- in the U.S., Instant Booking was no longer dilutive to the overall offering. And we've been improving both meta and IB since then. So I think it's a combination of factors, but it's just a sign that after incorporating -- fully incorporating Instant Booking in the U.S., now we -- we're off -- we're now better off than we were in '14 and continue to show impressive growth to our revenue per shopper. In terms of the desktop monetization gap, we've said in the past, it's -- mobile monetizes roughly at 1/3 of desktop, and those trends changed a little quarter-over-quarter, but not dramatically. We saw a quarter in the first quarter where there was revenue-per-shopper improvement on mobile. We had 35% -- about 35% growth of our phone revenues and about 25% growth of -- on the shopper line. And so we're very pleased with that. And we continue to plug away at making sure that we make that gap as small as we can. And then in terms of the -- your last question about the Q2. Yes, again, with mobile as with the general comments I was making, quarter-to-quarter, there may be some volatility in revenue per shopper or in monetization of mobile, but the long-term trend is pretty stable."

So I wouldn't say there's anything particularly different in our organic search trends. Google continues to take more space on search result pages on all devices for their own products and for other paid ads. There's nothing new in that statement. I've been say something like it for several years now. When we look at our overall marketing mix, we have more and more sort of brand traffic. We have paid traffic. We have organic traffic. We have our CRM program. And our focus, at this point, is on building, what we call, that branded direct traffic, focused with an offline TV campaign, in order to build more brand direct, build more loyalty to Trip when a user is in mind for shopping. So I wouldn't say it's -- that shift is any result of any -- it is not a result of any specific organic search trend, but it is a change for us.

Last year, in the first quarter, we posted, from memory, I believe, 14% growth for Non-Hotel, which was substantially lower than the rest of the year. And indeed, we said in our prepared remarks that we expect for the full year, Non-Hotel growth will be approaching the levels that we had for the full year of last year. So implied in that indeed is that we expect growth to be better in the rest of the year than in the first quarter. Other than underlying some of the seasonality we've seen in Vacation Rentals for instance, a continued shift to free-to-list model, which means we get paid on booking, which tends to happen in the summer rather than early on -- rather than at the time of -- time of stay rather than at the time of booking. And then there's some currency issues in there. Our -- again, our Vacation Rentals, but also our Attractions business are, for a large part, pound driven. And of course, we had Brexit and the adjustment to the pound happening in the second quarter of last year.

And that effectively, the negative impact on EBITDA we expect from TV, you said it's ROI negative -- we believe it's ROI negative in the near term. In the long term, we think it's very much ROI positive. But it will have a near-term drag on EBITDA, just the TV campaign itself, which is offset by these 2 drivers that I talked about, partly by reallocating some of our online spend. So we've looked at our total portfolio of advertising spend and said, ""TV doesn't necessarily have to be just a bolt-on."" We have looked at what does that mean for our online. And we have been allocating some spend that was on the margin less efficient than the average and allocated that towards TV. And then as we highlighted, we have upgraded our outlook on profitability of our Non-Hotel segment. And those 2 factors, together for '17, happen to be roughly equivalent to the EBITDA loss we expect from the TV campaign. So together -- taken together do not have a meaningful impact on where we thought the business would be 3 months ago without this brand advertising campaign. And therefore, we are reiterating the same guidance, flat to down, that we did a quarter ago."

Where Instant Book has a worse price for whatever reason, we're not pushing it on you because we're not asking you to spend more money for the privilege of using this path. And then rubber meets the road or the question's most relevant when you have a parity price with other providers, at which point, look, some users, we fully expect to be loyal to a different booking site. They thank TripAdvisor for finding them the best price. That best price might be on Booking.com, and they click over to Booking.com. And they're happy with that experience. And we're fine with that. We got paid on the click and we helped drive the booking. Other folks, because they're in the habit of booking on TripAdvisor, using our Instant Book with our stored credit card, will prefer the TripAdvisor option because it's literally fewer clicks to actually finish that booking. No need to switch. So our wealth of product capabilities here allows us to tailor the experience to what we think that individual traveler is looking for. And we think that's a great option. So Instant Book on the phone, when it has the better price, it's clearly a better experience than meta because it saved money.

Q2 consolidated total revenue growth accelerated to 8%, and TripAdvisor click-based and transaction revenue grew 6%, which was squarely in line with our expectations. Currency headwinds were approximately 2% to each of these 2 revenue lines during the period. Non-Hotel segment revenue growth accelerated to 31%, driven primarily by continued strong traction of our attractions and restaurant businesses. This segment also demonstrated a strong market -- margin potential, delivering 17% adjusted EBITDA margin amidst continued investment in long-term growth. Looking ahead, as described in last night's prepared remarks, some recent trends have softened our full year revenue outlook a bit, though our adjusted EBITDA outlook remains intact. This is primarily driven by our outperformance in Non-Hotel. Most importantly, our product and brand marketing initiatives are now in flight and are showing positive early signals. Over time, as more visit TripAdvisor to find and book their travel experiences, the more transformation it will be to our long-term revenue growth, marketing efficiency and profit.

But by virtue of making the design cleaner and simpler and more efficient for a hotel shopper, we regained that in terms of monetization capabilities. So when we look at it, no, there's no clear desktop monetization headwind that we're talking about or that we're facing that we have done. Really desktop traffic, in general, is declining and mobile's growing and we face that issue like every other company. When we look at our opportunities in the second half of the year, because a lot of the heavy lifting in the redesign is now released, we're able to get back on a really nice fast pace for optimizations. So that is something that we know how to do very well. We have done it for years. We have a new foundation that we're really pretty excited about on all devices, and now we how a fairly large team up and running and making regular improvements in the -- in our revenue per shopper, in our conversion, which, at the end of the day, certainly helps us economically but really helps our traveler find what they're looking for faster and easier or at the best possible price. You'd see more of that. We would all see more of that dropping to the bottom line. We're look forward to shift from desktop to mobile, causing that kind of monetization headwind, which is, again, why we're pretty excited about the conversion improvements that we've made on the phone and how that rev per shopper has grown. It just still has always to go to get closer to desktop."

It's really -- we said we're on a roughly 3- to 5-year journey with our Non-Hotel business where we're investing significantly in the early stages in supply expansion, in particular in marketing channels. And we're now getting to a scale where we see some impressive efficiencies. So if you go to different efficiencies on the marketing line, we see efficiencies. We continue to grow disproportionately fast on our TripAdvisor channel, so making attractions available to TripAdvisor users, which is a great growth channel for us and allows more marketing efficiency compared to before. We have large app penetration and a great ability to offer attractions to our users. So marketing efficiency, but then just operational efficiency as well. So initially, a lot of manpower going into both site development as well as supply expansion and we're now reaping some of the leverage benefits from that going forward. So you are right, we are managing the business not for profitability. We're managing it for growth. There's just tremendous opportunity in terms of the TAM of this -- particularly the attractions market space. We feel we have an early lead and we continue to invest aggressively to capitalize on that advantage. So we're not seeking margin expansion, and going forward, we will continue to  emphasize revenue growth. But the way the business has evolved has allowed us to see some margin expansion this year."

The TAM is phenomenally large. We would certainly argue we are the current leader in the space. We've put many -- what we put the past 3 years into building a more and more impressive supply footprint, getting the things that people want to do in-destination on our platform. You can't have a great conversion rate unless you have the things that people want, and we're by no means done in that category by way of supply, but a lot of the heavy lifting is there. So now we get to focus on conversion and the team has been doing just great work. And conversion makes the traveler happier. They get to find what they want, book what they. The margins of the business are great. We're not trying to maximize that piece. But if you take conversion as your near term, you take marketing channel growth as your kind of midterm driver and continued growth and supply as your long-term driver, you've got a set of beautiful characteristics. TripAdvisor already has so much attraction demand for everything, not just bookable items. So we have to speak in growing demand funnel that's been happening organically. We have our Viator point-of-sale and our third-party business. And as you grow in scale and as more people get used to booking online, which is a trend we're helping but I wouldn't say we're driving, all those come back and you're looking at a business that basically has almost all tailwinds to it. And with our ability to invest in it, we love what we see pretty much every way we look at it."

We have some of that, of course, because we do a lot of hotel business. But truly, most of it is people who are on our site because they are looking for  attractions, and this gets into one of the themes that we started several years ago when investing in restaurants and attractions is we have hundreds of millions of folks who are very happy, very loyal using our site for these other benefits that we were either poorly monetizing or not monetizing at all. And so now you see the attraction shopper on TripAdvisor turning into a real revenue. And it's through the Viator acquisition and the great work that, that team has been doing to build up supply and matching that supply with the things that are popular on TripAdvisor.

In Hotels, it's still early days and there is much more work to do but our new hotel shopping experience and television campaign have delivered some nice early signals of success, conveying the message that TripAdvisor helps users find the lowest hotel prices. 
In Non-Hotels, we have continued executing well on our 3- to 5-year growth strategy and are pleased that our recent results have begun to highlight not only the -- our continued market share gains, but also this segment's attractive longer-term margin potential. 
Our strong global brand, differentiated end-to-end product offering, growing mobile engagement and solid financial position uniquely position us to gain share in the large and growing travel market opportunity. We are making progress and we like the path we're on."

Q2 consolidated total revenue growth accelerated to 8%, and TripAdvisor click-based and transaction revenue grew 6%, which was squarely in line with our expectations. Currency headwinds were approximately 2% to each of these 2 revenue lines during the period. Non-Hotel segment revenue growth accelerated to 31%, driven primarily by continued strong traction of our Attractions and Restaurant businesses. This segment also demonstrated its strong market -- margin potential, delivering 17% adjusted EBITDA margin amidst continued investment in long-term growth. 
Looking ahead, as described in last night's prepared remarks, some recent trends have softened our full year revenue outlook a bit, though our adjusted EBITDA outlook remains intact. This is primarily driven by our outperformance in Non-Hotel. Most importantly, our product and brand marketing initiatives are now in flight and are showing positive early signals. Over time, as more users visit TripAdvisor to find and book their travel experiences, the more transformation it will be to our long-term revenue growth, marketing efficiency and profit. 
With that, we'll open the call to your questions."

Really desktop traffic, in general, is declining and mobile's growing and we face that issue like every other company. When we look at our opportunities in the second half of the year, because a lot of the heavy lifting in the redesign is now released, we're able to get back on a really nice fast pace for optimizations.

You'd see more of that. We would all see more of that dropping to the bottom line were it not for the shift from desktop to mobile causing that kind of monetization headwind, which is, again, why we're pretty excited about the conversion improvements that we've made on the phone and how that rev per shopper has grown.

Is it increasing inventory for tourist and attractions or marketing for Viator or LaFourchette inventory and marketing or something else?"

In terms of the margin expansion, yes, very pleasing. It's really -- we've said we were on a roughly 3- to 5-year journey with our Non-Hotel business where we're investing significantly in the early stages in supply expansion, in particular in marketing channels, and we're now getting to a scale where we see some impressive efficiencies. So if you go through the efficiencies, on the marketing line we see efficiencies. We continue to grow disproportionately fast on our TripAdvisor channel, so making attractions available to TripAdvisor users, which is a great growth channel for us and allows more marketing efficiency compared to before. We have large app penetration and a great ability to offer attractions to our users. So marketing efficiency, but then just operational efficiency as well. So initially, a lot of manpower going into both site development as well as supply expansion and we're now reaping some of the leverage benefits from that going forward. So you are right, we are managing the business not for profitability, we're managing it for growth. There is this tremendous opportunity in terms of the TAM of this -- particularly the Attractions market space. We feel we have an early lead and we continue to invest aggressively to capitalize on that advantage. So we're not seeking margin expansion, and going forward, we will continue to  emphasize revenue growth. But the way the business has evolved has allowed us to see some margin expansion this year."

The TAM is phenomenally large. We would certainly argue we are the current leader in the space. We've put many -- we've put the past 3 years into building a more and more impressive supply footprint, getting the things that people want to do in-destination on our platform. You can't have a great conversion rate unless you have the things that people want, and we're by no means done in that category by way of supply, but a lot of the heavy lifting is there. So now we get to focus on conversion and the team has been doing just great work and conversion makes the traveler happier. They get to find what they want, book what they want. The margins of the business are great. We're not trying to maximize that piece. But if you take conversion as your near term, you take marketing channel growth as your kind of midterm driver and continued growth and supply as your long-term driver, you've got a set of beautiful characteristics. TripAdvisor already has so much attraction demand for everything, not just bookable items. So we have this big and growing demand funnel that's been happening organically. We have our Viator point-of-sale and our third-party business. And as you grow in scale and as more people get used to booking online, which is a trend we're helping but I wouldn't say we're driving, all those come back and you're looking at a business that basically has almost all tailwinds to it. And with our ability to invest in it, we love what we see pretty much every way we look at it."

We have some of that, of course, because we do a lot of hotel business. But truly, most of it is people who are on our site because they are looking for  attractions and this gets into one of the themes that we started several years ago when investing in restaurants and attractions is we have hundreds of millions of folks who are very happy, very loyal using our site for these other benefits that we were either poorly monetizing or not monetizing at all. And so now you see the attraction shopper on TripAdvisor turning into a real revenue and it's through the Viator acquisition and the great work that, that team has been doing to build up supply and matching that supply with the things that are popular on TripAdvisor. To your second question, certainly, we've shown the RPS improvements on the phone. We actually have rev per shopper improvements on desktop as well. It's just that because of that mix shift, the overall RPS dropped a little bit. When we look at things we've done on the app and mobile web, it's in part better experience, in part; it's faster, in part. These are -- experience helps you find what you're looking for better and we've increased our rate of testing on, frankly, all devices but very specifically on mobile web as we've seen that traffic just shoot up. KPIs on just the homepage, no, I don't really have anything new to share there. I can simply point to the entire site redesign and then point to the metrics that say it's clearly worked for us to be effective.

But as we move the product, the display, the visibility and the impression of TripAdvisor on the part of our travelers to view us as that review site, that review site that actually saved me a ton of money because it offered me a great value hotel that I wouldn't have otherwise find with a better price or it helped to me find the best place to actually reserve a room at this hotel that I wanted to go at, and that's kind of a new piece. And so part of the site redesign was clarity. Part of the site redesign was easier shopping experience.

I hope you've all had a chance to read our prepared remarks we issued last night. In summary, we made important progress on our 2017 initiatives, laying the foundation for future growth. In Hotels, it's still early days and there is much more work to do but our new hotel shopping experience and television campaign have delivered some nice early signals of success, conveying the message that TripAdvisor helps users find the lowest hotel prices. 
In Non-Hotels, we have continued executing well on our 3- to 5-year growth strategy and are pleased that our recent results have begun to highlight not only the -- our continued market share gains, but also this segment's attractive longer-term margin potential. 
Our strong global brand, differentiated end-to-end product offering, growing mobile engagement and solid financial position uniquely position us to gain share in the large and growing travel market opportunity. We are making progress and we like the path we're on."

Q2 consolidated total revenue growth accelerated to 8%, and TripAdvisor click-based and transaction revenue grew 6%, which was squarely in line with our expectations. Currency headwinds were approximately 2% to each of these 2 revenue lines during the period. Non-Hotel segment revenue growth accelerated to 31%, driven primarily by continued strong traction of our Attractions and Restaurant businesses. This segment also demonstrated its strong market -- margin potential, delivering 17% adjusted EBITDA margin amidst continued investment in long-term growth. 
Looking ahead, as described in last night's prepared remarks, some recent trends have softened our full year revenue outlook a bit, though our adjusted EBITDA outlook remains intact. This is primarily driven by our outperformance in Non-Hotel. Most importantly, our product and brand marketing initiatives are now in flight and are showing positive early signals. Over time, as more users visit TripAdvisor to find and book their travel experiences, the more transformation it will be to our long-term revenue growth, marketing efficiency and profit. 
With that, we'll open the call to your questions."

So the ROI is going to be reflected in branded traffic. It's going to be reflected in the conversion rate of our clicks that come -- of the travelers that come to TripAdvisor and then click downstream to our partners in kind of how qualified are those folks and the overall ratios of folks coming to TripAdvisor, what percent of them are down-funnel enough that they're ready to buy.

We took away a few of the features that had generated some money for us. But by virtue of making the design cleaner and simpler and more efficient for a hotel shopper, we regained that in terms of monetization capabilities. So when we look at it, no, there is no clear desktop monetization headwind that we're talking about or that we're facing that we have done. Really desktop traffic, in general, is declining and mobile's growing and we face that issue like every other company. When we look at our opportunities in the second half of the year, because a lot of the heavy lifting in the redesign is now released, we're able to get back on a really nice fast pace for optimizations. So that is something that we know how to do very well. We have done it for years. We have a new foundation that we're really pretty excited about on all devices, and now we how a fairly large team up and running and making regular improvements in the -- in our revenue per shopper, in our conversion, which, at the end of the day, certainly helps us economically but really helps our traveler find what they're looking for faster and easier and at the best possible price. You'd see more of that. We would all see more of that dropping to the bottom line were it not for the shift from desktop to mobile causing that kind of monetization headwind, which is, again, why we're pretty excited about the conversion improvements that we've made on the phone and how that rev per shopper has grown.

So if you go through the efficiencies, on the marketing line we see efficiencies. We continue to grow disproportionately fast on our TripAdvisor channel, so making attractions available to TripAdvisor users, which is a great growth channel for us and allows more marketing efficiency compared to before. We have large app penetration and a great ability to offer attractions to our users. So marketing efficiency, but then just operational efficiency as well. So initially, a lot of manpower going into both site development as well as supply expansion and we're now reaping some of the leverage benefits from that going forward.

The TAM is phenomenally large. We would certainly argue we are the current leader in the space. We've put many -- we've put the past 3 years into building a more and more impressive supply footprint, getting the things that people want to do in-destination on our platform. You can't have a great conversion rate unless you have the things that people want, and we're by no means done in that category by way of supply, but a lot of the heavy lifting is there. So now we get to focus on conversion and the team has been doing just great work and conversion makes the traveler happier. They get to find what they want, book what they want. The margins of the business are great. We're not trying to maximize that piece. But if you take conversion as your near term, you take marketing channel growth as your kind of midterm driver and continued growth and supply as your long-term driver, you've got a set of beautiful characteristics. TripAdvisor already has so much attraction demand for everything, not just bookable items. So we have this big and growing demand funnel that's been happening organically. We have our Viator point-of-sale and our third-party business. And as you grow in scale and as more people get used to booking online, which is a trend we're helping but I wouldn't say we're driving, all those come back and you're looking at a business that basically has almost all tailwinds to it. And with our ability to invest in it, we love what we see pretty much every way we look at it."

We have some of that, of course, because we do a lot of hotel business. But truly, most of it is people who are on our site because they are looking for  attractions and this gets into one of the themes that we started several years ago when investing in restaurants and attractions is we have hundreds of millions of folks who are very happy, very loyal using our site for these other benefits that we were either poorly monetizing or not monetizing at all. And so now you see the attraction shopper on TripAdvisor turning into a real revenue and it's through the Viator acquisition and the great work that, that team has been doing to build up supply and matching that supply with the things that are popular on TripAdvisor. To your second question, certainly, we've shown the RPS improvements on the phone. We actually have rev per shopper improvements on desktop as well. It's just that because of that mix shift, the overall RPS dropped a little bit. When we look at things we've done on the app and mobile web, it's in part better experience, in part; it's faster, in part. These are -- experience helps you find what you're looking for better and we've increased our rate of testing on, frankly, all devices but very specifically on mobile web as we've seen that traffic just shoot up. KPIs on just the homepage, no, I don't really have anything new to share there. I can simply point to the entire site redesign and then point to the metrics that say it's clearly worked for us to be effective. We've studied it with our focus groups and it's clearly worked from their perspective, reducing clutter, easier to find what you're looking for, a set of other questions.

But we -- at the same time, we believe that the current third -- 1/3 monetization has significant upside to it. So we expect to narrow the difference, but not quite get there over time.

We're so well known for reviews, which is wonderful, incredible, differentiator. It's hard to imagine anyone could ever make a serious inroad to us in terms of being a competitor in that space. But as we move the product, the display, the visibility and the impression of TripAdvisor on the part of our travelers to view us as that review site, that review site that actually saved me a ton of money because it offered me a great value hotel that I wouldn't have otherwise find with a better price or it helped to me find the best place to actually reserve a room at this hotel that I wanted to go at, and that's kind of a new piece. And so part of the site redesign was clarity. Part of the site redesign was easier shopping experience. But one of the things that we love the most from our testing that we've achieved in this redesign is that we are educating our users, our travelers that we're helping to save them money, that we're finding them great prices and we see that come through in our surveys. We see that come through in the anecdotes, in the stories and that matches, of course, the big message in our brand campaigns."

And as we were testing different formats for that, we incurred some losses in April and May, smallish losses but impacting, which, by the end of May, we had neutralized, as Steve just described. So that is what the comment was about. It was not anything broader than that. In terms of Non-Hotel, yes, we see continued opportunity to show impressive growth in Attractions and in Restaurants going forward. So as we look at the TAM ahead of us and the inroads that we're making, we believe that line can continue to grow over the next years. And although as I said before, the path on margin may not be linear because we're focused on revenue growth, but we do believe that margins in this business are -- can be very helpful -- healthy and can be Hotel-like. And so we look at that business over the next 3 to 5 years and do our projections of revenue growth, market share gains and long-term margin and believe this will be a meaningful contributor to our overall revenue and overall profit pool 3 to 5 years from now."

It's not a stretch to see how our spokesperson can start talking about any of the other things that we currently do on the site along the same vein. It's not giving any comments on whether we will or won't do that short or long term. But we know we have so much more to offer than just hotel bookings and price comparison. But that's clearly, without a doubt, the #1 message we want to get across to consumers right now and we've chosen not to obviously dilute that message with all the other great value that we provide. Note, with Attractions growing the way it is, Restaurants growing even faster, we clearly already have a good sort of growth model in place in those areas.

In Hotels, it's still early days and there is much more work to do, but our new hotel shopping experience and television campaign have delivered some nice early signals of success, conveying the message that TripAdvisor helps users find the lowest hotel prices. 
In Non-Hotels, we have continued executing well on our 3- to 5-year growth strategy and are pleased that our recent results have begun to highlight not only the -- our continued market share gains, but also this segment's attractive longer-term margin potential. 
Our strong global brand, differentiated end-to-end product offering, growing mobile engagement and solid financial position uniquely position us to gain share in the large and growing travel market opportunity. We are making progress and we like the path we're on."

Q2 consolidated total revenue growth accelerated to 8%, and TripAdvisor click-based and transaction revenue grew 6%, which was squarely in line with our expectations. Currency headwinds were approximately 2% to each of these 2 revenue lines during the period. Non-Hotel segment revenue growth accelerated to 31%, driven primarily by continued strong traction of our Attractions and Restaurant businesses. This segment also demonstrated its strong market -- margin potential, delivering 17% adjusted EBITDA margin amidst continued investment in long-term growth. 
Looking ahead, as described in last night's prepared remarks, some recent trends have softened our full year revenue outlook a bit, though our adjusted EBITDA outlook remains intact. This is primarily driven by our outperformance in Non-Hotel. Most importantly, our product and brand marketing initiatives are now in flight and are showing positive early signals. Over time, as more users visit TripAdvisor to find and book their travel experiences, the more transformation it will be to our long-term revenue growth, marketing efficiency and profit. 
With that, we'll open the call to your questions."

So the ROI is going to be reflected in branded traffic.

We took away a few of the features that had generated some money for us. But by virtue of making the design cleaner and simpler and more efficient for a hotel shopper, we regained that in terms of monetization capabilities. So when we look at it, no, there is no clear desktop monetization headwind that we're talking about or that we're facing that we have done. Really desktop traffic, in general, is declining and mobile's growing and we face that issue like every other company. When we look at our opportunities in the second half of the year, because a lot of the heavy lifting in the redesign is now released, we're able to get back on a really nice fast pace for optimizations. So that is something that we know how to do very well. We have done it for years. We have a new foundation that we're really pretty excited about on all devices, and now we how a fairly large team up and running and making regular improvements in the -- in our revenue per shopper, in our conversion, which, at the end of the day, certainly helps us economically but really helps our traveler find what they're looking for faster and easier and at the best possible price. You'd see more of that, we would all see more of that dropping to the bottom line were it not for the shift from desktop to mobile causing that kind of monetization headwind, which is, again, why we're pretty excited about the conversion improvements that we've made on the phone and how that rev per shopper has grown.

So if you go through the different efficiencies, on the marketing line we see efficiencies. We continue to grow disproportionately fast on our TripAdvisor channel, so making attractions available to TripAdvisor users, which is a great growth channel for us and allows more marketing efficiency compared to before. We have large app penetration and a great ability to offer attractions to our users. So marketing efficiency, but then just operational efficiency as well. So initially, a lot of manpower going into both site development as well as supply expansion and we're now reaping some of the leverage benefits from that going forward.

The TAM is phenomenally large. We would certainly argue we are the current leader in the space. We've put many -- we've put the past 3 years into building a more and more impressive supply footprint, getting the things that people want to do in-destination on our platform. You can't have a great conversion rate unless you have the things that people want. And we're by no means done in that category by way of supply, but a lot of the heavy lifting is there. So now we get to focus on conversion and the team has been doing just great work. And conversion makes the traveler happier. They get to find what they want, book what they want. The margins of the business are great. We're not trying to maximize that piece. But if you take conversion as your near term, you take marketing channel growth as your kind of midterm driver and continued growth in supply as your long-term driver, you've got a set of beautiful characteristics. TripAdvisor already has so much attraction demand for everything, not just bookable items. So we have this big and growing demand funnel that's been happening organically. We have our Viator point-of-sale and our third-party business. And as you grow in scale and as more people get used to booking online, which is a trend we're helping but I wouldn't say we're driving, all those come back and you're looking at a business that basically has almost all tailwinds to it.

We have some of that, of course, because we do a lot of hotel business. But truly, most of it is people who are on our site because they are looking for  attractions. And this gets into one of the themes that we started several years ago when investing in restaurants and attractions is we have hundreds of millions of folks who are very happy, very loyal, using our site for these other benefits that we were either poorly monetizing or not monetizing at all. And so now you see the attraction shopper on TripAdvisor turning into real revenue, and it's through the Viator acquisition and the great work that, that team has been doing to build up supply and matching that supply with the things that are popular on TripAdvisor. To your second question, certainly, we've shown the RPS improvements on the phone. We actually have rev-per-shopper improvements on desktop as well. It's just that because of that mix shift, the overall RPS dropped a little bit. When we look at things we've done on the app and mobile web, it's in part better experience; in part, it's faster; in part, the user experience helps you find what you're looking for better and we've increased our rate of testing on, frankly, all devices, but very specifically on mobile web as we've seen that traffic just shoot up. KPIs on just the homepage, no, I don't really have anything new to share there. I can simply point to the entire site redesign and then point to the metrics that say it's clearly worked [ from our perspective ].

We're so well known for reviews, which is wonderful, incredible differentiator. It's hard to imagine anyone could ever make a serious inroad to us in terms of being a competitor in that space. But as we move the product, the display, the visibility and the impression of TripAdvisor on the part of our travelers to view us as that review site, that review site that actually saved me a ton of money because it offered me a great-value hotel that I wouldn't have otherwise find with a better price or it helped to me find the best place to actually reserve a room at this hotel that I wanted to go at, and that's kind of a new piece. And so part of the site redesign was clarity. Part of the site redesign was an easier shopping experience. But one of the things that we love the most from our testing that we've achieved in this redesign is that we are educating our users, our travelers, that we're helping to save them money, that we're finding them great prices and we see that come through in our surveys.

And as we were testing different formats for that, we incurred some losses in April and May, smallish losses but impacting, which, by the end of May, we had neutralized, as Steve just described. So that is what the comment was about. It was not anything broader than that. In terms of Non-Hotel, yes, we see continued opportunity to show impressive growth in Attractions and in Restaurants going forward. So as we look at the TAM ahead of us and the inroads that we're making, we believe that line can continue to grow over the next years. And although as I said before, the path on margin may not be linear because we're focused on revenue growth, but we do believe that margins in this business are -- can be very helpful -- healthy and can be Hotel-like. And so we look at that business over the next 3 to 5 years and do our projections of revenue growth, market share gains and long-term margin and believe this will be a meaningful contributor to our overall revenue and overall profit pool 3 to 5 years from now."

It's not a stretch to see how our spokesperson can start talking about any of the other things that we currently do on the site along the same vein. It's not giving any comments on whether we will or won't do that short or long term. But we know we have so much more to offer than just hotel bookings and price comparison. But that's clearly, without a doubt, the #1 message we want to get across to consumers right now and we've chosen not to obviously dilute that message with all the other great value that we provide. Note, with Attractions growing the way it is, Restaurants growing even faster, we clearly already have a good sort of growth model in place in those areas, so it's not like they need extra attention at the moment."

This segment also demonstrated its strong market -- margin potential, delivering 17% adjusted EBITDA margin amidst continued investment in long-term growth. 
Looking ahead, as described in last night's prepared remarks, some recent trends have softened our full year revenue outlook a bit, though our adjusted EBITDA outlook remains intact. This is primarily driven by our outperformance in Non-Hotel. Most importantly, our product and brand marketing initiatives are now in flight and are showing positive early signals.

So the ROI is going to be reflected in branded traffic.

We took away a few of the features that had generated some money for us. But by virtue of making the design cleaner and simpler and more efficient for a hotel shopper, we regained that in terms of monetization capabilities. So when we look at it, no, there is no clear desktop monetization headwind that we're talking about or that we're facing that we have done. Really desktop traffic, in general, is declining and mobile's growing and we face that issue like every other company. When we look at our opportunities in the second half of the year, because a lot of the heavy lifting in the redesign is now released, we're able to get back on a really nice fast pace for optimizations. So that is something that we know how to do very well. We have done it for years. We have a new foundation that we're really pretty excited about on all devices, and now we how a fairly large team up and running and making regular improvements in the -- in our revenue per shopper, in our conversion, which, at the end of the day, certainly helps us economically but really helps our traveler find what they're looking for faster and easier and at the best possible price. You'd see more of that, we would all see more of that dropping to the bottom line were it not for the shift from desktop to mobile causing that kind of monetization headwind, which is, again, why we're pretty excited about the conversion improvements that we've made on the phone and how that rev per shopper has grown.

So if you go through the different efficiencies, on the marketing line we see efficiencies. We continue to grow disproportionately fast on our TripAdvisor channel, so making attractions available to TripAdvisor users, which is a great growth channel for us and allows more marketing efficiency compared to before. We have large app penetration and a great ability to offer attractions to our users. So marketing efficiency, but then just operational efficiency as well. So initially, a lot of manpower going into both site development as well as supply expansion and we're now reaping some of the leverage benefits from that going forward.

We've put many -- we've put the past 3 years into building a more and more impressive supply footprint, getting the things that people want to do in-destination on our platform. You can't have a great conversion rate unless you have the things that people want. And we're by no means done in that category by way of supply, but a lot of the heavy lifting is there. So now we get to focus on conversion and the team has been doing just great work. And conversion makes the traveler happier. They get to find what they want, book what they want. The margins of the business are great. We're not trying to maximize that piece. But if you take conversion as your near term, you take marketing channel growth as your kind of midterm driver and continued growth in supply as your long-term driver, you've got a set of beautiful characteristics. TripAdvisor already has so much attraction demand for everything, not just bookable items. So we have this big and growing demand funnel that's been happening organically. We have our Viator point-of-sale and our third-party business. And as you grow in scale and as more people get used to booking online, which is a trend we're helping but I wouldn't say we're driving, all those come back and you're looking at a business that basically has almost all tailwinds to it.

A lot of that revenue is driven by paid marketing channels and, as a result, doesn't have a direct negative impact on the bottom line. We also continue to make some of the margin trade-offs on efficiency. But importantly, our Non-Hotel business has been doing really well and continues to do really well. So in that mix, despite the fact that we have lowered our outlook on revenue, we have essentially not changed our outlook on EBITDA. We're saying flat to down and continue to say flat to down. I get a question -- often get asked, can you range that? What is down? I look at some of the range of sell-side estimates out there and I don't think there's much confusion about what that may imply."

We have some of that, of course, because we do a lot of hotel business. But truly, most of it is people who are on our site because they are looking for  attractions. And this gets into one of the themes that we started several years ago when investing in restaurants and attractions is we have hundreds of millions of folks who are very happy, very loyal, using our site for these other benefits that we were either poorly monetizing or not monetizing at all. And so now you see the attraction shopper on TripAdvisor turning into real revenue, and it's through the Viator acquisition and the great work that, that team has been doing to build up supply and matching that supply with the things that are popular on TripAdvisor. To your second question, certainly, we've shown the RPS improvements on the phone. We actually have rev-per-shopper improvements on desktop as well. It's just that because of that mix shift, the overall RPS dropped a little bit. When we look at things we've done on the app and mobile web, it's in part better experience; in part, it's faster; in part, the user experience helps you find what you're looking for better and we've increased our rate of testing on, frankly, all devices, but very specifically on mobile web as we've seen that traffic just shoot up. KPIs on just the homepage, no, I don't really have anything new to share there. I can simply point to the entire site redesign and then point to the metrics that say it's clearly worked [ from our perspective ].

We're so well known for reviews, which is wonderful, incredible differentiator. It's hard to imagine anyone could ever make a serious inroad to us in terms of being a competitor in that space. But as we move the product, the display, the visibility and the impression of TripAdvisor on the part of our travelers to view us as that review site, that review site that actually saved me a ton of money because it offered me a great-value hotel that I wouldn't have otherwise find with a better price or it helped to me find the best place to actually reserve a room at this hotel that I wanted to go at, and that's kind of a new piece. And so part of the site redesign was clarity. Part of the site redesign was an easier shopping experience. But one of the things that we love the most from our testing that we've achieved in this redesign is that we are educating our users, our travelers, that we're helping to save them money, that we're finding them great prices and we see that come through in our surveys.

And as we were testing different formats for that, we incurred some losses in April and May, smallish losses but impacting, which, by the end of May, we had neutralized, as Steve just described. So that is what the comment was about. It was not anything broader than that. In terms of Non-Hotel, yes, we see continued opportunity to show impressive growth in Attractions and in Restaurants going forward. So as we look at the TAM ahead of us and the inroads that we're making, we believe that line can continue to grow over the next years. And although as I said before, the path on margin may not be linear because we're focused on revenue growth, but we do believe that margins in this business are -- can be very helpful -- healthy and can be Hotel-like.

It's not a stretch to see how our spokesperson can start talking about any of the other things that we currently do on the site along the same vein. It's not giving any comments on whether we will or won't do that short or long term. But we know we have so much more to offer than just hotel bookings and price comparison.

We're growing -- we're particularly growing faster our TripAdvisor platforms for Attractions, for instance, but also for Vacation Rentals, which has allowed us to be more inefficient with our marketing spend this year compared to other years, and its overall scale benefits actually that's driving most of the margin expansion in that segment this year."

So our revenue per shopper year-on-year was negative 11%. We bid separately for traffic on desktop and on mobile. The total was down 11%. Mobile RPS was up. Desktop was down but actually less down than the 11%. So the 11% is, to a significant degree, also driven by the mix shift between the lower monetizing mobile traffic. So in the meantime, we are improving our product quite significantly. One of the things that we called out is that when we look at in the quarter, the year on year performance of the -- just the economic value the underlying leads bring that we provide to our partners, that has been improving. So the decline that we've seen on desktop revenue per shopper has been largely driven by these partner bid-downs. So while these partner bid-downs have happened, we've also made significant strides in positive development. And as we think about our marketing budget, the performance-based marketing budget and, to some extent, the TV budget as well, as we look at ROAS, ROAS is going to be impacted by our projections for revenue per shopper and our projections for revenue per shopper are a fraction of what we expect an external environment does, obviously, what our -- how our partners behave but also what we believe we can improve over time in terms of the underlying economic value of our shoppers."

So I think we are an excellent partner for our hotel in OTA clients. We provide a very flexible bid mechanism, a flexible downstream kind of conversion funnel for them. And when we are able to measure the lead, the quality of the clicks that we send down to our partners, they have become more effective, in other words, they convert better than they did before, and that's direct work on our side to better qualify the traveler to be ready to book this hotel before we send them downstream to a hotel or an OTA. So we're kind of doing all the things that we can on our side to make ourselves a better partner. And I don't detect any reluctance on the part of partner hotels or OTAs to invest in the meta channel in general. And so again, you should, of course, be asking them.

That TV campaign is very much focused around educating folks around price comparisons around hotels. Looking at a conversion lift in the non-Hotel category from the initial brand awareness, next to impossible for us to tell in part because those components on TripAdvisor are growing so strong all by themselves. So we just have a lot of goodness happening in that Attraction Restaurant category. In terms of non-Hotel inventory trends, we continue to grow both on Restaurants and Attractions in particular. And Attractions, the bookable products, up 30-plus-percent year-on-year. The overall Attractions listing growing as well. And when you look back a couple of years, the bookable supply is up 5x or something. So the marketplace concept has really worked for us. We continue to grow in all regions of the world and we love it. It's the classic marketplace model where as we had more of the supply batch to the TripAdvisor demand that we already have, it continues to grow. I think our TripAdvisor sourced bookings for the Attraction category is -- was up 100% year-on-year in Q3. So we're just seeing really nice signs of that whole trip lifecycle coming in together, and you see that in the numbers, in that other Hotel business growth. So Ernst, do you want to add anything?

So our revenue per shopper year-on-year was negative 11%. We bid separately for traffic on desktop and on mobile. The total was down 11%. Mobile RPS was up. Desktop was down but actually less down than the 11%. So the 11% is, to a significant degree, also driven by the mix shift between the lower monetizing mobile traffic. So in the meantime, we are improving our product quite significantly. One of the things that we called out is that -- we look at in the quarter, the year on year performance of the -- just the economic value the underlying leads bring that we provide to our partners, that has -- had been improving. So the decline that we've seen on desktop revenue per shopper has been largely driven by these partner bid downs. So while these partner bid downs have happened, we've also made significant strides in positive development. And as we think about our marketing budget -- the performance-based marketing budget and, to some extent, the TV budget as well, as we look at ROAS, ROAS is going to be impacted by our projections for revenue per shopper so -- and our projections for revenue per shopper are a function of what we expect the external environment does, obviously, what our -- how our partners behave but also what we believe we can improve over time in terms of the underlying economic value of our shoppers."

Thanks. This is Steve. I would not kind of lump all of our partners into the ones that have -- that are currently looking for higher ROI, and the partners that have had the chance to speak to are all quite appreciative and interested in buying more and more traffic on the part of TripAdvisor. So I think we are an excellent partner for our hotel and OTA clients. We provide a very flexible bid mechanism, a flexible downstream kind of conversion funnel for them. And when we are able to measure the lead, the quality of the clicks that we send down to our partners, they have become more effective, in other words, they convert better than they did before, and that's direct work on our side to better qualify the traveler to be ready to book this hotel before we send them downstream to a hotel or an OTA. So we're kind of doing all the things that we can on our side to make ourselves a better partner. And I don't detect any reluctance on the part of partner hotels or OTAs to invest in the meta channel in general. And so again, you should, of course, be asking them. But when it comes to the overall health of meta as a channel, it still serves a very important function for travelers, and OTAs and hotels still recognize that. It's a very important channel for them to tap into the type of demand that we bring to the table."

So just wondering if mobile continues to hover around, say, the mid-20s range. It would imply desktop shopper growth falling double digits into October. Is that the right way to think about it? And then second one, on the Non-Hotel side, can you give us some color on the cost structure to the business here relative maybe to the core business? Is it more advertising-intensive historically? And we asked because, obviously, you're seeing a nice margin expansion. Some of it's driven by declining OpEx year-over-year, so trying to get a sense for what the cost structure looks like where it may have bottomed out such that future EBITDA will be more driven by top line growth on that side."

In terms of your second question and cost structure between Hotel and Non-Hotel, so what we see is that the cost structure is quite comparable in terms of the line items of sales and marketing, tech and content and general admin in terms of the structure of the P&L. So not that much different. What we've seen this year is scale benefits in the Non-Hotel business. We're growing -- we're particularly growing faster on our TripAdvisor platforms for Attractions, for instance, but also for Vacation Rentals, which has allowed us to be more efficient with our marketing spend this year compared to other years, and its overall scale benefits actually that is driving most of the margin expansion in that segment this year."

So our revenue per shopper year-on-year was negative 11%. We bid separately for traffic on desktop and on mobile. The total was down 11%. Mobile RPS was up. Desktop was down but actually less down than the 11%. So the 11% is, to a significant degree, also driven by the mix shift between the lower monetizing mobile traffic. So in the meantime, we are improving our product quite significantly. One of the things that we called out is that if you look at in the quarter, the year on year performance of the -- just the economic value the underlying leads bring that we provide to our partners, that has -- had been improving. So the decline that we've seen on desktop revenue per shopper has been largely driven by these partner bid downs. So while these partner bid downs have happened, we've also made significant strides in positive development.

And when we are able to measure the lead, the quality of the clicks that we send down to our partners, they have become more effective. In other words, they convert better than they did before, and that's direct work on our side to better qualify the traveler to be ready to book this hotel before we send them downstream to a hotel or an OTA. So we're kind of doing all the things that we can on our side to make ourselves a better partner. And I don't detect any reluctance on the part of partner hotels or OTAs to invest in the meta channel in general. And so again, you should, of course, be asking them.

The TV campaign is very much focused around educating folks on price comparison around hotels. Looking at a conversion lift in the Non-Hotel category from the initial brand awareness, next to impossible for us to tell in part because those components on TripAdvisor are growing so strong all by themselves. So we just have a lot of goodness happening in that Attraction, Restaurant category. In terms of Non-Hotel inventory trends, we continue to grow both on Restaurants and Attractions in particular. And Attractions, the bookable products, up 30-plus-percent year-on-year. The overall Attractions listing, growing as well. And when you look back a couple of years, the bookable supply has -- is up 5x or something. So the marketplace concept has really worked for us. We continue to grow in all regions of the world and it's -- we love it. It's the classic marketplace model where as we had more to the supply match to the TripAdvisor demand that we already have, it continues to grow. I think our TripAdvisor sourced bookings for the Attraction category is -- was up 100% year-on-year in Q3.

So our revenue per shopper year-on-year was negative 11%. We bid separately for traffic on desktop and on mobile. The total was down 11%. Mobile RPS was up. Desktop was down but actually less down than the 11%. So the 11% is, to a significant degree, also driven by the mix shift between the lower monetizing mobile traffic. So in the meantime, we are improving our product quite significantly. One of the things that we called out is that if you look at in the quarter, the year on year performance of the -- just the economic value the underlying leads bring that we provide to our partners, that has -- had been improving. So the decline that we've seen on desktop revenue per shopper has been largely driven by these partner bid downs. So while these partner bid downs have happened, we've also made significant strides in positive development. And as we think about our marketing budget -- the performance-based marketing budget and, to some extent, the TV budget as well, as we look at ROAS, ROAS is going to be impacted by our projections for revenue per shopper. So -- and our projections for revenue per shopper are a function of what we expect the external environment does, obviously, what our -- how our partners behave but also what we believe we can improve over time in terms of the underlying economic value of our shoppers."

Thanks. This is Steve. I would not kind of lump all of our partners into the ones that have -- that are currently looking for higher ROI, and the partners that have had the chance to speak to are all quite appreciative and interested in buying more and more traffic on the part of TripAdvisor. So I think we are an excellent partner for our hotel and OTA clients. We provide a very flexible bid mechanism, a flexible downstream kind of conversion funnel for them. And when we are able to measure the lead, the quality of the clicks that we send down to our partners, they have become more effective. In other words, they convert better than they did before, and that's direct work on our side to better qualify the traveler to be ready to book this hotel before we send them downstream to a hotel or an OTA. So we're kind of doing all the things that we can on our side to make ourselves a better partner. And I don't detect any reluctance on the part of partner hotels or OTAs to invest in the meta channel in general. And so again, you should, of course, be asking them. But when it comes to the overall health of meta as a channel, it still serves a very important function for travelers, and OTAs and hotels still recognize that. It's a very important channel for them to tap into the type of demand that we bring to the table."
