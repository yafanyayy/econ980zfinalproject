Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
Before I turn to our presentation, I would like to acknowledge Howard Cosgrove and Ed Muller for their years of service as Directors on the NRG board. I want to thank them for their dedication and wish them well in their next endeavors. Let me also congratulate our current Director, Larry Coben, on his appointment as Chairman of the Board. I'd also like to welcome our 2 new board members, John Wilder and Barry Smitherman. I look forward to working with both of them on all of the exciting opportunities ahead for NRG.
2016 was a pivotal year for our company. Just 1 year ago, I made a commitment to simplify our business, strengthen our platform and restore confidence in our direction and decision-making. We have made significant progress on all fronts. Today, NRG is in a much better place to continue executing on our multiyear strategic plan to solidify our position as the premier integrated power company in the country.
Let's move now to Slide 3, where I'd like to summarize the key highlights from today's call. First, we delivered on our numbers. Our track record of strong results and execution continued in 2016. We had our second best safety performance year on record, and our integrated platform delivered earnings that were even stronger than last year. We grew both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth despite the difficult commodity price environment that reduced our total generation by 14% from 2015. Our Retail business delivered its third consecutive year of EBITDA growth with a record adjusted EBITDA of just over $800 million.
NRG's best-in-class platform has again demonstrated its ability to provide strong stable results despite challenging market conditions. For these reasons, I'm also able to reaffirm our 2017 financial guidance. I want to thank all my colleagues for a job well done on a very successful year.
Second, we executed on our priorities. Our focus over the past year in simplifying and streamlining our business resulted in over $0.5 billion in cost reductions. We made progress in repositioning our portfolio by selling assets at value and executing several capital projects on time and on budget. We strengthened our balance sheet by reducing corporate debt by $1 billion and extending $6 billion of debt maturities well beyond 2020. 
Last, we reinvigorated our strategic partnership with NRG Yield by putting in place a dedicated management team and expanding our renewables business at ROFO pipeline.
Third, we're not done yet. As we close out the first phase of deleveraging, cost cutting and business optimization efforts, we now turn to the next phase of our plan. We're in a much better position today to benefit from market opportunities than we were 1 year ago.
But before discussing details of our 2016 results and 2017 plans, I want to remind you of what underpins our continued strong results and sets NRG apart from others in the industry on Slide 4. NRG's differentiated business model is simple and focuses on our competitive advantage, the integration of Generation, which includes Renewables and Retail. This integrated platform and the touch points between these primary businesses allow us to capture operational and commercial synergies in a way that makes the whole of our business greater than the sum of its parts.
NRG's unique value proposition centers on stability. Our diverse portfolio minimizes our exposure to market and few [ph] specific downturns, while our diverse business lines create a stable base of free cash flows, particularly the natural hedge between Retail and Generation. In 2017, we're estimating that 3/4 of our gross margin will come from stable sources such as retail, contracted assets, including NRG Yield, and capacity revenues.
We have built a business that is not dependent on commodity prices to deliver strong results but that remains well positioned to benefit from upside in a commodity market recovery. As we manage our business for stable, visible free cash flows, we maintained the ability to grow and quickly replenish capital. We achieved these through our strategic partnership with NRG Yield, which serves as another unique differentiator of our business and is an important driver of our ability to participate in the growing Renewables segment.
Turning to Slide 5. I want to reiterate my belief that the competitive power sector is in a period of unprecedented disruption. Changes in fuel mix, consumer preference, technological innovation and increased distributed generation have put pressure on the traditional IPP model, particularly as commodity markets continue to weaken. While sufficient at the outset of competitive markets, I believe the IPP model is now obsolete and unable to create value over the long term.
On our fourth quarter call last year, I highlighted the 6 elements but I believe are now required to succeed in the competitive power sector. This started with excellence in operations and execution, diversification, both on terms of generation portfolio and business lines, and a scalable platform for growth. NRG was already strong in these 3 areas, and the results achieved throughout the past year further confirmed this assessment. So our focus turn to the remaining 3 attributes.
First, we needed to ensure that we were operating a platform efficiently. These meant simplifying by focusing on our core Generation and Retail businesses and divesting from non-core and underperforming businesses. Furthermore, we focus on reducing costs, taking over $0.5 billion out of NRG's total cost structure. These combined efforts have greatly strengthened our business compared to where we were 1 year ago.
The remaining attributes require implementing a more flexible, transparent approach to capital allocation and achieving a more resilient capital structure, given the sustained low commodity price environment. As a result, we refocused a substantial amount of our capital to deleveraging in 2016, bringing up additional capital by adjusting our dividend policy.
Importantly, we also changed the way we allocate capital for growth by refocusing on projects that offer high returns and quick paybacks. Going forward, you can expect the same discipline we brought in 2016 to be applied to the next phase of execution. And I will continue with my philosophy of no head scratchers when it comes to understanding how we allocate capital.
And with a focus of the new business review committee well aligned with our strategic priorities, we look forward to its role in our review process and the continued execution on the 3 priorities outlined here.
Turning to Slide 6. I'd like to provide you more detail around our cost-reduction initiatives and the next phase of our plan as we move into 2017.
I am very pleased to report that not only have we already achieved our $400 million total cost savings target, we have exceeded it, reducing our total cost by $539 million compared to our 2015 baseline. Reducing our cost was not just a focus of management, but a focus of all employees throughout our organization, and I am very pleased with the progress we have made today. My promise to you was to not only hit our targeted cost savings, but to report our savings in a way that was more transparent and held us accountable. The left side of the page is a view of our total cost structure, sales and marketing, G&A, O&M and development. As you may recall, last year, we combined all of our cost-savings initiatives under one comprehensive program, but you can still track individual items in our 10-K disclosures.
With our current target mix and exceeded ahead of our initial time frame, we continue on our focus on streamlining and optimizing our business. We are already working on our next round of 4 NRG cost-cutting initiatives. But given the scope of the business review committee, it is appropriate to delay a public announcement of the new set of targets until later in the year.
Now turning to Slide 7. As I discussed earlier, the breadth and scale of our platform is a clear competitive advantage, but I also understand that it can complicate the ability to properly unpack our cost structure. The objective today is to help further simplify the investment proposition by enhancing the visibility into our cost structure. While I will discuss the highlights in the slide, the full detail behind these numbers can be found on the appendix of today's presentation and will map to our 2016 10-K disclosures.
As I'm sure you're all aware, comparing costs from one company to the next can be challenging. So before I get into detail, let me put more context around this analysis.
First, given the business and technology diversity that drives our integrated platform, benchmarking NRG's consolidated cost to those of a pure IPP is simply not correct. So in our disclosure, we have isolated the cost structures within each of our reported businesses as a means to compare our cost to appropriate peer companies.
Second, costs are somewhat fungible between different categories. And even within the small competitive power group, there are notable differences in cost categorization. To account for this difference, it is important to capture these combined costs, both expensed and capitalized, to fully appreciate a company's baseline cost structure.
Now going into the detail on each of our segments. In Generation, I want to remind you that our current Generation business is the result of consolidating 4 generation companies over the past 5 years: NRG, RRI, Edison Mission and Mirant. And during this time, significant cost synergies were realized as part of the integration efforts. This discipline continues today, and on an adjusted basis, our Generation segment carries a total cost of almost $50 per kilowatt, a number that is slightly lower than that of our closest peers.
For this business, we focus on $1 per kW metric, given that a substantial of our fleet in the Northeast is reliability focused, capturing significant capacity and scarcity revenues while generating a lower number of megawatt hours. In addition, to maintain comparability, we have backed out costs associated with our nuclear unit ownership that NRG is the only competitive power generator with this higher fixed cost, lower fuel cost technology.
While our Generation cost per kW are in line with our peers, we're continually focused on driving further cost savings by improving upon efficiencies in fleet operations and asset optimization efforts.
Next, on Retail, with nearly 3 million customers, most of whom are residential customers located in Texas, NRG operates the leading residential retail platform in the country, and the stable margins from retail are an important driver of our free cash flows each quarter.
Our Retail business maintains a relentless focus on meaning, evolving customer needs and on continuous improvement, which have driven expansion on both our customer base and earnings. Benchmarking costs in Retail is difficult, given the differences in customer, product and regional mix from one company to the next and because other retailers provide little visibility into the breakdown of their cost structures.
Finally, moving to renewables. As I highlighted earlier, renewables are a pillar of our growth and portfolio repositioning. Today, NRG, together with NRG Yield, has one of the largest renewable energy platforms in the country. And we're able to leverage our expertise within our other segments to continue to develop and operate this fleet. The operating costs as reported for NRG's renewables segment is $91 per KW. But important to note, this includes asset such as the Ivanpah concentrated solar thermal facility, which has a higher cost structure given the emerging nature of this technology.
The more appropriate metric is that of our combined renewables segment in NRG and NRG Yield, which captures the full cost structure of our renewables operations across our entire fleet. This combined view cost of $67 per KW, as you can see, is in line with peers. And we continue to improve. Since we reintegrated our renewables group last year, we have driven further improvement in this area through transitioning large portions of our fleet to self performance of O&M.
Additionally, we are focused on adding simpler mainstream technologies to our fleet with the core focus on utility scale solar, which can be operated at $20 per KW and utility scale wind at $50 per KW. As a result of these initiatives, you should expect our renewable cost structure to step down over time.
A goal of these disclosures is to provide you greater visibility into our overall cost structure and the metric that you can compare to peers. But what I want to make clear is that being in line with peers does not mean we're done looking for areas to improve. Assessing and reducing our cost is an ongoing process, and we will always aim for increased efficiency.
Now on Slide 8, I'd like to provide a summary of the many ways in which we reposition our portfolio during the past year. As part of our normal course of business, we put our entire portfolio through a rigorous review process. The result can lead to everything from fuel conversions to assets sales to realigning our portfolio to the most compelling market opportunity.
In 2016, we took significant steps to strengthen our generation fleet. We sold 4 assets at value for $550 million, exceeding our original target by 10%. We modernized our fleet and converted 2.2 gigawatts of coal plants to natural gas, benefiting from lower gas prices and capacity revenues. We brought online our first of a kind carbon capture facility, Petra Nova, on time and on budget. We pursued growth opportunities in both conventional and renewable plans looking for areas of free capital replenishment as highlighted by the 1.5 gigawatt renewable portfolio acquisition from SunEdison that we closed last year.
For this transaction, we have already recovered 100% of our total utility scale purchase price with just the first 265 megawatt drop down to NRG Yield. This means we have over 1 gigawatt of projects in this portfolio at effectively 0 cost.
Looking forward, we will continue our rigorous review process, assessing the current market and developing solutions that optimize our fleet and strengthen our platform. I would expect these to include further asset dispositions at value.
Turning to Slide 9. I want to provide an update on our capital allocation plan. As I laid out on the fourth quarter call of last year, my primary objective for capital allocation was to ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital and provide our shareholders with greater visibility into our capital allocation decision-making. In an effort to begin to better align to the market cycle, the transition in capital allocation mix between 2015 to 2016 reflects the recognition that we needed to focus our efforts more on deleveraging and leave no doubt on our ability to withstand a prolonged period of low commodity prices.
For 2017, we will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and pay down debt, expanding our current program with an additional $200 million through the end of this year. Approximately 70% of every dollar we allocate will go toward this effort as we aim to maintain a cycle appropriate level of leverage. These will ensure we have the financial flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities when the market recovers.
We will also continue to pursue low-cost options for growth where we have an ability to generate the strong returns in a relatively short period of time, which can be viewed as temporal capital for NRG.
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk now for the financial review."

Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 11, before I review the full year results, I'd like to take a moment to highlight a change we've made to both our segment disclosures for 2016 and our guidance",1474,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 11, before I review the full year results, I'd like to take a moment to highlight a change we've made to both our segment disclosures for 2016 and our guidance breakdown. We're now combining both mass retail and Business Solutions into a single retail segments in order to bring all our direct customer-facing businesses together as a single segment.
Business Solutions, which consists of our C&I, demand response and other B2B initiatives was previously part of the Generation segment. Our results for 2016 as well as our guidance for 2017, now reflect this change, which we believe will provide greater clarity of disclosure in helping our investors better understand the NRG value proposition.
Turning to 2016 financial results, NRG delivered $3.257 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.2 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Our results highlight the benefits and resilience of our integrated platform as the low commodity price environment helped retail deliver $800 million in adjusted EBITDA. Mass retail contributed $755 million of this total, in line with the midpoint of our latest guidance for mass retail, which was announced in our third quarter call. Generation and renewables achieved $1.547 billion in adjusted EBITDA, while NRG Yield, aided primarily by robust wind conditions through the year, contributed $899 million.
We ended 2016 having completed $1 billion of our $1.4 billion corporate debt reduction program. The balance of which is part of our 2017 capital allocation to retire the remainder of our 2018 bond maturity.
When combined with the retirement of our convertible [indiscernible] and the extension of corporate debt maturities at more favorable rates, including the recent refinancing of our term loan, which occurred in January, our deleveraging efforts have generated in total almost $100 million in annual interest and dividend savings, significantly improving NRG level free cash flow.
Earlier this month, NRG received $128 million in net proceeds from a new nonrecourse debt financing at Agua Caliente. In addition, NRG and NRG Yield have now entered into an agreement drop-down of a 31 -- of 31% of NRG's stake in Agua Caliente as well as the Utah solar assets acquired late last year as a part of the SunEdison transaction for a total of $130 million. Having previously realized $48 million in financing proceeds from additional debt financing for the Utah solar assets late last year, these 2017 transactions, which I'll review in greater detail shortly, are expected to result in additional cash proceeds to NRG of over $250 million, increasing 2017 capital available for allocation.
Next, I'd like to briefly address an element of our 2016 results outside of EBITDA and free cash flow, the noncash impairment charges of $1.2 billion incurred for the year. Over the course of 2016, we had impaired a number of assets due to changes in the market, affecting the specific projects for a total of approximately $300 million through the third quarter. And in addition, on an annual basis, we tested along that live assets and goodwill for potential impairments. Given a prolonged low commodity price outlook, we adjusted our long-term view of power prices, which resulted in additional noncash impairment charge of approximately $900 million, consisting primarily of a write-down of certain fixed assets in California, Texas, Pennsylvania as well as the remaining goodwill on the Texas assets. This noncash impairment charge has no impact on EBITDA or free cash flow, and we are reconfirming our guidance for both 2017 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth.
Turning to Slide 12 to review our plans on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. We expect approximately $1 billion of capital bill for allocation in the NRG-level 2017, which represents excess capital beyond our minimum cash reserves for liquidity that supplements our corporate credit facility. 2017 capital bill for allocation consisted of the excess cash balance of the NRG level at the end of 2016, supplemented with the closing of the Agua Caliente financing in February, plus the midpoint of our 2017 NRG level free cash flow before guidance as well as the proceeds from the drop-down of the Utah utility solar assets and the 16% interest in Agua Caliente to NRG Yield of approximately $130 million, and that is expected to close this quarter.
We expect to allocate approximately 7% of NRG-level capital in '17 towards further debt reduction. This consists of debt amortization of both the NRG term loan and the pavements for the counterparty in connection with the Midwest generation monetization transaction in 2016, which are treated as principal payments from an accounting perspective. The balance of capital towards debt reduction is discretionary and consists of $400 million toward the retirement of the remainder of our 2018 maturity, which was previously committed, plus an additional $200 million towards more corporate debt reduction, which we are announcing today.
We will remain flexible as to the tenor of debt, to which this additional $200 million is allocated. However, the most likely scenario is we will deploy this capital toward retiring the remaining balance of our 2021 senior notes. These notes are currently callable and the called parties will step down again in May. Prior to this allocation, we were already on track to achieve our target debt ratio in 2017, which we continue to see as a trough year based on the forward curves. This additional debt reduction not only further strengthens our balance sheet and extends our nearest unsecured maturity to 2022, it also represents an attractive risk-adjusted return.
We plan to hold our dividend at its current rate of $0.12 per share on an annualized basis, representing about 4% of our capital for allocation. And finally, in 2017, we expect approximately $185 million of growth investments, primarily consisting of our investments at Bay Cliff, Fuente, Carlsbad and the remaining capital required of the Petra Nova project.
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to provide some further details on the drop-down transactions and related financings, which highlight in particular the rapid return of capital achieved from the SunEdison transaction, as Mauricio mentioned earlier.
Looking at the left half of this slide, as I mentioned, we have already closed an additional project financing for both the Utah solar assets we acquired as a part of the SunEdison utility scale transaction as well as our 51% stake in Agua Caliente. When combined with the expected proceeds from the drop-down of our equity stake in Utah as well as a portion of our stake in Agua Caliente, which we expect to close in the current quarter, total proceeds from this transaction to NRG is approximately $300 million.
In connection with the drop-down transaction, NRG and NRG Yield also agreed to expand the ROFO pipeline to include 2 additional assets from the SunEdison transaction, enhancing the growth pipeline for Yield and expanding potential capital replenishment for NRG.
Looking at the right half of the slide and importantly, less than 6 months after closing the SunEdison utility scale transaction, NRG is on track to replenish more than 100% of the total purchase price while retaining a 0 cost option on the balance of that portfolio, which includes both the late stage pipeline, which is now part of the expanded NRG Yield ROFO as well as more than 1 gigawatt of additional activity. As shown on the lower right of the slide, the proceeds from the Utah solar debt financing, which closed late last year, and the Utah solar portion of the NRG Yield drop-drown, which should close shortly, total $129 million, exceeding the price paid for the entire SunEdison transaction by $5 million.
And finally, Slide 14 provides an update on corporate credit metrics. Starting with 2016, having repurchased a portion of our 2018 and '21 notes during the fourth quarter, we've completed our 2016 delevering objectives, driving corporate debt to $7.8 billion.
Based on the midpoint 2016 guidance, this implies a corporate debt, a corporate EBITDA ratio of just over 4x.
Turning to 2017 metrics, having now allocated that additional $200 million in corporate level debt reduction, total corporate level debt reduction in 2017 is just over $600 million, putting us on track to reduce corporate level debt to $7.2 billion. When combined with 2017 corporate EBITDA based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance, this now implies a 2017 debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.13x.
Importantly, while our target ratio is based on gross corporate debt-to-EBITDA, for comparative purposes, I've now added the implied net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the bottom of this table using actual corporate level cash in 2016 and implied year-end 2017 cash by adding the current balance of unallocated 2017 capital, the year-end 2016 balance. These implied net debt ratios are approximately 3.75x in each of 2016 and 2017.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks"

I mean, we went through a very thorough review process on assets that were not necessarily core on specific regions, that were single assets that had been underperforming, but the most important thing to me is if we can actually monetize assets at value. And that's where we're -- what we're going to be focusing on the next steps of asset dispositions. As I've said in the past, we ended up with a portfolio of close to 50,000 megawatts of generation through a number of acquisitions, and it is the time now to be pruning around that portfolio and to recalibrate and resize that portfolio. But we will only do that if we can actually monetize assets at value, like we did last year where we set a target of $500 million, and we came in a little over $550 million. So I think that's how you should be thinking about the asset optimization efforts going into 2017. And of course, I mean, now that we have a new framework around the business review committee, we will have a conversation about single assets, but every part of our business and evaluate that and make a determination in the next couple of months, which I will be in a position to announce to you later in the year."

And it is important, as we go in through these asset rebalancing, that we have the transparency to provide you the level that you need to be able to compare where we were before and where we are today. I will also say that a lot of the overperformance happened just across all the different categories, SG&A, O&M, selling and marketing, so there's not just one area to pinpoint, but I think it was, as I mentioned, completely across the organization."

Before I turn to our presentation, I would like to acknowledge Howard Cosgrove and Ed Muller for their years of service as Directors on the NRG board. I want to thank them for their dedication and wish them well in their next endeavors. Let me also congratulate our current Director, Larry Coben, on his appointment as Chairman of the Board. I'd also like to welcome our 2 new board members, John Wilder and Barry Smitherman. I look forward to working with both of them on all of the exciting opportunities ahead for NRG.
2016 was a pivotal year for our company. Just 1 year ago, I made a commitment to simplify our business, strengthen our platform and restore confidence in our direction and decision-making. We have made significant progress on all fronts. Today, NRG is in a much better place to continue executing on our multiyear strategic plan to solidify our position as the premier integrated power company in the country.
Let's move now to Slide 3, where I'd like to summarize the key highlights from today's call. First, we delivered on our numbers. Our track record of strong results and execution continued in 2016. We had our second best safety performance year on record, and our integrated platform delivered earnings that were even stronger than last year. We grew both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth despite the difficult commodity price environment that reduced our total generation by 14% from 2015. Our Retail business delivered its third consecutive year of EBITDA growth with a record adjusted EBITDA of just over $800 million.
NRG's best-in-class platform has again demonstrated its ability to provide strong stable results despite challenging market conditions. For these reasons, I'm also able to reaffirm our 2017 financial guidance. I want to thank all my colleagues for a job well done on a very successful year.
Second, we executed on our priorities. Our focus over the past year in simplifying and streamlining our business resulted in over $0.5 billion in cost reductions. We made progress in repositioning our portfolio by selling assets at value and executing several capital projects on time and on budget. We strengthened our balance sheet by reducing corporate debt by $1 billion and extending $6 billion of debt maturities well beyond 2020. 
Last, we reinvigorated our strategic partnership with NRG Yield by putting in place a dedicated management team and expanding our renewables business at ROFO pipeline.
Third, we're not done yet. As we close out the first phase of deleveraging, cost cutting and business optimization efforts, we now turn to the next phase of our plan. We're in a much better position today to benefit from market opportunities than we were 1 year ago.
But before discussing details of our 2016 results and 2017 plans, I want to remind you of what underpins our continued strong results and sets NRG apart from others in the industry on Slide 4. NRG's differentiated business model is simple and focuses on our competitive advantage, the integration of Generation, which includes Renewables and Retail. This integrated platform and the touch points between these primary businesses allow us to capture operational and commercial synergies in a way that makes the whole of our business greater than the sum of its parts.
NRG's unique value proposition centers on stability. Our diverse portfolio minimizes our exposure to market and few, less specific downturns, while our diverse business lines create a stable base of free cash flows, particularly the natural hedge between Retail and Generation. In 2017, we're estimating that 3/4 of our gross margin will come from stable sources such as retail, contracted assets, including NRG Yield, and capacity revenues.
We have built a business that is not dependent on commodity prices to deliver strong results but that remains well positioned to benefit from upside in a commodity market recovery. As we manage our business for stable, visible free cash flows, we maintained the ability to grow and quickly replenish capital. We achieved these through our strategic partnership with NRG Yield, which serves as another unique differentiator of our business and is an important driver of our ability to participate in the growing Renewables segment.
Turning to Slide 5. I want to reiterate my belief that the competitive power sector is in a period of unprecedented disruption. Changes in fuel mix, consumer preference, technological innovation and increased distributed generation have put pressure on the traditional IPP model, particularly as commodity markets continue to weaken. While sufficient at the outset of competitive markets, I believe the IPP model is now obsolete and unable to create value over the long term.
On our fourth quarter call last year, I highlighted the 6 elements but I believe are now required to succeed in the competitive power sector. This started with excellence in operations and execution, diversification, both on terms of generation portfolio and business lines, and a scalable platform for growth. NRG was already strong in these 3 areas, and the results achieved throughout the past year further confirmed this assessment. So our focus turned to the remaining 3 attributes.
First, we needed to ensure that we were operating a platform efficiently. These meant simplifying by focusing on our core Generation and Retail businesses and divesting from non-core and underperforming businesses. Furthermore, we focus on reducing costs, taking over $0.5 billion out of NRG's total cost structure. These combined efforts have greatly strengthened our business compared to where we were 1 year ago.
The remaining attributes require implementing a more flexible, transparent approach to capital allocation and achieving a more resilient capital structure, given the sustained low commodity price environment. As a result, we refocused a substantial amount of our capital to deleveraging in 2016, bringing up additional capital by adjusting our dividend policy.
Importantly, we also changed the way we allocate capital for growth by refocusing on projects that offer high returns and quick paybacks. Going forward, you can expect the same discipline we brought in 2016 to be applied to the next phase of execution. And I will continue with my philosophy of no head scratchers when it comes to understanding how we allocate capital.
And with a focus of the new business review committee well aligned with our strategic priorities, we look forward to its role in our review process and the continued execution on the 3 priorities outlined here.
Turning to Slide 6. I'd like to provide you more detail around our cost-reduction initiatives and the next phase of our plan as we move into 2017.
I am very pleased to report that not only have we already achieved our $400 million total cost savings target, we have exceeded it, reducing our total cost by $539 million compared to our 2015 baseline. Reducing our cost was not just a focus of management, but a focus of all employees throughout our organization, and I am very pleased with the progress we have made today. My promise to you was to not only hit our targeted cost savings, but to report our savings in a way that was more transparent and held us accountable. The left side of the page is a view of our total cost structure, sales and marketing, G&A, O&M and development. As you may recall, last year, we combined all of our cost-savings initiatives under one comprehensive program, but you can still track individual items in our 10-K disclosures.
With our current target mix and exceeded ahead of our initial time frame, we continue on our focus on streamlining and optimizing our business. We are already working on our next round of 4 NRG cost-cutting initiatives. But given the scope of the business review committee, it is appropriate to delay a public announcement of the new set of targets until later in the year.
Now turning to Slide 7. As I discussed earlier, the breadth and scale of our platform is a clear competitive advantage, but I also understand that it can complicate the ability to properly unpack our cost structure. The objective today is to help further simplify the investment proposition by enhancing the visibility into our cost structure. While I will discuss the highlights in the slide, the full detail behind these numbers can be found on the appendix of today's presentation and will map to our 2016 10-K disclosures.
As I'm sure you're all aware, comparing costs from one company to the next can be challenging. So before I get into detail, let me put more context around this analysis.
First, given the business and technology diversity that drives our integrated platform, benchmarking NRG's consolidated cost to those of a pure IPP is simply not correct. So in our disclosure, we have isolated the cost structures within each of our reported businesses as a means to compare our cost to appropriate peer companies.
Second, costs are somewhat fungible between different categories. And even within the small competitive power group, there are notable differences in cost categorization. To account for this difference, it is important to capture these combined costs, both expensed and capitalized, to fully appreciate a company's baseline cost structure.
Now going into the detail on each of our segments. In Generation, I want to remind you that our current Generation business is the result of consolidating 4 generation companies over the past 5 years: NRG, RRI, Edison Mission and Mirant. And during this time, significant cost synergies were realized as part of the integration efforts. This discipline continues today, and on an adjusted basis, our Generation segment carries a total cost of almost $50 per kilowatt, a number that is slightly lower than that of our closest peers.
For this business, we focus on $1 per kW metric, given that a substantial of our fleet in the Northeast is reliability focused, capturing significant capacity and scarcity revenues while generating a lower number of megawatt hours. In addition, to maintain comparability, we have backed out costs associated with our nuclear unit ownership that NRG is the only competitive power generator with this higher fixed cost, lower fuel cost technology.
While our Generation cost per kW are in line with our peers, we're continually focused on driving further cost savings by improving upon efficiencies in fleet operations and asset optimization efforts.
Next, on Retail, with nearly 3 million customers, most of whom are residential customers located in Texas, NRG operates the leading residential retail platform in the country, and the stable margins from retail are an important driver of our free cash flows each quarter.
Our Retail business maintains a relentless focus on meaning, evolving customer needs and on continuous improvement, which have driven expansion on both our customer base and earnings. Benchmarking costs in Retail is difficult, given the differences in customer, product and regional mix from one company to the next and because other retailers provide little visibility into the breakdown of their cost structures.
Finally, moving to renewables. As I highlighted earlier, renewables are a pillar of our growth and portfolio repositioning. Today, NRG, together with NRG Yield, has one of the largest renewable energy platforms in the country and we're able to leverage our expertise within our other segments to continue to develop and operate this fleet. The operating costs, as reported for NRG's Renewables segment, is $91 per kW. But important to note, this includes assets such as the Ivanpah concentrated solar thermal facility, which has a higher cost structure given the emerging nature of this technology.
The more appropriate metric is that of our combined Renewables segment in NRG and NRG Yield, which captures the full cost structure of our Renewables operations across our entire fleet. This combined view [ph] cost of $67 per kW, as you can see, is in line with peers. And we continue to improve. Since we reintegrated our Renewables group last year, we have driven further improvement in this area through transitioning large portions of our fleet to self-performance of O&M.
Additionally, we are focused on adding simpler mainstream technologies to our fleet with the core focus on utility scale solar, which can be operated at $20 per kW, and utility scale wind at $50 per kW. As a result of these initiatives, you should expect our renewable cost structure to step down over time.
The goal of these disclosures is to provide you greater visibility into our overall cost structure and MAmetric [ph] that you can compare to peers. But what I want to make clear is that being in line with peers does not mean we're done looking for areas to improve. Assessing and reducing our costs is an ongoing process, and we will always aim for increased efficiency.
Now on Slide 8, I'd like to provide a summary of the many ways in which we reposition our portfolio during the past year. As part of our normal course of business, we put our entire portfolio through a rigorous review process. The result can lead to everything from fuel conversions to asset sales to realigning our portfolio to the most compelling market opportunity.
In 2016, we took significant steps to strengthen our generation fleet. We sold 4 assets at value for $550 million, exceeding our original target by 10%. We modernized our fleet and converted 2.2 gigawatts of coal plants to natural gas, benefiting from lower gas prices and capacity revenues. We brought online our first of a kind carbon capture facility, Petra Nova, on time and on budget. We pursued growth opportunities in both conventional and renewable plants, looking for areas of free capital replenishment, as highlighted by the 1.5 gigawatt renewable portfolio acquisition from SunEdison that we closed last year.
For this transaction, we have already recovered 100% of our total utility scale purchase price with just the first 265 megawatt drop-down to NRG Yield. This means we have over 1 gigawatt of projects in this portfolio at effectively 0 cost.
Looking forward, we will continue our rigorous review process, assessing the current market and developing solutions that optimize our fleet and strengthen our platform. I would expect these to include further asset dispositions at value.
Turning to Slide 9. I want to provide an update on our capital allocation plan. As I laid out on the fourth quarter call of last year, my primary objective for capital allocation was to ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital and provide our shareholders with greater visibility into our capital allocation decision-making. In an effort to begin to better align to the market cycle, the transition in capital allocation mix between 2015 to 2016 reflects the recognition that we needed to focus our efforts more on deleveraging and leave no doubt on our ability to withstand a prolonged period of low commodity prices.
For 2017, we will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and pay down debt, expanding our current program with an additional $200 million through the end of this year. Approximately 70% of every dollar we allocate will go toward this effort as we aim to maintain a cycle appropriate level of leverage. These will ensure we have the financial flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities when the market recovers.
We will also continue to pursue low-cost options for growth where we have an ability to generate strong returns in a relatively short period of time, which can be viewed as temporal capital for NRG.
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk now for the financial review."
413857,416418264,1144546,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2017",2017-02-28,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 11, before I review the full year results, I'd like to take a moment to highlight a change we've made to both our segment disclosures for 2016 and our guidance",1476,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 11, before I review the full year results, I'd like to take a moment to highlight a change we've made to both our segment disclosures for 2016 and our guidance breakdown. We're now combining both Mass Retail and Business Solutions into a single Retail segment in order to bring all our direct customer-facing businesses together as a single segment.
Business Solutions, which consists of our C&I, demand response and other B2B initiatives, was previously part of the Generation segment. Our results for 2016, as well as our guidance for 2017, now reflect this change, which we believe will provide greater clarity of disclosure in helping our investors better understand the NRG value proposition.
Turning to 2016 financial results. NRG delivered $3.257 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.2 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Our results highlight the benefits and resilience of our integrated platform as the low commodity price environment helped Retail deliver $800 million in adjusted EBITDA. Mass Retail contributed $755 million of this total, in line with the midpoint of our latest guidance for Mass Retail, which was announced in our third quarter call. Generation and Renewables achieved $1.547 billion in adjusted EBITDA, while NRG Yield, aided primarily by robust wind conditions through the year, contributed $899 million.
We ended 2016 having completed $1 billion of our $1.4 billion corporate debt reduction program, the balance of which is part of our 2017 capital allocation to retire the remainder of our 2018 bond maturity.
When combined with the retirement of our convertible preferred and the extension of corporate debt maturities at more favorable rates, including the recent refinancing of our term loan, which occurred in January, our deleveraging efforts have generated in total almost $100 million in annual interest and dividend savings, significantly improving NRG level free cash flow.
Earlier this month, NRG received $128 million in net proceeds from a new nonrecourse debt financing at Agua Caliente. In addition, NRG and NRG Yield have now entered into an agreement to complete the drop-down of a 31 -- of 31%, rather, of NRG's stake in Agua Caliente as well as the Utah solar assets acquired late last year as a part of the SunEdison transaction for a total of $130 million. Having previously realized $48 million in financing proceeds from additional debt financing for the Utah solar assets late last year, these 2017 transactions, which I'll review in greater detail shortly, are expected to result in additional cash proceeds to NRG of over $250 million, increasing 2017 capital available for allocation.
Next, I'd like to briefly address an element of our 2016 results outside of EBITDA and free cash flow, the noncash impairment charges of $1.2 billion incurred for the year. Over the course of 2016, we had impaired a number of assets due to changes in the market, affecting the specific projects for a total of approximately $300 million through the third quarter. And in addition, on an annual basis, we tested our long-lived assets and goodwill for potential impairments. Given the prolonged low commodity price outlook, we adjusted our long-term view of power prices, which resulted in an additional noncash impairment charge of approximately $900 million, consisting primarily of a write-down of certain fixed assets in California, Texas, Pennsylvania as well as the remaining goodwill on the Texas assets. This noncash impairment charge has no impact on EBITDA or free cash flow, and we are reconfirming our guidance for both 2017 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth.
Turning to Slide 12 to review our plans on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. We expect approximately $1 billion of capital available for allocation at the NRG level in 2017, which represents excess capital beyond our minimum cash reserve for liquidity that supplements our corporate credit facility. 2017 capital available for allocation consists of the excess cash balance at the NRG level at the end of 2016, supplemented with the closing of the Agua Caliente financing in February, plus the midpoint of our 2017 NRG level free cash flow before guidance as well as the proceeds from the drop-down of the Utah utility solar assets and the 16% interest in Agua Caliente to NRG Yield of approximately $130 million, and that is expected to close this quarter.
We expect to allocate approximately 7% of NRG-level capital in '17 towards further debt reduction. This consists of nondiscretionary debt amortization of both the NRG term loan and the payments for the counter-party in connection with the Midwest generation monetization transaction in 2016, which are treated as principal payments from an accounting perspective. The balance of capital towards debt reduction is discretionary and consists of $400 million toward the retirement of the remainder of our 2018 maturity, which was previously committed, plus an additional $200 million towards more corporate debt reduction, which we are announcing today.
We will remain flexible as to the tenor of debt, to which this additional $200 million is allocated. However, the most likely scenario is we will deploy this capital toward retiring the remaining balance of our 2021 senior notes. These notes are currently callable and the called parties will step down again in May. Prior to this allocation, we're already on track to achieve our target debt ratio in 2017, which we continue to see as a trough year based on the forward curves. This additional debt reduction not only further strengthens our balance sheet and extends our nearest unsecured maturity to 2022, it also represents an attractive risk-adjusted return.
We plan to hold our dividend at its current rate of $0.12 per share on an annualized basis, representing about 4% of our capital for allocation. And finally, in 2017, we expect approximately $185 million of growth investments, primarily consisting of our investments at Bacliff, Puente, Carlsbad and the remaining capital required for the Petra Nova project.
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to provide some further details on the drop-down transactions and related financings, which highlight in particular the rapid return of capital achieved from the SunEdison transaction, as Mauricio mentioned earlier.
Looking at the left half of the slide, as I mentioned, we have already closed on additional project-level financings for both the Utah solar assets we acquired as a part of the SunEdison utility scale transaction as well as our 51% stake in Agua Caliente. When combined with the expected proceeds from the drop-down of our equity stake in Utah as well as a portion of our stake in Agua Caliente, which we expect to close in the current quarter, total proceeds from these transactions to NRG is approximately $300 million.
In connection with the drop-down transaction, NRG and NRG Yield also agreed to expand the ROFO pipeline to include 2 additional assets from the SunEdison transaction, enhancing the growth pipeline for Yield and expanding potential capital replenishment for NRG.
Looking at the right half of the slide and, importantly, less than 6 months after closing the SunEdison utility scale transaction, NRG is on track to replenish more than 100% of the total purchase price while retaining a 0 cost option on the balance of that portfolio, which includes both the late-stage pipeline, which is now part of the expanded NRG Yield ROFO, as well as more than a gigawatt of additional opportunities. As shown on the lower right of the slide, the proceeds from the Utah solar debt financing, which closed late last year, and the Utah solar portion of the NRG Yield drop-drown, which should close shortly, total $129 million, exceeding the price paid for the entire SunEdison transaction by $5 million.
And finally, Slide 14 provides an update on corporate credit metrics. Starting with 2016, having repurchased a portion of our 2018 and '21 notes during the fourth quarter, we've completed our 2016 delevering objectives, driving corporate debt to $7.8 billion.
Based on the midpoint 2016 guidance, this implies a corporate debt with corporate EBITDA ratio of just over 4x.
Turning to 2017 metrics. Having now allocated that additional $200 million in corporate level debt reduction, total corporate level debt reduction in 2017 is just over $600 million, putting us on track to reduce corporate-level debt to $7.2 billion. When combined with 2017 corporate EBITDA based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance, this now implies a 2017 debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.13x.
Importantly, while our target ratio is based on gross corporate debt-to-EBITDA, for comparative purposes, I've now added the implied net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the bottom of this table using actual corporate-level cash in 2016 and implied year-end 2017 cash by adding the current balance of unallocated 2017 capital, the year-end 2016 balance. These implied net debt ratios are approximately 3.75x in each of 2016 and 2017.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

So I hope that you'll indulge us with holding on to the, I guess, the direction that we have provided in terms of our new FORNRG program, our new cost initiatives.

I mean, we went through a very thorough review process on assets that were not necessarily core on any -- on specific regions, but were single assets that had been underperforming. But the most important thing to me is if we can actually monetize assets at value. And that's where we're -- what we're going to be focusing on the next steps of asset dispositions. As I've said in the past, we ended up with a portfolio of close to 50,000 megawatts of generation through a number of acquisitions, and it is the time now to be pruning around that portfolio and to recalibrate and resize that portfolio. But we will only do that if we can actually monetize assets at value, like we did last year where we set a target of $500 million, and we came in a little over $550 million. So I think that's how you should be thinking about the asset optimization efforts going into 2017. And of course, I mean, now that we have a new framework around the Business Review Committee, we will have a conversation about single assets, but every part of our business and evaluate that and make a determination in the next couple of months, which I will be in a position to announce to you later in the year."

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
Before I turn to our presentation, I would like to acknowledge Howard Cosgrove and Ed Muller for their years of service as Directors on the NRG board. I want to thank them for their dedication and wish them well in their next endeavors. Let me also congratulate our current Director, Larry Coben, on his appointment as Chairman of the Board. I'd also like to welcome our 2 new board members, John Wilder and Barry Smitherman. I look forward to working with both of them on all of the exciting opportunities ahead for NRG.
2016 was a pivotal year for our company. Just 1 year ago, I made a commitment to simplify our business, strengthen our platform and restore confidence in our direction and decision-making. We have made significant progress on all fronts. Today, NRG is in a much better place to continue executing on our multiyear strategic plan to solidify our position as the premier integrated power company in the country.
Let's move now to Slide 3, where I'd like to summarize the key highlights from today's call. First, we delivered on our numbers. Our track record of strong results and execution continued in 2016. We had our second-best safety performance year on record, and our integrated platform delivered earnings that were even stronger than last year. We grew both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth despite the difficult commodity price environment that reduced our total generation by 14% from 2015. Our Retail business delivered its third consecutive year of EBITDA growth with a record adjusted EBITDA of just over $800 million.
NRG's best-in-class platform has again demonstrated its ability to provide strong stable results despite challenging market conditions. For these reasons, I'm also able to reaffirm our 2017 financial guidance. I want to thank all my colleagues for a job well done on a very successful year.
Second, we executed on our priorities. Our focus over the past year in simplifying and streamlining our business resulted in over $0.5 billion in cost reductions. We made progress in repositioning our portfolio by selling assets at value and executing several capital projects on time and on budget. We strengthened our balance sheet by reducing corporate debt by $1 billion and extending $6 billion of debt maturities well beyond 2020. 
Last, we reinvigorated our strategic partnership with NRG Yield by putting in place a dedicated management team and expanding our Renewables business and ROFO pipeline.
Third, we're not done yet. As we close out the first phase of deleveraging, cost cutting and business optimization efforts, we now turn to the next phase of our plan. We're in a much better position today to benefit from market opportunities than we were 1 year ago.
But before discussing details of our 2016 results and 2017 plans, I want to remind you of what underpins our continued strong results and sets NRG apart from others in the industry on Slide 4. NRG's differentiated business model is simple and focuses on our competitive advantage, the integration of Generation, which includes Renewables and Retail. This integrated platform and the touch points between these primary businesses allow us to capture operational and commercial synergies in a way that makes the whole of our business greater than the sum of its parts.
NRG's unique value proposition centers on stability. Our diverse portfolio minimizes our exposure to market and fuel-specific downturns, while our diverse business lines create a stable base of free cash flows, particularly the natural hedge between Retail and Generation. In 2017, we're estimating that 3/4 of our gross margin will come from stable sources such as retail; contracted assets, including NRG Yield; and capacity revenues.
We have built a business that is not dependent on commodity prices to deliver strong results but that remains well positioned to benefit from upside in a commodity market recovery. As we manage our business for stable, visible free cash flows, we maintain the ability to grow and quickly replenish capital. We achieve these through our strategic partnership with NRG Yield, which serves as another unique differentiator of our business and is an important driver of our ability to participate in the growing Renewables segment.
Turning to Slide 5. I want to reiterate my belief that the competitive power sector is in a period of unprecedented disruption. Changes in fuel mix, consumer preference, technological innovation and increased distributed generation have put pressure on the traditional IPP model, particularly as commodity markets continue to weaken. While sufficient at the outset of competitive markets, I believe the IPP model is now obsolete and unable to create value over the long term.
On our fourth quarter call last year, I highlighted the 6 elements that I believe are now required to succeed in the competitive power sector. This started with excellence in operations and execution; diversification, both in terms of generation portfolio and business lines; and a scalable platform for growth. NRG was already strong in these 3 areas, and the results achieved throughout the past year further confirmed this assessment. So our focus turned to the remaining 3 attributes.
First, we needed to ensure that we were operating a platform efficiently. These meant simplifying by focusing on our core Generation and Retail businesses and divesting from non-core and underperforming businesses. Furthermore, we focus on reducing costs, taking over $0.5 billion out of NRG's total cost structure. These combined efforts have greatly strengthened our business compared to where we were 1 year ago.
The remaining attributes require implementing a more flexible, transparent approach to capital allocation and achieving a more resilient capital structure, given the sustained low commodity price environment. As a result, we refocused a substantial amount of our capital to deleveraging in 2016, bringing up additional capital by adjusting our dividend policy.
Importantly, we also changed the way we allocate capital for growth by refocusing on projects that offer high returns and quick paybacks. Going forward, you can expect the same discipline we brought in 2016 to be applied to the next phase of execution. And I will continue with my philosophy of no head-scratchers when it comes to understanding how we allocate capital.
And with a focus of the new business review committee well aligned with our strategic priorities, we look forward to its role in our review process and the continued execution on the 3 priorities outlined here.
Turning to Slide 6. I'd like to provide you more detail around our cost-reduction initiatives and the next phase of our plan as we move into 2017.
I am very pleased to report that not only have we already achieved our $400 million total cost savings target, we have exceeded it, reducing our total cost by $539 million compared to our 2015 baseline. Reducing our cost was not just a focus of management, but a focus of all employees throughout our organization, and I am very pleased with the progress we have made today. My promise to you was to not only hit our targeted cost savings, but to report our savings in a way that was more transparent and held us accountable. The left side of the page is a view of our total cost structure: sales and marketing, G&A, O&M and development. As you may recall, last year, we combined all of our cost-savings initiatives under one comprehensive program, but you can still track individual items in our 10-K disclosures.
With our current target met and exceeded ahead of our initial time frame, we continue on our focus on streamlining and optimizing our business. We are already working on our next round of FORNRG cost-cutting initiatives. But given the scope of the business review committee, it is appropriate to delay a public announcement of the new set of targets until later in the year.
Now turning to Slide 7. As I discussed earlier, the breadth and scale of our platform is a clear competitive advantage, but I also understand that it can complicate the ability to properly unpack our cost structure. The objective today is to help further simplify the investment proposition by enhancing the visibility into our cost structure. While I will discuss the highlights in the slide, the full detail behind these numbers can be found on the appendix of today's presentation and will map to our 2016 10-K disclosures.
As I'm sure you're all aware, comparing costs from one company to the next can be challenging. So before I get into detail, let me put more context around this analysis.
First, given the business and technology diversity that drives our integrated platform, benchmarking NRG's consolidated cost to those of a pure IPP is simply not correct. So in our disclosure, we have isolated the cost structures within each of our reported businesses as a means to compare our cost to appropriate peer companies.
Second, costs are somewhat fungible between different categories. And even within the small competitive power group, there are notable differences in cost categorization. To account for this difference, it is important to capture these combined costs, both expensed and capitalized, to fully appreciate a company's baseline cost structure.
Now going into the detail on each of our segments. In Generation, I want to remind you that our current Generation business is the result of consolidating 4 generation companies over the past 5 years: NRG, RRI, Edison Mission and Mirant. And during this time, significant cost synergies were realized as part of the integration efforts. This discipline continues today, and on an adjusted basis, our Generation segment carries a total cost of almost $50 per kilowatt, a number that is slightly lower than that of our closest peers.
For this business, we focus on a dollar-per-kW metric, given that a substantial portion of our fleet in the Northeast is reliability focused, capturing significant capacity and scarcity revenues while generating a lower number of megawatt hours. In addition, to maintain comparability, we have backed out costs associated with our nuclear unit ownership, that NRG is the only competitive power generator with this higher-fixed-cost, lower-fuel-cost technology.
While our generation costs per kW are in line with our peers, we're continually focused on driving further cost savings by improving upon efficiencies in fleet operations and asset optimization efforts.
Next, on Retail, with nearly 3 million customers, most of whom are residential customers located in Texas, NRG operates the leading residential retail platform in the country. And the stable margins from retail are an important driver of our free cash flows each quarter.
Our Retail business maintains a relentless focus on meeting evolving customer needs and on continuous improvement, which have driven expansion on both our customer base and earnings. Benchmarking costs in Retail is difficult, given the differences in customer, product and regional mix from one company to the next and because other retailers provide little visibility into the breakdown of their cost structures.
Finally, moving to Renewables. As I highlighted earlier, Renewables are a pillar of our growth and portfolio repositioning. Today, NRG, together with NRG Yield, has one of the largest renewable energy platforms in the country and we're able to leverage our expertise within our other segments to continue to develop and operate this fleet. The operating costs, as reported for NRG's Renewables segment, is $91 per kW. But important to note, this includes assets such as the Ivanpah concentrated solar thermal facility, which has a higher cost structure given the emerging nature of this technology.
The more appropriate metric is that of our combined Renewables segment in NRG and NRG Yield, which captures the full cost structure of our Renewables operations across our entire fleet. This combined view [ph] cost of $67 per kW, as you can see, is in line with peers. And we continue to improve. Since we reintegrated our Renewables group last year, we have driven further improvement in this area through transitioning large portions of our fleet to self-performance of O&M.
Additionally, we are focused on adding simpler mainstream technologies to our fleet with the core focus on utility scale solar, which can be operated at $20 per kW, and utility scale wind at $50 per kW. As a result of these initiatives, you should expect our Renewables cost structure to step down over time.
The goal of these disclosures is to provide you greater visibility into our overall cost structure and a metric that you can compare to peers. But what I want to make clear is that being in line with peers does not mean we're done looking for areas to improve. Assessing and reducing our costs is an ongoing process, and we will always aim for increased efficiency.
Now on Slide 8, I'd like to provide a summary of the many ways in which we repositioned our portfolio during the past year. As part of our normal course of business, we put our entire portfolio through a rigorous review process. The result can lead to everything from fuel conversions to asset sales to realigning our portfolio to the most compelling market opportunity.
In 2016, we took significant steps to strengthen our generation fleet. We sold 4 assets at value for $550 million, exceeding our original target by 10%. We modernized our fleet and converted 2.2 gigawatts of coal plants to natural gas, benefiting from lower gas prices and capacity revenues. We brought online our first-of-a-kind carbon capture facility, Petra Nova, on time and on budget. We pursued growth opportunities in both conventional and renewable plants, looking for areas of free [ph] capital replenishment, as highlighted by the 1.5 gigawatt renewable portfolio acquisition from SunEdison that we closed last year.
For this transaction, we have already recovered 100% of our total utility scale purchase price with just the first 265 megawatt drop-down to NRG Yield. This means we have over 1 gigawatt of projects in this portfolio at effectively 0 cost.
Looking forward, we will continue our rigorous review process, assessing the current market and developing solutions that optimize our fleet and strengthen our platform. I would expect these to include further asset dispositions at value.
Turning to Slide 9. I want to provide an update on our capital allocation plan. As I laid out on the fourth quarter call of last year, my primary objective for capital allocation was to ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital and provide our shareholders with greater visibility into our capital allocation decision-making. In an effort to begin to better align to the market cycle, the transition in capital allocation mix between 2015 to 2016 reflects the recognition that we needed to focus our efforts more on deleveraging and leave no doubt on our ability to withstand a prolonged period of low commodity prices.
For 2017, we will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and pay down debt, expanding our current program with an additional $200 million through the end of this year. Approximately 70% of every dollar we allocate will go toward this effort as we aim to maintain a cycle-appropriate level of leverage. This will ensure we have the financial flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities when the market recovers.
We will also continue to pursue low-cost options for growth where we have an ability to generate strong returns in a relatively short period of time, which can be viewed as temporal capital for NRG.
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk now for the financial review."
413857,416418264,1144884,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2017",2017-02-28,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 11, before I review the full year results, I'd like to take a moment to highlight a change we've made to both our segment disclosures for 2016 and our guidance",1475,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 11, before I review the full year results, I'd like to take a moment to highlight a change we've made to both our segment disclosures for 2016 and our guidance breakdown. We're now combining both Mass Retail and Business Solutions into a single Retail segment in order to bring all of our direct customer-facing businesses together as a single segment.
Business Solutions, which consists of our C&I, demand response and other B2B initiatives, was previously part of the Generation segment. Our results for 2016, as well as our guidance for 2017, now reflect this change, which we believe will provide greater clarity of disclosure in helping our investors better understand the NRG value proposition.
Turning to 2016 financial results. NRG delivered $3.257 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.2 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Our results highlight the benefits and resilience of our integrated platform as the low commodity price environment helped Retail deliver $800 million in adjusted EBITDA. Mass Retail contributed $755 million of this total, in line with the midpoint of our latest guidance for Mass Retail, which was announced in our third quarter call. Generation and Renewables achieved $1.547 billion in adjusted EBITDA, while NRG Yield, aided primarily by robust wind conditions through the year, contributed $899 million.
We ended 2016 having completed $1 billion of our $1.4 billion corporate debt reduction program, the balance of which is part of our 2017 capital allocation to retire the remainder of our 2018 bond maturity.
When combined with the retirement of our convertible preferred and the extension of corporate debt maturities at more favorable rates, including the recent refinancing of our term loan, which occurred in January, our deleveraging efforts have generated in total almost $100 million in annual interest and dividend savings, significantly improving NRG-level free cash flow.
Earlier this month, NRG received $128 million in net proceeds from a new nonrecourse holdco debt financing at Agua Caliente. In addition, NRG and NRG Yield have now entered into an agreement to complete the drop-down of a 31 -- of 31%, rather, of NRG's stake in Agua Caliente as well as the Utah solar assets acquired late last year as a part of the SunEdison transaction for a total of $130 million. Having previously realized $48 million in financing proceeds from additional debt financing for the Utah solar assets late last year, these 2017 transactions, which I'll review in greater detail shortly, are expected to result in additional cash proceeds to NRG of over $250 million, increasing 2017 capital available for allocation.
Next, I'd like to briefly address an element of our 2016 results outside of EBITDA and free cash flow: the noncash impairment charges of $1.2 billion incurred for the year. Over the course of 2016, we impaired a number of assets due to changes in the market affecting these specific projects for a total of approximately $300 million through the third quarter. And in addition, on an annual basis, we tested our long-lived assets and goodwill for potential impairments. Given the prolonged low commodity price outlook, we adjusted our long-term view of power prices, which resulted in an additional noncash impairment charge of approximately $900 million, consisting primarily of a write-down of certain fixed assets in California, Texas, Pennsylvania as well as the remaining goodwill on the Texas assets. This noncash impairment charge has no impact on EBITDA or free cash flow, and we are reconfirming our guidance for both 2017 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth.
Turning to Slide 12 to review our plans on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. We expect approximately $1 billion of capital available for allocation at the NRG level in 2017, which represents excess capital beyond our minimum cash reserve for liquidity that supplements our corporate credit facility. 2017 capital available for allocation consists of the excess cash balance at the NRG level at the end of 2016, supplemented with the closing of the Agua Caliente financing in February, plus the midpoint of our 2017 NRG level free cash flow before growth guidance as well as the proceeds from the drop-down of the Utah utility solar assets and the 16% interest in Agua Caliente to NRG Yield of approximately $130 million, and that is expected to close this quarter.
We expect to allocate approximately 7% of NRG-level capital in '17 towards further debt reduction. This consists of nondiscretionary debt amortization of both the NRG term loan and the payments to the counter-party in connection with the Midwest generation monetization transaction in 2016, which are treated as principal payments from an accounting perspective. The balance of capital towards debt reduction is discretionary and consists of $400 million toward the retirement of the remainder of our 2018 maturity, which was previously committed, plus an additional $200 million towards more corporate debt reduction, which we are announcing today.
We will remain flexible as to the tenor of debt, to which this additional $200 million is allocated. However, the most likely scenario is we will deploy this capital toward retiring the remaining balance of our 2021 senior notes. These notes are currently callable and the call price will step down again in May. Prior to this allocation, we're already on track to achieve our target debt ratio in 2017, which we continue to see as a trough year based on the forward curves. This additional debt reduction not only further strengthens our balance sheet and extends our nearest unsecured maturity to 2022, it also represents an attractive risk-adjusted return.
We plan to hold our dividend at its current rate of $0.12 per share on an annualized basis, representing about 4% of our capital for allocation. And finally, in 2017, we expect approximately $185 million of growth investments, primarily consisting of our investments at Bacliff, Puente, Carlsbad and the remaining capital required for the Petra Nova project.
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to provide some further details on the drop-down transactions and related financings, which highlight in particular the rapid return of capital achieved from the SunEdison transaction, as Mauricio mentioned earlier.
Looking at the left half of the slide, as I mentioned, we have already closed on additional project-level financings for both the Utah solar assets we acquired as a part of the SunEdison utility scale transaction as well as our 51% stake in Agua Caliente. When combined with the expected proceeds from the drop-down of our equity stake in Utah as well as a portion of our stake in Agua Caliente, which we expect to close in the current quarter, total proceeds from these transactions to NRG is approximately $300 million.
In connection with the drop-down transaction, NRG and NRG Yield also agreed to expand the ROFO pipeline to include 2 additional assets from the SunEdison transaction, enhancing the growth pipeline for Yield and expanding potential capital replenishment for NRG.
Looking at the right half of the slide and, importantly, less than 6 months after closing the SunEdison utility scale transaction, NRG is on track to replenish more than 100% of the total purchase price while retaining a 0-cost option on the balance of that portfolio, which includes both the late-stage pipeline, which is now part of the expanded NRG Yield ROFO, as well as more than 1 gigawatt of additional opportunities. As shown on the lower right of the slide, the proceeds from the Utah solar debt financing, which closed late last year, and the Utah solar portion of the NRG Yield drop-drown, which should close shortly, total $129 million, exceeding the price paid for the entire SunEdison transaction by $5 million.
And finally, Slide 14 provides an update on corporate credit metrics. Starting with 2016, having repurchased a portion of our 2018 and '21 notes during the fourth quarter, we've completed our 2016 delevering objectives, driving corporate debt to $7.8 billion.
Based on the midpoint 2016 guidance, this implies a corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio of just over 4x.
Turning to 2017 metrics. Having now allocated that additional $200 million in corporate-level debt reduction, total corporate-level debt reduction in 2017 is just over $600 million, putting us on track to reduce corporate-level debt to $7.2 billion. When combined with 2017 corporate EBITDA based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance, this now implies a 2017 debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.13x.
Importantly, while our target ratio is based on gross corporate debt-to-EBITDA, for comparative purposes, I've now added the implied net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the bottom of this table using actual corporate-level cash in 2016 and implied year-end 2017 cash by adding the current balance of unallocated 2017 capital to the year-end 2016 balance. These implied net debt ratios are approximately 3.75x in each of 2016 and 2017.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

But the most important thing to me is if we can actually monetize assets at value. And that's where we're -- what we're going to be focusing on, on the next steps of asset dispositions. As I've said in the past, we ended up with a portfolio of close to 50,000 megawatts of generation through a number of acquisitions, and it is the time now to be pruning around that portfolio and to recalibrate and resize that portfolio. But we will only do that if we can actually monetize assets at value, like we did last year where we set a target of $500 million and we came in a little over $550 million. So I think that's how you should be thinking about the asset optimization efforts going into 2017.

Before I turn to our presentation, I would like to acknowledge Howard Cosgrove and Ed Muller for their years of service as Directors on the NRG board. I want to thank them for their dedication and wish them well in their next endeavors. Let me also congratulate our current Director, Larry Coben, on his appointment as Chairman of the Board. I'd also like to welcome our 2 new board members, John Wilder and Barry Smitherman. I look forward to working with both of them on all of the exciting opportunities ahead for NRG.
2016 was a pivotal year for our company. Just 1 year ago, I made a commitment to simplify our business, strengthen our platform and restore confidence in our direction and decision-making. We have made significant progress on all fronts. Today, NRG is in a much better place to continue executing on our multiyear strategic plan to solidify our position as the premier integrated power company in the country.
Let's move now to Slide 3, where I'd like to summarize the key highlights from today's call. First, we delivered on our numbers. Our track record of strong results and execution continued in 2016. We had our second-best safety performance year on record, and our integrated platform delivered earnings that were even stronger than last year. We grew both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth despite the difficult commodity price environment that reduced our total generation by 14% from 2015. Our Retail business delivered its third consecutive year of EBITDA growth with a record adjusted EBITDA of just over $800 million.
NRG's best-in-class platform has again demonstrated its ability to provide strong stable results despite challenging market conditions. For these reasons, I'm also able to reaffirm our 2017 financial guidance. I want to thank all my colleagues for a job well done on a very successful year.
Second, we executed on our priorities. Our focus over the past year in simplifying and streamlining our business resulted in over $0.5 billion in cost reductions. We made progress in repositioning our portfolio by selling assets at value and executing several capital projects on time and on budget. We strengthened our balance sheet by reducing corporate debt by $1 billion and extending $6 billion of debt maturities well beyond 2020. 
Last, we reinvigorated our strategic partnership with NRG Yield by putting in place a dedicated management team and expanding our Renewables business and ROFO pipeline.
Third, we're not done yet. As we close out the first phase of deleveraging, cost cutting and business optimization efforts, we now turn to the next phase of our plan. We're in a much better position today to benefit from market opportunities than we were 1 year ago.
But before discussing details of our 2016 results and 2017 plans, I want to remind you of what underpins our continued strong results and sets NRG apart from others in the industry on Slide 4. NRG's differentiated business model is simple and focuses on our competitive advantage, the integration of Generation, which includes Renewables and Retail. This integrated platform and the touch points between these primary businesses allow us to capture operational and commercial synergies in a way that makes the whole of our business greater than the sum of its parts.
NRG's unique value proposition centers on stability. Our diverse portfolio minimizes our exposure to market and fuel-specific downturns, while our diverse business lines create a stable base of free cash flows, particularly the natural hedge between Retail and Generation. In 2017, we're estimating that 3/4 of our gross margin will come from stable sources such as retail; contracted assets, including NRG Yield; and capacity revenues.
We have built a business that is not dependent on commodity prices to deliver strong results but that remains well positioned to benefit from upside in a commodity market recovery. As we manage our business for stable, visible free cash flows, we maintain the ability to grow and quickly replenish capital. We achieve these through our strategic partnership with NRG Yield, which serves as another unique differentiator of our business and is an important driver of our ability to participate in the growing Renewables segment.
Turning to Slide 5. I want to reiterate my belief that the competitive power sector is in a period of unprecedented disruption. Changes in fuel mix, consumer preference, technological innovation and increased distributed generation have put pressure on the traditional IPP model, particularly as commodity markets continue to weaken. While sufficient at the outset of competitive markets, I believe the IPP model is now obsolete and unable to create value over the long term.
On our fourth quarter call last year, I highlighted the 6 elements that I believe are now required to succeed in the competitive power sector. This started with excellence in operations and execution; diversification, both in terms of generation portfolio and business lines; and a scalable platform for growth. NRG was already strong in these 3 areas, and the results achieved throughout the past year further confirmed this assessment. So our focus turned to the remaining 3 attributes.
First, we needed to ensure that we were operating a platform efficiently. These meant simplifying by focusing on our core Generation and Retail businesses and divesting from non-core and underperforming businesses. Furthermore, we focus on reducing costs, taking over $0.5 billion out of NRG's total cost structure. These combined efforts have greatly strengthened our business compared to where we were 1 year ago.
The remaining attributes require implementing a more flexible, transparent approach to capital allocation and achieving a more resilient capital structure, given the sustained low commodity price environment. As a result, we refocused a substantial amount of our capital to deleveraging in 2016, bringing up additional capital by adjusting our dividend policy.
Importantly, we also changed the way we allocate capital for growth by refocusing on projects that offer high returns and quick paybacks. Going forward, you can expect the same discipline we brought in 2016 to be applied to the next phase of execution. And I will continue with my philosophy of no head-scratchers when it comes to understanding how we allocate capital.
And with a focus of the new business review committee well aligned with our strategic priorities, we look forward to its role in our review process and the continued execution on the 3 priorities outlined here.
Turning to Slide 6. I'd like to provide you more detail around our cost-reduction initiatives and the next phase of our plan as we move into 2017.
I am very pleased to report that not only have we already achieved our $400 million total cost savings target, we have exceeded it, reducing our total cost by $539 million compared to our 2015 baseline. Reducing our cost was not just a focus of management, but a focus of all employees throughout our organization, and I am very pleased with the progress we have made today. My promise to you was to not only hit our targeted cost savings, but to report our savings in a way that was more transparent and held us accountable. The left side of the page is a view of our total cost structure: sales and marketing, G&A, O&M and development. As you may recall, last year, we combined all of our cost-savings initiatives under one comprehensive program, but you can still track individual items in our 10-K disclosures.
With our current target met and exceeded ahead of our initial time frame, we continue on our focus on streamlining and optimizing our business. We are already working on our next round of FORNRG cost-cutting initiatives. But given the scope of the business review committee, it is appropriate to delay a public announcement of the new set of targets until later in the year.
Now turning to Slide 7. As I discussed earlier, the breadth and scale of our platform is a clear competitive advantage, but I also understand that it can complicate the ability to properly unpack our cost structure. The objective today is to help further simplify the investment proposition by enhancing the visibility into our cost structure. While I will discuss the highlights in the slide, the full detail behind these numbers can be found on the appendix of today's presentation and will map to our 2016 10-K disclosures.
As I'm sure you're all aware, comparing costs from one company to the next can be challenging. So before I get into detail, let me put more context around this analysis.
First, given the business and technology diversity that drives our integrated platform, benchmarking NRG's consolidated cost to those of a pure IPP is simply not correct. So in our disclosure, we have isolated the cost structures within each of our reported businesses as a means to compare our cost to appropriate peer companies.
Second, costs are somewhat fungible between different categories. And even within the small competitive power group, there are notable differences in cost categorization. To account for this difference, it is important to capture these combined costs, both expensed and capitalized, to fully appreciate a company's baseline cost structure.
Now going into the detail on each of our segments. In Generation, I want to remind you that our current Generation business is the result of consolidating 4 generation companies over the past 5 years: NRG, RRI, Edison Mission and Mirant. And during this time, significant cost synergies were realized as part of the integration efforts. This discipline continues today, and on an adjusted basis, our Generation segment carries a total cost of almost $50 per kilowatt, a number that is slightly lower than that of our closest peers.
For this business, we focus on a dollar-per-kW metric, given that a substantial portion of our fleet in the Northeast is reliability focused, capturing significant capacity and scarcity revenues while generating a lower number of megawatt hours. In addition, to maintain comparability, we have backed out costs associated with our nuclear unit ownership, that NRG is the only competitive power generator with this higher-fixed-cost, lower-fuel-cost technology.
While our generation costs per kW are in line with our peers, we're continually focused on driving further cost savings by improving upon efficiencies in fleet operations and asset optimization efforts.
Next, on Retail, with nearly 3 million customers, most of whom are residential customers located in Texas, NRG operates the leading residential retail platform in the country. And the stable margins from retail are an important driver of our free cash flows each quarter.
Our Retail business maintains a relentless focus on meeting evolving customer needs and on continuous improvement, which have driven expansion on both our customer base and earnings. Benchmarking costs in Retail is difficult, given the differences in customer, product and regional mix from one company to the next and because other retailers provide little visibility into the breakdown of their cost structures.
Finally, moving to Renewables. As I highlighted earlier, Renewables are a pillar of our growth and portfolio repositioning. Today, NRG, together with NRG Yield, has one of the largest renewable energy platforms in the country and we're able to leverage our expertise within our other segments to continue to develop and operate this fleet. The operating costs, as reported for NRG's Renewables segment, is $91 per kW. But important to note, this includes assets such as the Ivanpah concentrated solar thermal facility, which has a higher cost structure given the emerging nature of this technology.
The more appropriate metric is that of our combined Renewables segment in NRG and NRG Yield, which captures the full cost structure of our Renewables operations across our entire fleet. This combined view [ph] cost of $67 per kW, as you can see, is in line with peers. And we continue to improve. Since we reintegrated our Renewables group last year, we have driven further improvement in this area through transitioning large portions of our fleet to self-performance of O&M.
Additionally, we are focused on adding simpler mainstream technologies to our fleet with the core focus on utility scale solar, which can be operated at $20 per kW, and utility scale wind at $50 per kW. As a result of these initiatives, you should expect our Renewables cost structure to step down over time.
The goal of these disclosures is to provide you greater visibility into our overall cost structure and a metric that you can compare to peers. But what I want to make clear is that being in line with peers does not mean we're done looking for areas to improve. Assessing and reducing our costs is an ongoing process, and we will always aim for increased efficiency.
Now on Slide 8, I'd like to provide a summary of the many ways in which we repositioned our portfolio during the past year. As part of our normal course of business, we put our entire portfolio through a rigorous review process. The result can lead to everything from fuel conversions to asset sales to realigning our portfolio to the most compelling market opportunity.
In 2016, we took significant steps to strengthen our generation fleet. We sold 4 assets at value for $550 million, exceeding our original target by 10%. We modernized our fleet and converted 2.2 gigawatts of coal plants to natural gas, benefiting from lower gas prices and capacity revenues. We brought online our first-of-a-kind carbon capture facility, Petra Nova, on time and on budget. We pursued growth opportunities in both conventional and renewable plants, looking for areas of free [ph] capital replenishment, as highlighted by the 1.5 gigawatt renewable portfolio acquisition from SunEdison that we closed last year.
For this transaction, we have already recovered 100% of our total utility scale purchase price with just the first 265 megawatt drop-down to NRG Yield. This means we have over 1 gigawatt of projects in this portfolio at effectively 0 cost.
Looking forward, we will continue our rigorous review process, assessing the current market and developing solutions that optimize our fleet and strengthen our platform. I would expect these to include further asset dispositions at value.
Turning to Slide 9. I want to provide an update on our capital allocation plan. As I laid out on the fourth quarter call of last year, my primary objective for capital allocation was to ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital and provide our shareholders with greater visibility into our capital allocation decision-making. In an effort to begin to better align to the market cycle, the transition in capital allocation mix between 2015 to 2016 reflects the recognition that we needed to focus our efforts more on deleveraging and leave no doubt on our ability to withstand a prolonged period of low commodity prices.
For 2017, we will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and pay down debt, expanding our current program with an additional $200 million through the end of this year. Approximately 70% of every dollar we allocate will go toward this effort as we aim to maintain a cycle-appropriate level of leverage. This will ensure we have the financial flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities when the market recovers.
We will also continue to pursue low-cost options for growth where we have an ability to generate strong returns in a relatively short period of time, which can be viewed as temporal capital for NRG.
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk now for the financial review."
413857,416418264,1146161,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2017",2017-02-28,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 11, before I review the full year results, I'd like to take a moment to highlight a change we've made to both our segment disclosures for 2016 and our guidance",1475,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 11, before I review the full year results, I'd like to take a moment to highlight a change we've made to both our segment disclosures for 2016 and our guidance breakdown. We're now combining both Mass Retail and Business Solutions into a single Retail segment in order to bring all of our direct customer-facing businesses together as a single segment.
Business Solutions, which consists of our C&I, demand response and other B2B initiatives, was previously part of the Generation segment. Our results for 2016, as well as our guidance for 2017, now reflect this change, which we believe will provide greater clarity of disclosure in helping our investors better understand the NRG value proposition.
Turning to 2016 financial results. NRG delivered $3.257 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.2 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Our results highlight the benefits and resilience of our integrated platform as the low commodity price environment helped Retail deliver $800 million in adjusted EBITDA. Mass Retail contributed $755 million of this total, in line with the midpoint of our latest guidance for Mass Retail, which was announced in our third quarter call. Generation and Renewables achieved $1.547 billion in adjusted EBITDA, while NRG Yield, aided primarily by robust wind conditions through the year, contributed $899 million.
We ended 2016 having completed $1 billion of our $1.4 billion corporate debt reduction program, the balance of which is part of our 2017 capital allocation to retire the remainder of our 2018 bond maturity.
When combined with the retirement of our convertible preferred and the extension of corporate debt maturities at more favorable rates, including the recent refinancing of our term loan, which occurred in January, our deleveraging efforts have generated in total almost $100 million in annual interest and dividend savings, significantly improving NRG-level free cash flow.
Earlier this month, NRG received $128 million in net proceeds from a new nonrecourse holdco debt financing at Agua Caliente. In addition, NRG and NRG Yield have now entered into an agreement to complete the drop-down of a 31 -- of 31%, rather, of NRG's stake in Agua Caliente as well as the Utah solar assets acquired late last year as a part of the SunEdison transaction for a total of $130 million. Having previously realized $48 million in financing proceeds from additional debt financing for the Utah solar assets late last year, these 2017 transactions, which I'll review in greater detail shortly, are expected to result in additional cash proceeds to NRG of over $250 million, increasing 2017 capital available for allocation.
Next, I'd like to briefly address an element of our 2016 results outside of EBITDA and free cash flow: the noncash impairment charges of $1.2 billion incurred for the year. Over the course of 2016, we impaired a number of assets due to changes in the market affecting these specific projects for a total of approximately $300 million through the third quarter. And in addition, on an annual basis, we tested our long-lived assets and goodwill for potential impairments. Given the prolonged low commodity price outlook, we adjusted our long-term view of power prices, which resulted in an additional noncash impairment charge of approximately $900 million, consisting primarily of a write-down of certain fixed assets in California, Texas, Pennsylvania as well as the remaining goodwill on the Texas assets. This noncash impairment charge has no impact on EBITDA or free cash flow, and we are reconfirming our guidance for both 2017 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth.
Turning to Slide 12 to review our plans on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. We expect approximately $1 billion of capital available for allocation at the NRG level in 2017, which represents excess capital beyond our minimum cash reserve for liquidity that supplements our corporate credit facility. 2017 capital available for allocation consists of the excess cash balance at the NRG level at the end of 2016, supplemented with the closing of the Agua Caliente financing in February, plus the midpoint of our 2017 NRG level free cash flow before growth guidance as well as the proceeds from the drop-down of the Utah utility solar assets and the 16% interest in Agua Caliente to NRG Yield of approximately $130 million, and that is expected to close this quarter.
We expect to allocate approximately 7% of NRG-level capital in '17 towards further debt reduction. This consists of nondiscretionary debt amortization of both the NRG term loan and the payments to the counter-party in connection with the Midwest generation monetization transaction in 2016, which are treated as principal payments from an accounting perspective. The balance of capital towards debt reduction is discretionary and consists of $400 million toward the retirement of the remainder of our 2018 maturity, which was previously committed, plus an additional $200 million towards more corporate debt reduction, which we are announcing today.
We will remain flexible as to the tenor of debt, to which this additional $200 million is allocated. However, the most likely scenario is we will deploy this capital toward retiring the remaining balance of our 2021 senior notes. These notes are currently callable and the call price will step down again in May. Prior to this allocation, we're already on track to achieve our target debt ratio in 2017, which we continue to see as a trough year based on the forward curves. This additional debt reduction not only further strengthens our balance sheet and extends our nearest unsecured maturity to 2022, it also represents an attractive risk-adjusted return.
We plan to hold our dividend at its current rate of $0.12 per share on an annualized basis, representing about 4% of our capital for allocation. And finally, in 2017, we expect approximately $185 million of growth investments, primarily consisting of our investments at Bacliff, Puente, Carlsbad and the remaining capital required for the Petra Nova project.
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to provide some further details on the drop-down transactions and related financings, which highlight in particular the rapid return of capital achieved from the SunEdison transaction, as Mauricio mentioned earlier.
Looking at the left half of the slide, as I mentioned, we have already closed on additional project-level financings for both the Utah solar assets we acquired as a part of the SunEdison utility scale transaction as well as our 51% stake in Agua Caliente. When combined with the expected proceeds from the drop-down of our equity stake in Utah as well as a portion of our stake in Agua Caliente, which we expect to close in the current quarter, total proceeds from these transactions to NRG is approximately $300 million.
In connection with the drop-down transaction, NRG and NRG Yield also agreed to expand the ROFO pipeline to include 2 additional assets from the SunEdison transaction, enhancing the growth pipeline for Yield and expanding potential capital replenishment for NRG.
Looking at the right half of the slide and, importantly, less than 6 months after closing the SunEdison utility scale transaction, NRG is on track to replenish more than 100% of the total purchase price while retaining a 0-cost option on the balance of that portfolio, which includes both the late-stage pipeline, which is now part of the expanded NRG Yield ROFO, as well as more than 1 gigawatt of additional opportunities. As shown on the lower right of the slide, the proceeds from the Utah solar debt financing, which closed late last year, and the Utah solar portion of the NRG Yield drop-drown, which should close shortly, total $129 million, exceeding the price paid for the entire SunEdison transaction by $5 million.
And finally, Slide 14 provides an update on corporate credit metrics. Starting with 2016, having repurchased a portion of our 2018 and '21 notes during the fourth quarter, we've completed our 2016 delevering objectives, driving corporate debt to $7.8 billion.
Based on the midpoint 2016 guidance, this implies a corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio of just over 4x.
Turning to 2017 metrics. Having now allocated that additional $200 million in corporate-level debt reduction, total corporate-level debt reduction in 2017 is just over $600 million, putting us on track to reduce corporate-level debt to $7.2 billion. When combined with 2017 corporate EBITDA based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance, this now implies a 2017 debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.13x.
Importantly, while our target ratio is based on gross corporate debt-to-EBITDA, for comparative purposes, I've now added the implied net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the bottom of this table using actual corporate-level cash in 2016 and implied year-end 2017 cash by adding the current balance of unallocated 2017 capital to the year-end 2016 balance. These implied net debt ratios are approximately 3.75x in each of 2016 and 2017.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

We continue with the process of seeking a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, where we are in active dialogue with bondholders, and expect to provide more clarity next quarter.
With a solid foundation put in place this year, we can continue on executing our strategy to drive greater shareholder value in the months and years to come.

But the most important thing to me is if we can actually monetize assets at value. And that's where we're -- what we're going to be focusing on, on the next steps of asset dispositions. As I've said in the past, we ended up with a portfolio of close to 50,000 megawatts of generation through a number of acquisitions, and it is the time now to be pruning around that portfolio and to recalibrate and resize that portfolio. But we will only do that if we can actually monetize assets at value, like we did last year where we set a target of $500 million and we came in a little over $550 million. So I think that's how you should be thinking about the asset optimization efforts going into 2017.

The remainder of that are -- it's a list of different things: It's deactivation cost for deactivations that took place. Obviously, those megawatts are not included; ARO, asset retirement obligation expense; the purchase accounting effect of lease accounting for some of our acquired assets that are under lease; and the remainder of that is basically just lease expense, which is really more of a financing charge that's largely associated with GenOn, and a subset of that is obviously the Midwest Gen asset.

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
Let's start today's call with our Q1 results on Slide 3. Today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $412 million and reaffirming our full year financial guidance for 2017 of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion.
Our operational execution remained outstanding during the quarter. First and foremost, we achieved top-decile safety performance, which is a testament to our ability to focus on our most critical objectives. We also maintained our focus on our key strategic priorities: reducing costs, optimizing assets and balance sheet management. We announced the activation [indiscernible] of 1,600 megawatts of generation, reinforcing our commitment to constantly optimize our portfolio, given changing market conditions.
We continue our prudent approach to growth and capital recycling with the drop-down of the Utah solar and 31% of our interest in Agua Caliente assets for $130 million in total proceeds. And today, we are announcing the offer of our remaining 25% interest in a large portfolio of wind assets from the [indiscernible] pipeline to NRG Yield.
Finally, the Business Review Committee is well underway in its evaluation and is making good progress. All businesses are engaged, and we're working diligently to provide an update to the market as soon as possible.
Turning to the right side of the page, I want to take a moment to identify and explain the key drivers for the quarter and touch upon our path to full-year guidance. Kirk will provide additional details later in the presentation.
Let me start with the first quarter results. As you can see on the chart, the decrease in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year was driven almost entirely by the generation business. The rolloff of higher price hedges that were executed after the polar vortex of 2014, lower capacity revenues in the East and a few known onetime items accounted for almost 75% of the total decrease. These items were included in our guidance, as we had identified 2017 as a trough-year and have guided to a lower full year result compared to 2016.
The other 25% was a result of mild weather, weak renewable resources and advisory fees. Taking this first quarter result and our current outlook for the year, we're now trending towards the lower half of our guidance range. We expect to update our guidance once we have more clarity on the DRC and general processes.
Now shifting focused on our operational metrics on Slide 4. As you can see, the organization remained focus on our day-to-day operations, despite ongoing internal initiatives and weak market conditions. I am particularly proud of our safety record, as we delivered another quarter of top-decile performance. This is a testament to our strong safety culture and excellence in operations, where 142 facilities out of 158 operated without a single reportable injury.
Total generation was down 9% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by lower generation in our gas and oil units and the East coal plants. This was partially offset by increases in production from our oil units in the Gulf Coast due to higher wholesale prices.
Our traditional availability metric, EAF, was up from last year following the completion of an intense 2 years of repowering and environmental compliance outage. Although EAF increased, it doesn't tell the full story of NRG's ability to capture value when economics justify, so we introduced our in the money availability metric last quarter. We believe this is an improved measure of our ability to manage and balance operational performance, margin at risk and spend while in this low commodity price environment. Our results demonstrate our ability to have units are available to capture value when it matters.
In our Retail business, we continued our growth. Our sales were up in both our Retail Mass and C&I segments, where we acquired an additional 14,000 Retail Mass customers over the quarter, bringing us up nearly 87,000 customers year-over-year. Although margins were down slightly due to mild weather and changing customer mix, our growth in customers and customer count helped us maintain volumes.
We now turn our attention to the important summer months, and I remained confident in how we have positioned both our generation and retail businesses in each of their respective markets.
Turning to Slide 5, we outlined the key trends and how we have positioned our portfolio in each of our core markets. As I've described in the past, we have come a long way in diversifying our earnings, both in terms of business lines and our portfolio composition. Today, almost 3/4 of our estimated 2017 gross margin comes from sources that are not directly correlated to the price of natural gas. These diversified base of earnings drives our platform and is enhanced by the regional strategies we take in each of our markets.
So let me start with the Gulf Coast. We continued to see strong growth across the region and are encouraged by the fundamental dynamics, particularly in ERCOT. Given the energy-only market structure, an integrated platform of generation and retail is necessary to mitigate price volatility and deliver sustained value.
From a market perspective, given the persistent low commodity prices in ERCOT for almost 5 years, we do see a heightened risk of both new generation being delayed and accelerated retirements that could tighten the markets sooner than expected.
In the East, the market continues to be centered around capacity and providing reliability of the lowest cost. Over the years, we have pivoted our fleet to focus on reliability and benefit from capacity prices, while maintaining a cheap option on energy. We continue to seek opportunities to balance our generation portfolio with more retail and enjoy the benefits of an integrated platform. But we will only do that at value, while recognizing the limitations of the East Retail markets today.
We're also encouraged by the full implementation of the capacity performance construct in the upcoming PJM auction, which creates a natural market tightening through more stringent reliability requirements. But while we believe the market construct itself can be effective, we are concerned about the recent out of market payments that keep on economic generation from leaving the system, and I will be speaking more in these in a few minutes.
Finally, in California, regulatory policy continues to support the decarbonization of the state's economy with a focus on renewables, click start gas, controllable demands and increasing energy storage. In this market, our assets are well-positioned inside low pockets and have benefited from repowering opportunities.
In California, we have brought online or developed over 2 gigawatts of renewables and 2.5 gigawatts of quick start gas over the past 5 years. This past quarter, our construct project PPA became final and nonappealable and construction started in February.
Moving on to Slide 6. The fundamentals of the ERCOT market remains strong. Load growth continues to outpace the rest of the country. On a weather normalized basis, it has averaged over 2% over the past 12 months. And as you can see on the left-hand chart, ERCOT has achieved higher peak loads with lower temperatures over the past few years. The new forecast by ERCOT for 2017 who's peak demand 2.5% higher than last year and a high demand case close to 8%, that is 5,000 megawatts higher. At the same time, we have experienced energy prices for the past 5 years with little to no scarcity premium.
This market dynamic is putting significant pressure on both newbuilds and retirements. As you can see on the right side of the page, there have been a number of delays or cancellation of projects as developers failed to justify new investment at current prices. For example, the 3 thermal projects later to come online for the summer of 2018 have not yet indicated that they have begun construction and are unlikely to achieve commercial operations prior to next summer.
Now turning to retirements. ERCOT has historically understated the actual number of megawatts leaving the system, as you can see, from the period between 2009 and 2016. Looking forward, we see the same anemic estimate for the retirements in the reports, assuming only 840 megawatts between 2017 and 2022. In April, we announced that Greens Bayou 5 will go into mothball status. That's 371 megawatts alone leaving the market. And we believe that there are close to 5 to 6 gigawatts of already identified generation at risk today in the market.
As we look at the future, we serve margins in the high teens. We cannot help but think about the higher loads, less newbuilds and more retirements quickly tightening the market and creating scarcity conditions. In our view, ERCOT remains the most attractive market in terms of market fundamentals, but we need to see significantly better price signals before we can start deploying additional capital.
Now turning to the east on the Slide 7. Energy margins remained challenged, given low natural gas prices and new efficient generation, but we maintained our positive outlook on capacity markets, particularly in PJM, which implements the first 100% capacity performance option later this month. In this construct, the higher reliability requirement will create challenges for the megawatt [indiscernible] in previous options as base capacity, including less reliable generation and demand response. These resources will have to make a decision between taking themselves out of the market or pricing in a higher reliability premium.
While we see positive changes like the capacity performance construct in PJM and other East markets, we are concerned about increasing activity by the states to undermine the integrity of competitive markets.
Out of market subsidies and contracts distort price signals needed to attract new capital investment, but often raising prices for the end users. We, and a number of other parties, have filed legal challenges to the nuclear subsidies in both New York and Illinois because we believe they're not legal and because regulators should focus on crafting competitive solutions for public policy objectives. We are encouraged by the support from PJM, its market monitor, other generators and consumer groups. You can expect NRG to continue to be a leader in these efforts, to protect the world functioning of competitive markets.
So with that, I will turn it to Kirk to talk about the financial results for the quarter."

Turning to financial summary on Slide 9, NRG delivered $412 million adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter. Generation and Renewables delivered $95 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, while retail",851,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to financial summary on Slide 9, NRG delivered $412 million adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter. Generation and Renewables delivered $95 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, while retail and yield time contributed $133 million and $184 million. As Mauricio discussed earlier, our first quarter results, relative to 2016, were impacted by a combination of expected changes as well as other unexpected variances.
As shown in the chart on the bottom half of the page, approximately 75% of the quarter-over-quarter change in EBITDA was anticipated and occurred in our Generation segment. The majority of this anticipated variance was a result of the impact of lower realized energy margins, including the roll off of higher-priced hedges in 2016 combined with a onetime impact of the sale of emissions credits. The remainder of this expected change in the Generation segment was due to a combination of lower year-over-year capacity prices as well as the shift of hedge revenues from 2017 to 2016, as a result of the early monetization of hedges at GenOn. The remaining quarter-over-quarter variance was primarily due to the impact of milder weather, which affected all 4 of our major segments during the quarter.
Our Retail business was primarily impacted by lower margins, resulted from a combination of milder weather and higher supply cost, while both NRG Yield and Renewables solar below normal solar installation and wind speeds, primarily in California. The milder than normal weather for the quarter also impacted the Generation segment, particularly in the East. And finally, we saw additional SG&A expenses due to advisory fees, largely associated with the newly formed Business Review Committee we established late in the quarter.
Turning to the outlook for full year 2017. We are reaffirming our guidance ranges for the year of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $800 million to $1 billion in free cash flow before growth. However, taking into account the first quarter results and our current outlook for the balance of the year, we are currently tracking towards the lower half of these ranges.
Importantly, as Mauricio noted, this outlook does not yet reflect the impact of the BRC and GenOn processes. We anticipate having clarity on these processes and their resulting impact on guidance in the near term.
Turning to Slide 10, for a brief update on 2017 NRG level capital allocation. Having now closed on a drop-down of the Utah assets and a partial interest in Agua Caliente to NRG Yield during the quarter, our capital built for allocation stands at approximately $1 billion. And having now offered our remaining 25% stake in the TE Wind portfolio to NRG Yield, we are focused on completing this transaction later in the year to further augment available capital at the NRG-level.
Our planned capital allocation for the year also remains unchanged, including approximately 70% allocated to debt reduction to further strengthen the balance sheet. We expect to execute on the bulk of delevering in late 2017, as we approach the maturity data of our 2018 notes as well as more attractive pricing on callable debt.
With growth investments and shareholder dividends unchanged since our previous update, we continue to anticipate approximately $75 million of excess capital yet to be allocated, and we will address the expected use of this excess later in the year.
Finally, Slide 11 provides an update on 2017 corporate credit metrics. There are 2 changes to highlight since our last update: first, during the quarter, GenOn grew $125 million under the secured intercompany credit facility with NRG. NRG, in turn, funded this via a draw on our corporate credit facility in the same amount. The draw under the intercompany GenOn revolver was a result of a drawdown on the $125 million letter of credit posted by GenOn in support of Genmar. Although this drawdown was a result of the claim of default by the owner lessors, Genmar disagrees with the default claim and the associated drawdown on the letters of credit and has been in the process of pursuing its rights in revenues. Although we view this drawdown on the NRG revolving credit facility is temporary, pending the resolution of this dispute, we have updated our corporate debt balance as well as the GenOn level total debt to reflect the $125 million increase.
As to the second change, turning to the right side of the slide, given the lower-than-expected first quarter results, primarily at the Genma and Rima subsidiaries within GenOn, as well as additional costs associated with the ongoing restructuring process, we are reducing the GenOn midpoint of the adjustments to our midpoint EBITDA guidance used to arrive at corporate level EBITDA. The net impact of these changes on corporate credit ratios, however, is very minor, as our result in 2017 gross corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio is now 4.17 versus 4.13 in our prior quarter update. As we began last quarter, we've also shown this ratio on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, which remains under 4x.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

We, along with GenOn, remain in active dialogue with GenOn's creditors, while we continue to evaluate and pursue a broader range of possible outcomes. To that end, GenOn recently appointed a new dedicated CEO to assist in these ongoing efforts. I expect to update the market in the near-term.

So I would say right now, we are not seeing any more competition than we have historically seen and NRG's Retail engine is very strong. We have great momentum in both customer acquisition and retention, demonstrated really by our customer growth. Once again, we grew 14,000 in the quarter. Mauricio mentioned, last year in Texas alone, we grew by 87,000 customers. Every one of our competitors is looking at declines of some level and that customer growth actually mitigated the impact that we would have seen otherwise. On your question around margins, we do see some margin compression when we look at customer growth because if we decide to grow in a particular pocket, we will be willing to accept customers at lower margins if they deliver strong EBITDA. And because of our scalable platform, we're able to take on those customers and grow from there. So we do make trade-offs. I don't think that anything that's going on in the competitive dynamics is driving material compression and margin. And while we did see some compression, largely associated with weather and a little bit associated with customer mix, we're still strong in our momentum at maintaining our margins. And only when we take deliberate action to -- where we see some compression, but it's going in eyes wide open."

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
Let's start today's call with our Q1 results on Slide 3. Today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $412 million and reaffirming our full year financial guidance for 2017 of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion.
Our operational execution remained outstanding during the quarter. First and foremost, we achieved top-decile safety performance, which is a testament to our ability to focus on our most critical objectives. We also maintained our focus on our key strategic priorities: reducing costs, optimizing assets and balance sheet management. 
We announced the deactivation and mothball of 1,600 megawatts of generation, reinforcing our commitment to constantly optimize our portfolio given changing market conditions. We continue our prudent approach to growth and capital recycling with the drop-down of the Utah solar and 31% of our interest in Agua Caliente assets for $130 million in total proceeds. And today, we are announcing the offer of our remaining 25% interest in a large portfolio of wind assets from the ROFO pipeline to NRG Yield. Finally, the Business Review Committee is well on their way in its evaluation and is making good progress. All businesses are engaged and we're working diligently to provide an update to the market as soon as possible.
Turning to the right side of the page, I want to take a moment to identify and explain the key drivers for the quarter and touch upon our path to full year guidance. Kirk will provide additional details later in the presentation.
Let me start with the first quarter results. As you can see on the chart, the decrease in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year was driven almost entirely by the Generation business. The roll-off of higher price hedges that were executed after the polar vortex of 2014, lower capacity revenues in the East and a few known onetime items accounted for almost 75% of the total decrease. These items were included in our guidance as we had identified 2017 as a trough year and have guided to a lower full year result compared to 2016. The other 25% was the result of mild weather, weak renewable resources and advisory fees. 
Taking this first quarter result and our current outlook for the year, we're now trending towards the lower half of our guidance range. We expect to update our guidance once we have more clarity on the BRC and general processes.
Now shifting focus to our operational metrics on Slide 4. As you can see, the organization remained focus on our day-to-day operations despite ongoing internal initiatives and weak market conditions. I am particularly proud of our safety record as we delivered another quarter of top-decile performance. This is a testament to our strong safety culture and excellence in operations where 142 facilities out of 158 operated without a single reportable injury.
Total generation was down 9% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by lower generation in our gas and oil units and the East coal plants. This was partially offset by increases in production from our oil units in the Gulf Coast due to higher wholesale prices.
Our traditional availability metric, EAF, was up from last year following the completion of an intense 2 years of repowering and environmental compliance outages. Although EAF increased, it doesn't tell the full story of NRG's ability to capture value when economics justify, so we introduced our in-the-money-availability metric last quarter. We believe this is an improved measure of our ability to manage and balance operational performance, margin at risk and spend while in this low commodity price environment. Our results demonstrate our ability to have units available to capture value when it matters.
In our Retail business, we continued our growth. Our sales were up in both our Retail Mass and C&I segments where we acquired an additional 14,000 Retail Mass customers over the quarter, bringing us up nearly 87,000 customers year-over-year. Although margins were down slightly due to mild weather and changing customer mix, our growth in customers and customer count helped us maintain volumes.
We now turn our attention to the important summer months, and I remain confident in how we have positioned both our Generation and Retail businesses in each of their respective markets.
Turning to Slide 5, we outlined the key trends and how we have positioned our portfolio in each of our core markets. As I've described in the past, we have come a long way in diversifying our earnings, both in terms of business lines and our portfolio composition. Today, almost 3/4 of our estimated 2017 gross margin comes from sources that are not directly correlated to the price of natural gas. This diversified base of earnings drives our platform and is enhanced by the regional strategies we take in each of our markets.
So let me start with the Gulf Coast. We continued to see strong growth across the region and are encouraged by the fundamental dynamics, particularly in ERCOT. Given the energy-only market structure, an integrated platform of Generation and Retail is necessary to mitigate price volatility and deliver sustained value.
From a market perspective, given the persistent low commodity prices in ERCOT for almost 5 years, we do see a heightened risk of both new generation being delayed and accelerated retirements that could tighten the markets sooner than expected.
In the East, the market continues to be centered around capacity and providing reliability at the lowest cost. Over the years, we have pivoted our fleet to focus on reliability and benefit from capacity prices while maintaining a cheap option on energy. We continue to seek opportunities to balance our Generation portfolio with more Retail and enjoy the benefits of an integrated platform. But we will only do that at value while recognizing the limitations of the East Retail markets today.
We're also encouraged by the full implementation of the capacity performance construct in the upcoming PJM auction, which creates a natural market tightening through more stringent reliability requirements. But while we believe the market construct itself can be effective, we are concerned about the recent out-of-market payments that keep uneconomic generation from leaving the system, and I will be speaking more in this in a few minutes.
Finally, in California, regulatory policy continues to support the decarbonization of the state's economy with a focus on renewables, quick-start gas, controllable demand and increasing the energy storage. In this market, our assets are well positioned inside low pockets and have benefited from repowering opportunities.
In California, we have brought online or developed over 2 gigawatts of renewables and 2.5 gigawatts of quick-start gas over the past 5 years. This past quarter, our Carlsbad project PPA became final and nonappealable and construction started in February.
Moving on to Slide 6. The fundamentals of the ERCOT market remained strong. Load growth continues to outpace the rest of the country. On a weather-normalized basis, it has averaged over 2% over the past 12 months. And as you can see on the left-hand chart, ERCOT has achieved higher peak loads with lower temperatures over the past few years. The new forecast by ERCOT for 2017  with peak demand 2.5% higher than last year and a high demand case close to 8%, that is 5,000 megawatts higher. At the same time, we have experienced energy prices for the past 5 years with little to no scarcity premium.
This market dynamic is putting significant pressure on both new builds and retirements. As you can see on the right side of the page, there have been a number of delays or cancellation of projects as developers failed to justify new investment at current prices. For example, the 3 thermal projects slated to come online for the summer of 2018 have not yet indicated that they have begun construction and are unlikely to achieve commercial operations prior to next summer.
Now turning to retirements. ERCOT has historically understated the actual number of megawatts leaving the system, as you can see from the period between 2009 and 2016. Looking forward, we see the same anemic estimate for the retirements in their reports, assuming only 840 megawatts between 2017 and 2022. In April, we announced that Greens Bayou 5 will go into mothball status, that's 371 megawatts alone leaving the market. And we believe that there are close to 5 to 6 gigawatts of already identified generation at risk today in the market.
As we look at the future reserve margins in the high teens, we cannot help but think about the higher loads, less new builds and more retirements quickly tightening the market and creating scarcity conditions. In our view, ERCOT remains the most attractive market in terms of market fundamentals, but we need to see significantly better price signals before we can start deploying additional capital.
Now turning to the East on the Slide 7. Energy margins remained challenged given low natural gas prices and new efficient generation, but we maintain our positive outlook on capacity markets, particularly in PJM, which implements the first 100% capacity performance auction later this month. In this construct, the higher reliability requirement will create challenges for the megawatts that cleared in previous auctions as base capacity including less reliable generation and demand response. These resources will have to make a decision between taking themselves out of the market or pricing in a higher reliability premium.
While we see positive changes like the capacity performance construct in PJM and other East markets, we are concerned about the increasing activity by the states to undermine the integrity of competitive markets.
Out-of-market subsidies and contracts distort price signals needed to attract new capital investment, but often raising prices for the end users. We, and a number of other parties, have filed legal challenges to the nuclear subsidies in both New York and Illinois because we believe they're not legal and because regulators should focus on crafting competitive solutions for public policy objectives. We are encouraged by the support from PJM, its market monitor, other generators and consumer groups. You can expect NRG to continue to be a leader in these efforts to protect the world functioning of competitive markets.
So with that, I will turn it to Kirk to talk about the financial results for the quarter."

Turning to financial summary on Slide 9, NRG delivered $412 million adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter.

Turning to financial summary on Slide 9, NRG delivered $412 million adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter. Generation and Renewables delivered $95 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail and Yield time contributed $133 million and $184 million. 
As Mauricio discussed earlier, our first quarter results relative to 2016 were impacted by a combination of expected changes as well as other unexpected variances.  As shown in the chart on the bottom half of the page, approximately 75% of the quarter-over-quarter change in EBITDA was anticipated and occurred in our Generation segment. The majority of this anticipated variance was a result of the impact of lower realized energy margins including the roll-off of higher-priced hedges in 2016 combined with the onetime impact of the sale of emissions credits. The remainder of this expected change in the Generation segment was due to a combination of lower year-over-year capacity prices as well as the shift of hedge revenues from 2017 to 2016 as a result of the early monetization of hedges at GenOn. The remaining quarter-over-quarter variance was primarily due to the impact of milder weather, which affected all 4 of our major segments during the quarter.
Our Retail business was primarily impacted by lower margins resulted from a combination of milder weather and higher supply costs. While both NRG Yield and Renewables saw below-normal solar installation and wind speeds, primarily in California. The milder-than-normal weather for the quarter also impacted the Generation segment, particularly in the East. And finally, we saw additional G&A expenses due to advisory fees largely associated with the newly formed Business Review Committee we established late in the quarter.
Turning to the outlook for full year 2017. We are reaffirming our guidance ranges for the year of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $800 million to $1 billion in free cash flow before growth. However, taking into account the first quarter results and our current outlook for the balance of the year, we are currently tracking toward the lower half of these ranges.
Importantly, as Mauricio noted, this outlook does not yet reflect the impact of the BRC and GenOn processes. We anticipate having clarity on these processes and their resulting impact on guidance in the near term.
Turning to Slide 10 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. Having now closed on a drop-down of the Utah assets and the partial interest in Agua Caliente to NRG Yield during the quarter, our capital available for allocation stands at approximately $1 billion. And having now offered our remaining 25% stake in the TE Wind portfolio to NRG Yield, we are focused on completing this transaction later in the year to further augment available capital at the NRG-level.
Our planned capital allocation for the year also remains unchanged including approximately 70% allocated to debt reduction to further strengthen the balance sheet. We expect to execute on the bulk of this delevering in late 2017 as we approach the maturity date of our 2018 notes as well as more attractive pricing on callable debt.
With growth investments and shareholder dividends unchanged since our previous update, we continue to anticipate approximately $75 million of excess capital yet to be allocated and we will address the expected use of this excess later in the year.
Finally, Slide 11 provides an update on 2017 corporate credit metrics. There are 2 changes to highlight since our last update. First, during the quarter, GenOn grew $125 million under the secured intercompany credit facility with NRG. NRG, in turn, funded this via a draw on our corporate credit facility in the same amount. The draw under the intercompany GenOn revolver was a result of a drawdown on the $125 million letter of credit posted by GenOn in support of GenMa. Although this drawdown was a result of the claim of default by the owner lessors, GenMa disagrees with the default claim and the associated drawdown on the letters of credit and is in the process of pursuing its rights and remedies. Although we view this drawdown on the NRG revolving credit facility as temporary pending the resolution of this dispute, we have updated our corporate debt balance as well as the GenOn level total debt to reflect the $125 million increase.
As to the second change, turning to the right side of the slide, given the lower-than-expected first quarter results primarily at the GenMa and REMA subsidiaries within GenOn as well as additional costs associated with the ongoing restructuring process, we are reducing the GenOn midpoint of the adjustments to our midpoint EBITDA guidance used to arrive at corporate level EBITDA. The net impact of these changes on corporate credit ratios, however, is very minor as our result in 2017 gross corporate debt-to-corporate EBITDA ratio is now 4.17 versus 4.13 in our prior quarter update. As we began last quarter, we've also shown this ratio on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, which remains under 4x.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

We, along with GenOn, remain in active dialogue with GenOn's creditors while we continue to evaluate and pursue a broader range of possible outcomes. To that end, GenOn recently appointed a new dedicated CEO to assist in these ongoing efforts. I expect to update the market in the near term.
As I look into the summer and beyond, I am confident in our ability to deliver strong results across our well-diversified and integrated platform with our philosophy of continuous improvement.

So I would say right now we are not seeing any more competition than we have historically seen and NRG's retail engine is very strong. We have great momentum in both customer acquisition and retention, demonstrated really by our customer growth. Once again, we grew 14,000 in the quarter. Mauricio mentioned, last year in Texas alone, we grew by 87,000 customers. Every one of our competitors is looking at declines of some level and that customer growth actually mitigated the impact that we would have seen otherwise. On your question around margins, we do see some margin compression when we look at customer growth because if we decide to grow in a particular pocket, we will be willing to accept customers at lower margins if they deliver strong EBITDA. And because of our scalable platform, we're able to take on those customers and grow from there. So we do make trade-offs. I don't think that anything that's going on in the competitive dynamics is driving material compression in margin. And while we did see some compression largely associated with weather and a little bit associated with customer mix, we're still strong in our momentum at maintaining our margins and only when we take deliberate action to -- where we see some compression, but it's going in eyes wide open."

I mean, we're -- our business is not to keep uneconomic generation running. We have retired significant amount of generation that we felt was unprofitable and didn't have good prospects. Just last month, we retired Greens Bayou 5, 370 megawatts of capacity in Texas. And earlier in the year, we retired Pittsburg in California. So I think combination was close to 1,500 megawatts of generation. So we're not -- when we have an uneconomic plant, we will move quickly and swiftly to take it out of the market. And of course, I mean, as part of the BRC, we're running -- we're doing a holistic review of the portfolio. There are opportunities and I think we demonstrated that last year. We sold 3 plants, we monetized over $0.5 billion of asset -- of sales proceeds. I think there is an opportunity where perhaps another counterparty has a different view on commodity markets or can create a -- or looks at value differently than us and we will execute on that.

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
Let's start today's call with our Q1 results on Slide 3. Today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $412 million and reaffirming our full year financial guidance for 2017 of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion.
Our operational execution remained outstanding during the quarter. First and foremost, we achieved top-decile safety performance, which is a testament to our ability to focus on our most critical objectives. We also maintained our focus on our key strategic priorities: reducing costs, optimizing assets and balance sheet management. 
We announced the deactivation and mothball of 1,600 megawatts of generation, reinforcing our commitment to constantly optimize our portfolio given changing market conditions. We continue our prudent approach to growth and capital recycling with the drop-down of the Utah solar and 31% of our interest in Agua Caliente assets for $130 million in total proceeds. And today, we are announcing the offer of our remaining 25% interest in a large portfolio of wind assets from the ROFO pipeline to NRG Yield. Finally, the Business Review Committee is well on their way in its evaluation and is making good progress. All businesses are engaged and we're working diligently to provide an update to the market as soon as possible.
Turning to the right side of the page, I want to take a moment to identify and explain the key drivers for the quarter and touch upon our path to full year guidance. Kirk will provide additional details later in the presentation.
Let me start with the first quarter results. As you can see on the chart, the decrease in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year was driven almost entirely by the Generation business. The roll-off of higher price hedges that were executed after the polar vortex of 2014, lower capacity revenues in the East and a few known onetime items accounted for almost 75% of the total decrease. These items were included in our guidance as we had identified 2017 as a trough year and have guided to a lower full year result compared to 2016. The other 25% was the result of mild weather, weak renewable resources and advisory fees. 
Taking this first quarter result and our current outlook for the year, we're now trending towards the lower half of our guidance range. We expect to update our guidance once we have more clarity on the BRC and general processes.
Now shifting focus to our operational metrics on Slide 4. As you can see, the organization remained focus on our day-to-day operations despite ongoing internal initiatives and weak market conditions. I am particularly proud of our safety record as we delivered another quarter of top-decile performance. This is a testament to our strong safety culture and excellence in operations where 142 facilities out of 158 operated without a single reportable injury.
Total generation was down 9% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by lower generation in our gas and oil units and the East coal plants. This was partially offset by increases in production from our oil units in the Gulf Coast due to higher wholesale prices.
Our traditional availability metric, EAF, was up from last year following the completion of an intense 2 years of repowering and environmental compliance outages. Although EAF increased, it doesn't tell the full story of NRG's ability to capture value when economics justify, so we introduced our in-the-money-availability metric last quarter. We believe this is an improved measure of our ability to manage and balance operational performance, margin at risk and spend while in this low commodity price environment. Our results demonstrate our ability to have units available to capture value when it matters.
In our Retail business, we continued our growth. Our sales were up in both our Retail Mass and C&I segments where we acquired an additional 14,000 Retail Mass customers over the quarter, bringing us up nearly 87,000 customers year-over-year. Although margins were down slightly due to mild weather and changing customer mix, our growth in customers and customer count helped us maintain volumes.
We now turn our attention to the important summer months, and I remain confident in how we have positioned both our Generation and Retail businesses in each of their respective markets.
Turning to Slide 5, we outlined the key trends and how we have positioned our portfolio in each of our core markets. As I've described in the past, we have come a long way in diversifying our earnings, both in terms of business lines and our portfolio composition. Today, almost 3/4 of our estimated 2017 gross margin comes from sources that are not directly correlated to the price of natural gas. This diversified base of earnings drives our platform and is enhanced by the regional strategies we take in each of our markets.
So let me start with the Gulf Coast. We continued to see strong growth across the region and are encouraged by the fundamental dynamics, particularly in ERCOT. Given the energy-only market structure, an integrated platform of Generation and Retail is necessary to mitigate price volatility and deliver sustained value.
From a market perspective, given the persistent low commodity prices in ERCOT for almost 5 years, we do see a heightened risk of both new generation being delayed and accelerated retirements that could tighten the markets sooner than expected.
In the East, the market continues to be centered around capacity and providing reliability at the lowest cost. Over the years, we have pivoted our fleet to focus on reliability and benefit from capacity prices while maintaining a cheap option on energy. We continue to seek opportunities to balance our Generation portfolio with more Retail and enjoy the benefits of an integrated platform. But we will only do that at value while recognizing the limitations of the East Retail markets today.
We're also encouraged by the full implementation of the capacity performance construct in the upcoming PJM auction, which creates a natural market tightening through more stringent reliability requirements. But while we believe the market construct itself can be effective, we are concerned about the recent out-of-market payments that keep uneconomic generation from leaving the system, and I will be speaking more in this in a few minutes.
Finally, in California, regulatory policy continues to support the decarbonization of the state's economy with a focus on renewables, quick-start gas, controllable demand and increasing the energy storage. In this market, our assets are well positioned inside low pockets and have benefited from repowering opportunities.
In California, we have brought online or developed over 2 gigawatts of renewables and 2.5 gigawatts of quick-start gas over the past 5 years. This past quarter, our Carlsbad project PPA became final and nonappealable and construction started in February.
Moving on to Slide 6. The fundamentals of the ERCOT market remained strong. Load growth continues to outpace the rest of the country. On a weather-normalized basis, it has averaged over 2% over the past 12 months. And as you can see on the left-hand chart, ERCOT has achieved higher peak loads with lower temperatures over the past few years. The new forecast by ERCOT for 2017 with peak demand 2.5% higher than last year and a high demand case close to 8%, that is 5,000 megawatts higher. At the same time, we have experienced energy prices for the past 5 years with little to no scarcity premium.
This market dynamic is putting significant pressure on both new builds and retirements. As you can see on the right side of the page, there have been a number of delays or cancellation of projects as developers failed to justify new investment at current prices. For example, the 3 thermal projects slated to come online for the summer of 2018 have not yet indicated that they have begun construction and are unlikely to achieve commercial operations prior to next summer.
Now turning to retirements. ERCOT has historically understated the actual number of megawatts leaving the system, as you can see from the period between 2009 and 2016. Looking forward, we see the same anemic estimate for the retirements in their reports, assuming only 840 megawatts between 2017 and 2022. In April, we announced that Greens Bayou 5 will go into mothball status, that's 371 megawatts alone leaving the market. And we believe that there are close to 5 to 6 gigawatts of already identified generation at risk today in the market.
As we look at the future reserve margins in the high teens, we cannot help but think about the higher loads, less new builds and more retirements quickly tightening the market and creating scarcity conditions. In our view, ERCOT remains the most attractive market in terms of market fundamentals, but we need to see significantly better price signals before we can start deploying additional capital.
Now turning to the East on the Slide 7. Energy margins remained challenged given low natural gas prices and new efficient generation, but we maintain our positive outlook on capacity markets, particularly in PJM, which implements the first 100% capacity performance auction later this month. In this construct, the higher reliability requirement will create challenges for the megawatts that cleared in previous auctions as base capacity including less reliable generation and demand response. These resources will have to make a decision between taking themselves out of the market or pricing in a higher reliability premium.
While we see positive changes like the capacity performance construct in PJM and other East markets, we are concerned about the increasing activity by the states to undermine the integrity of competitive markets.
Out-of-market subsidies and contracts distort price signals needed to attract new capital investment, but often raising prices for the end users. We, and a number of other parties, have filed legal challenges to the nuclear subsidies in both New York and Illinois because we believe they're not legal and because regulators should focus on crafting competitive solutions for public policy objectives. We are encouraged by the support from PJM, its market monitor, other generators and consumer groups. You can expect NRG to continue to be a leader in these efforts to protect the world functioning of competitive markets.
So with that, I will turn it to Kirk to talk about the financial results for the quarter."

Turning to financial summary on Slide 9, NRG delivered $412 million adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter. Generation and Renewables delivered $95 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail",843,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to financial summary on Slide 9, NRG delivered $412 million adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter. Generation and Renewables delivered $95 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail and Yield contributed $133 million and $184 million. 
As Mauricio discussed earlier, our first quarter results relative to 2016 were impacted by a combination of expected changes as well as other unexpected variances.  As shown in the chart on the bottom half of the page, approximately 75% of the quarter-over-quarter change in EBITDA was anticipated and occurred in our Generation segment. The majority of this anticipated variance was a result of the impact of lower realized energy margins including the roll-off of higher-priced hedges in 2016 combined with the onetime impact of the sale of emissions credits. The remainder of this expected change in the Generation segment was due to a combination of lower year-over-year capacity prices as well as the shift of hedge revenues from 2017 to 2016 as a result of the early monetization of hedges at GenOn. The remaining quarter-over-quarter variance was primarily due to the impact of milder weather, which affected all 4 of our major segments during the quarter.
Our Retail business was primarily impacted by lower margins resulted from a combination of milder weather and higher supply costs. While both NRG Yield and Renewables saw below-normal solar installation and wind speeds, primarily in California. The milder-than-normal weather for the quarter also impacted the Generation segment, particularly in the East. And finally, we saw additional G&A expenses due to advisory fees largely associated with the newly formed Business Review Committee we established late in the quarter.
Turning to the outlook for full year 2017. We are reaffirming our guidance ranges for the year of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $800 million to $1 billion in free cash flow before growth. However, taking into account the first quarter results and our current outlook for the balance of the year, we are currently tracking toward the lower half of these ranges.
Importantly, as Mauricio noted, this outlook does not yet reflect the impact of the BRC and GenOn processes. We anticipate having clarity on these processes and their resulting impact on guidance in the near term.
Turning to Slide 10 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. Having now closed on a drop-down of the Utah assets and the partial interest in Agua Caliente to NRG Yield during the quarter, our capital goal for allocation stands at approximately $1 billion. And having now offered our remaining 25% stake in the TE Wind portfolio to NRG Yield, we are focused on completing this transaction later in the year to further augment available capital at the NRG-level.
Our planned capital allocation for the year also remains unchanged including approximately 70% allocated to debt reduction to further strengthen the balance sheet. We expect to execute on the bulk of this delevering in late 2017 as we approach the maturity date of our 2018 notes as well as more attractive pricing on callable debt.
With growth investments and shareholder dividends unchanged since our previous update, we continue to anticipate approximately $75 million of excess capital yet to be allocated and we will address the expected use of this excess later in the year.
Finally, Slide 11 provides an update on 2017 corporate credit metrics. There are 2 changes to highlight since our last update. First, during the quarter, GenOn grew $125 million under the secured intercompany credit facility with NRG. NRG, in turn, funded this via a draw on our corporate credit facility in the same amount. The draw under the intercompany GenOn revolver was a result of a drawdown on the $125 million letter of credit posted by GenOn in support of GenMa. Although this drawdown was a result of the claim of default by the owner lessors, GenMa disagrees with the default claim and the associated drawdown on the letters of credit and is in the process of pursuing its rights and remedies. Although we view this drawdown on the NRG revolving credit facility as temporary pending the resolution of this dispute, we have updated our corporate debt balance as well as the GenOn level total debt to reflect the $125 million increase.
As to the second change, turning to the right side of the slide, given the lower-than-expected first quarter results primarily at the GenMa and REMA subsidiaries within GenOn as well as additional costs associated with the ongoing restructuring process, we are reducing the GenOn midpoint of the adjustments to our midpoint EBITDA guidance used to arrive at corporate level EBITDA. The net impact of these changes on corporate credit ratios, however, is very minor as our result in 2017 gross corporate debt-to-corporate EBITDA ratio is now 4.17 versus 4.13 in our prior quarter update. As we began last quarter, we've also shown this ratio on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, which remains under 4x.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

So I would say right now we are not seeing any more competition than we have historically seen and NRG's retail engine is very strong. We have great momentum in both customer acquisition and retention, demonstrated really by our customer growth. Once again, we grew 14,000 in the quarter. Mauricio mentioned, last year in Texas alone, we grew by 87,000 customers. Every one of our competitors is looking at declines of some level and that customer growth actually mitigated the impact that we would have seen otherwise. On your question around margins, we do see some margin compression when we look at customer growth because if we decide to grow in a particular pocket, we will be willing to accept customers at lower margins if they deliver strong EBITDA. And because of our scalable platform, we're able to take on those customers and grow from there. So we do make trade-offs. I don't think that anything that's going on in the competitive dynamics is driving material compression in margin. And while we did see some compression largely associated with weather and a little bit associated with customer mix, we're still strong in our momentum at maintaining our margins and only when we take deliberate action to -- where we see some compression, but it's going in eyes wide open."

So if you remember, after the polar vortex, all the winter strips repriced right after that. The '16 and '17 winter strip completely -- or the '15 and '16 repriced. And most of that, the uptick that we saw post polar vortex, were exactly in the winter months. So that's why the largest impact was in this quarter. I think as you progress in the year, that's going to subside. And the other thing that I will say is we've always identified 2017 as a trough year. So I think as you move in the outer years, at current market prices, I think it's fair to assume that the outlook for commodity prices improved."

Just last month, we retired Greens Bayou 5, 370 megawatts of capacity in Texas. And earlier in the year, we retired Pittsburg in California. So I think combination was close to 1,500 megawatts of generation. So we're not -- when we have an uneconomic plant, we will move quickly and swiftly to take it out of the market. And of course, I mean, as part of the BRC, we're running -- we're doing a holistic review of the portfolio. There are opportunities and I think we demonstrated that last year. We sold 3 plants, we monetized over $0.5 billion of asset -- of sales proceeds. I think there is an opportunity where perhaps another counterparty has a different view on commodity markets or can create a -- or looks at value differently than us and we will execute on that.

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
Let's start today's call with our Q1 results on Slide 3. Today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $412 million and reaffirming our full year financial guidance for 2017 of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion.
Our operational execution remained outstanding during the quarter. First and foremost, we achieved top-decile safety performance, which is a testament to our ability to focus on our most critical objectives. We also maintained our focus on our key strategic priorities: reducing costs, optimizing assets and balance sheet management. 
We announced the deactivation and mothball of 1,600 megawatts of generation, reinforcing our commitment to constantly optimize our portfolio given changing market conditions. We continue our prudent approach to growth and capital recycling with the drop-down of the Utah solar and 31% of our interest in Agua Caliente assets for $130 million in total proceeds. And today, we are announcing the offer of our remaining 25% interest in a large portfolio of wind assets from the ROFO pipeline to NRG Yield. Finally, the Business Review Committee is well on their way in its evaluation and is making good progress. All businesses are engaged and we're working diligently to provide an update to the market as soon as possible.
Turning to the right side of the page, I want to take a moment to identify and explain the key drivers for the quarter and touch upon our path to full year guidance. Kirk will provide additional details later in the presentation.
Let me start with the first quarter results. As you can see on the chart, the decrease in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year was driven almost entirely by the Generation business. The roll-off of higher price hedges that were executed after the polar vortex of 2014, lower capacity revenues in the East and a few known onetime items accounted for almost 75% of the total decrease. These items were included in our guidance as we had identified 2017 as a trough year and have guided to a lower full year result compared to 2016. The other 25% was the result of mild weather, weak renewable resources and advisory fees. 
Taking this first quarter result and our current outlook for the year, we're now trending towards the lower half of our guidance range. We expect to update our guidance once we have more clarity on the BRC and general processes.
Now shifting focus to our operational metrics on Slide 4. As you can see, the organization remained focus on our day-to-day operations despite ongoing internal initiatives and weak market conditions. I am particularly proud of our safety record as we delivered another quarter of top-decile performance. This is a testament to our strong safety culture and excellence in operations where 142 facilities out of 158 operated without a single reportable injury.
Total generation was down 9% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by lower generation in our gas and oil units and the East coal plants. This was partially offset by increases in production from our oil units in the Gulf Coast due to higher wholesale prices.
Our traditional availability metric, EAF, was up from last year following the completion of an intense 2 years of repowering and environmental compliance outages. Although EAF increased, it doesn't tell the full story of NRG's ability to capture value when economics justify, so we introduced our in-the-money-availability metric last quarter. We believe this is an improved measure of our ability to manage and balance operational performance, margin at risk and spend while in this low commodity price environment. Our results demonstrate our ability to have units available to capture value when it matters.
In our Retail business, we continued our growth. Our sales were up in both our Retail Mass and C&I segments where we acquired an additional 14,000 Retail Mass customers over the quarter, bringing us up nearly 87,000 customers year-over-year. Although margins were down slightly due to mild weather and changing customer mix, our growth in customers and customer count helped us maintain volumes.
We now turn our attention to the important summer months, and I remain confident in how we have positioned both our Generation and Retail businesses in each of their respective markets.
Turning to Slide 5, we outlined the key trends and how we have positioned our portfolio in each of our core markets. As I've described in the past, we have come a long way in diversifying our earnings, both in terms of business lines and our portfolio composition. Today, almost 3/4 of our estimated 2017 gross margin comes from sources that are not directly correlated to the price of natural gas. This diversified base of earnings drives our platform and is enhanced by the regional strategies we take in each of our markets.
So let me start with the Gulf Coast. We continued to see strong growth across the region and are encouraged by the fundamental dynamics, particularly in ERCOT. Given the energy-only market structure, an integrated platform of Generation and Retail is necessary to mitigate price volatility and deliver sustained value.
From a market perspective, given the persistent low commodity prices in ERCOT for almost 5 years, we do see a heightened risk of both new generation being delayed and accelerated retirements that could tighten the markets sooner than expected.
In the East, the market continues to be centered around capacity and providing reliability at the lowest cost. Over the years, we have pivoted our fleet to focus on reliability and benefit from capacity prices while maintaining a cheap option on energy. We continue to seek opportunities to balance our Generation portfolio with more Retail and enjoy the benefits of an integrated platform. But we will only do that at value while recognizing the limitations of the East Retail markets today.
We're also encouraged by the full implementation of the capacity performance construct in the upcoming PJM auction, which creates a natural market tightening through more stringent reliability requirements. But while we believe the market construct itself can be effective, we are concerned about the recent out-of-market payments that keep uneconomic generation from leaving the system, and I will be speaking more in this in a few minutes.
Finally, in California, regulatory policy continues to support the decarbonization of the state's economy with a focus on renewables, quick-start gas, controllable demand and increasing the energy storage. In this market, our assets are well positioned inside low pockets and have benefited from repowering opportunities.
In California, we have brought online or developed over 2 gigawatts of renewables and 2.5 gigawatts of quick-start gas over the past 5 years. This past quarter, our Carlsbad project PPA became final and nonappealable and construction started in February.
Moving on to Slide 6. The fundamentals of the ERCOT market remained strong. Load growth continues to outpace the rest of the country. On a weather-normalized basis, it has averaged over 2% over the past 12 months. And as you can see on the left-hand chart, ERCOT has achieved higher peak loads with lower temperatures over the past few years. The new forecast by ERCOT for 2017 with peak demand 2.5% higher than last year and a high demand case close to 8%, that is 5,000 megawatts higher. At the same time, we have experienced energy prices for the past 5 years with little to no scarcity premium.
This market dynamic is putting significant pressure on both new builds and retirements. As you can see on the right side of the page, there have been a number of delays or cancellation of projects as developers failed to justify new investment at current prices. For example, the 3 thermal projects slated to come online for the summer of 2018 have not yet indicated that they have begun construction and are unlikely to achieve commercial operations prior to next summer.
Now turning to retirements. ERCOT has historically understated the actual number of megawatts leaving the system, as you can see from the period between 2009 and 2016. Looking forward, we see the same anemic estimate for the retirements in their reports, assuming only 840 megawatts between 2017 and 2022. In April, we announced that Greens Bayou 5 will go into mothball status, that's 371 megawatts alone leaving the market. And we believe that there are close to 5 to 6 gigawatts of already identified generation at risk today in the market.
As we look at the future reserve margins in the high teens, we cannot help but think about the higher loads, less new builds and more retirements quickly tightening the market and creating scarcity conditions. In our view, ERCOT remains the most attractive market in terms of market fundamentals, but we need to see significantly better price signals before we can start deploying additional capital.
Now turning to the East on the Slide 7. Energy margins remained challenged given low natural gas prices and new efficient generation, but we maintain our positive outlook on capacity markets, particularly in PJM, which implements the first 100% capacity performance auction later this month. In this construct, the higher reliability requirement will create challenges for the megawatts that cleared in previous auctions as base capacity including less reliable generation and demand response. These resources will have to make a decision between taking themselves out of the market or pricing in a higher reliability premium.
While we see positive changes like the capacity performance construct in PJM and other East markets, we are concerned about the increasing activity by the states to undermine the integrity of competitive markets.
Out-of-market subsidies and contracts distort price signals needed to attract new capital investment, but often raising prices for the end users. We, and a number of other parties, have filed legal challenges to the nuclear subsidies in both New York and Illinois because we believe they're not legal and because regulators should focus on crafting competitive solutions for public policy objectives. We are encouraged by the support from PJM, its market monitor, other generators and consumer groups. You can expect NRG to continue to be a leader in these efforts to protect the world functioning of competitive markets.
So with that, I will turn it to Kirk to talk about the financial results for the quarter."

Turning to financial summary on Slide 9, NRG delivered $412 million adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter.

Turning to financial summary on Slide 9, NRG delivered $412 million adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter. Generation and Renewables delivered $95 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail and Yield contributed $133 million and $184 million. 
As Mauricio discussed earlier, our first quarter results relative to 2016 were impacted by a combination of expected changes as well as other unexpected variances.  As shown in the chart on the bottom half of the page, approximately 75% of the quarter-over-quarter change in EBITDA was anticipated and occurred in our Generation segment. The majority of this anticipated variance was a result of the impact of lower realized energy margins including the roll-off of higher-priced hedges in 2016 combined with the onetime impact of the sale of emissions credits. The remainder of this expected change in the Generation segment was due to a combination of lower year-over-year capacity prices as well as the shift of hedge revenues from 2017 to 2016 as a result of the early monetization of hedges at GenOn. The remaining quarter-over-quarter variance was primarily due to the impact of milder weather, which affected all 4 of our major segments during the quarter.
Our Retail business was primarily impacted by lower margins resulted from a combination of milder weather and higher supply costs. While both NRG Yield and Renewables saw below-normal solar installation and wind speeds, primarily in California. The milder-than-normal weather for the quarter also impacted the Generation segment, particularly in the East. And finally, we saw additional G&A expenses due to advisory fees largely associated with the newly formed Business Review Committee we established late in the quarter.
Turning to the outlook for full year 2017. We are reaffirming our guidance ranges for the year of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $800 million to $1 billion in free cash flow before growth. However, taking into account the first quarter results and our current outlook for the balance of the year, we are currently tracking toward the lower half of these ranges.
Importantly, as Mauricio noted, this outlook does not yet reflect the impact of the BRC and GenOn processes. We anticipate having clarity on these processes and their resulting impact on guidance in the near term.
Turning to Slide 10 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. Having now closed on a drop-down of the Utah assets and the partial interest in Agua Caliente to NRG Yield during the quarter, our capital goal for allocation stands at approximately $1 billion. And having now offered our remaining 25% stake in the TE Wind portfolio to NRG Yield, we are focused on completing this transaction later in the year to further augment available capital at the NRG-level.
Our planned capital allocation for the year also remains unchanged including approximately 70% allocated to debt reduction to further strengthen the balance sheet. We expect to execute on the bulk of this delevering in late 2017 as we approach the maturity date of our 2018 notes as well as more attractive pricing on callable debt.
With growth investments and shareholder dividends unchanged since our previous update, we continue to anticipate approximately $75 million of excess capital yet to be allocated and we will address the expected use of this excess later in the year.
Finally, Slide 11 provides an update on 2017 corporate credit metrics. There are 2 changes to highlight since our last update. First, during the quarter, GenOn grew $125 million under the secured intercompany credit facility with NRG. NRG, in turn, funded this via a draw on our corporate credit facility in the same amount. The draw under the intercompany GenOn revolver was a result of a drawdown on the $125 million letter of credit posted by GenOn in support of GenMa. Although this drawdown was a result of the claim of default by the owner lessors, GenMa disagrees with the default claim and the associated drawdown on the letters of credit and is in the process of pursuing its rights and remedies. Although we view this drawdown on the NRG revolving credit facility as temporary pending the resolution of this dispute, we have updated our corporate debt balance as well as the GenOn level total debt to reflect the $125 million increase.
As to the second change, turning to the right side of the slide, given the lower-than-expected first quarter results primarily at the GenMa and REMA subsidiaries within GenOn as well as additional costs associated with the ongoing restructuring process, we are reducing the GenOn midpoint of the adjustments to our midpoint EBITDA guidance used to arrive at corporate level EBITDA. The net impact of these changes on corporate credit ratios, however, is very minor as our result in 2017 gross corporate debt-to-corporate EBITDA ratio is now 4.17 versus 4.13 in our prior quarter update. As we began last quarter, we've also shown this ratio on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, which remains under 4x.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

So I would say right now we are not seeing any more competition than we have historically seen and NRG's retail engine is very strong. We have great momentum in both customer acquisition and retention, demonstrated really by our customer growth. Once again, we grew 14,000 in the quarter. Mauricio mentioned, last year in Texas alone, we grew by 87,000 customers. Every one of our competitors is looking at declines of some level and that customer growth actually mitigated the impact that we would have seen otherwise. On your question around margins, we do see some margin compression when we look at customer growth because if we decide to grow in a particular pocket, we will be willing to accept customers at lower margins if they deliver strong EBITDA. And because of our scalable platform, we're able to take on those customers and grow from there. So we do make trade-offs. I don't think that anything that's going on in the competitive dynamics is driving material compression in margin. And while we did see some compression largely associated with weather and a little bit associated with customer mix, we're still strong in our momentum at maintaining our margins and only when we take deliberate action to -- where we see some compression, but it's going in eyes wide open."

I mean, we're -- our business is not to keep uneconomic generation running. We have retired significant amount of generation that we felt was unprofitable and didn't have good prospects. Just last month, we retired Greens Bayou 5, 370 megawatts of capacity in Texas. And earlier in the year, we retired Pittsburg in California. So I think combination was close to 1,500 megawatts of generation. So we're not -- when we have an uneconomic plant, we will move quickly and swiftly to take it out of the market. And of course, I mean, as part of the BRC, we're running -- we're doing a holistic review of the portfolio. There are opportunities and I think we demonstrated that last year. We sold 3 plants, we monetized over $0.5 billion of asset -- of sales proceeds. I think there is an opportunity where perhaps another counterparty has a different view on commodity markets or can create a -- or looks at value differently than us and we will execute on that. But as I said, I mean, I think as part of a -- with that respect, I don't want to front-run the BRC process. When it comes to asset divestitures, I think we need to let that play out. We are having good -- very constructive conversations inside the BRC, and as I said before, I mean, we're moving as fast as we can because I am the first one who wants to communicate this to the market. So you have my commitment that as soon as we have something to communicate, we will tell you.
Great. Thank you, Steve, and thank you all for your interest at NRG. Thank you, and good morning."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business.
Just a few weeks ago, we announced our comprehensive and multidimensional transformation plan. Since then, we've had the opportunity to speak with many of you in great detail about our plan, which will better position us as the leader in the competitive power space. We are actively engaged on all fronts, and I look forward to updating you on our hard work in progress in the next quarter. 
But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results. Also, you will note that all the financial and operational results discussed today do not include GenOn due to its bankruptcy filing.
Starting on Slide 4 with the summary and highlights for the quarter. Today, we're reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $685 million, in line with our second quarter results from last year and $240 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. We are also reaffirming our full year financial guidance for 2017 for both EBITDA and free cash flow.
Our integrated platform performed quite well during the quarter. Both Generation and Retail financial results were slightly lower given the mild weather experienced in the quarter and lower hedge prices. This was offset by strong results from Renewables, NRG Yield and the change in our Home Solar business model announced earlier in the year. We also remained focused on execution and made significant progress on our key priorities.
First, we continue to execute on our capital recycling program with NRG Yield. We completed 1 drop down and made 2 separate offerings that will further strengthen the partnership. We believe this transaction highlight the Renewable platform's ability to enhance Yield's growth going forward, with opportunities both inside and outside of the current ROFO agreement.
Second, we announced our Transformation Plan, which laid out a much clearer path to value for investors and will significantly strengthen and simplify our business so that it will thrive in any market cycles.
And finally, we've made substantial progress towards resolving GenOn. We continue to work diligently with GenOn and its stakeholders through the bankruptcy process and can report that GenOn currently remains on track to emerge from bankruptcy by the year-end.
As you can see, it has been a busy several months, and I am extremely proud of all the hard work and focus that has gone into making this a strong quarter for our business.
Turning to our key operational metrics on Slide 5, I am very pleased with our safety performance for the quarter. We are just shy of top-decile performance with 108 out of 129 facilities operating without a single recordable injury. We actually had fewer injuries year-over-year and while these numbers are good, we will never be satisfied. The safety of our people is our #1 priority, and we will continue to focus our resources on improving our safety record over the balance of the year and beyond.
Performance was strong for our Generation fleet. Total megawatts produced were 6% higher compared to the last period last year. This increase was driven largely by the return to service of our South Central combined cycle plant following a significant flooding event in the first quarter of 2016 as well as higher coal generation. 
The availability of our Generation fleet also increased during the quarter as we have fewer repowering and environmental compliance outages. More importantly, our fleet was available almost 94% of the time as you can see by our in-the-money-availability metric.
Our Retail business delivered a steady quarter, driven by strong customer acquisition and retention, as well as reductions in operating costs. Both sales and customer count increased, helping to offset milder-than-normal weather.
Now moving to our key market on Slide 6. Starting on the left side of the page with the ERCOT market. The fundamentals in this market are strong, and we continue to see trends that point to market tightening over the next several years. Weather normalized demand growth in ERCOT has averaged 2.3% over the last 3 months, which is well above the flat to negative growth of every other competitive market in the country. This steady demand has been driven by strong increases in population and employment as well as new coastal demand from the industrial sectors.
On the supply side, we continue to see delays in new builds with optional megawatts brought online coming in well below expectations. Since the latest CVR report from May, we have seen 1 gigawatt of new generation being delayed from 2018 to later years, and a new 700 megawatt combined cycle removed from the CDR. At the same time, we're seeing continued pressure for retirement given the low prices experienced in Texas over the past several years.
These market dynamics have become evident in the reserve margin calculation that indicate the tightness of market supply versus peak demand. As you can see on the chart, just in the last 18 months, reserve margins for 2018 went from the mid-20s to the high teens. And it does not take too much in terms of additional retirements, load growth or delays to get the single-digit numbers. For these reasons, ERCOT remains the most attractive market in our opinion.
However, there are changes that need to be made to strengthen the market, including marginal losses, improved location of scarcity pricing and enhance performance of the ORDC. We will continue our work with ERCOT, the PUCT and other stakeholders to improve price formation and ensure the well functioning of ERCOT's energy-only market.
Turning to the right side of our slide, I want to highlight the premium location of our generational fleet. In Texas, we have seen price separation between Houston and other areas. This is driven primarily by strong load growth in the area and transmission congestion. The Houston load pocket is where most of our generation is located and given the drivers I mentioned, we would expect this premium to continue in the future.
Turning to PJM. During the quarter, we had the 2021 BRA capacity auction, which was the first with 100% capacity performance requirement. As you can see on the chart, over 85% of our capacity in PJM clear in the comment premium zone at almost $190 per megawatt day. 
These are 2 clear examples of our plants having a competitive advantage given their location near low pockets, benefiting from premium prices.
Before handing things over to Kirk on the topic of markets, I want to take a moment to reiterate NRG's strong support and advocacy of competitive markets for both retail and wholesale. We are disappointed with the rulings in New York and Illinois regarding subsidies for nuclear generation, however, there are strong grounds for appeal in these cases. 
We will continue to be a vocal advocate for competitive markets and expect both the courts and the new FERC commissioners to take a fresh look at this issue. We remain optimistic that these subsidies will be found to be damaging to both the market and to consumers as these cases progress through the court system.
I will now turn to Kirk for our financial review."

For the second quarter, NRG delivered $685 million in adjusted EBITDA and $240 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. 
Total adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was relatively in line with the second quarter of 2016, and Generation and Renewables contributed $212 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, while Retail and Yield delivered $203 million and $270 million, respectively. 
As a reminder and as I review during our transformation plan presentation a couple of weeks ago, our consolidated financial results as well as our guidance now reflects the deconsolidation of GenOn.
Turning to guidance for our 2017, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance ranges, which are provided and updated as part of a Transformation Plan rollout to reflect adjustments related to the deconsolidation of GenOn as well as the impact of $65 million in 2017 cost savings and $175 million in onetime working capital improvements from the plan. 
For your reference, I've included in the appendix the slide from our transformation plan presentation, which details these 2 adjustments to 2017 guidance. 
As a reminder, however, as I also indicated on the transformation plan call, our expectations for the balance of the year continue to place us at the lower end of the guidance range.
On August 1, we closed the sale to NRG Yield of our remaining 25% interest in the TE Wind portfolio consisting of 12 wind projects for total cash consideration of $41 million. In addition, we have now offered Yield a 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility-scale solar assets, which are not part of the ROFO agreement. And we have proposed the creation of a new $50 million distributed generation partnership. These potential drop downs are subject to negotiations with and the approval by NRG Yield's independent directors.
Finally, during the quarter, we successfully closed on a number of nonrecourse project financings resulting in approximately $500 million in cash proceeds, including over $350 million of debt proceeds for the construction of our Carlsbad contract gas plant in California. 
NRG has now repaid the $125 million outstanding balance under our corporate revolver, leaving this facility now undrawn. As a reminder, we have made that draw earlier in the year to fund the corresponding drawdown by GenOn under the intercompany revolver. 
Although that intercompany balance remains outstanding, GenOn is required to repay the balance upon emergence from bankruptcy. And in anticipation of that event, we repaid the NRG revolver this past quarter using excess cash-on-hand, which we expect will be replenished upon GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy and the corresponding repayment of the intercompany revolver.
Turning to Slide 9 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. Our updated capital allocation now reflects the proceeds received from the closing of the TE wind drop down, further increasing expected surplus capital at year-end to $170 million. As we reviewed with you on July 12, we expect to significantly build on this balance during the first half of 2018 using proceeds from asset sales, which assuming a sale of 100% of NRG Yield and Renewables would help drive anticipated excess cash to just over $4 billion by the end of 2018.
To complete the financial review, Slide 10 provides an update on our corporate credit metrics. Having previously provided a pro forma view for these ratios based on the full impact of the transformation plan, this page focuses on our expected credit ratio for 2017 with the denominator that based on the midpoint of our guidance for the year. Our expected year-end gross debt balance of $7.2 billion continues to reflect the expected deployment of $600 million in 2017 capital previously allocated to our debt reduction, which we expect to execute later this year. 
Our corporate credit ratios are largely unchanged since our first quarter update, and we continue to expect to achieve a net corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.7x.
As we review, as a part of the transformation plan, we expect to be able to achieve our target 3x ratio by 2018 based on the EBITDA benefits of the cost savings and margin improvements. 
Additional deleveraging in 2018 will be necessarily solely as a result of a reduction in EBITDA associated with assets targeted for sale. We intend to fund this additional debt reduction with the proceeds from asset sales and based on 100% of NRG Yield and Renewables, we'd expect incremental debt reduction to be approximately $650 million in order to maintain our target ratio.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

I recognize that there are some improvements that we need to make to the market, both in terms of recognizing the attributes that each power plant brings to the system and to recognize also the impact of new technologies. But where we disagree is to have an out-of-market subsidy for 1 specific company in a technology that is now proven and mature that in our view, at the expense of consumers and the integrity of competitive markets. I mean that's the -- that's really the concern. So we think that we have a strong case and with new FERC commissioners coming in, I think there will be a fresh look, a fresh perspective on the validity of our case and the potential impact that this out-of-market subsidies can have in the competitive markets. And we feel confident that this will prevail. Obviously, I can't comment anymore because this is a ongoing legal proceeding. I mean in terms of our nuclear plants, South Texas project in Texas and that's true for any other plant in the Generation -- in our Generation portfolio. We are constantly evaluating the financial health of our facilities, not only in the near term but in the long term. What are the prospects? What is their profitability today and tomorrow? And I will tell you because I think we have a pretty good track record for that, to extent the facilities are not operating, are not cash flow positive. We've taken steps to either improve their competitiveness or to retire them if we don't see any better prospects to that. So I think we will -- in the case of SVP, in particular, I mean this is something that we, obviously, work closely with our partners. This is not just an NRG decision only.

So I'm very comfortable in Texas. In the Northeast, given the resolution of GenOn and some of the asset -- conventional assets that we're going to have, post a transformation plan, we will have an opportunity to rebalance the portfolio. And while we're going to be little longer generation, keep in mind that, that generation is within the low pocket of the Chicago area, New York City or Southwest Connecticut. And that these assets benefit significantly from capacity prices that have been very robust and continue to be robust as far as 2020, 2021. So we have a 5-year runway where it gives me a lot of comfort in terms of the balancing of our portfolio and obviously, we evaluate the composition of our integrated platform every time, and we see if the asset mix that we have is the right mix to manage our load.

And particularly in Retail, we knew that there is a -- in terms of the scale and scope of our Retail operation, they are very few people we can actually compare ourselves to. So we went a little outside of the power space and we went to the Retail space, in the entire Retail space in other industries to see what are the best practices. And we identified 2 areas where we can actually improve our Retail business, which we are very proud of, and I think everybody recognizes our leading position in the space. And that was building off our IT infrastructure and analytics. And I think everybody recognizes the amount of information that we have from our customers, and so there is an opportunity here to really take our Retail business to the next level, adopting some of the best practices from other industries. I think the midpoint that you were talking about, how we should think about it. For 2017, our midpoint was around $750 million, give or take. So what I -- the way I characterize this effort is the last 3 years, we grew our business roughly by $200 million.

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, head of our Retail business.
Just a few weeks ago, we announced our comprehensive and multidimensional Transformation Plan. Since then, we've had the opportunity to speak with many of you in great detail about our plan, which will better position us as the leader in the competitive power space. We are actively engaged on all fronts, and I look forward to updating you on our hard work and progress in the next quarter. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results.
Also, you will note that all the financial and operational results discussed today do not include GenOn due to its bankruptcy filing.
Starting on Slide 4 with the summary and highlights for the quarter. Today, we're reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $685 million, in line with our second quarter results from last year and $240 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. We are also reaffirming our full year financial guidance for 2017 for both EBITDA and free cash flow.
Our integrated platform performed quite well during the quarter. Both Generation and Retail financial results were slightly lower given the mild weather experienced in the quarter and lower hedge prices. This was offset by strong results from Renewables, NRG Yield and the change in our Home Solar business model announced earlier in the year. We also remained focused on execution and made significant progress on our key priorities.
First, we continue to execute on our capital recycling program with NRG Yield. We completed one dropdown and made 2 separate offerings that will further strengthen their partnership. We believe these transactions highlight the Renewable platform's ability to enhance Yield's growth going forward, with opportunities both inside and outside of the current ROFO agreement.
Second, we announced our Transformation Plan, which laid out a much clearer path to value for investors and will significantly strengthen and simplify our business so that it will thrive in any market cycles.
And finally, we made substantial progress towards resolving GenOn. We continue to work diligently with GenOn and its stakeholders through the bankruptcy process and can report that GenOn currently remains on track to emerge from bankruptcy by the year-end.
As you can see, it has been a busy several months, and I am extremely proud of all the hard work and focus that has gone into making this a strong quarter for our business.
Turning to our key operational metrics on Slide 5. I am very pleased with our safety performance for the quarter. We are just shy of top decile performance with 108 out of 129 facilities operating without a single recordable injury. We actually had fewer injuries year-over-year, and while these numbers are good, we will never be satisfied. The safety of our people is our #1 priority, and we will continue to focus our resources on improving our safety record over the balance of the year and beyond.
Performance was strong for our Generation fleet. Total megawatts produced were 6% higher compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven largely by the return to service of our South Central Cottonwood combined cycle plant following a significant flooding event in the first quarter of 2016 as well as higher coal generation.
The availability of our Generation fleet also increased during the quarter as we have fewer repowering and environmental compliance outages. More importantly, our fleet was available almost 94% of the time, as you can see by our in the money availability metric.
Our Retail business delivered a steady quarter, driven by strong customer acquisition and retention as well as reductions in operating costs. Both sales and customer count increased, helping to offset milder-than-normal weather.
Now moving to our key market on Slide 6. Starting on the left side of the page with the ERCOT market. The fundamentals in this market are strong, and we continue to see trends that point to market tightening over the next several years. Weather-normalized demand growth in ERCOT has averaged 2.3% over the last 12 months, which is well above the flat to negative growth of every other competitive market in the country. This steady demand has been driven by strong increases in population and employment as well as new coastal demand from the industrial sector.
On the supply side, we continue to see delays in newbuilds with actual megawatts brought online coming in well below expectations. Since the latest CDR report from May, we have seen 1 gigawatt of new generation being delayed from 2018 to later years and a new 700-megawatt combined cycle removed from the CDR. At the same time, we're seeing continued pressure for retirement given the low prices experienced in Texas over the past several years.
These market dynamics have become evident in the reserve margin calculation that indicate the tightness of market supply versus peak demand. As you can see in the chart, just in the last 18 months, reserve margins for 2018 went from the mid-20s to the high teens. And it does not take too much in terms of additional retirements, load growth or delays to get to single-digit numbers. For these reasons, ERCOT remains the most attractive market in our opinion.
However, there are changes that need to be made to strengthen the market, including marginal losses, improved location of scarcity pricing and enhanced performance of the ORDC. We will continue our work with ERCOT, the PUCT and other stakeholders to improve price formation and ensure the well functioning of ERCOT's energy-only market.
Turning to the right side of our slide, I want to highlight the premium location of our Generation fleet. In Texas, we have seen price separation between Houston and other areas. This is driven primarily by strong load growth in the area and transmission congestion. The Houston load pocket is where most of our generation is located, and given the drivers I mentioned, we would expect this premium to continue in the future.
Turning to PJM. During the quarter, we had the 2021 BRA capacity auction, which was the first with 100% capacity performance requirement. As you can see on the chart, over 85% of our capacity in PJM clear in the comment premium zone at almost $190 per [indiscernible].
These are 2 clear examples of our plants having a competitive advantage given their location near low pockets, benefiting from premium prices.
Before handing things over to Kirk on the topic of markets, I want to take a moment to reiterate NRG's strong support and advocacy of competitive markets for both retail and wholesale. We are disappointed with the rulings in New York and Illinois regarding subsidies for nuclear generation, however, there are strong grounds for appeal in these cases.
We will continue to be a vocal advocate for competitive markets and expect both the courts and the new FERC commissioners to take a fresh look at this issue. We remain optimistic that these subsidies will be found to be damaging to both the market and to consumers as these cases progress through the court system.
I will now turn to Kirk for our financial review."

Turning to the financial summary on Slide 8. For the second quarter, NRG delivered $685 million in adjusted EBITDA and $240 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth.
Total adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was relatively in line with the second quarter of 2016, and Generation and Renewables contributed $212 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, while Retail and Yield delivered $203 million and $270 million, respectively.
As a reminder and as I reviewed during our Transformation Plan presentation a couple of weeks ago, our consolidated financial results as well as our guidance now reflect the de-consolidation of GenOn.
Turning to guidance for 2017, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance ranges, which are provided and updated as a part of our Transformation Plan rollout to reflect adjustments related to the de-consolidation of GenOn as well as the impact of $65 million in 2017 cost savings and $175 million in onetime working capital improvements from the plan.
For your reference, I have included in the appendix the slide from our Transformation Plan presentation, which details these 2 adjustments to 2017 guidance. As a reminder, however, as I also indicated on the transformation plan call, our expectations for the balance of the year continue to place us at the lower end of the guidance range.
On August 1, we closed the sale to NRG Yield of our remaining 25% interest in the TE Wind portfolio consisting of 12 wind projects for a total cash consideration of $41 million. In addition, we have now offered Yield a 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility-scale solar assets, which are not part of the ROFO agreement, and we have proposed the creation of a new $50 million distributed generation partnership. These potential dropdowns are subject to negotiation with and the approval by NRG Yield's independent directors.
Finally, during the quarter, we successfully closed on a number of nonrecourse project financings resulting in approximately $500 million in cash proceeds, including over $350 million of debt proceeds for the construction of our Carlsbad contracted gas plant in California.
NRG has now repaid the $125 million outstanding balance under our corporate revolver, leaving this facility now undrawn. As a reminder, we have made that draw earlier in the year to fund the corresponding drawdown by GenOn under the intercompany revolver. Although that intercompany balance remains outstanding, GenOn is required to repay the balance upon emergence from bankruptcy. And in anticipation of that event, we repaid the NRG revolver this past quarter using excess cash on hand, which we expect will be replenished upon GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy and the corresponding repayment of the intercompany revolver.
Turning to Slide 9 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. Our updated capital available for allocation now reflects the proceeds received from the closing of the TE Wind dropdown, further increasing expected surplus capital at year-end to $170 million. As we reviewed with you on July 12, we expect to significantly build on this balance during the first half of 2018 using proceeds from asset sales, which assuming a sale of 100% of NRG Yield and Renewables would help drive anticipated excess cash to just over $4 billion by the end of 2018.
To complete the financial review, Slide 10 provides an update on our corporate credit metrics. Having previously provided a pro forma view of these ratios based on the full impact of the Transformation Plan, this page focuses on our expected credit ratio for 2017 with the denominator of that ratio based on the midpoint of our guidance for the year.
Our expected year-end gross debt balance of $7.2 billion continues to reflect the expected deployment of $600 million in 2017 capital previously allocated to our debt reduction, which we expect to execute later this year.
Our corporate credit ratios are largely unchanged since our first quarter update, and we continue to expect to achieve a net corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.7x.
As we reviewed, as a part of the Transformation Plan, we expect to be able to achieve our target 3x ratio by 2018 based on the EBITDA benefits of the cost savings and margin improvements.
Additional deleveraging in 2018 will be necessarily solely as a result of the reduction in EBITDA associated with assets targeted for sale. We intend to fund this additional debt reduction with the proceeds from asset sales and, based on 100% of NRG Yield and Renewables, we'd expect incremental debt reduction to be approximately $650 million in order to maintain our target ratio.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

Our priorities to enhance margins and streamline costs, optimize our portfolio and rightsize our capital structure are now integrated into our transformation plan, and we will begin updating the market on our progress starting on our third quarter call.
Also, we would expect to update the market with any material announcements regarding asset sales as they occur. As we work through these sales processes and improvements, we will also provide you a more definitive time line for our Investor Day.

I think that you will -- you should expect that we will appeal both to the circuit courts. I recognize that there are some improvements that we need to make to the market, both in terms of recognizing the attributes that each power plant brings to the system and to recognize also the impact of new technologies. But where we disagree is to have an out-of-market subsidy for one specific company in a technology that is now proven and mature that, in our view, at the expense of consumers and the integrity of competitive markets. I mean, that's the -- that's really the concern. So we think that we have a strong case, and with new FERC commissioners coming in, I think there will be a fresh look, a fresh perspective on the validity of our case and the potential impact that this out-of-market subsidies can have in the competitive markets. And we feel confident that this will prevail. Obviously, I can't comment anymore because this is a ongoing legal proceeding. I mean, in terms of our nuclear plants, South Texas project in Texas, and that's true for any other plant in the Generation -- in our Generation portfolio. We are constantly evaluating the financial health of our facilities, not only in the near term, but in the long term. What are the prospects? What is their profitability today and tomorrow? And I will tell you, because I think we have a pretty good track record for that, to the extent the facilities are not operating, are not cash flow positive, we've taken steps to either improve their competitiveness or to retire them if we don't see any better prospects to that. So I think we will -- in the case of SVP, in particular, I mean, this is something that we, obviously, work closely with our partners. This is not just an NRG decision only. We have other 2 partners, and we are all focused in improving the competitiveness of our plant, of our nuclear plant."

So we have a 5-year runway where it gives me a lot of comfort in terms of the rebalancing of our portfolio. And obviously, we evaluate the composition of our integrated platform every time.

And particularly in Retail, we knew that there is a -- in terms of the scale and scope of our Retail operation, there are very few people that we can actually compare ourselves to. So we went a little outside of the power space and we went to the Retail space and the entire Retail space in other industries to see what are the best practices. And we identified 2 areas where we can actually improve our Retail business, which we are very proud of, and I think everybody recognizes our leading position in this space. And that was building up our IT infrastructure and analytics. And I think everybody recognizes the amount of information that we have from our customers, and so there is an opportunity here to really take our Retail business to the next level, adopting some of the best practices from other industries. I think the midpoint that you were talking about, how should we think about it. For 2017, our midpoint was around $750 million, give or take. So what I -- the way I characterize this effort is, in the last 3 years, we grew our business roughly by $200 million. What we're saying that is in the next 3 years, we are going to grow it by $200 million. This, I hope, gives all of you comfort that we have done this in the past, and that's what we are targeting to do in the future."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, head of our Retail business.
Just a few weeks ago, we announced our comprehensive and multidimensional Transformation Plan. Since then, we've had the opportunity to speak with many of you in great detail about our plan, which will better position us as the leader in the competitive power space. We are actively engaged on all fronts, and I look forward to updating you on our hard work and progress in the next quarter. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results.
Also, you will note that all the financial and operational results discussed today do not include GenOn due to its bankruptcy filing.
Starting on Slide 4 with the summary and highlights for the quarter. Today, we're reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $685 million, in line with our second quarter results from last year, and $240 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. We are also reaffirming our full year financial guidance for 2017 for both EBITDA and free cash flow.
Our integrated platform performed quite well during the quarter. Both Generation and Retail financial results were slightly lower given the mild weather experienced in the quarter and lower hedge prices. This was offset by strong results from Renewables, NRG Yield and the change in our Home Solar business model announced earlier in the year. We also remained focused on execution and made significant progress on our key priorities.
First, we continue to execute on our capital recycling program with NRG Yield. We completed one dropdown and made 2 separate offerings that will further strengthen their partnership. We believe these transactions highlight the Renewable platform's ability to enhance Yield's growth going forward, with opportunities both inside and outside of the current ROFO agreement.
Second, we announced our Transformation Plan, which laid out a much clearer path to value for investors and will significantly strengthen and simplify our business so that it will thrive in any market cycles.
And finally, we made substantial progress towards resolving GenOn. We continue to work diligently with GenOn and its stakeholders through the bankruptcy process and can report that GenOn currently remains on track to emerge from bankruptcy by the year-end.
As you can see, it has been a busy several months, and I am extremely proud of all the hard work and focus that has gone into making this a strong quarter for our business.
Turning to our key operational metrics on Slide 5. I am very pleased with our safety performance for the quarter. We are just shy of top decile performance with 108 out of 129 facilities operating without a single recordable injury. We actually had fewer injuries year-over-year, and while these numbers are good, we will never be satisfied. The safety of our people is our #1 priority, and we will continue to focus our resources on improving our safety record over the balance of the year and beyond.
Performance was strong for our Generation fleet. Total megawatts produced were 6% higher compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven largely by the return to service of our South Central Cottonwood combined cycle plant following a significant flooding event in the first quarter of 2016 as well as higher coal generation.
The availability of our Generation fleet also increased during the quarter as we have fewer repowering and environmental compliance outages. More importantly, our fleet was available almost 94% of the time, as you can see by our in the money availability metric.
Our Retail business delivered a steady quarter, driven by strong customer acquisition and retention as well as reductions in operating costs. Both sales and customer count increased, helping to offset milder-than-normal weather.
Now moving to our key market on Slide 6. Starting on the left side of the page with the ERCOT market. The fundamentals in this market are strong, and we continue to see trends that point to market tightening over the next several years. Weather-normalized demand growth in ERCOT has averaged 2.3% over the last 12 months, which is well above the flat to negative growth of every other competitive market in the country. This steady demand has been driven by strong increases in population and employment as well as new coastal demand from the industrial sector.
On the supply side, we continue to see delays in newbuilds with actual megawatts brought online coming in well below expectations. Since the latest CDR report from May, we have seen 1 gigawatt of new generation being delayed from 2018 to later years and a new 700-megawatt combined cycle removed from the CDR. At the same time, we're seeing continued pressure for retirement given the low prices experienced in Texas over the past several years.
These market dynamics have become evident in the reserve margin calculation that indicate the tightness of market supply versus peak demand. As you can see in the chart, just in the last 18 months, reserve margins for 2018 went from the mid-20s to the high teens. And it does not take too much in terms of additional retirements, load growth or delays to get to single-digit numbers. For these reasons, ERCOT remains the most attractive market in our opinion.
However, there are changes that need to be made to strengthen the market, including marginal losses, improved location of scarcity pricing and enhanced performance of the ORDC. We will continue our work with ERCOT, the PUCT and other stakeholders to improve price formation and ensure the well-functioning of ERCOT's energy-only market.
Turning to the right side of our slide, I want to highlight the premium location of our Generation fleet. In Texas, we have seen price separation between Houston and other areas. This is driven primarily by strong load growth in the area and transmission congestion. The Houston load pocket is where most of our generation is located, and given the drivers I mentioned, we would expect this premium to continue in the future.
Turning to PJM. During the quarter, we had the 2021 BRA capacity auction, which was the first with 100% capacity performance requirement. As you can see on the chart, over 85% of our capacity in PJM clear in the comment premium zone at almost $190 per megawatt day.
These are 2 clear examples of our plants having a competitive advantage given their location near low pockets, benefiting from premium prices.
Before handing things over to Kirk on the topic of markets, I want to take a moment to reiterate NRG's strong support and advocacy of competitive markets for both retail and wholesale. We are disappointed with the rulings in New York and Illinois regarding subsidies for nuclear generation, however, there are strong grounds for appeal in these cases.
We will continue to be a vocal advocate for competitive markets and expect both the courts and the new FERC commissioners to take a fresh look at this issue. We remain optimistic that these subsidies will be found to be damaging to both the market and to consumers as these cases progress through the court system.
I will now turn to Kirk for our financial review."

Turning to the financial summary on Slide 8. For the second quarter, NRG delivered $685 million in adjusted EBITDA and $240 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth.
Total adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was relatively in line with the second quarter of 2016, and Generation and Renewables contributed $212 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, while Retail and Yield delivered $203 million and $270 million, respectively.
As a reminder and as I reviewed during our Transformation Plan presentation a couple of weeks ago, our consolidated financial results as well as our guidance now reflect the de-consolidation of GenOn.
Turning to guidance for 2017, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance ranges, which are provided and updated as a part of our Transformation Plan rollout to reflect adjustments related to the de-consolidation of GenOn as well as the impact of $65 million in 2017 cost savings and $175 million in onetime working capital improvements from the plan.
For your reference, I have included in the appendix the slide from our Transformation Plan presentation, which details these 2 adjustments to 2017 guidance. As a reminder, however, as I also indicated on the transformation plan call, our expectations for the balance of the year continue to place us at the lower end of the guidance range.
On August 1, we closed the sale to NRG Yield of our remaining 25% interest in the TE Wind portfolio consisting of 12 wind projects for a total cash consideration of $41 million. In addition, we have now offered Yield a 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility-scale solar assets, which are not part of the ROFO agreement, and we have proposed the creation of a new $50 million distributed generation partnership. These potential dropdowns are subject to negotiation with and the approval by NRG Yield's independent directors.
Finally, during the quarter, we successfully closed on a number of nonrecourse project financings resulting in approximately $500 million in cash proceeds, including over $350 million of debt proceeds for the construction of our Carlsbad contracted gas plant in California.
NRG has now repaid the $125 million outstanding balance under our corporate revolver, leaving this facility now undrawn. As a reminder, we have made that draw earlier in the year to fund the corresponding drawdown by GenOn under the intercompany revolver. Although that intercompany balance remains outstanding, GenOn is required to repay the balance upon emergence from bankruptcy. And in anticipation of that event, we repaid the NRG revolver this past quarter using excess cash on hand, which we expect will be replenished upon GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy and the corresponding repayment of the intercompany revolver.
Turning to Slide 9 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. Our updated capital available for allocation now reflects the proceeds received from the closing of the TE Wind dropdown, further increasing expected surplus capital at year-end to $170 million. As we reviewed with you on July 12, we expect to significantly build on this balance during the first half of 2018 using proceeds from asset sales, which assuming a sale of 100% of NRG Yield and Renewables would help drive anticipated excess cash to just over $4 billion by the end of 2018.
To complete the financial review, Slide 10 provides an update on our corporate credit metrics. Having previously provided a pro forma view of these ratios based on the full impact of the Transformation Plan, this page focuses on our expected credit ratio for 2017 with the denominator of that ratio based on the midpoint of our guidance for the year.
Our expected year-end gross debt balance of $7.2 billion continues to reflect the expected deployment of $600 million in 2017 capital previously allocated to our debt reduction, which we expect to execute later this year.
Our corporate credit ratios are largely unchanged since our first quarter update, and we continue to expect to achieve a net corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.7x.
As we reviewed, as a part of the Transformation Plan, we expect to be able to achieve our target 3x ratio by 2018 based on the EBITDA benefits of the cost savings and margin improvements.
Additional deleveraging in 2018 will be necessary solely as a result of the reduction in EBITDA associated with assets targeted for sale. We intend to fund this additional debt reduction with the proceeds from asset sales and, based on 100% sale of NRG Yield and Renewables, we'd expect incremental debt reduction to be approximately $650 million in order to maintain our target ratio.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

So let me ask you a different question. I know that when you announced the transformation plan, you indicated that some of the sales processes had already been sort of well under way, while others, like the process of looking for a strategic alternative for NRG Yield had been more nascent because it had only begun formally after the board approved the full Transformation Plan.

I recognize that there are some improvements that we need to make to the market, both in terms of recognizing the attributes that each power plant brings to the system and to recognize also the impact of new technologies. But where we disagree is to have an out-of-market subsidy for one specific company in a technology that is now proven and mature that, in our view, at the expense of consumers and the integrity of competitive markets. I mean, that's the -- that's really the concern. So we think that we have a strong case, and with new FERC commissioners coming in, I think there will be a fresh look, a fresh perspective on the validity of our case and the potential impact that these out-of-market subsidies can have in the competitive markets. And we feel confident that this will prevail. Obviously, I can't comment any more because this is a ongoing legal proceeding. I mean, in terms of our nuclear plants, South Texas project in Texas, and that's true for any other plant in the Generation -- in our Generation portfolio. We are constantly evaluating the financial health of our facilities, not only in the near term, but in the long term. What are the prospects? What is their profitability today and tomorrow? And I will tell you, because I think we have a pretty good track record for that, to the extent the facilities are not operating, are not cash flow positive, we've taken steps to either improve their competitiveness or to retire them if we don't see any better prospects to that. So I think we will -- in the case of STP, in particular, I mean, this is something that we, obviously, work closely with our partners. This is not just an NRG decision only.

In the Northeast, given the resolution of GenOn and some of the asset -- conventional asset sales that we're going to have, post the Transformation Plan, we will have an opportunity to rebalance that portfolio. And while we're going to be a little longer generation, keep in mind that, that generation is within the load pocket of the Chicago area, New York City or Southwest Connecticut, and that these assets benefit significantly from capacity prices that have been very robust and continue to be robust as far as 2020, 2021. So we have a 5-year runway where it gives me a lot of comfort in terms of the rebalancing of our portfolio. And obviously, we evaluate the composition of our integrated platform every time. And we see if the asset mix that we have is the right mix to manage our load, so that's what I -- that's how I think about the post-Transformation Plan in terms of our portfolio positioning."

And particularly in Retail, we knew that there is a -- in terms of the scale and scope of our Retail operation, there are very few people that we can actually compare ourselves to. So we went a little outside of the power space and we went to the Retail space and the entire Retail space in other industries to see what are the best practices. And we identified 2 areas where we can actually improve our Retail business, which we are very proud of, and I think everybody recognizes our leading position in this space. And that was building up our IT infrastructure and analytics. And I think everybody recognizes the amount of information that we have from our customers, and so there is an opportunity here to really take our Retail business to the next level, adopting some of the best practices from other industries. I think the midpoint that you were talking about, how should we think about it. For 2017, our midpoint was around $750 million, give or take.

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, head of our Retail business.
Just a few weeks ago, we announced our comprehensive and multidimensional Transformation Plan. Since then, we've had the opportunity to speak with many of you in great detail about our plan, which will better position us as the leader in the competitive power space. We are actively engaged on all fronts, and I look forward to updating you on our hard work and progress in the next quarter. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results.
Also, you will note that all the financial and operational results discussed today do not include GenOn due to its bankruptcy filing.
Starting on Slide 4 with the summary and highlights for the quarter. Today, we're reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $685 million, in line with our second quarter results from last year, and $240 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. We are also reaffirming our full year financial guidance for 2017 for both EBITDA and free cash flow.
Our integrated platform performed quite well during the quarter. Both Generation and Retail financial results were slightly lower given the mild weather experienced in the quarter and lower hedge prices. This was offset by strong results from Renewables, NRG Yield and the change in our Home Solar business model announced earlier in the year. We also remained focused on execution and made significant progress on our key priorities.
First, we continue to execute on our capital recycling program with NRG Yield. We completed one dropdown and made 2 separate offerings that will further strengthen their partnership. We believe these transactions highlight the Renewable platform's ability to enhance Yield's growth going forward, with opportunities both inside and outside of the current ROFO agreement.
Second, we announced our Transformation Plan, which laid out a much clearer path to value for investors and will significantly strengthen and simplify our business so that it will thrive in any market cycles.
And finally, we made substantial progress towards resolving GenOn. We continue to work diligently with GenOn and its stakeholders through the bankruptcy process and can report that GenOn currently remains on track to emerge from bankruptcy by the year-end.
As you can see, it has been a busy several months, and I am extremely proud of all the hard work and focus that has gone into making this a strong quarter for our business.
Turning to our key operational metrics on Slide 5. I am very pleased with our safety performance for the quarter. We are just shy of top decile performance with 108 out of 129 facilities operating without a single recordable injury. We actually had fewer injuries year-over-year, and while these numbers are good, we will never be satisfied. The safety of our people is our #1 priority, and we will continue to focus our resources on improving our safety record over the balance of the year and beyond.
Performance was strong for our Generation fleet. Total megawatts produced were 6% higher compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven largely by the return to service of our South Central Cottonwood combined cycle plant following a significant flooding event in the first quarter of 2016 as well as higher coal generation.
The availability of our Generation fleet also increased during the quarter as we have fewer repowering and environmental compliance outages. More importantly, our fleet was available almost 94% of the time, as you can see by our in the money availability metric.
Our Retail business delivered a steady quarter, driven by strong customer acquisition and retention as well as reductions in operating costs. Both sales and customer count increased, helping to offset milder-than-normal weather.
Now moving to our key market on Slide 6. Starting on the left side of the page with the ERCOT market. The fundamentals in this market are strong, and we continue to see trends that point to market tightening over the next several years. Weather-normalized demand growth in ERCOT has averaged 2.3% over the last 12 months, which is well above the flat to negative growth of every other competitive market in the country. This steady demand has been driven by strong increases in population and employment as well as new coastal demand from the industrial sector.
On the supply side, we continue to see delays in newbuilds with actual megawatts brought online coming in well below expectations. Since the latest CDR report from May, we have seen 1 gigawatt of new generation being delayed from 2018 to later years and a new 700-megawatt combined cycle removed from the CDR. At the same time, we're seeing continued pressure for retirement given the low prices experienced in Texas over the past several years.
These market dynamics have become evident in the reserve margin calculation that indicate the tightness of market supply versus peak demand. As you can see in the chart, just in the last 18 months, reserve margins for 2018 went from the mid-20s to the high teens. And it does not take too much in terms of additional retirements, load growth or delays to get to single-digit numbers. For these reasons, ERCOT remains the most attractive market in our opinion.
However, there are changes that need to be made to strengthen the market, including marginal losses, improved location of scarcity pricing and enhanced performance of the ORDC. We will continue our work with ERCOT, the PUCT and other stakeholders to improve price formation and ensure the well-functioning of ERCOT's energy-only market.
Turning to the right side of our slide, I want to highlight the premium location of our Generation fleet. In Texas, we have seen price separation between Houston and other areas. This is driven primarily by strong load growth in the area and transmission congestion. The Houston load pocket is where most of our generation is located, and given the drivers I mentioned, we would expect this premium to continue in the future.
Turning to PJM. During the quarter, we had the 2021 BRA capacity auction, which was the first with 100% capacity performance requirement. As you can see on the chart, over 85% of our capacity in PJM clear in the comment premium zone at almost $190 per megawatt day.
These are 2 clear examples of our plants having a competitive advantage given their location near low pockets, benefiting from premium prices.
Before handing things over to Kirk on the topic of markets, I want to take a moment to reiterate NRG's strong support and advocacy of competitive markets for both retail and wholesale. We are disappointed with the rulings in New York and Illinois regarding subsidies for nuclear generation, however, there are strong grounds for appeal in these cases.
We will continue to be a vocal advocate for competitive markets and expect both the courts and the new FERC commissioners to take a fresh look at this issue. We remain optimistic that these subsidies will be found to be damaging to both the market and to consumers as these cases progress through the court system.
I will now turn to Kirk for our financial review."

Turning to the financial summary on Slide 8. For the second quarter, NRG delivered $685 million in adjusted EBITDA and $240 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth.
Total adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was relatively in line with the second quarter of 2016, and Generation and Renewables contributed $212 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, while Retail and Yield delivered $203 million and $270 million, respectively.
As a reminder and as I reviewed during our Transformation Plan presentation a couple of weeks ago, our consolidated financial results as well as our guidance now reflect the de-consolidation of GenOn.
Turning to guidance for 2017, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance ranges, which are provided and updated as a part of our Transformation Plan rollout to reflect adjustments related to the de-consolidation of GenOn as well as the impact of $65 million in 2017 cost savings and $175 million in onetime working capital improvements from the plan.
For your reference, I have included in the appendix the slide from our Transformation Plan presentation, which details these 2 adjustments to 2017 guidance. As a reminder, however, as I also indicated on the transformation plan call, our expectations for the balance of the year continue to place us at the lower end of the guidance range.
On August 1, we closed the sale to NRG Yield of our remaining 25% interest in the TE Wind portfolio consisting of 12 wind projects for a total cash consideration of $41 million. In addition, we have now offered Yield a 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility-scale solar assets, which are not part of the ROFO agreement, and we have proposed the creation of a new $50 million distributed generation partnership. These potential dropdowns are subject to negotiation with and the approval by NRG Yield's independent directors.
Finally, during the quarter, we successfully closed on a number of nonrecourse project financings resulting in approximately $500 million in cash proceeds, including over $350 million of debt proceeds for the construction of our Carlsbad contracted gas plant in California.
NRG has now repaid the $125 million outstanding balance under our corporate revolver, leaving this facility now undrawn. As a reminder, we have made that draw earlier in the year to fund the corresponding drawdown by GenOn under the intercompany revolver. Although that intercompany balance remains outstanding, GenOn is required to repay the balance upon emergence from bankruptcy. And in anticipation of that event, we repaid the NRG revolver this past quarter using excess cash on hand, which we expect will be replenished upon GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy and the corresponding repayment of the intercompany revolver.
Turning to Slide 9 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. Our updated capital available for allocation now reflects the proceeds received from the closing of the TE Wind dropdown, further increasing expected surplus capital at year-end to $170 million. As we reviewed with you on July 12, we expect to significantly build on this balance during the first half of 2018 using proceeds from asset sales, which assuming a sale of 100% of NRG Yield and Renewables would help drive anticipated excess cash to just over $4 billion by the end of 2018.
To complete the financial review, Slide 10 provides an update on our corporate credit metrics. Having previously provided a pro forma view of these ratios based on the full impact of the Transformation Plan, this page focuses on our expected credit ratio for 2017 with the denominator of that ratio based on the midpoint of our guidance for the year.
Our expected year-end gross debt balance of $7.2 billion continues to reflect the expected deployment of $600 million in 2017 capital previously allocated to our debt reduction, which we expect to execute later this year.
Our corporate credit ratios are largely unchanged since our first quarter update, and we continue to expect to achieve a net corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.7x.
As we reviewed, as a part of the Transformation Plan, we expect to be able to achieve our target 3x ratio by 2018 based on the EBITDA benefits of the cost savings and margin improvements.
Additional deleveraging in 2018 will be necessary solely as a result of the reduction in EBITDA associated with assets targeted for sale. We intend to fund this additional debt reduction with the proceeds from asset sales and, based on 100% sale of NRG Yield and Renewables, we'd expect incremental debt reduction to be approximately $650 million in order to maintain our target ratio.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

Our priorities to enhance margins and streamline costs, optimize our portfolio and rightsize our capital structure are now integrated into our transformation plan, and we will begin updating the market on our progress starting on our third quarter call.
Also, we would expect to update the market with any material announcements regarding asset sales as they occur. As we work through these sales processes and improvements, we will also provide you a more definitive time line for our Investor Day.

So let me ask you a different question. I know that when you announced the transformation plan, you indicated that some of the sales processes had already been sort of well under way, while others, like the process of looking for a strategic alternative for NRG Yield had been more nascent because it had only begun formally after the board approved the full Transformation Plan. So can you just give us some sense of what we think -- what you think the cadence of announcements will be on disposition of assets and what we might expect to happen in the nearer term and what we might need to sort of be cognizant of weighting for towards the end of the year?"

I think that you will -- you should expect that we will appeal both to the circuit courts. I recognize that there are some improvements that we need to make to the market, both in terms of recognizing the attributes that each power plant brings to the system and to recognize also the impact of new technologies. But where we disagree is to have an out-of-market subsidy for one specific company in a technology that is now proven and mature that, in our view, at the expense of consumers and the integrity of competitive markets. I mean, that's the -- that's really the concern. So we think that we have a strong case, and with new FERC commissioners coming in, I think there will be a fresh look, a fresh perspective on the validity of our case and the potential impact that these out-of-market subsidies can have in the competitive markets. And we feel confident that this will prevail. Obviously, I can't comment any more because this is a ongoing legal proceeding. I mean, in terms of our nuclear plants, South Texas project in Texas, and that's true for any other plant in the Generation -- in our Generation portfolio. We are constantly evaluating the financial health of our facilities, not only in the near term, but in the long term. What are the prospects? What is their profitability today and tomorrow? And I will tell you, because I think we have a pretty good track record for that, to the extent the facilities are not operating, are not cash flow positive, we've taken steps to either improve their competitiveness or to retire them if we don't see any better prospects to that. So I think we will -- in the case of STP, in particular, I mean, this is something that we, obviously, work closely with our partners. This is not just an NRG decision only. We have other 2 partners, and we are all focused in improving the competitiveness of our plant, of our nuclear plant."

And while we're going to be a little longer generation, keep in mind that, that generation is within the load pocket of the Chicago area, New York City or Southwest Connecticut, and that these assets benefit significantly from capacity prices that have been very robust and continue to be robust as far as 2020, 2021. So we have a 5-year runway where it gives me a lot of comfort in terms of the rebalancing of our portfolio. And obviously, we evaluate the composition of our integrated platform every time.

So we went a little outside of the power space and we went to the Retail space and the entire Retail space in other industries to see what are the best practices. And we identified 2 areas where we can actually improve our Retail business, which we are very proud of, and I think everybody recognizes our leading position in this space. And that was building up our IT infrastructure and analytics. And I think everybody recognizes the amount of information that we have from our customers, and so there is an opportunity here to really take our Retail business to the next level, adopting some of the best practices from other industries. I think the midpoint that you were talking about, how should we think about it. For 2017, our midpoint was around $750 million, give or take. So what I -- the way I characterize this effort is, in the last 3 years, we grew our business roughly by $200 million. What we're saying that is in the next 3 years, we are going to grow it by $200 million. This, I hope, gives all of you comfort that we have done this in the past, and that's what we are targeting to do in the future."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business. 
I'd like to start the call by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, we are on track to deliver on the transformational plan objectives we laid out earlier this year. For cost savings, we're actually ahead of our 2017 target through the third quarter of this year. Second, today, we're initiating 2018 financial guidance, which I'm pleased to confirm is in line with the targets provided in our Transformation Plan. Third, we are seeing a number of positive catalysts in our core markets from our recovering in our driven by asset retirements to multiple regulatory initiatives that highlight the urgency of reforming our power markets. This is certainly a time to be optimistic about competitive power. 
Now turning to our Transformation Plan update on Slide 5. We are making good progress across all areas. We are reaffirming our full cost savings on margin enhancement targets with a run rate of $855 million in recurring free cash flow accretion by 2020. Through the end of the third quarter, we have already realized $92 million in cost savings, which means we have achieved 142% of our target for 2017. And as I told you previously, we were hard at work identifying cost savings starting early in the year. This focus on continuous improvement have led to adjust on our plan and has enabled us to realize some of our anticipated 2018 cost savings in 2017. 
In addition, we're currently putting in place the foundation needed to realize margin improvements starting next year. This includes everything from finalizing strategies for expanding and enhancing offerings for customers, to streamlining transactions, to enhancing our IT systems for more sophisticated customer analytics. Our asset sales process remains on track. We are reaffirming our total proceeds target of up to $4 billion and we anticipate a vast majority of this process to be announced in 2017. 
With respect to our Renewables business, and our interest in NRG Yield, while this is very much an ongoing process, what I can tell you is that we are currently anticipating a 100% sale of this platform. We are pleased with the level of interest that our high-quality, unique assets and businesses have created from prospective buyers. These have allowed us to move to advance stages in multiple processes and we maintained the expectation of announcing significant transactions by the end of the year. But to be clear and consistent with our objective to maximize shareholder value, we will not compromise value for time with any of these transactions. 
On the capital allocation front, we remain focused on using excess cash to deleverage our business and position ourselves to take advantage of high return opportunities in the future. Since our second quarter call, we have taken other $600 million of debt out of our capital structure, completing our 2017 capital allocation goal. 
Turning now to our third quarter results on Slide 6. We achieved $806 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which reflects the impacts of sustained mild weather in our core markets as well as Hurricane Harvey. As we have been tracking to the low end of the guidance coming into the summer, these results had led us to narrow and lower our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. I do want to take a moment, however, to acknowledge the strong results and outlook for our Retail business, which continues improving its operating efficiencies, and customer acquisition and retention, offsetting some of the impacts of summer weather. 
Despite the disappointing quarter in terms of weather and wholesale pricing opportunities, we have still made significant progress on executing many key priorities. As we execute on our transformation, we have remained vigilant and focused on safety. For the quarter, we achieved a better than top decile safety performance with 118 out of 128 facilities operating without a single recordable injury. This result is a testament to the safety culture embraced by everyone of my colleagues at NRG. We also continue to execute on opportunities to quickly recycle capital through our partnership with NRG Yield, closing on a 38-megawatt solar portfolio for $71 million in cash proceeds and forming a new $50 million solar partnerships. 
In addition, we are announcing today the offer of our 154-megawatt Buckthorn Solar assets to NRG Yield. Looking ahead to 2018, we are initiating adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Kirk will provide more details later in the presentation, but importantly, for the retained businesses, this guidance is in line with the targets provided in our Transformational Plan announced this summer. This is despite removing several plans that were originally included in our 2018 Transformation Plan projections and lower-than-expected production from the oil field associated with our project. 
Now turning to Slide 7 for a closer look at the key drivers this summer. We experienced very mild weather across the East and ERCOT, eliminating any opportunity for scarcity pricing. In Texas, we saw both a major hurricane and the coolest August since 2004 with cooling degree days, 13% below normal. In the Northeast, cooling degree days were on average, 8% below normal for July and August. This lack of weather resulted in very weak summer prices as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. 
In ERCOT, real-time on peak prices settled 43% below pre-summer expectations. But despite the absence of extreme weather this summer, ERCOT fundamentals remain strong. ERCOT's 2017 peak load of 69.5 gigawatts was up nearly 2% over the 5-year average and came in just shy of the 2016 peak. In terms of total consumption, we were flat to 2016 levels despite having the coolest August in 14 years plus a major hurricane. 
And while for our business, we say summer 2017 weather was mild, for many living along the Gulf Coast, it was devastating. Hurricane Harvey was an unprecedented storm. It was the wettest storm to ever hit the continental United States. In the face of this historic adversity, I could not be more proud of the way my colleagues responded. 
Turning to Slide 8. I want to take a moment to recognize the men and women of NRG who kept the lights on, supported each other and provided assistance to both our customers and impacted communities during a time of need. First and foremost, safety is always the primary concern and I'm pleased to report we have no safety incidents at our plants or in our corporate offices during the storm, but beyond safety, our employees showed great concern for their communities, engaging with first responders, and community assistance programs to be on the ground, helping with services such as on-site emergency power supply. 
And reliant, our flagship retail business in Texas, went above and beyond, demonstrating leadership by being the first retailer to offer customer relief programs. We were as prepared as we could be for Hurricane Harvey. Our generation maintained 80% availability during the worst of the storm, a testament to the resiliency and reliability of our portfolio. Today, we're back to 95% availability across all of our generation. Currently, only 2 of our plants are off-line, and we're actively assessing impacts and determining our return to service strategy. 
On the Retail side, I did speak, about 4% of our customers where without power and today, power has been restored to nearly all of our customers. Between our 2 businesses, we estimate the financial impacts of the storm and related whether to be about $40 million in 2017. As we continue to assess the situation, we will provide you with any necessary updates. 
Once again, I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone across the organization for their commitment to safety, their focus in building resilient operations, and their support for effective communities in the days and weeks following the storm. 
Looking forward, we have many reasons to be excited about the markets, as outlined on Slide 9. In ERCOT, the recently announced retirement of over 4 gigawatts of generating capacity puts further pressure on a market with already steady, strong fundamentals. First summer of 2018, these known retirements and asset delays alone will put ERCOT as the lowest reserve margins on record, which is expected to be somewhere between 10% and 11%. Other changes such as delay in newbuilds and industrial demand could lower this number even further. 
The tightening of the ERCOT market is something that we have been anticipating for quite some time. Just on our last earnings call, we were estimating reserve margins to close -- of close to 11%, which now has become a reality. We are encouraged to see that other generators in the market are being disciplined on economic assets as we have done in the past. And while news of these retirements during the past several weeks has increased power prices, it is important to note that these prices are still below what is needed to justify new build economics. 
Now while these retirements are important in improving market health, ERCOT must do more to strengthen markets and should recognize the location of value of power plants. We have already provided a set of recommendations that would improve the pricing now for generators in locations where power is needed. Reliability and resiliency are important attributes to the grid and we will continue to work with ERCOT to ensure generators, close to load centers are compensated for all the benefits they provide. 
Beyond this positive developments in the ERCOT market, we are seeing several other calls to action for market reform. As the power grid continues to undergo significant change, low gas prices, renewal penetration and attempts for out-of-market subsidy for economic generation, regulatory bodies and other stakeholders are taking note. This has led to several significant potential catalysts, from the DOE staff reported competitive market and offer, to PJM's proposed market reforms, I cannot recall another time where there has been such urgency and reach across ISOs to improve competitive energy markets. We will continue our vocal advocacy against out-of-market subsidies for existing uneconomic generation and for market-based solutions that recognize all the services that generators provide energy, capacity, reliability and resiliency. 
And with that, I will turn things over to Kirk for a financial review."
413857,540727310,1329221,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $806 million in adjusted EBITDA and $599 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Generation renewables contribute",1156,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $806 million in adjusted EBITDA and $599 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Generation renewables contributed $265 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail and Yield delivered $276 million and $265 million, respectively. Our results for the quarter reflect the impact of mild weather as well as Hurricane Harvey. 
In the latter case, as the sustained heavy winds and lower temperatures led to below normal load for our Retail business. The resulting revenue impact, combined with losses experienced from unwinding hedges and depressed real-time prices, contributed to lower-than-expected retail results for the quarter. Although our Houston base load assets weathered the storm admirably, our wholesale business was also impacted by outages and associated loss margins resulting from flooding across the region including in particular our Cottonwood facility, which has since returned to service. 
And finally, our Boston Energy trading and Marketing or BETM business, underperform for the quarter, further contributing to results, which came in below expectations. Prior to the summer, although our Retail outlook had been trending above the range, our reduced expectations for wholesale more than offset this and as I indicated in our second quarter call, our expectations for the balance of the year at that time placed us at the lower end of our consolidated guidance. 
Now, factoring in the impact of the third quarter events I just reviewed. Our outlook for 2017 is now approximately [ $115 million ] below the low end of our previous EBITDA guidance range. As a result, we are now reducing and narrowing our 2017 guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Our revised consolidated free cash flow guidance range is now $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion while revised NRG level free cash flow guidance is now $755 million to $855 million. We do not expect the contributing factors to our reduced guidance for 2017 to be recurring and they do not impact our outlook and guidance for 2018, which I'll review in a moment. 
Immediately following the quarter-end, we redeemed the remaining balances of our 2018 and 2021 unsecured notes, further reducing corporate debt, extending our nearest maturity 2022 and capturing nearly [ $50 million ] in incremental annual cash interest savings. These redemptions also represent the completion of our 2017 capital allocation plan and places on track to achieving our leverage ratio target announced as part of the Transformation Plan. 
Finally, on November 1, we closed on the sales to NRG Yield of a 38-megawatt portfolio, a distributed and small utility scale solar assets, not part of the ROFO agreement for $71 million, increasing 2017 capital available for capital allocation. 
Turning next to 2018 guidance on Slide 12. Although as Mauricio indicated, we remain on track to announce most of our targeted divestitures by year-end, we will continue to include those assets and businesses in our consolidated results and guidance until that process concludes. For 2018, we expect $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion adjusted EBITDA with $950 million to $1.05 billion for generation of renewables, $900 million to $1 billion from Retail, which includes $30 million of margin improvements from the Transformation Plan and $950 million from NRG Yield. 
Our 2018 consolidated free cash flow guidance is $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion with 1.170 billion to 1.370 billion at the NRG level. In order to provide a pro forma view of 2018 based on midpoint guidance and moving them left to right in the table, we deduct the 2018 impact to consolidated guidance associated with divestitures, which is comprised of approximately $1.4 billion in EBITDA, $670 million in consolidated free cash flow and $290 million in NRG level free cash flow. These 2018 divestiture impact numbers diverse slightly from those used in the pro forma walk we provided as part of the Transformation Plan, which were then based on 2017 numbers. 
The final column provides an implied pro forma view of 2018 results based on midpoint guidance, and assuming asset sales including 100% of yield and renewables all take place as of January 1. On a pro forma basis, implied retained asset EBITDA is approximately $1.5 billion with nearly $1 billion of free cash flow. These numbers also reflect the impact of our 2017 transformation targets, including achieving $500 million of cost savings, $30 million of margin improvement and $85 million of additional working capital efficiency. Importantly, pro forma cash balances are also of course, further improved by up to $4 billion in expected asset sale proceeds. 
Beyond 2018, we expect nearly $3 billion of additional upside from the full run rate of the Transformation Plan benefits as cost savings grow from $500 million in 2018 to the full $590 million by 2020 and margin improvements further expand from $30 million in 2018 to $215 million by 2020. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a brief update on 2017 NRG level capital allocation with changes since the prior quarter highlighted in blue. Our updated 2017 capital for allocation of $1.3 billion, now reflects the proceeds received from the closing of the 38-megawatt portfolio of distribute and small utilities solar assets to NRG Yield as well as the $165 million reduction in the midpoint 2017 NRG level free cash flow before growth guidance. 
Turning to the GenOn settlement capital. As the GenOn noteholders on October 30 entered into and filed the consent agreement, extending the effective date milestones to as late as September 30, 2018, we now expect GenOn's to emerge from bankruptcy in 2018. However, we will continue to reserve from the GenOn settlement payment next year upon emergence. In parallel with the milestone extension, NRG and GenOn also reached agreement on a settlement term sheet in an effort to resolve certain open issues from the original RSA.
With our corporate debt reduction now complete, with the redemption of the 2018 and '21 notes, we've revised the debt reduction up slightly to reflect the principal balance of the '21 notes actually repaid versus the $200 million delevering placeholder in our previous disclosure and we expect approximately $70 million of excess capital at year-end 2017. 
To complete the financial review, Slide 14 provides an update on our corporate credit metrics for both 2017 and 2018. Based on our revised guidance for 2017, we expect a 2017 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 4.3x. Turning to 2018, and taking into account our implied midpoint for pro forma EBITDA post asset sales, which includes, again, the benefit of both cost savings and margin enhancements, and taking to account the $640 million of additional debt reduction due to divestitures, which was previously disclosed as part of the Transformation Plan, places us on track to achieve our net-debt-to-EBITDA target ratio of 3x with significant surplus capital for allocation from asset sale proceeds. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

As we continue to work diligently through the sales process, I look forward to providing you with further detail on sale announcements upon reaching agreement. 
We also continue to make good progress on GenOn. We have worked with GenOn to resolve open issues in the restructuring and support agreement, which were detailed in the summary term filed in our 8-K this week. This includes items such as the timing and nature of transition services, the treatment of NRG's canal 3 project, and other post employment benefit obligations. We stake these terms will be finalizing the plan confirmation on November 13 and will set the path forward for GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy.

We are always mindful in monitoring the bonds and high-yield market clearly, we've seen a rally there where I think most of the yields on our bonds, they're trading at a premium, which means they're trading inside the nominal coupons. And almost every case, in fact, I think in every case, all the way up to the longest maturity inside 6, which is really sort of an attractive long-term rates for unsecured financing at that credit level so we will certainly continue to monitor that. We have some near-term callable debt so I think our approach to the leverage side of the balance sheet is going to be a balance of obviously, first and foremost, maintaining that 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio, but in the process, I'm a big believer and obviously, interest savings on accretive MTV positive basis in addition to maturity extension. So I think you'd see us looking at that pretty closely. I think at or around the bond levels are trading right now, especially on the longest dated maturities, which is the where we can refinance on a long-term rate. We are at or even slightly ahead of what would be an implied accretive transaction. So I think that is certainly not beyond the realm of possibility and we'll continue to monitor that closely to sort of blend in that opportunistic refinancings and maturity extension, which is driving this balance sheet ratios to where we want it to be."

More importantly, the calls about energy center project, which still has actually a slight negative EBITDA contribution in 2018 as we complete that project. As we move into 2019 and beyond, you've got a pretty significant contribution there from that particular asset.

I mean we have a ways to go before we have a balanced portfolio like we have in Texas so we have a lot of room to grow in retail. But just in terms of market structure, I would put PJM #1, I think #2 and New York, #3 if I had to force rank them."

I mean, it has to do with where they are located in the grid? What type of coal they burn? What is their environmental profile? Do they have environmental controls that are in place or not? What are the rules that are coming down the pipe? So I don't think you can make a blank statement like that. What I have said in the past is our coal generation in Texas, I feel very comfortable with it given the size, the coal that they burn, which is PRD and the location in the grid and the environmental control that they have. I mean, we feel very comfortable where they are right now. Clearly, the expected retirement that we've been talking for a while were announced. That has an impact on prices. But as I said, an impact, but it's not enough to bring -- to justify new build economics. So if ERCOT falls below the target reserve margins, I think more needs to be done in the market to incentivize new generation to come back, but that's how I think about our coal portfolio under these economics. I mean, somebody else is, I think, you can clearly see that these were an economic plans that were difficult to justify and we're just encouraged that they're behaving, that they can go on economic generation now with the market and behaving rationally."

So we've never looked at the '17 to '18 numbers as a hockey stick, but there are some market recoveries.

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business. 
I'd like to start the call by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, we are on track to deliver on the Transformation Plan objectives we laid out earlier this year. For cost savings, we're actually ahead of our 2017 target through the third quarter of this year. Second, today, we're initiating 2018 financial guidance, which I am pleased to confirm is in line with the targets provided in our Transformation Plan. Third, we are seeing a number of positive catalysts in our core markets, from a recovery in ERCOT driven by asset retirements to multiple regulatory initiatives that highlight the urgency of reforming our power markets. This is certainly a time to be optimistic about competitive power. 
Now turning to our Transformation Plan update on Slide 5. We are making good progress across all areas. We are reaffirming our full cost savings and margin enhancement targets with a run rate of $855 million in recurring free cash flow accretion by 2020. Through the end of the third quarter, we have already realized $92 million in cost savings, which means we have achieved 142% of our target for 2017. And as I told you previously, we were hard at work identifying cost savings starting early in the year. This focus on continuous improvement have led to adjust that on our plan and has enabled us to realize some of our anticipated 2018 cost savings in 2017. 
In addition, we're currently putting in place the foundation needed to realize margin improvement starting next year. This includes everything from finalizing strategies for expanding and enhancing offerings for customers to streamlining transactions to enhancing our IT systems for more sophisticated customer analytics. Our asset sale process remains on track. We are reaffirming our total proceeds target of up to $4 billion, and we anticipate a vast majority of this proceeds to be announced in 2017. 
With respect to our Renewables business and our interest in NRG Yield, while this is very much an ongoing process, what I can tell you is that we are currently anticipating a 100% sale of this platform. We are pleased with the level of interest that our high-quality, unique assets and businesses have created from prospective buyers. These have allowed us to move to advanced stages in multiple processes, and we maintain the expectation of announcing significant transactions by the end of the year. But to be clear and consistent with our objective to maximize shareholder value, we will not compromise value for time with any of these transactions.  
On the capital allocation front, we remain focused on using excess cash to deleverage our business and position ourselves to take advantage of high-return opportunities in the future. Since our second quarter call, we have taken another $600 million of debt out of our capital structure, completing our 2017 capital allocation goal. 
Turning now to our third quarter results on Slide 6. We achieved $806 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which reflects the impacts of sustained mild weather in our core markets as well as Hurricane Harvey. As we have been tracking to the low end of the guidance coming into the summer, this result has led us to narrow and lower our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. I do want to take a moment, however, to acknowledge the strong results and outlook for our Retail business, which continues improving its operating efficiencies and customer acquisition and retention, offsetting some of the impacts of summer weather. 
Despite the disappointing quarter in terms of weather and wholesale pricing opportunities, we have still made significant progress on executing many key priorities. As we execute on our transformation, we have remained vigilant and focused on safety. For the quarter, we achieved a better-than-top-decile safety performance with 118 out of 128 facilities operating without a single recordable injury. This result is a testament to the safety culture embraced by everyone of my colleagues at NRG. We also continue to execute on opportunities to quickly recycle capital through our partnership with NRG Yield, closing on a 38-megawatt solar portfolio for $71 million in cash proceeds and forming a new $50 million solar partnership. In addition, we are announcing today the offer of our 154-megawatt Buckthorn Solar assets to NRG Yield. 
Looking ahead to 2018, we are initiating adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Kirk will provide more details later in the presentation, but importantly, for the retained businesses, this guidance is in line with the targets provided in our Transformational Plan announcement this summer. This is despite removing several plants that were originally included in our 2018 Transformation Plan projections and lower-than-expected production from the oilfield associated with our Petra Nova project. 
Now turning to Slide 7 for a closer look at the key drivers this summer. We experienced very mild weather across the East and ERCOT, eliminating any opportunity for scarcity pricing. In Texas, we saw both a major hurricane and the coolest August since 2004 with cooling degree days 13% below normal. In the Northeast, cooling degree days were on average 8% below normal for July and August. This lack of weather resulted in very weak summer prices, as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. 
 
In ERCOT, real-time on-peak prices settled 43% below pre-summer expectations. But despite the absence of extreme weather this summit -- summer, ERCOT fundamentals remain strong. ERCOT's 2017 peak load of 69.5 gigawatts was up nearly 2% over the 5-year average and came in just shy of the 2016 peak. In terms of total consumption, we were flat to 2016 levels despite having the coolest August in 14 years plus a major hurricane. 
And while, for our business, we say summer 2017 weather was mild, for many living along the Gulf Coast, it was devastating. Hurricane Harvey was an unprecedented storm. It was the wettest storm to ever hit the continental United States. In the face of this historic adversity, I could not be more proud of the way my colleagues responded. 
Turning to Slide 8. I want to take a moment to recognize the men and women of NRG who kept the lights on, supported each other and provided assistance to both our customers and impacted communities during a time of need. First and foremost, safety is always the primary concern, and I am pleased to report we have no safety incidents at our plants or in our corporate offices during the storm. But beyond safety, our employees showed great concern for their communities, engaging with first responders and community assistance programs to be on the ground, helping with services such as on-site emergency power supply. And Reliant, our flagship retail business in Texas, went above and beyond, demonstrating leadership by being the first retailer to offer customer relief programs. 
We were as prepared as we could be for Hurricane Harvey. Our baseload generation maintained 80% availability during the worst of the storm, a testament to the resiliency and reliability of our portfolio. Today, we're back to 95% availability across all of our Gulf generation. Currently, only 2 of our plants are offline, and we're actively assessing impacts and determining our return-to-service strategy. 
On the Retail side, I did speak about 4% of our customers were without power, and today, power has been restored to nearly all of our customers. Between our 2 businesses, we estimate the financial impacts of the storm and related weather to be about $40 million in 2017. As we continue to assess the situation, we will provide you with any necessary updates. Once again, I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone across the organization for their commitment to safety, their focus on building resilient operations and their support for effective communities in the days and weeks following the storm. 
Looking forward, we have many reasons to be excited about the markets, as outlined on Slide 9. In ERCOT, the recently announced retirement of over 4 gigawatts of generating capacity puts further pressure on a market with already steady, strong fundamentals. For summer of 2018, these known retirements and asset delays alone will put ERCOT at the lowest reserve margin on record, which is expected to be somewhere between 10% and 11%. Other changes such as delay in newbuilds and new industrial demand could lower this number even further. 
The tightening of the ERCOT market is something that we have been anticipating for quite some time. Just on our last earnings call, we were estimating reserve margins to close -- of close to 11%, which now has become a reality. We are encouraged to see that other generators in the market are being disciplined 
[Audio Gap] 
uneconomic assets as we have done in the past. And while news of these retirements during the past several weeks has increased power prices, it is important to note that these prices are still below what is needed to justify newbuild economics. 
Now while these retirements are important in improving market health, ERCOT must do more to strengthen markets and should recognize the locational value of power plants. We have already provided a set of recommendations that would improve the pricing for generators in locations where power is needed. Reliability and resiliency are important attributes to the grid, and we will continue to work with ERCOT to ensure generators close to load centers are compensated for all the benefits they provide. 
Beyond this positive developments in the ERCOT market, we are seeing several other calls to action for market reform. As the power grid continues to undergo significant change, low gas prices, renewable penetration and attempts for out-of-market subsidy for uneconomic generation, regulatory bodies and other stakeholders are taking note. This has led to several significant potential catalysts. From the DOE staff report of competitive market and NOPR to PJM's proposed market reforms, I cannot recall another time where there has been such urgency and reach across ISOs to improve competitive energy markets. We will continue our vocal advocacy against out-of-market subsidies for existing uneconomic generation and for market-based solutions that recognize all the services that generators provide: energy, capacity, reliability and resiliency. 
 And with that, I will turn things over to Kirk for a financial review."
413857,540727310,1329649,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $806 million in adjusted EBITDA and $599 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Generation and Renewables co",1160,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $806 million in adjusted EBITDA and $599 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Generation and Renewables contributed $265 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail and Yield delivered $276 million and $265 million, respectively. Our results for the quarter reflect the impact of mild weather as well as Hurricane Harvey. 
In the latter case, as the sustained heavy winds and lower temperatures led to below-normal load for our Retail business, the resulting revenue impact, combined with losses experienced from unwinding hedges and depressed real-time prices, contributed to lower-than-expected Retail results for the quarter. Although our Houston baseload assets weathered the storm admirably, our wholesale business was also impacted by outages and associated loss margin resulting from flooding across the region, including in particular our Cottonwood facility, which has since returned to service. 
Finally, our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing or BETM business underperformed for the quarter, further contributing to results which came in below expectations. Prior to the summer, although our Retail outlook had been trending above the range, our reduced expectations for wholesale more than offset this, and as I indicated in our second quarter call, our expectations for the balance of the year at that time placed us at the lower end of our consolidated guidance.  
Now factoring in the impact of the third quarter events I just reviewed, our outlook for 2017 is now approximately  $115 million  (sic) [ $165 million ]  below the low end of our previous EBITDA guidance range. As a result, we are now reducing and narrowing our 2017 guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Our revised consolidated free cash flow guidance range is now $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion while revised NRG-level free cash flow guidance is now $755 million to $855 million. We do not expect the contributing factors to our reduced guidance for 2017 to be recurring, and they do not impact our outlook and guidance for 2018, which I'll review in a moment. 
Immediately following the quarter end, we redeemed the remaining balances of our 2018 and 2021 unsecured notes, further reducing corporate debt, extending our nearest maturity 2022 and capturing nearly $50 million in incremental annual cash interest savings. These redemptions also represent the completion of our 2017 capital allocation plan and place us on track to achieving our leverage ratio target announced as part of the Transformation Plan. Finally, on November 1, we closed on the sale to NRG Yield of a 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility-scale solar assets, which are not part of the ROFO agreement, for $71 million, increasing 2017 capital available for allocation. 
Turning next to 2018 guidance on Slide 12. Although, as Mauricio indicated, we remain on track to announce most of our targeted divestitures by year-end, we will continue to include those assets and businesses in our consolidated results and guidance until that process concludes. For 2018, we expect $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion adjusted EBITDA, with $950 million to $1.05 billion from Generation and Renewables; $900 million to $1 billion from Retail, which includes $30 million of margin improvements from the Transformation Plan; and $950 million from NRG Yield. Our 2018 consolidated free cash flow guidance is $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion, with $1.170 billion to $1.370 billion at the NRG level. 
In order to provide a pro forma view of 2018 based on midpoint guidance and moving from left to right in the table, we deduct the 2018 impact to consolidated guidance associated with divestitures, which is comprised of approximately $1.4 billion in EBITDA, $670 million in consolidated free cash flow and $290 million in NRG-level free cash flow. These 2018 divestiture impact numbers differ slightly from those used in the pro forma walk we provided as a part of the Transformation Plan, which were then based on 2017 numbers. 
The final column provides an implied pro forma view of 2018 results based on midpoint guidance and assuming asset sales, including 100% of Yield and Renewables, all take place as of January 1. On a pro forma basis, implied midpoint retained asset EBITDA is approximately $1.5 billion, with nearly $1 billion of free cash flow. These numbers also reflect the impact of our 2017 transformation targets, including achieving $500 million of cost savings, $30 million of margin improvement and $85 million of additional working capital efficiency. Importantly, pro forma cash balances are also, of course, further improved by up to $4 billion in expected asset sale proceeds. Beyond 2018, we expect nearly $300 million of additional upside from the full run rate of the Transformation Plan benefits as cost savings grow from $500 million in 2018 to the full $590 million by 2020 and margin improvements further expand from $30 million in 2018 to $215 million by 2020. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level [ capital allocation ],  with changes since the prior quarter highlighted in blue. Our updated 2017 capital available for allocation of $1.3 billion now reflects the proceeds received from the closing of the 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility solar assets to NRG Yield as well as the $165 million reduction in the midpoint 2017 NRG-level free cash flow before growth guidance. 
Turning to the GenOn settlement capital. As the GenOn noteholders on October 30 entered into and filed the consent agreement extending the effective date milestones to as late as September 30, 2018, we now expect GenOn to emerge from bankruptcy in 2018. However, we will continue to reserve for the GenOn settlement payment next year upon emergence. In parallel with the milestone extension, NRG and GenOn also reached agreement on a settlement term sheet in an effort to resolve certain open issues from the original RSA. With our corporate debt reduction now complete with the redemption of the 2018 and '21 notes, we've revised the debt reduction number up slightly to reflect the principal balance of the '21 notes actually repaid versus the $200 million delevering placeholder in our previous disclosure, and we expect approximately $70 million of excess capital at year-end 2017. 
To complete the financial review, Slide 14 provides an update on our corporate credit metrics for both 2017 and 2018. Based on our revised guidance for 2017, we expect a 2017 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 4.3x. Turning to 2018 and taking into account our implied midpoint pro forma EBITDA post asset sales, which includes, again, the benefit of both cost savings and margin enhancements, and taking to account the $640 million of additional debt reduction due to divestitures, which was previously disclosed as a part of the Transformation Plan, places us on track to achieve our net-debt-to-EBITDA target ratio of 3x with significant surplus capital for allocation from asset sale proceeds. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

We have made significant progress across all the goals we set for the organization. We remain focused on delivering results and executing on the Transformation Plan. We have exceeded our 2017 targeted cost savings and continue to reduce our debt profile in order to achieve our corporate credit metrics. As we continue to work diligently through the asset sales process, I look forward to providing you with further detail on sale announcements upon reaching agreement. 
We also continue to make good progress on GenOn. We have worked with GenOn to resolve open issues in the restructuring support agreement, which were detailed in the summary term sheet filed in our 8-K this week. This includes items such as the timing and nature of transition services, the treatment of NRG's Canal 3 project and other post-employment benefit obligations. We expect these terms will be finalizing the plan confirmation on November 13 and will set the path forward for GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy. 
On a final note, I promise all of you that we would provide a more robust plan and opportunity for strategic discussion through an Analyst Day. We are planning to hold that Analyst Day in March of 2018, where we will provide you with an update on our Transformation Plan progress, updated financials as well as details around the strategic direction of our business. 
So with that, I want to thank you for your time today and your interest in NRG. And with that, Takeisha, we are now open -- we're now ready to open the lines for questions."

We are always mindful in monitoring the trading levels on the bonds and the high-yield market. And clearly, we've seen a rally there where, I think, most of the yields on our bonds were trading at a premium, which means they're trading inside the nominal coupons in almost every case, in fact, I think in every case, all the way up to the longest maturity, inside 6%, which is clearly sort of an attractive long-term rate for unsecured financing at that credit level. So we will certainly continue to monitor that. We've got some near-term callable debt. So I think our approach to the leverage side of the balance sheet is going to be a balance of, obviously, first and foremost, maintaining that 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio, but in the process, I'm a big believer on, obviously, interest savings on accretive or NPV-positive basis, in addition to maturity extension. So I think you'd see us looking at that pretty closely, I think, at or around the bond levels that are trading right now, especially on the longest-dated maturities, which is the best [indiscernible] we could refinance our long-term rate. We are at or even slightly ahead of what would be an implied accretive transaction. So I think that is certainly not beyond the realm of possibility, and we'll continue to monitor that closely to sort of blend in that opportunistic refinancing and maturity extension, which is driving this balance sheet ratios to where we want them to be."

It remains to be seen what we do with those. We mentioned in particular Greens Bayou and Gregory. In addition, our Encina plant, which we don't have a contract for yet for capacity in 2018, so we basically have no contribution there. I think there is reason to be optimistic to see that come back online. But more importantly, as you move from 2018 and beyond, Petra Nova is still not a significant contributor in 2018, but as that ramps up, we still expect that to contribute at least more meaningfully on a relative basis, albeit governed by what Mauricio indicated was lower volumes. More importantly, the Carlsbad Energy Center project, which still has actually a slight negative EBITDA contribution in 2018 as we complete that project, as you move into 2019 and beyond, you've got a pretty significant contribution there from that particular asset. In order of magnitude, to give you a sense, $80 million to $90 million of EBITDA run-rate basis once you get beyond 2018.

We just reflect the supply cost inherent in the market. Now obviously, there is a -- we've always said that these 2 businesses move countercyclical. That's why they're so complementary. And as you see commodity prices rise, we would expect some pressure on the Retail, but it is more than offset by the gains that you have on the Generation business."

Baseload generation allows us to have a lot of the credit synergies that we look for when you put these 2 businesses together. Our peaking facility provides us the flexibility to manage peak loads. So far, the load following or the mid-merit, we've been able to buy that from the market at very attractive economics. Right now, our -- we are very comfortable with acquisition.

A lot of the generation is going to be driven by our retail needs and how we grow retail, and a lot of our retail is going to be driven by where we have generation. So we are, right now, in the process of balancing the portfolio. And even without the GenOn assets and some of the conventional asset sales, we're still long generation in PJM. I mean we have a ways to go before we have a balanced portfolio, like we have in Texas. So we have a lot of room to grow in Retail.

So I don't think you can make a blank statement like that. What I have said in the past is our coal generation in Texas, I feel very comfortable with it given their size, the coal that they burn, which is PRB and the location in the grid and the environmental controls that they have. I mean, we feel very comfortable where they are right now. Clearly, the expected retirements that we've been talking for a while were announced. That has an impact on prices, but as I said, an impact but it's not enough to bring -- to justify newbuild economics. So if ERCOT falls below their target reserve margins, I think more needs to be done in the market to incentivize new generation to come back. But that's how I think about the -- our coal portfolio under these economics. I mean, somebody else is -- I think you can clearly see that these were uneconomic plants that were difficult to justify.

So there's a little bit of non-same-store on that basis between '17 and '18 where that's concerned. So some of that contributes to that. So basically, as we've said all along, in '17, even in the period of time when we are looking at our midpoint guidance, we've talked about being sort of setting the baseline, if you will, which is why we anchored that and looked forward. So we've never looked at the '17 to '18 numbers as a hockey stick, but there are some market recoveries.

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business. 
I'd like to start the call by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, we are on track to deliver on the Transformation Plan objectives we laid out earlier this year. For cost savings, we're actually ahead of our 2017 target through the third quarter of this year. Second, today, we're initiating 2018 financial guidance, which I am pleased to confirm is in line with the targets provided in our Transformation Plan. Third, we are seeing a number of positive catalysts in our core markets, from a recovery in ERCOT driven by asset retirements to multiple regulatory initiatives that highlight the urgency of reforming our power markets. This is certainly a time to be optimistic about competitive power. 
Now turning to our Transformation Plan update on Slide 5. We are making good progress across all areas. We are reaffirming our full cost savings and margin enhancement targets with a run rate of $855 million in recurring free cash flow accretion by 2020. Through the end of the third quarter, we have already realized $92 million in cost savings, which means we have achieved 142% of our target for 2017. And as I told you previously, we were hard at work identifying cost savings starting early in the year. This focus on continuous improvement have led to adjust that on our plan and has enabled us to realize some of our anticipated 2018 cost savings in 2017. 
In addition, we're currently putting in place the foundation needed to realize margin improvement starting next year. This includes everything from finalizing strategies for expanding and enhancing offerings for customers to streamlining transactions to enhancing our IT systems for more sophisticated customer analytics. Our asset sale process remains on track. We are reaffirming our total proceeds target of up to $4 billion, and we anticipate a vast majority of these proceeds to be announced in 2017. 
With respect to our Renewables business and our interest in NRG Yield, while this is very much an ongoing process, what I can tell you is that we are currently anticipating a 100% sale of this platform. We are pleased with the level of interest that our high-quality, unique assets and businesses have created from prospective buyers. These have allowed us to move to advanced stages in multiple processes, and we maintain the expectation of announcing significant transactions by the end of the year. But to be clear and consistent with our objective to maximize shareholder value, we will not compromise value for time with any of these transactions.  
On the capital allocation front, we remain focused on using excess cash to deleverage our business and position ourselves to take advantage of high-return opportunities in the future. Since our second quarter call, we have taken another $600 million of debt out of our capital structure, completing our 2017 capital allocation goal. 
Turning now to our third quarter results on Slide 6. We achieved $806 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which reflects the impacts of sustained mild weather in our core markets as well as Hurricane Harvey. As we have been tracking to the low end of the guidance coming into the summer, this result has led us to narrow and lower our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. I do want to take a moment, however, to acknowledge the strong results and outlook for our Retail business, which continues improving its operating efficiencies and customer acquisition and retention, offsetting some of the impacts of summer weather. 
Despite the disappointing quarter in terms of weather and wholesale pricing opportunities, we have still made significant progress on executing many key priorities. As we execute on our transformation, we have remained vigilant and focused on safety. For the quarter, we achieved a better-than-top-decile safety performance with 118 out of 128 facilities operating without a single recordable injury. This result is a testament to the safety culture embraced by every one of my colleagues at NRG. We also continue to execute on opportunities to quickly recycle capital through our partnership with NRG Yield, closing on a 38-megawatt solar portfolio for $71 million in cash proceeds and forming a new $50 million solar partnership. In addition, we are announcing today the offer of our 154-megawatt Buckthorn Solar assets to NRG Yield. 
Looking ahead to 2018, we are initiating adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Kirk will provide more details later in the presentation, but importantly, for the retained businesses, this guidance is in line with the targets provided in our Transformation Plan announcement this summer. This is despite removing several plants that were originally included in our 2018 Transformation Plan projections and lower-than-expected production from the oilfield associated with our Petra Nova project. 
Now turning to Slide 7 for a closer look at the key drivers this summer. We experienced very mild weather across the East and ERCOT, eliminating any opportunity for scarcity pricing. In Texas, we saw both a major hurricane and the coolest August since 2004 with cooling degree days 13% below normal. In the Northeast, cooling degree days were on average 8% below normal for July and August. This lack of weather resulted in very weak summer prices, as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. 
 
In ERCOT, real-time on-peak prices settled 43% below pre-summer expectations. But despite the absence of extreme weather this summit -- summer, ERCOT fundamentals remain strong. ERCOT's 2017 peak load of 69.5 gigawatts was up nearly 2% over the 5-year average and came in just shy of the 2016 peak. In terms of total consumption, we were flat to 2016 levels despite having the coolest August in 14 years, plus a major hurricane. 
And while, for our business, we say summer 2017 weather was mild, for many living along the Gulf Coast, it was devastating. Hurricane Harvey was an unprecedented storm. It was the wettest storm to ever hit the continental United States. In the face of this historic adversity, I could not be more proud of the way my colleagues responded. 
Turning to Slide 8. I want to take a moment to recognize the men and women of NRG who kept the lights on, supported each other and provided assistance to both our customers and impacted communities during a time of need. First and foremost, safety is always the primary concern, and I am pleased to report we had no safety incidents at our plants or in our corporate offices during the storm. But beyond safety, our employees showed great concern for their communities, engaging with first responders and community assistance programs to be on the ground, helping with services such as on-site emergency power supply. And Reliant, our flagship retail business in Texas, went above and beyond, demonstrating leadership by being the first retailer to offer customer relief programs. 
We were as prepared as we could be for Hurricane Harvey. Our baseload generation maintained 80% availability during the worst of the storm, a testament to the resiliency and reliability of our portfolio. Today, we're back to 95% availability across all of our Gulf generation. Currently, only 2 of our plants are offline, and we're actively assessing impacts and determining our return-to-service strategy. 
On the Retail side, I did speak about 4% of our customers were without power, and today, power has been restored to nearly all of our customers. Between our 2 businesses, we estimate the financial impacts of the storm and related weather to be about $40 million in 2017. As we continue to assess the situation, we will provide you with any necessary updates. Once again, I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone across the organization for their commitment to safety, their focus on building resilient operations and their support for affected communities in the days and weeks following the storm. 
Looking forward, we have many reasons to be excited about the markets, as outlined on Slide 9. In ERCOT, the recently announced retirement of over 4 gigawatts of generating capacity puts further pressure on a market with already steady, strong fundamentals. For summer of 2018, these known retirements and asset delays alone will put ERCOT at the lowest reserve margin on record, which is expected to be somewhere between 10% and 11%. Other changes such as delay in newbuilds and new industrial demand could lower this number even further. 
The tightening of the ERCOT market is something that we have been anticipating for quite some time. Just on our last earnings call, we were estimating reserve margins to close -- of close to 11%, which now has become a reality. We are encouraged to see that other generators in the market are being disciplined 
[Audio Gap] 
uneconomic assets as we have done in the past. And while news of these retirements during the past several weeks has increased power prices, it is important to note that these prices are still below what is needed to justify newbuild economics. 
Now while these retirements are important in improving market health, ERCOT must do more to strengthen markets and should recognize the locational value of power plants. We have already provided a set of recommendations that would improve the pricing for generators in locations where power is needed. Reliability and resiliency are important attributes to the grid, and we will continue to work with ERCOT to ensure generators close to load centers are compensated for all the benefits they provide. 
Beyond these positive developments in the ERCOT market, we are seeing several other calls to action for market reform. As the power grid continues to undergo significant change, low gas prices, renewable penetration and attempts for out-of-market subsidy for uneconomic generation, regulatory bodies and other stakeholders are taking note. This has led to several significant potential catalysts. From the DOE staff report of competitive markets and NOPR to PJM's proposed market reforms, I cannot recall another time where there has been such urgency and reach across ISOs to improve competitive energy markets. We will continue our vocal advocacy against out-of-market subsidies for existing uneconomic generation and for market-based solutions that recognize all the services that generators provide: energy, capacity, reliability and resiliency. 
 And with that, I will turn things over to Kirk for a financial review."
413857,540727310,1329954,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $806 million in adjusted EBITDA and $599 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Generation and Renewables co",1162,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $806 million in adjusted EBITDA and $599 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Generation and Renewables contributed $265 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail and Yield delivered $276 million and $265 million, respectively. Our results for the quarter reflect the impact of mild weather as well as Hurricane Harvey. 
In the latter case, as the sustained heavy winds and lower temperatures led to below-normal load for our Retail business, the resulting revenue impact, combined with losses experienced from unwinding hedges and depressed real-time prices, contributed to lower-than-expected Retail results for the quarter. Although our Houston baseload assets weathered the storm admirably, our wholesale business was also impacted by outages and associated loss margin resulting from flooding across the region, including in particular our Cottonwood facility, which has since returned to service. 
Finally, our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing or BETM business underperformed for the quarter, further contributing to results which came in below expectations. Prior to the summer, although our Retail outlook had been trending above the range, our reduced expectations for wholesale more than offset this, and as I indicated in our second quarter call, our expectations for the balance of the year at that time placed us at the lower end of our consolidated guidance.  
Now factoring in the impact of the third quarter events I just reviewed, our outlook for 2017 is now approximately  $115 million  (sic) [ $165 million ]  below the low end of our previous EBITDA guidance range. As a result, we are now reducing and narrowing our 2017 guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Our revised consolidated free cash flow guidance range is now $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion while revised NRG-level free cash flow guidance is now $755 million to $855 million. We do not expect the contributing factors to our reduced guidance for 2017 to be recurring, and they do not impact our outlook and guidance for 2018, which I'll review in a moment. 
Immediately following the quarter end, we redeemed the remaining balances of our 2018 and 2021 unsecured notes, further reducing corporate debt, extending our nearest maturity to 2022 and capturing nearly $50 million in incremental annual cash interest savings. These redemptions also represent the completion of our 2017 capital allocation plan and place us on track to achieving our leverage ratio target announced as part of the Transformation Plan. Finally, on November 1, we closed on the sale to NRG Yield of a 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility-scale solar assets, which are not part of the ROFO agreement, for $71 million, increasing 2017 capital available for allocation. 
Turning next to 2018 guidance on Slide 12. Although, as Mauricio indicated, we remain on track to announce most of our targeted divestitures by year-end, we will continue to include those assets and businesses in our consolidated results and guidance until that process concludes. For 2018, we expect $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with $950 million to $1.05 billion from Generation and Renewables; $900 million to $1 billion from Retail, which includes $30 million of margin improvements from the Transformation Plan; and $950 million from NRG Yield. Our 2018 consolidated free cash flow guidance is $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion, with $1.170 billion to $1.370 billion at the NRG level. 
In order to provide a pro forma view of 2018 based on midpoint guidance and moving from left to right in the table, we deduct the 2018 impact to consolidated guidance associated with divestitures, which is comprised of approximately $1.4 billion in EBITDA, $670 million in consolidated free cash flow and $290 million in NRG-level free cash flow. These 2018 divestiture impact numbers differ slightly from those used in the pro forma walk we provided as a part of the Transformation Plan, which were then based on 2017 numbers. 
The final column provides an implied pro forma view of 2018 results based on midpoint guidance and assuming asset sales, including 100% of Yield and Renewables, all take place as of January 1. On a pro forma basis, implied midpoint retained asset EBITDA is approximately $1.5 billion, with nearly $1 billion of free cash flow. These numbers also reflect the impact of our 2017 transformation targets, including achieving $500 million of cost savings, $30 million of margin improvement and $85 million of additional working capital efficiency. Importantly, pro forma cash balances are also, of course, further improved by up to $4 billion in expected asset sale proceeds. Beyond 2018, we expect nearly $300 million of additional upside from the full run rate of the Transformation Plan benefits as cost savings grow from $500 million in 2018 to the full $590 million by 2020 and margin improvements further expand from $30 million in 2018 to $215 million by 2020. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level [ capital allocation ],  with changes since the prior quarter highlighted in blue. Our updated 2017 capital available for allocation of $1.3 billion now reflects the proceeds received from the closing of the 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility solar assets to NRG Yield as well as the $165 million reduction in the midpoint 2017 NRG-level free cash flow before growth guidance. 
Turning to the GenOn settlement capital. As the GenOn noteholders on October 30 entered into and filed the consent agreement extending the effective date milestones to as late as September 30, 2018, we now expect GenOn to emerge from bankruptcy in 2018. However, we will continue to reserve for the GenOn settlement payment next year upon emergence. In parallel with the milestone extension, NRG and GenOn also reached agreement on a settlement term sheet in an effort to resolve certain open issues from the original RSA. With our corporate debt reduction now complete with the redemption of the 2018 and '21 notes, we've revised the debt reduction number up slightly to reflect the principal balance of the '21 notes actually repaid versus the $200 million delevering placeholder in our previous disclosure, and we expect approximately $70 million of excess capital at year-end 2017. 
To complete the financial review, Slide 14 provides an update on our corporate credit metrics for both 2017 and 2018. Based on our revised guidance for 2017, we expect a 2017 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 4.3x. Turning to 2018 and taking into account our implied midpoint pro forma EBITDA post asset sales, which includes, again, the benefit of both cost savings and margin enhancements, and taking into account the $640 million of additional debt reduction due to divestitures, which was previously disclosed as a part of the Transformation Plan, places us on track to achieve our net-debt-to-EBITDA target ratio of 3x with significant surplus capital for allocation from asset sale proceeds. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

We have made significant progress across all the goals we set for the organization. We remain focused on delivering results and executing on the Transformation Plan. We have exceeded our 2017 targeted cost savings and continue to reduce our debt profile in order to achieve our corporate credit metrics. As we continue to work diligently through the asset sales process, I look forward to providing you with further detail on sale announcements upon reaching agreement. 
We also continue to make good progress on GenOn. We have worked with GenOn to resolve open issues in the restructuring support agreement, which were detailed in the summary term sheet filed in our 8-K this week. This includes items such as the timing and nature of transition services, the treatment of NRG's Canal 3 project and other post-employment benefit obligations. We expect these terms will be finalizing the plan confirmation on November 13 and will set the path forward for GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy. 
On a final note, I promised all of you that we would provide a more robust plan and opportunity for strategic discussion through an Analyst Day. We are planning to hold that Analyst Day in March of 2018, where we will provide you with an update on our Transformation Plan progress, updated financials, as well as details around the strategic direction of our business.

So we will certainly continue to monitor that. We've got some near-term callable debt. So I think our approach to the leverage side of the balance sheet is going to be a balance of, obviously, first and foremost, maintaining that 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio, but in the process, I'm a big believer in, obviously, interest savings on accretive or NPV-positive basis, in addition to maturity extension. So I think you'd see us looking at that pretty closely, I think, at or around the bond levels that are trading right now, especially on the longest-dated maturities, which is the best barometer for where we could refinance at a long-term rate. We are at or even slightly ahead of what would be an implied accretive transaction. So I think that is certainly not beyond the realm of possibility, and we'll continue to monitor that closely to sort of blend in that opportunistic refinancing and maturity extension, which is driving this balance sheet ratios to where we want them to be."

But what I will tell you is, right now, I cannot think of any more compelling investment than our own stock given the Transformation Plan that we have laid out. But again, I think it's -- we need to go through our priorities. First and foremost is have the capital then get to our credit metrics and then we can start talking about allocating capital."

And obviously, I think, directionally, just focusing on the midpoint, you're correct, but a few things are true. One, in 2018, as Mauricio mentioned, there's a few assets that are still offline. It remains to be seen what we do with those. We mentioned in particular Greens Bayou and Gregory. In addition, our Encina plant, which we don't have a contract for yet for capacity in 2018, so we basically have no contribution there. I think there is reason to be optimistic to see that come back online. But more importantly, as you move from 2018 and beyond, Petra Nova is still not a significant contributor in 2018, but as that ramps up, we still expect that to contribute at least more meaningfully on a relative basis, albeit governed by what Mauricio indicated was lower volumes. More importantly, the Carlsbad Energy Center project, which still has actually a slight negative EBITDA contribution in 2018 as we complete that project, as you move into 2019 and beyond, you've got a pretty significant contribution there from that particular asset. In order of magnitude, to give you a sense, $80 million to $90 million of EBITDA run-rate basis once you get beyond 2018. So that's the reason we're sort of looking for that $1.845 billion as a target for full Transformation Plan and full achievement of some of those assets, in particular Carlsbad, still coming online."

And our portfolio is very close to low pockets around the Houston area, so it already carries an inherent locational value that we have been very vocal to ERCOT that they need to recognize.

If you look at the hedges -- the hedge disclosures that we have put in the appendix, we are now -- we have now pivoted to where we're significantly open in 2019 and beyond, and that has been on purpose. We were expecting a tightening in market. We've been talking about asset retirements. We've been talking about the load growth that we have seen and the potential delays of new generation. So we actually have positioned the portfolio very favorable -- favorably to benefit from these strong fundamentals that we're seeing. On the Retail side, while you are correct, in the short term, in terms of some of our customers and the short position, keep in mind that we don't necessarily run a short position in Retail. For any [ sign load ] that we have, we have generation. We back to back it. It's about retail margins. We don't speculate the commodity market with our Retail business. As you move out, when you have on-price load but expected load, we have the opportunity to pass whatever is the cost and the prices to customers, just like any other retailer do, so we don't necessarily harm our competitiveness in the market. We just reflect the supply costs inherent in the market. Now obviously, there is a -- we've always said that these 2 businesses move countercyclical. That's why they're so complementary. And as you see commodity prices rise, we would expect some pressure on the Retail, but it is more than offset by the gains that you have on the Generation business."

What I will tell you is that they were a very wide array of -- we really attracted a number -- a very wide array of buyers in the process, but that's as much as I can disclose for you, Ali, at this point. 
And thank you, all of you, for your interest in NRG, and I look forward to talking to you when we have more information about the asset sales process. Thank you."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business",1752,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business. 
I'd like to start the call by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, we are on track to deliver on the Transformation Plan objectives we laid out earlier this year. For cost savings, we're actually ahead of our 2017 target through the third quarter of this year. Second, today, we're initiating 2018 financial guidance, which I am pleased to confirm is in line with the targets provided in our Transformation Plan. Third, we are seeing a number of positive catalysts in our core markets, from a recovery in ERCOT driven by asset retirements to multiple regulatory initiatives that highlight the urgency of reforming our power markets. This is certainly a time to be optimistic about competitive power. 
Now turning to our Transformation Plan update on Slide 5. We are making good progress across all areas. We are reaffirming our full cost savings and margin enhancement targets with a run rate of $855 million in recurring free cash flow accretion by 2020. Through the end of the third quarter, we have already realized $92 million in cost savings, which means we have achieved 142% of our target for 2017. And as I told you previously, we were hard at work identifying cost savings starting early in the year. This focus on continuous improvement have led to adjust that on our plan and has enabled us to realize some of our anticipated 2018 cost savings in 2017. 
In addition, we're currently putting in place the foundation needed to realize margin improvement starting next year. This includes everything from finalizing strategies for expanding and enhancing offerings for customers to streamlining transactions to enhancing our IT systems for more sophisticated customer analytics. Our asset sale process remains on track. We are reaffirming our total proceeds target of up to $4 billion, and we anticipate a vast majority of these proceeds to be announced in 2017. 
With respect to our Renewables business and our interest in NRG Yield, while this is very much an ongoing process, what I can tell you is that we are currently anticipating a 100% sale of this platform. We are pleased with the level of interest that our high-quality, unique assets and businesses have created from prospective buyers. These have allowed us to move to advanced stages in multiple processes, and we maintain the expectation of announcing significant transactions by the end of the year. But to be clear and consistent with our objective to maximize shareholder value, we will not compromise value for time with any of these transactions. 
On the capital allocation front, we remain focused on using excess cash to deleverage our business and position ourselves to take advantage of high-return opportunities in the future. Since our second quarter call, we have taken another $600 million of debt out of our capital structure, completing our 2017 capital allocation goal. 
Turning now to our third quarter results on Slide 6. We achieved $806 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which reflects the impacts of sustained mild weather in our core markets as well as Hurricane Harvey. As we have been tracking to the low end of the guidance coming into the summer, this result has led us to narrow and lower our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. I do want to take a moment, however, to acknowledge the strong results and outlook for our Retail business, which continues improving its operating efficiencies and customer acquisition and retention, offsetting some of the impacts of summer weather. 
Despite the disappointing quarter in terms of weather and wholesale pricing opportunities, we have still made significant progress on executing many key priorities. As we execute on our transformation, we have remained vigilant and focused on safety. For the quarter, we achieved a better-than-top-decile safety performance with 118 out of 128 facilities operating without a single recordable injury. This result is a testament to the safety culture embraced by every one of my colleagues at NRG. We also continue to execute on opportunities to quickly recycle capital through our partnership with NRG Yield, closing on a 38-megawatt solar portfolio for $71 million in cash proceeds and forming a new $50 million solar partnership. In addition, we are announcing today the offer of our 154-megawatt Buckthorn Solar assets to NRG Yield. 
Looking ahead to 2018, we are initiating adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Kirk will provide more details later in the presentation, but importantly, for the retained businesses, this guidance is in line with the targets provided in our Transformation Plan announcement this summer. This is despite removing several plants that were originally included in our 2018 Transformation Plan projections and lower-than-expected production from the oilfield associated with our Petra Nova project. 
Now turning to Slide 7 for a closer look at the key drivers this summer. We experienced very mild weather across the East and ERCOT, eliminating any opportunity for scarcity pricing. In Texas, we saw both a major hurricane and the coolest August since 2004 with cooling degree days 13% below normal. In the Northeast, cooling degree days were on average 8% below normal for July and August. This lack of weather resulted in very weak summer prices, as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. 
 
In ERCOT, real-time on-peak prices settled 43% below pre-summer expectations. But despite the absence of extreme weather this summit -- summer, ERCOT fundamentals remain strong. ERCOT's 2017 peak load of 69.5 gigawatts was up nearly 2% over the 5-year average and came in just shy of the 2016 peak. In terms of total consumption, we were flat to 2016 levels despite having the coolest August in 14 years, plus a major hurricane. 
And while, for our business, we say summer 2017 weather was mild, for many living along the Gulf Coast, it was devastating. Hurricane Harvey was an unprecedented storm. It was the wettest storm to ever hit the continental United States. In the face of this historic adversity, I could not be more proud of the way my colleagues responded. 
Turning to Slide 8. I want to take a moment to recognize the men and women of NRG who kept the lights on, supported each other and provided assistance to both our customers and impacted communities during a time of need. First and foremost, safety is always the primary concern, and I am pleased to report we had no safety incidents at our plants or in our corporate offices during the storm. But beyond safety, our employees showed great concern for their communities, engaging with first responders and community assistance programs to be on the ground, helping with services such as on-site emergency power supply. And Reliant, our flagship retail business in Texas, went above and beyond, demonstrating leadership by being the first retailer to offer customer relief programs. 
We were as prepared as we could be for Hurricane Harvey. Our baseload generation maintained 80% availability during the worst of the storm, a testament to the resiliency and reliability of our portfolio. Today, we're back to 95% availability across all of our Gulf generation. Currently, only 2 of our plants are offline, and we're actively assessing impacts and determining our return-to-service strategy. 
On the Retail side, I did speak about 4% of our customers were without power, and today, power has been restored to nearly all of our customers. Between our 2 businesses, we estimate the financial impacts of the storm and related weather to be about $40 million in 2017. As we continue to assess the situation, we will provide you with any necessary updates. Once again, I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone across the organization for their commitment to safety, their focus on building resilient operations and their support for affected communities in the days and weeks following the storm. 
Looking forward, we have many reasons to be excited about the markets, as outlined on Slide 9. In ERCOT, the recently announced retirement of over 4 gigawatts of generating capacity puts further pressure on a market with already steady, strong fundamentals. For summer of 2018, these known retirements and asset delays alone will put ERCOT at the lowest reserve margin on record, which is expected to be somewhere between 10% and 11%. Other changes such as delay in newbuilds and new industrial demand could lower this number even further. 
The tightening of the ERCOT market is something that we have been anticipating for quite some time. Just on our last earnings call, we were estimating reserve margins to close -- of close to 11%, which now has become a reality. We are encouraged to see that other generators in the market are being disciplined 
[Audio Gap] 
uneconomic assets as we have done in the past. And while news of these retirements during the past several weeks has increased power prices, it is important to note that these prices are still below what is needed to justify newbuild economics. 
Now while these retirements are important in improving market health, ERCOT must do more to strengthen markets and should recognize the locational value of power plants. We have already provided a set of recommendations that would improve the pricing for generators in locations where power is needed. Reliability and resiliency are important attributes to the grid, and we will continue to work with ERCOT to ensure generators close to load centers are compensated for all the benefits they provide. 
Beyond these positive developments in the ERCOT market, we are seeing several other calls to action for market reform. As the power grid continues to undergo significant change, low gas prices, renewable penetration and attempts for out-of-market subsidy for uneconomic generation, regulatory bodies and other stakeholders are taking note. This has led to several significant potential catalysts. From the DOE staff report of competitive markets and NOPR to PJM's proposed market reforms, I cannot recall another time where there has been such urgency and reach across ISOs to improve competitive energy markets. We will continue our vocal advocacy against out-of-market subsidies for existing uneconomic generation and for market-based solutions that recognize all the services that generators provide: energy, capacity, reliability and resiliency. 
 And with that, I will turn things over to Kirk for a financial review."
413857,540727310,1332999,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $806 million in adjusted EBITDA and $599 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Generation and Renewables co",1162,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 11. For the third quarter, NRG delivered $806 million in adjusted EBITDA and $599 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Generation and Renewables contributed $265 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail and Yield delivered $276 million and $265 million, respectively. Our results for the quarter reflect the impact of mild weather as well as Hurricane Harvey. 
In the latter case, as the sustained heavy winds and lower temperatures led to below-normal load for our Retail business, the resulting revenue impact, combined with losses experienced from unwinding hedges and depressed real-time prices, contributed to lower-than-expected Retail results for the quarter. Although our Houston baseload assets weathered the storm admirably, our wholesale business was also impacted by outages and associated loss margin resulting from flooding across the region, including in particular our Cottonwood facility, which has since returned to service. 
Finally, our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing or BETM business underperformed for the quarter, further contributing to results which came in below expectations. Prior to the summer, although our Retail outlook had been trending above the range, our reduced expectations for wholesale more than offset this, and as I indicated in our second quarter call, our expectations for the balance of the year at that time placed us at the lower end of our consolidated guidance. 
Now factoring in the impact of the third quarter events I just reviewed, our outlook for 2017 is now approximately $115 million (sic) [ $165 million ] below the low end of our previous EBITDA guidance range. As a result, we are now reducing and narrowing our 2017 guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Our revised consolidated free cash flow guidance range is now $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion while revised NRG-level free cash flow guidance is now $755 million to $855 million. We do not expect the contributing factors to our reduced guidance for 2017 to be recurring, and they do not impact our outlook and guidance for 2018, which I'll review in a moment. 
Immediately following the quarter end, we redeemed the remaining balances of our 2018 and 2021 unsecured notes, further reducing corporate debt, extending our nearest maturity to 2022 and capturing nearly $50 million in incremental annual cash interest savings. These redemptions also represent the completion of our 2017 capital allocation plan and place us on track to achieving our leverage ratio target announced as part of the Transformation Plan. Finally, on November 1, we closed on the sale to NRG Yield of a 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility-scale solar assets, which are not part of the ROFO agreement, for $71 million, increasing 2017 capital available for allocation. 
Turning next to 2018 guidance on Slide 12. Although, as Mauricio indicated, we remain on track to announce most of our targeted divestitures by year-end, we will continue to include those assets and businesses in our consolidated results and guidance until that process concludes. For 2018, we expect $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with $950 million to $1.05 billion from Generation and Renewables; $900 million to $1 billion from Retail, which includes $30 million of margin improvements from the Transformation Plan; and $950 million from NRG Yield. Our 2018 consolidated free cash flow guidance is $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion, with $1.170 billion to $1.370 billion at the NRG level. 
In order to provide a pro forma view of 2018 based on midpoint guidance and moving from left to right in the table, we deduct the 2018 impact to consolidated guidance associated with divestitures, which is comprised of approximately $1.4 billion in EBITDA, $670 million in consolidated free cash flow and $290 million in NRG-level free cash flow. These 2018 divestiture impact numbers differ slightly from those used in the pro forma walk we provided as a part of the Transformation Plan, which were then based on 2017 numbers. 
The final column provides an implied pro forma view of 2018 results based on midpoint guidance and assuming asset sales, including 100% of Yield and Renewables, all take place as of January 1. On a pro forma basis, implied midpoint retained asset EBITDA is approximately $1.5 billion, with nearly $1 billion of free cash flow. These numbers also reflect the impact of our 2017 transformation targets, including achieving $500 million of cost savings, $30 million of margin improvement and $85 million of additional working capital efficiency. Importantly, pro forma cash balances are also, of course, further improved by up to $4 billion in expected asset sale proceeds. Beyond 2018, we expect nearly $300 million of additional upside from the full run rate of the Transformation Plan benefits as cost savings grow from $500 million in 2018 to the full $590 million by 2020 and margin improvements further expand from $30 million in 2018 to $215 million by 2020. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level [ capital allocation ], with changes since the prior quarter highlighted in blue. Our updated 2017 capital available for allocation of $1.3 billion now reflects the proceeds received from the closing of the 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility solar assets to NRG Yield as well as the $165 million reduction in the midpoint 2017 NRG-level free cash flow before growth guidance. 
Turning to the GenOn settlement capital. As the GenOn noteholders on October 30 entered into and filed the consent agreement extending the effective date milestones to as late as September 30, 2018, we now expect GenOn to emerge from bankruptcy in 2018. However, we will continue to reserve for the GenOn settlement payment next year upon emergence. In parallel with the milestone extension, NRG and GenOn also reached agreement on a settlement term sheet in an effort to resolve certain open issues from the original RSA. With our corporate debt reduction now complete with the redemption of the 2018 and '21 notes, we've revised the debt reduction number up slightly to reflect the principal balance of the '21 notes actually repaid versus the $200 million delevering placeholder in our previous disclosure, and we expect approximately $70 million of excess capital at year-end 2017. 
To complete the financial review, Slide 14 provides an update on our corporate credit metrics for both 2017 and 2018. Based on our revised guidance for 2017, we expect a 2017 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 4.3x. Turning to 2018 and taking into account our implied midpoint pro forma EBITDA post asset sales, which includes, again, the benefit of both cost savings and margin enhancements, and taking into account the $640 million of additional debt reduction due to divestitures, which was previously disclosed as a part of the Transformation Plan, places us on track to achieve our net-debt-to-EBITDA target ratio of 3x with significant surplus capital for allocation from asset sale proceeds. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks."

As we continue to work diligently through the asset sales process, I look forward to providing you with further detail on sale announcements upon reaching agreement. 
We also continue to make good progress on GenOn. We have worked with GenOn to resolve open issues in the restructuring support agreement, which were detailed in the summary term sheet filed in our 8-K this week. This includes items such as the timing and nature of transition services, the treatment of NRG's Canal 3 project and other post-employment benefit obligations. We expect these terms will be finalizing the plan confirmation on November 13 and will set the path forward for GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy. 
On a final note, I promised all of you that we would provide a more robust plan and opportunity for strategic discussion through an Analyst Day. We are planning to hold that Analyst Day in March of 2018, where we will provide you with an update on our Transformation Plan progress, updated financials as well as details around the strategic direction of our business.

We are always mindful in monitoring the trading levels on the bonds and the high-yield market.

So we will certainly continue to monitor that. We've got some near-term callable debt. So I think our approach to the leverage side of the balance sheet is going to be a balance of, obviously, first and foremost, maintaining that 3x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio, but in the process, I'm a big believer in, obviously, interest savings on accretive or NPV-positive basis, in addition to maturity extension. So I think you'd see us looking at that pretty closely, I think, at or around the bond levels that are trading right now, especially on the longest-dated maturities, which is the best barometer for where we could refinance at a long-term rate. We are at or even slightly ahead of what would be an implied accretive transaction. So I think that is certainly not beyond the realm of possibility, and we'll continue to monitor that closely to sort of blend in that opportunistic refinancing and maturity extension, which is driving this balance sheet ratios to where we want them to be."

It remains to be seen what we do with those. We mentioned in particular Greens Bayou and Gregory. In addition, our Encina plant, which we don't have a contract for yet for capacity in 2018, so we basically have no contribution there. I think there is reason to be optimistic to see that come back online. But more importantly, as you move from 2018 and beyond, Petra Nova is still not a significant contributor in 2018, but as that ramps up, we still expect that to contribute at least more meaningfully on a relative basis, albeit governed by what Mauricio indicated was lower volumes. More importantly, the Carlsbad Energy Center project, which still has actually a slight negative EBITDA contribution in 2018 as we complete that project, as you move into 2019 and beyond, you've got a pretty significant contribution there from that particular asset. In order of magnitude, to give you a sense, $80 million to $90 million of EBITDA run-rate basis once you get beyond 2018.

We were expecting a tightening in market. We've been talking about asset retirements. We've been talking about the load growth that we have seen and the potential delays of new generation. So we actually have positioned the portfolio very favorable -- favorably to benefit from these strong fundamentals that we're seeing.

For any [ sign load ] that we have, we have generation. We back to back it. It's about retail margins. We don't speculate the commodity market with our Retail business. As you move out, when you have on-price load but expected load, we have the opportunity to pass whatever is the cost and the prices to customers, just like any other retailer do, so we don't necessarily harm our competitiveness in the market. We just reflect the supply costs inherent in the market. Now obviously, there is a -- we've always said that these 2 businesses move countercyclical. That's why they're so complementary.

With the big move in on-peak prices after recent coal plant retirement announcements, is that move enough to bring coal plants back into free cash flow breakeven? Or when you look at the market today with the big move in prices, are coal plants in the market still struggling to have cash flow breakeven?"

I don't think you can paint with a broad brush and just say coal plants, generic, how is their economics. I mean, it has to do with where they are located in the grid, what type of coal they burn, what is their environmental profile, do they have environmental controls already in place or not, what are the rules that are coming down the pipe. So I don't think you can make a blank statement like that. What I have said in the past is our coal generation in Texas, I feel very comfortable with it given their size, the coal that they burn, which is PRB and the location in the grid and the environmental controls that they have. I mean, we feel very comfortable where they are right now. Clearly, the expected retirements that we've been talking for a while were announced. That has an impact on prices, but as I said, an impact but it's not enough to bring -- to justify newbuild economics. So if ERCOT falls below their target reserve margins, I think more needs to be done in the market to incentivize new generation to come back. But that's how I think about the -- our coal portfolio under these economics. I mean, somebody else is -- I think you can clearly see that these were uneconomic plants that were difficult to justify. And I -- we're just encouraged in that they're behaving -- they're taking uneconomic generation out of the market and behaving rationally."

First off, when I look at your retail guidance for '18, and as you pointed out, there's a very small component of margin enhancement. I believe only $32 million or so. So if I exclude that, the underlying Retail EBITDA for '18 is probably the highest that I've ever seen certainly in the last 5 years, maybe longer. What's causing that number to be so high in '18?"

Ali, it's Kirk. There's some puts and takes. Some of that was in what I responded to with Steve on the call earlier with Gregory, which was certainly a part, and Greens Bayou, et cetera, in '17, that currently, we have 0 EBITDA for those 2 plants that are currently offline as well as the Encina plant not having any, at least, EBITDA baked into our guidance on the base of we don't currently have a capacity contract there. So there's a little bit of non-same-store on that basis between '17 and '18 where that's concerned. So some of that contributes to that. So basically, as we've said all along, in '17, even in the period of time when we are looking at our midpoint guidance, we talked about being sort of setting the baseline, if you will, which is why we anchored that and looked forward. So we've never looked at the '17 to '18 numbers as a hockey stick, but there are some market recoveries. There's certainly the cost improvements that contribute to that, and then, as I said before, there's a few elements namely around the plant side where we don't have the same contribution on an EBITDA basis. So it's a combination of those elements."
