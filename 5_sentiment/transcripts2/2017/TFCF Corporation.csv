91031,418071694,1124871,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2017",2017-02-06,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone from Houston, where last night, we were privileged to witness a brilliant Super Bowl telecast, beautifully produced and expertly delivered by Eric Shanks and his team at FOX Sports. I want to thank the literally",789,"Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone from Houston, where last night, we were privileged to witness a brilliant Super Bowl telecast, beautifully produced and expertly delivered by Eric Shanks and his team at FOX Sports. I want to thank the literally thousands of FOX Sports staff who brought us this amazing game. 
This single game is a great example of the strength of live sports, increasingly delivered across multiple platforms, the power of our core brands aligned with our ability to cross promote them and the continued value broadcast television delivers to the world's leading marketers. And yesterday, the Super Bowl powered FOX's first [ph] $0.5 billion revenue day and that's something that [ph] made Mr. Nallen very happy.
Of course that revenue falls in the third quarter, but for the second quarter, we're pleased to have delivered another strong result, both from an operational and financial standpoint, as evidenced by the 15% EBITDA growth and 20% adjusted EPS growth that we have just reported. Importantly, this growth was broad-based with earnings gains in all of our operating segments, including strong double-digit increases in both Film and Television.
Core to our overarching long-term strategy is our steady focus on building the value of our video brands. That means partnering with the best creators and investing in the highest quality storytelling, the best journalism and premium sports rights to ensure our video experiences are vital for any consumer offering, established or emerging.
Testament to the progress we have made is our ability to again but [ph] to the broader industry trend of multichannel subscriber declines. In fact, this last quarter, we grew our cumulative domestic subscribers by 1.5% over last year's level on the back of subscriber additions at our younger channels, including FXX, the FOX Business Network, the National Geographic Channels and FOX Sports 1.
Our momentum underscores the strength of our brands across categories and genres, be it sports, news or entertainment, both scripted and nonscripted. The investments we have made to bolster our leadership in these areas are paying dividends.
We've been saying this for a while, but actions and outcomes speak louder than words. Clear and demonstrable evidence of the value we built is the meaningful affiliate renewals we recently achieved for our RSNs and Fox News with one of the nation's largest MSOs. We completed an agreement at the end of December, which delivered on the objectives we sought out. As part of a deal, this MSO will receive TV Everywhere rights across our entire RSN portfolio for the first time, a huge benefit to their subscribers and our passionate viewers.
In addition, our full suite of brands was included in DirecTV Now's November launch, and we expect the full suite to be included in the wave of emergent DMVPD services, including as previously announced, Hulu's live and on-demand service, which launches in the next couple of months.
These agreements with both established distributors and new entrants move us forward on another [ph] strategic priority, driving a more compelling user experience for our customers. This is one of the key strategic pillars behind the agreement we announced in December to acquire the 61% [ph] of Sky we do not already own. A combination of our 2 companies will give us leading direct-to-consumer capabilities and technologies while enhancing [ph] our sports and entertainment scale.
The Sky transaction will also deliver more balanced revenue streams and geographic spread. It further simplifies our structure and operating model. And in terms of the financial rationale, it is significantly accretive to our core earnings per share and our free cash flow.
As a founding shareholder of Sky, we are proud to have participated in its growth and development. Its transformation over the past 25 years into Europe's leading entertainment business has been extraordinary. We believe this transaction is the highest and most effective use of our capital to deliver shareholder value and returns over the long term.
Now before I hand it over to John for a financial review, I'm going to -- I want to conclude with some recent remarks on our cable news business.
On our last call, I noted the strength of Fox News. That strength has continued unabated. Fox News 2016  [ph] as the most-watched cable network and achieved its highest rated year in history. Postelection, Fox News is continuing to beat CNN and MSNBC combined. Adding to this strength is year-over-year growth in the important 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. time slots following recent programming changes. All of this underscores the underlying strength of the Fox News brand, the enduring power of its positioning and the continued loyalty of its viewers.
With that, I'd like to hand it over to John for his financial review."
91031,418071694,1124871,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2017",2017-02-06,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported another good quarter of financial results highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Our EBITDA growth was delivered across all of our business segments, with p",823,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported another good quarter of financial results highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Our EBITDA growth was delivered across all of our business segments, with particular strength reported at the Television and Film segments.
Second quarter revenues increased $307 million or 4% to $7.68 billion led by growth at both the Cable Network and Television segments, partially offset by slightly lower revenues reported in the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.99 billion, a record for any quarter, and a 15% increase from the prior year, reflecting double-digit growth at our Television and Film segments and continued good growth at our Cable segment.
This quarter's results include a $44 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency rates. And absent this impact, our overall EBITDA growth rate was 18%.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $857 million or $0.46 per share. Excluding the net income effect in both years of other net and of equity earnings adjustments at Sky and the Endemol Shine Group, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.53, which is a 20% increase over the comparable $0.44 reported a year ago.
So with that, I'll provide some additional comments on the performance of our operating segments for the second quarter, starting with the Cable Networks segment, where EBITDA of $1.33 billion was up 6% on revenue growth of 7%. Total Cable Networks expense growth was 8%, which includes a 2 percentage point increase from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners.
Domestic Cable revenues increased 10% in the aggregate, led by advertising increases of 12% and affiliate fee growth of 7%. Ad revenues continue to benefit from the ratings strength of Fox News as well as strong ratings and pricing grow at FS1, driven by Major League Baseball postseason and from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners, which added 2 percentage points to the ad growth. The affiliate fee increase primarily reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and continued growth at our expanding networks.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 12% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by increased Major League Baseball costs at FS1 and NBA costs at the RSNs and higher expenses from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners and the launch of our new programming initiative across the Nat Geo channels worldwide.
Second quarter reported international cable revenues grew 2%, driven by a 5% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 12% on a local currency basis. Advertising revenues declined 6% on a reported basis and 3% on a local currency basis versus the prior year. This primarily reflects an approximate $30 million decline at STAR's entertainment channels due principally to a negative impact from the demonetization policy implemented in India in early November, which meaningfully lowered overall market advertising spend. The marketing -- the market expects this dampening effect and disruption from the demonetization to substantially abate within another month or so as new Indian fiscal years commence.
Reported international EBITDA contributions decreased 13%, primarily due to the lower advertising revenues at STAR and a 9% impact from negative foreign exchange movements.
At our Television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $376 million, a 35% over last year, driven by increased revenues. We had strong advertising growth from a very successful broadcast of the World Series, which benefited from 2 additional games and viewership levels not seen in 2 decades and higher political advertising at the station. We also had continued double-digit retransmission consent revenue growth. And additionally, the stations generated incremental revenues from permitting the use of some spectrum in one of our markets. These total revenue gains were partially offset by higher sports and entertainment programming expenses of the network as well as higher promotion costs from the launch of new series.
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA of $389 million was $87 million higher than last year. This increase was primarily driven by lower marketing costs in the current year due to fewer theatrical releases versus last year. Additionally, revenues in the quarter were 4% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the difficult comparison against last year's worldwide theatrical performance of The Martian. It's worth noting that while we reported very strong fiscal year-to-date earnings in the segment, the comparisons become much more challenging in the second half of the fiscal year. In the next 2 quarters, for example, we will be comping against last year's very successful releases of Deadpool in theatrical and The Martian in home entertainment.
Shifting over to capital management, during the quarter, we purchased $132 million of FOXA shares, leaving our outstanding authorization of roughly $3.1 billion. And also, in the quarter, we issued $850 million of new debt and repaid $400 million in maturities. And now let me turn it over to James."

And so as you've heard and seen, the first half of the fiscal year has been a good one and the outlook for the next few quarters and years is also encouraging.
Now as noted, it seems an opportune time to talk a little bit about U.S. sports. It was a key driver in the quarter, and it's emblematic of our broader strategy around big brands and making investments in the programming that matters the most for our customers.
The MLB postseason was strong. The seventh game of the World Series was the most watched baseball game in a quarter century, while the National League Divisional Series is the highest rated week in FS1's history. Both drove strong ad revenues in the quarter while strengthening the overall franchise.
The NFL postseason was also strong. Average viewers per game exceeded 40 million in the playoffs. While we did see single-digit audience declines for our regular season NFL games on FOX, I'm going to note that our national game still averaged close to 20 million viewers. And yesterday, it looks like Super Bowl LI had more than 170 million total viewers.
To the power of sports, it [ph] can't be overstated. In the U.S., 88 of the top 100 most viewed telecasts on television last year were live sports. At across all of our broadcast, FOX Sports continue to deliver what we believe is a superior experience to viewers in terms of production, talent and technology, and we're very proud of what the team is doing.
We're also continuing to make great progress in entertainment, from Taboo, Legion, Fargo, Atlanta, Baskets [ph], Archer and The Americans at FX to STAR, 24th [ph], The Meek [ph] and Empire at FOX, Genius, Mars and The Story of God at National Geographic, Gomorrah, Babylon Berlin, Fortitude [ph] and The Young Pope at our affiliate, Sky, and [indiscernible] Hindustani and [indiscernible] at STAR, creatively, the business is firing on all cylinders and at a high volume and velocity.
This year, across the group, we'll produce almost 500 original series, over 20,000 hours of entertainment programs. I'd like to touch on where all this puts us and on the future and the direction of 21CF and the potential to create what we believe is really incredible value year.[ph] 
We've spoken with all of you many times over the last few years about simplifying our business, focusing on core brands and creative output that matters and taking the many steps required to get there. In December, with the announcement of our intention to acquire the balance of Sky and wholly consolidate that asset finally into the group, we took a major step, at least as far as intent, in the long process that started a number of years ago. We've shed noncore assets, consolidated joint ventures, invested in our core operations, created new capability sets within the group and simplified our management structure. All of this has been part of executing a core realignment of the company around the future of video.
The underlying revolution, ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end-user connected displays and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally presents an opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video platforms. We believe this is only just the beginning and the combination of strengths required to operate a high-volume content business in a vast international video platform business is precisely the combination of strengths that we're developing.
In short, if content is indeed king, then using it to build a platform that is an expression of those underlying trends presents one of the most promising opportunities for our company in decades. And so far, we've made great strides to this end. 
A few quick data points. The hotstar platform in India, barely 3 years old, continues to grow quickly. In December of '15, we saw about 16.5 million monthly active users. In this last December, that number was over 50 million. In terms of engagement, minutes of viewing in the December quarter grew year-on-year from 3.9 billion minutes of watch time to 17 billion minutes. 
Across Europe, the Sky has delivered online and over-the-top services to over 13 million customers and streamed in the December quarter almost 20 billion minutes. 
And in the U.S., within the next few months, we'll be rolling out a major overhaul of our streaming apps, which will deliver a step change for customers and future customers in quality, in discovery and in engagement.
The streaming business is not limited, of course, to our own platforms. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, our investment in our core brands is meant that our portfolio is very desirable to existing and new entrants alike, as demonstrated by our licensing last year to DirecTV Now, Sling, Hulu MVPD [ph] and Google's upcoming service. We expect this explosion of competition to benefit customers, to spur innovation and grow the overall marketplace for video in the U.S. where top line subscriber trends have been previously not so great. That should reverse over the coming years.
We're at the beginning of a great transformation of the business, and we couldn't be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. So with that, I'll turn it over to Reed, and we're happy to take whatever questions you might have."

And then for anyone who wants to take it, we're all focused on this new streaming packages coming out and at least, I would argue that Sling and DirecTV Now have had some technology challenges in terms of the scaling. And I'm curious, how focused Twenty-First Century Fox is on that topic as it relates to Hulu, in particular, where you're an owner. How confident are you that products can come out of the gate and be robust from a product offering scalability perspective? And should your shareholders be expecting that when that comes out over the next couple of months?"

So I think we've seen really, really good progress in terms of our ability to stream concurrent streams of live sports of the high-volume entertainment programming, for example, of the Hotstar platform that I mentioned, to you earlier as well as what our affiliate, Sky, routinely does with Sky Go and NOW TV. And Hulu's working very hard on making sure that that experience for customers is good as it's possibly can be. You never rule out teething problems. And I think it's instructive or it's worthwhile to kind of just mentioning that some of these problems in streaming, particularly concurrent live events, when everyone's logging in at the same second, is -- it's nontrivial. That said, we have a high degree of confidence in the Hulu platform, in the team there, their ability to deliver really a ton of minutes of streaming across their subscriber base currently. So we think it's going to be pretty strong. I think some of the things you've seen over the last number of months are normal for new services. And certainly, we expect those kind of kinks to be worked out. But certainly, it's not a -- it's not an easy technical challenge, but it's one that is surmountable and the team at Hulu is very, very focused on it.

So yes, we sort of land at around 4x, a little bit above. It really delevers rapidly and we're going to be focused on deleveraging, right? So we're going to put that at the top of the agenda, so the numbers of quarters and years postclosing. So I think it kind of delevers pretty quickly, and I think we have the capacity to do other things, either to think about additional capital returns by way of buybacks and continuing, obviously, with a growing dividend. Or potential kind of medium-sized or bolt-on M&A where we can capabilities and kind of expanding our business can make sense. But at this point, we're really focused on the shape of the business, as we've outlined to you. And as you can -- as you've seen and as we've shown you, I think that deleveraging profile there is pretty rapid and is pretty manageable for us. So no, we don't think it really curtails us, and this is the most sensible thing. As Lachlan made out of his early comments, this is the best use of our capital at this point with the highest returns available to all shareholders, given the accretive nature of it and the pace of deleveraging. And with respect to potentially the FTC relaxing ownership halves on extraterrestrial TV stations in the U.S., no, I guess just, the most straightforward way to answer your question. I hate to comment on future sort of speculation and hypotheticals, but I can -- I think you can rest there. We really like the stable of our station business right now and while there always may be affiliation swaps or other little bits and pieces around the edges, no, we don't have a big appetite for adding much to that.

We probably won't fully get there in the current year, but given the product and the success of what FX has done and particularly the success of its product, not only on FX but in other markets, that's an investment that returns are just fabulous on. So I think in order book, which premiered 3 or 4 weeks ago, which is part of that extra programming expense and it's been a terrific success. Very happy."

In terms of advertising and the sort of asset, I think one thing's really interesting is that as we've revamp over the next kind of month and change, we'll start rolling out on a per platform basis, and then Android, and so on as you kind of roll through the state out there. The authenticated apps really have a potential to reach an enormous audience. The 90 million or so MVPD households out there under our agreements had access to these apps, and what we need to do is really ease and simplify the authentication pathways. We need to create single logins across multiple brands, which will really make it easy and a great experience for customers. And we think we can generate some real audience there. Now that said, what's exciting about that is that that's a platform for us to innovate in terms of advertising, so that's around dynamic ad insertion. It's around pricing and customer time in a different way. It's about engagement units and other things, really lowering the ad holds and getting a higher yield. We're already seeing nonlinear advertising growth at a very, very good clip in the U.S. and internationally. And that's because from a data perspective and then a monetization perspective flowing from that with innovative ad products and different loads, you have a much better experience. So we're going to approach it, first of all, by making sure the app platform is stable. It's not easy dealing with a number of systems, the number of MVPDs, all the different issues that are out there. But first of all, we want to make it stable, we want to make it a great experience. We're very focused on having a very, very big, large volume of content available on those apps. And we're going to kind of reiterate in terms of how the advertising and monetization works. It's already going pretty well with the existing apps and we think we're going to be able to enhance that experience and enhance our capabilities over the next number of months and through the rest of the year. It'll be a big focus for us."

It's over the last month and we expect that to kind of wash out over the system, but you will see that impact in this current quarter that we're in, and we have to really see what the fourth quarter looks like. I just want to reiterate that the business is performing pretty strongly. The impact is primarily associated with the entertainment advertising piece of this due to the nature of our clients and the nature of their business and how it's impacted by the demonetization. Viewing shares is very strong, and we're very confident that the business, once its through this kind of speed bump over a quarter or 2, will be able to get back on the trajectory towards the targets that we've outlined for '18, '19, '20 and beyond."

And we think there's a lot to play for. We're think it's a big opportunity. I think for us, I guess, and we've been sort of talking about this for a little while, we think that that proliferation in downstream competition is really, really healthy for content creators and for brands like ours that are robust, that are differentiated that can really deliver content that works for customers. So we think that that a, from a 21CF perspective, that proliferation is going to be a positive thing for our business, and we do believe that it can reverse some of these overall declines in subscriber trends in the total MVPD universe and have that go forward. And then with Hulu, in particular, as you saw, I think Mike Hopkins did a great job kind of unveiling a lot of the details of the service at the plant service at CES earlier this year, I think that live viewing plus current plus past seasons and movies by really bundling of the SVOD services with originals and librarian past seasons in with what is the current MVPD window, I think it's a very compelling offering that makes it simple for customers, that makes it exciting, and I think gives it a really unique, at this point, angle on the marketplace. So we think it could be very exciting. I think it's -- I would just say it is very early days. So even though we've seen a lot of announcements and we're seeing reasonable growth in these digital MVPDs, they are just starting from very little over 0 and it's a big market place and one that, I think, is going to benefit from a lot of this innovation."

But just wondering, even when you're talking about in terms of the technology that you're going to be fully consolidating with Sky, it seems like NOW TV, is there a path for FOX to build a, for a lack of a better word, a direct FOX to consumer relationship rather than everything going through Hulu? And what could that look like? And then secondly, when you think about Hulu, it's an amazing product at $8, and I think, James, I've heard you speak at conferences about how when you launched the $12 product, it's actually driven home to people the value of the $8 product and really showing people the value of watching ads. How do you prevent the launch of a $40-ish product from showing people how much value there is to not watching live, and essentially, highlighting how great the $8 is versus the $40? How do you protect against that?"

We talked about discovery of content, engagement, generally. I gave you some numbers in my opening comments about how some of that is working around the world in terms of those levels of engagement. But I think the goal for us is first to, as I said, really create this product, a direct streaming product for customers, available to many, many, many millions of households on an authenticated basis who are already paying for the programming, and we can really enhance their experience with that programming, and we can also really enhance our capability in terms of monetizing that in addition advertising lighter loads, et cetera. But certainly, it's also an option for us in the future whether or not we'd like to have an independently priced access to that suite of apps. And that's a decision that we haven't yet made but one certainly that we feel we have the capability and the general wherewithal and experience in terms of managing direct-to-consumer businesses and subscriber businesses to tackle. But right now, we're very focused with our MVPD partners and our new digital MVPD partners to making a customer expense that is as good as it can be. And those decisions around independently priced G2C platforms are some in the U.S. is something that can wait. I would note that between the Hotstar platform, both the free one and the premium tier there, and then the businesses that are affiliate, Sky and Sky in India as well, many tens of millions of customers are on this vast direct-to-consumer platform today that is generating a lot of engagement and a lot of growth and a lot of profit. So we feel really good about that around the world as well. And whether or not there's a future for us in that, for example, the way that TBS has taken some steps in those areas in the U.S., is a decision that we can take at a later date. And then with respect to pricing, look, I think pricing and packaging around these things is a challenging sort of art, if you will. It's a bit of science, but it's also a bit of art and the question is how do you make those -- how do you make the differentiation between those two has really worthwhile for people, that they want to step up and do something that's a little bit more expensive, and you try to create steps for them, both up and down, so it doesn't just become in or out of a service, and certainly, we did that, have done that for years at the Skys, and I think the team at Hulu are approaching it in a pretty smart way. A lot of it has to do with just how they -- how they're planning the product in the future. So I think you have to watch it carefully and you have to create packaging around that that makes it understandable for customers exactly what they're getting. It's simple. It's straightforward. And then they can choose the prices that they like. And I would say that I think that the live programming, current and live sports, et cetera, are hugely valuable. And we see that in the uptake and penetration of the MVPD world today and in the engagement numbers and audiences that we're delivering, either to our sports businesses at the RSNs or at the broadcast network as we talked earlier and with a kind of recency and immediacy of new programming as it launches. So I think that does have value for people. But pricing, detailed pricing and packaging, going forward for Hulu is a matter for them that they're going to be articulating pretty, pretty soon and then also probably developing and changing it as it goes along."

I want to thank the literally",786,"Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone from Houston, where last night, we were privileged to witness a brilliant Super Bowl telecast, beautifully produced and expertly delivered by Eric Shanks and his team at FOX Sports. I want to thank the literally thousands of FOX Sports staff who brought us this amazing game. 
This single game is a great example of the strength of live sports, increasingly delivered across multiple platforms, the power of our core brands aligned with our ability to cross promote them and the continued value broadcast television delivers to the world's leading marketers. And yesterday, the Super Bowl powered FOX' first $0.5 billion revenue day and that something has made Mr. Nallen sitting across from me very happy.
Of course that revenue falls in the third quarter, but for the second quarter, we're pleased to have delivered another strong result, both from an operational and financial standpoint, as evidenced by the 15% EBITDA growth and 20% adjusted EPS growth that we have just reported. Importantly, this growth was broad-based with earnings gains in all of our operating segments, including strong double-digit increases in both Film and Television.
Core to our overarching long-term strategy is our steady focus on building the value of our video brands. That means partnering with the best creators and investing in the highest quality storytelling, the best journalism and premium sports rights to ensure our video experiences are vital for any consumer offering, established or emerging.
Testament to the progress we have made is our ability to again buck the broader industry trend of multichannel subscriber declines. In fact, this last quarter, we grew our cumulative domestic subscribers by 1.5% over last year's level on the back of subscriber additions at our younger channels, including FXX, the FOX Business Network, the National Geographic Channels and FOX Sports 1.
Our momentum underscores the strength of our brands across categories and genres, be it sports, news or entertainment, both scripted and nonscripted. The investments we have made to bolster our leadership in these areas are paying dividends.
We've been saying this for a while, but actions and outcomes speak louder than words. Clear and demonstrable evidence of the value we built is the meaningful affiliate renewals we recently achieved for our RSNs and Fox News with one of the nation's largest MSOs. We completed an agreement at the end of December, which delivered on the objectives we sought out. As part of a deal, this MSO will receive TV Everywhere rights across our entire RSN portfolio for the first time, a huge benefit to their subscribers and our passionate viewers.
In addition, our full suite of brands was included in DirecTV Now's November launch, and we expect the full suite to be included in the wave of emergent DMVPD services, including as previously announced, Hulu's live and on-demand service, which launches in the next couple of months.
These agreements with both established distributors and new entrants move us forward on another strategic priority, driving a more compelling user experience for our customers. This is one of the key strategic pillars behind the agreement we announced in December to acquire the 61% of Sky we do not already own. A combination of our 2 companies will give us leading direct-to-consumer capabilities and technologies while enhancing our sports and entertainment scale.
The Sky transaction will also deliver more balanced revenue streams and geographic spread. It further simplifies our structure and operating model. And in terms of the financial rationale, it is significantly accretive to our core earnings per share and our free cash flow.
As a founding shareholder of Sky, we are proud to have participated in its growth and development. Its transformation over the past 25 years into Europe's leading entertainment business has been extraordinary. We believe this transaction is the highest and most effective use of our capital to deliver shareholder value and returns over the long term.
Now before I hand it over to John for a financial review, I'm going to -- I want to conclude with some recent remarks on our cable news business.
On our last call, I noted the strength of Fox News. That strength has continued unabated. Fox News finished 2016 as the most-watched cable network and achieved its highest rated year in history. Postelection, Fox News is continuing to beat CNN and MSNBC combined. Adding to this strength is year-over-year growth in the important 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. time slots following recent programming changes. All of this underscores the underlying strength of the Fox News brand, the enduring power of its positioning and the continued loyalty of its viewers.
With that, I'd like to hand it over to John for his financial review."
91031,418071694,1124974,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2017",2017-02-06,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported another good quarter of financial results highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Our EBITDA growth was delivered across all of our business segments, with p",823,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported another good quarter of financial results highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Our EBITDA growth was delivered across all of our business segments, with particular strength reported at the Television and Film segments.
Second quarter revenues increased $307 million or 4% to $7.68 billion led by growth at both the Cable Network and Television segments, partially offset by slightly lower revenues reported in the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.99 billion, a record for any quarter, and a 15% increase from the prior year, reflecting double-digit growth at our Television and Film segments and continued good growth at our Cable segment.
This quarter's results include a $44 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency rates. And absent this impact, our overall EBITDA growth rate was 18%.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $857 million or $0.46 per share. Excluding the net income effect in both years of other net and of equity earnings adjustments at Sky and the Endemol Shine Group, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.53, which is a 20% increase over the comparable $0.44 reported a year ago.
So with that, I'll provide some additional comments on the performance of our operating segments for the second quarter, starting with the Cable Networks segment, where EBITDA of $1.33 billion was up 6% on revenue growth of 7%. Total Cable Networks expense growth was 8%, which includes a 2 percentage point increase from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners.
Domestic Cable revenues increased 10% in the aggregate, led by advertising increases of 12% and affiliate fee growth of 7%. Ad revenues continue to benefit from the ratings strength of Fox News as well as strong ratings and pricing grow at FS1, driven by Major League Baseball postseason and from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners, which added 2 percentage points to the ad growth. The affiliate fee increase primarily reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and continued growth at our expanding networks.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 12% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by increased Major League Baseball costs at FS1 and NBA costs at the RSNs and higher expenses from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners and the launch of our new programming initiative across the Nat Geo channels worldwide.
Second quarter reported international cable revenues grew 2%, driven by a 5% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 12% on a local currency basis. Advertising revenues declined 6% on a reported basis and 3% on a local currency basis versus the prior year. This primarily reflects an approximate $30 million decline at STAR's entertainment channels due principally to a negative impact from the demonetization policy implemented in India in early November, which meaningfully lowered overall market advertising spend. The marketing -- the market expects this dampening effect and disruption from the demonetization to substantially abate within another month or so as new Indian fiscal years commence.
Reported international EBITDA contributions decreased 13%, primarily due to the lower advertising revenues at STAR and a 9% impact from negative foreign exchange movements.
At our Television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $376 million, a 35% over last year, driven by increased revenues. We had strong advertising growth from a very successful broadcast of the World Series, which benefited from 2 additional games and viewership levels not seen in 2 decades and higher political advertising at the station. We also had continued double-digit retransmission consent revenue growth. And additionally, the stations generated incremental revenues from permitting the use of some spectrum in one of our markets. These total revenue gains were partially offset by higher sports and entertainment programming expenses of the network as well as higher promotion costs from the launch of new series.
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA of $389 million was $87 million higher than last year. This increase was primarily driven by lower marketing costs in the current year due to fewer theatrical releases versus last year. Additionally, revenues in the quarter were 4% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the difficult comparison against last year's worldwide theatrical performance of The Martian. It's worth noting that while we reported very strong fiscal year-to-date earnings in the segment, the comparisons become much more challenging in the second half of the fiscal year. In the next 2 quarters, for example, we will be comping against last year's very successful releases of Deadpool in theatrical and The Martian in home entertainment.
Shifting over to capital management, during the quarter, we purchased $132 million of FOXA shares, leaving our outstanding authorization of roughly $3.1 billion. And also, in the quarter, we issued $850 million of new debt and repaid $400 million in maturities. And now let me turn it over to James."

And so as you've heard and seen, the first half of the fiscal year has been a good one and the outlook for the next few quarters and years is also encouraging.
Now as noted, it seems an opportune time to talk a little bit about U.S. sports. It was a key driver in the quarter, and it's emblematic of our broader strategy around big brands and making investments in the programming that matters the most for our customers.
The MLB postseason was strong. The seventh game of the World Series was the most watched baseball game in a quarter century, while the National League Divisional Series is the highest rated week in FS1's history. Both drove strong ad revenues in the quarter while strengthening the overall franchise.
The NFL postseason was also strong. Average viewers per game exceeded 40 million in the playoffs. While we did see single-digit audience declines for our regular season NFL games on FOX, I'm going to note that our national game still averaged close to 20 million viewers. And yesterday, it looks like Super Bowl LI had more than 170 million total viewers.
So the power of sports, really can't be overstated. In the U.S., 88 of the top 100 most viewed telecasts on television last year were live sports. At across all of our broadcast, FOX Sports continue to deliver what we believe is a superior experience to viewers in terms of production, talent and technology, and we're very proud of what the team is doing.
We're also continuing to make great progress in entertainment, from Taboo, Legion, Fargo, Atlanta, Baskets, Archer and The Americans at FX to STAR, 24, The Mick and Empire at FOX, Genius, Mars and The Story of God at National Geographic, Gomorrah, Babylon Berlin, Fortitude and The Young Pope at our affiliate, Sky, and Malliswari, Dil Hai Hindustani and Neeli at STAR, creatively, the business is firing on all cylinders and at a high volume and velocity.
This year, across the group, we'll produce almost 500 original series, over 20,000 hours of entertainment programs. I'd like to touch on where all this puts us and on the future and the direction of 21CF and the potential to create what we believe is really incredible value here.
We've spoken with all of you many times over the last few years about simplifying our business, focusing on core brands and creative output that matters and taking the many steps required to get there. In December, with the announcement of our intention to acquire the balance of Sky and wholly consolidate that asset finally into the group, we took a major step, at least as far as intent, in the long process that started a number of years ago. We've shed noncore assets, consolidated joint ventures, invested in our core operations, created new capability sets within the group and simplified our management structure. All of this has been part of executing a core realignment of the company around the future of video.
The underlying revolution, ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end-user connected displays and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally presents an opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video platforms. We believe this is only just the beginning and the combination of strengths required to operate a high-volume content business in a vast international video platform business is precisely the combination of strengths that we're developing.
In short, if content is indeed king, then using it to build a platform that is an expression of those underlying trends presents one of the most promising opportunities for our company in decades. And so far, we've made great strides to this end. 
A few quick data points. The hotstar platform in India, barely 3 years old, continues to grow quickly. In December of '15, we saw about 16.5 million monthly active users. In this last December, that number was over 50 million. In terms of engagement, minutes of viewing in the December quarter grew year-on-year from 3.9 billion minutes of watch time to 17 billion minutes. 
Across Europe, the Sky has delivered online and over-the-top services to over 13 million customers and streamed in the December quarter almost 20 billion minutes. 
And in the U.S., within the next few months, we'll be rolling out a major overhaul of our streaming apps, which will deliver a step change for customers and future customers in quality, in discovery and in engagement.
The streaming business is not limited, of course, to our own platforms. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, our investment in our core brands is meant that our portfolio is very desirable to existing and new entrants alike, as demonstrated by our licensing last year to DirecTV Now, Sling, Hulu soon-to-launch streaming MVPD and Google's upcoming service. We expect this explosion of competition to benefit customers, to spur innovation and grow the overall marketplace for video in the U.S. where top line subscriber trends have been previously not so great. That should reverse over the coming years.
We're at the beginning of a great transformation of the business, and we couldn't be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Reed, and we're happy to take out whatever questions you might have."

And then for anyone who wants to take it, we're all focused on this new streaming packages coming out and at least, I would argue that Sling and DirecTV Now have had some technology challenges in terms of the scaling. And I'm curious, how focused Twenty-First Century Fox is on that topic as it relates to Hulu, in particular, where you're an owner. And how confident are you that product is going to come out of the gate and be robust from a product offering scalability perspective? And should your shareholders be expecting that when that comes out over the next couple of months?"

Look, I think the short answer is that the team at Hulu and certainly, what we're doing is well with our streaming apps, everyone is very, very focused on how do you solve some of the challenges in streaming, particularly when you have a lot of concurrent streams. So I think we've seen really, really good progress in terms of our ability to stream concurrent streams of live sports of the high-volume entertainment programming, for example, of the hotstar platform that I mentioned to you earlier as well as what our affiliate, Sky, kind of routinely does with Sky Go and NOW TV. And Hulu's working very hard on making sure that, that experience for customers is good as it's possibly can be. You never rule out teething problems. And I think it's instructive or it's worthwhile to kind of just mentioning that some of these problems in streaming, particularly concurrent live events, when everyone's logging in at the same second, is -- it's nontrivial. That said, we have a high degree of confidence in the Hulu platform, in the team there, their ability to deliver really a ton of minutes of streaming across their subscriber base currently. So we think it's going to be pretty strong. I think some of the things you've seen over the last number of months are normal for new services. And certainly, we expect those kind of kinks to be worked out. But certainly, it's not a -- it's not an easy technical challenge, but it's one that is surmountable and the team at Hulu is very, very focused on it. And I think the experience is going to be pretty good."

And if there's opportunities to grow those brands, as we did with the STAR brand, launching services to the South Asian Diaspora across Europe and in particular, the U.K. a number of years ago with great success, these things can live in different territories.

And the second question is for John and it's about Cable Network profitability. So last summer, your announce an incremental $200 million in investment in programming in Nat Geo and FX, you now lap to the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners. The question is when might you expect Cable Networks segment margins to return to expansion? Or said another way, when you look at the programming investments in Nat Geo and FX, when do those start to taper off such that the programming expense growth moderates?"

Look, I think with respect to capital allocation, looking at the balance sheet going forward, I think the key thing to remember about the Sky transaction that we've kind of detailed in December was the rapid deleveraging profile of the combined business. So yes, we sort of land at around 4x, a little bit above. It really delevers rapidly, and we're going to be focused on deleveraging, right. So we're going to put that at the top of the agenda for the numbers of just kind of quarters and years postclosing. So I think it kind of delevers pretty quickly, and I think we have capacity to do other things, either to think about additional capital returns by way of buybacks and continuing, obviously, with a growing dividend. Or potential kind of medium-sized or bolt-on M&A where we think capabilities and kind of expanding our business can make sense. But at this point, we're really focused on the shape of the business, as we've outlined to you. And as you can -- as you've seen and as we've shown you, I think that deleveraging profile there is pretty rapid and is pretty manageable for us. So no, we don't think it really curtails us, and this is the most sensible thing. As Lachlan made out of his early comments, he really think this is the best use of our capital at this point with the highest returns available to all shareholders, given the accretive nature of it and the pace of deleveraging. And with respect to potentially the FCC relaxing ownership caps on extraterrestrial TV stations in the U.S., no, I guess, the most straightforward way to answer the question. I hate to comment on future sort of speculation and hypotheticals, but I can -- I think you can rest easy there. We really like the shape of our station business right now and while there always may be affiliation swaps or other little bits and pieces around the edges, no, we don't have a big appetite for adding much to that. And then, I think it was 3 questions, John, do you want to talk about programming or...?"

The authenticated apps really have a potential to reach an enormous audience. That 90 million or so MVPD households out there under our agreements had access to these apps, and what we need to do is really ease and simplify the authentication pathways. We need to create single logins across multiple brands, which will really make it easy and a great experience for customers. And we think we can generate some real audience there. Now that said, what's exciting about that is that that's a platform for us to innovate in terms of advertising, so that's around dynamic ad insertion. It's around pricing a customer's time in a different way. It's about engagement units and other things, really lowering the ad votes and getting a higher yield. We're already seeing nonlinear advertising growth at a very, very good clip in the U.S. and internationally. And that's because from a data perspective and then a monetization perspective flowing from that with innovative new ad products and different loads, you can have a much better experience. So we're going to approach it, first of all, by making sure the app platform is stable. It's not easy dealing with a number of systems, the number of MVPDs, all the different authentication kind of issues that are out there. But first of all, we want to make it stable, we want to make it a great experience. We're very focused on having a very, very big, large volume of content available on those apps. And we're going to kind of iterate in terms of how the advertising and monetization works. It's already going pretty well with the existing apps, and we think we're going to be able to enhance that experience and enhance our capabilities over the next number of months and through the rest of the year, it'll be a big focus for us."

We continue to feel some of that. It's ameliorated over the last month, and we expect that to kind of wash out of the system, but you will see that impact in this current quarter that we're in, and we have to really see what the fourth quarter looks like. I just want to reiterate that the business is performing pretty strongly. The impact is primarily associated with the entertainment advertising piece of this due to the nature of our clients and the nature of their business and how it's impacted by the demonetization. Viewing shares is very strong, and we're very confident that the business, once it's through this kind of speed bump over a quarter or 2, we'll be able to get back on the trajectory towards the targets that we've outlined for '18, '19, '20 and beyond."

I mean, we've seen Sling, obviously, first out the gate, but I guess Sony, Vue, Sling, DIRECTV, very recent. We expect the team at Hulu to be ready for a launch pretty soon. And we think there's a lot to play for. We're think it's a big opportunity. I think for us, I guess, and we've been sort of talking about this for a little while, we think that that proliferation of downstream competition is really, really healthy for content creators and for brands like ours that are robust, that are differentiated that can really deliver content that works for customers. So we think that that, a, from a 21CF perspective, that proliferation is going to be a positive thing for our business, and we do believe that it can reverse some of these overall declines in subscriber trends in the total MVPD universe and have that go forward. And then with Hulu, in particular, as you saw, I think Mike Hopkins did a great job kind of unveiling a lot of the details of the service at the plant service at CES earlier this year, I think that live viewing plus current plus past seasons and movies by really bundling the SVOD services with originals and library in past seasons in with what is the kind of current MVPD window, I think it's a very compelling offering that makes it simple for customers, that makes it exciting, and I think gives it a really unique, at this point, angle on the marketplace. So we think it could be very exciting. I think it's -- I would just say it is very early days. So even though we've seen a lot of announcements and we're seeing reasonable growth in these digital MVPDs, they are just starting from very little over 0 and it's a big market place and one that, I think, is going to benefit from a lot of this innovation."

In the U.S., you've got your Hulu product that you've talked about and what's coming with the virtual MVPD for Hulu. But just wondering, even what you're talking about in terms of the technology that you're going to be fully consolidating with Sky, it seems like NOW TV, is there a path for FOX to build a, I guess for a lack of a better word, a direct FOX-to-consumer relationship rather than everything going through Hulu? And what could that look like? And then secondly, when you think about Hulu, it's an amazing product at $8. And I think, James, I know I've heard you speak at conferences about how when you launched the $12 product, it's actually driven home to people the value of the $8 product and really showing people the value of watching ads. How do you prevent the launch of a $40-ish product from showing people how much value there is to not watching live, and essentially, highlighting how great the $8 is versus the $40? How do you protect against that?"

Thanks, Rich. So look, I think the -- I think first of all, as I mentioned earlier, we're really focused on the streaming customer experience in the platform that we can deliver streaming content on to enable us to have the capabilities we talked earlier about advertising. We talked about discovery of content, engagement, generally. I gave you some numbers in my opening comments about how some of that is working around the world in terms of those levels of engagement. But I think the goal for us is first to, as I said, really, create this product, a direct streaming product for customers, available to many, many, many millions of households on an authenticated basis who are already paying for the programming, and we can really enhance their experience with that programming, and we can also really enhance our capability in terms of monetizing that in addition to advertising lighter loads, et cetera. But certainly, it's also an option for us in the future whether or not we'd like to have an independently priced access to that suite of apps. And that's a decision that we haven't yet made but one certainly that we feel we have the capability and the general wherewithal and experience in terms of managing direct-to-consumer businesses and subscriber businesses to tackle. But right now, we're very focused with our MVPD partners and our new digital MVPD partners to making a customer experience that is as good as it can be. And those decisions around independently priced D2C platforms are some [ph] in the U.S. is something that can wait. 
I would note that between the hotstar platform, both the free one and the premium tier there, and then the businesses that are affiliate, Sky, and the Tata Sky in India as well, many tens of millions of customers are on this vast direct-to-consumer platform today that is generating a lot of engagement and a lot of growth and a lot of profit. So we feel really good about that around the world as well. And whether or not there's a future for us in that, for example, the way that a CBS has taken some steps in those areas in the U.S., is a decision that we can take at a later date. 
And then with respect to pricing, look, I think pricing and packaging around these things is a challenging sort of art, if you will. It's a bit of science, but it's also a bit of art and the question is how do you make those -- how do you make the differentiation between those two is really worthwhile for people, that they want to step up and do something that's a little bit more expensive, and you try to create steps for them, both up and down, so it doesn't just become in or out of a service, and certainly, we did that, have done that for years at the Skys, and I think the team at Hulu are approaching it in a pretty smart way. A lot of it has to do with just how they -- how they're planning the product in the future. So I think you have to watch it carefully and you have to create packaging around that that makes it understandable for customers exactly what they're getting. It's simple. It's straightforward. And then they can choose the prices that they like. And I would say that I think that the live programming, current and live sports, et cetera, are hugely valuable. And we see that in the uptake and penetration of the MVPD world today and in the engagement numbers and audiences that we're delivering, either through our sports businesses at the RSNs or at the broadcast network as we talked earlier and with a kind of recency and immediacy of new programming as it launches. So I think that does have value for people. But pricing, detailed pricing and packaging, going forward for Hulu is a matter for them that they're going to, I think, they're articulating pretty, pretty soon and then also probably developing and changing it as it goes along."

I want to thank the literally",785,"Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone from Houston, where last night, we were privileged to witness a brilliant Super Bowl telecast, beautifully produced and expertly delivered by Eric Shanks and his team at FOX Sports. I want to thank the literally thousands of FOX Sports staff who brought us this amazing game. 
This single game is a great example of the strength of live sports, increasingly delivered across multiple platforms, the power of our core brands aligned with our ability to cross-promote them and the continued value broadcast television delivers to the world's leading marketers. And yesterday, the Super Bowl powered FOX' first $0.5 billion revenue day and that's something has made Mr. Nallen sitting across from me very happy.
Of course that revenue falls in the third quarter, but for the second quarter, we're pleased to have delivered another strong result, both from an operational and financial standpoint, as evidenced by the 15% EBITDA growth and 20% adjusted EPS growth that we have just reported. Importantly, this growth was broad-based with earnings gains in all of our operating segments, including strong double-digit increases in both Film and Television.
Core to our overarching long-term strategy is our steady focus on building the value of our video brands. That means partnering with the best creators and investing in the highest quality storytelling, the best journalism and premium sports rights to ensure our video experiences are vital for any consumer offering, established or emerging.
Testament to the progress we have made is our ability to again buck the broader industry trend of multichannel subscriber declines. In fact, this last quarter, we grew our cumulative domestic subscribers by 1.5% over last year's level on the back of subscriber additions at our younger channels, including FXX, the FOX Business Network, the National Geographic Channels and FOX Sports 1.
Our momentum underscores the strength of our brands across categories and genres, be it sports, news or entertainment, both scripted and nonscripted. The investments we have made to bolster our leadership in these areas are paying dividends.
We've been saying this for a while, but actions and outcomes speak louder than words. Clear and demonstrable evidence of the value we built is the meaningful affiliate renewals we recently achieved for our RSNs and Fox News with one of the nation's largest MSOs. We completed an agreement at the end of December, which delivered on the objectives we sought out. As part of the deal, this MSO will receive TV Everywhere rights across our entire RSN portfolio for the first time, a huge benefit to their subscribers and our passionate viewers.
In addition, our full suite of brands was included in DirecTV Now's November launch, and we expect the full suite to be included in the wave of emergent DMVPD services, including as previously announced, Hulu's live and on-demand service, which launches in the next couple of months.
These agreements with both established distributors and new entrants move us forward on another strategic priority, driving a more compelling user experience for our customers. This is one of the key strategic pillars behind the agreement we announced in December to acquire the 61% of Sky we do not already own. A combination of our 2 companies will give us leading direct-to-consumer capabilities and technologies while enhancing our sports and entertainment scale.
The Sky transaction will also deliver more balanced revenue streams and geographic spread. It further simplifies our structure and operating model. And in terms of the financial rationale, it is significantly accretive to our core earnings per share and our free cash flow.
As a founding shareholder of Sky, we are proud to have participated in its growth and development. Its transformation over the past 25 years into Europe's leading entertainment business has been extraordinary. We believe this transaction is the highest and most effective use of our capital to deliver shareholder value and returns over the long term.
Now before I hand it over to John for a financial review, I'm going to -- I want to conclude with some recent remarks on our cable news business.
On our last call, I noted the strength of Fox News. That strength has continued unabated. Fox News finished 2016 as the most-watched cable network and achieved its highest rated year in history. Postelection, Fox News is continuing to beat CNN and MSNBC combined. Adding to this strength is year-over-year growth in the important 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. time slots following recent programming changes. All of this underscores the underlying strength of the Fox News brand, the enduring power of its positioning and the continued loyalty of its viewers.
With that, I'd like to hand it over to John for his financial review."
91031,418071694,1125008,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2017",2017-02-06,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported another good quarter of financial results, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Our EBITDA growth was delivered across all of our business segments, with",823,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported another good quarter of financial results, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Our EBITDA growth was delivered across all of our business segments, with particular strength reported at the Television and Film segments.
Second quarter revenues increased $307 million or 4% to $7.68 billion led by growth at both the Cable Network and Television segments, partially offset by slightly lower revenues reported in the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.99 billion, a record for any quarter, and a 15% increase from the prior year, reflecting double-digit growth at our Television and Film segments and continued good growth at our Cable segment.
This quarter's results include a $44 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency rates. And absent this impact, our overall EBITDA growth rate was 18%.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $857 million or $0.46 per share. Excluding the net income effect in both years of other net and of equity earnings adjustments at Sky and the Endemol Shine Group, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.53, which is a 20% increase over the comparable $0.44 reported a year ago.
So with that, I'll provide some additional comments on the performance of our operating segments for the second quarter, starting with the Cable Networks segment, where EBITDA of $1.33 billion was up 6% on revenue growth of 7%. Total Cable Network expense growth was 8%, which includes a 2 percentage point increase from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners.
Domestic Cable revenues increased 10% in the aggregate, led by advertising increases of 12% and affiliate fee growth of 7%. Ad revenues continued to benefit from the ratings strength of Fox News as well as strong ratings and pricing grow at FS1, driven by Major League Baseball postseason and from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners, which added 2 percentage points to the ad growth. The affiliate fee increase primarily reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and continued growth at our expanding networks.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 12% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by increased Major League Baseball costs at FS1 and NBA costs at the RSNs and higher expenses from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners and the launch of our new programming initiative across the Nat Geo channels worldwide.
Second quarter reported international cable revenues grew 2%, driven by a 5% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 12% on a local currency basis. Advertising revenues declined 6% on a reported basis and 3% on a local currency basis versus the prior year. This primarily reflects an approximate $30 million decline at STAR's entertainment channels due principally to a negative impact from the demonetization policy implemented in India in early November, which meaningfully lowered overall market advertising spend. The marketing -- the market expects this dampening effect and disruption from the demonetization to substantially abate within another month or so as new Indian fiscal years commence.
Reported international EBITDA contributions decreased 13%, primarily due to the lower advertising revenues at STAR and a 9% impact from negative foreign exchange movements.
At our Television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $376 million, a 35% over last year, driven by increased revenues. We had strong advertising growth from a very successful broadcast of the World Series, which benefited from 2 additional games and viewership levels not seen in 2 decades and higher political advertising at the station. We also had continued double-digit retransmission consent revenue growth. And additionally, the stations generated incremental revenues from permitting the use of some spectrum in one of our markets. These total revenue gains were partially offset by higher sports and entertainment programming expenses at the network as well as higher promotion costs from the launch of new series.
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA of $389 million was $87 million higher than last year. This increase was primarily driven by lower marketing costs in the current year due to fewer theatrical releases versus last year. Additionally, revenues in the quarter were 4% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the difficult comparison against last year's worldwide theatrical performance of The Martian. It's worth noting that while we reported very strong fiscal year-to-date earnings in the segment, the comparisons become much more challenging in the second half of the fiscal year. In the next 2 quarters, for example, we will be comping against last year's very successful releases of Deadpool in theatrical and The Martian in home entertainment.
Shifting over to capital management, during the quarter, we purchased $132 million of FOXA shares, leaving our outstanding authorization of roughly $3.1 billion.

And so as you've heard and seen, the first half of the fiscal year has been a good one and the outlook for the next few quarters and years is also encouraging.Now as noted, it seems an opportune time to talk a little b",893,"Thanks, John, and thanks, Lachlan. And so as you've heard and seen, the first half of the fiscal year has been a good one and the outlook for the next few quarters and years is also encouraging.
Now as noted, it seems an opportune time to talk a little bit about U.S. sports. It was a key driver in the quarter, and it's emblematic of our broader strategy around big brands and making investments in the programming that matters the most for our customers.
The MLB postseason was strong. The seventh game of the World Series was the most watched baseball game in a quarter century, while the National League Divisional Series was the highest rated week in FS1's history. Both drove strong ad revenues in the quarter while strengthening the overall franchise.
The NFL postseason was also strong. Average viewers per game exceeded 40 million in the playoffs. While we did see single-digit audience declines for our regular season NFL games on FOX, I want to note that our national games still averaged close to 20 million viewers. And yesterday, it looks like Super Bowl LI had more than 170 million total viewers.
So the power of sports really can't be overstated. In the U.S., 88 of the top 100 most viewed telecasts on television last year were live sports. And across all of our broadcasts, FOX Sports continue to deliver what we believe is a superior experience to viewers in terms of production, talent and technology, and we're very proud of what the team is doing.
We're also continuing to make great progress in entertainment, from Taboo, Legion, Fargo, Atlanta, Baskets, Archer and The Americans at FX to STAR, 24, The Mick and Empire at FOX; Genius, Mars and The Story of God at National Geographic; Gomorrah, Babylon Berlin, Fortitude and The Young Pope at our affiliate, Sky; and Malliswari, Dil Hai Hindustani and Neeli at STAR, creatively, the business is firing on all cylinders and at a high volume and velocity.
This year, across the group, we'll produce almost 500 original series, over 20,000 hours of entertainment programs. I'd like to touch on where all this puts us and on the future and the direction of 21CF and the potential to create what we believe is really incredible value here.
We've spoken with all of you many times over the last few years about simplifying our business, focusing on core brands and creative output that matters and taking the many steps required to get there. In December, with the announcement of our intention to acquire the balance of Sky and wholly consolidate that asset finally into the group, we took a major step, at least as far as intent, in a long process that started a number of years ago. We've shed noncore assets, consolidated joint ventures, invested in our core operations, created new capability sets within the group and simplified our management structure. All of this has been part of executing a core realignment of the company around the future of video.
The underlying revolution -- ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end-user connected displays and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally -- presents an opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video platforms. We believe this is only just the beginning, and the combination of strengths required to operate a high-volume content business and a vast international video platform business is precisely the combination of strengths that we're developing.
In short, if content is indeed king, then using it to build a platform that is an expression of those underlying trends presents one of the most promising opportunities for our company in decades. And so far, we've made great strides to this end. 
A few quick data points. The Hotstar platform in India, barely 3 years old, continues to grow quickly. In December of '15, we saw about 16.5 million monthly active users. In this last December, that number was over 50 million. In terms of engagement, minutes of viewing in the December quarter grew year-on-year from 3.9 billion minutes of watch time to 17 billion minutes. 
Across Europe, the Sky has delivered online and over-the-top services to over 13 million customers and streamed in the December quarter almost 20 billion minutes. 
And in the U.S., within the next few months, we'll be rolling out a major overhaul of our streaming apps, which will deliver a step change for customers and future customers in quality, in discovery and in engagement.
The streaming business is not limited, of course, to our own platforms. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, our investment in our core brands has meant that our portfolio is very desirable to existing and new entrants alike, as demonstrated by our licensing last year to DirecTV Now, Sling, Hulu'ss oon-to-launch streaming MVPD and Google's upcoming service. We expect this explosion of competition to benefit customers, to spur innovation and grow the overall marketplace for video in the U.S. where top line subscriber trends have been previously not so great. That should reverse over the coming years.
We're at the beginning of a great transformation of the business, and we couldn't be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Reed, and we're happy to take whatever questions you might have."

And then for anyone who wants to take it, we're all focused on these new streaming packages coming out and at least I would argue that Sling and DirecTV Now have had some technology challenges in terms of the scaling. And I'm curious, how focused Twenty-First Century Fox is on that topic as it relates to Hulu, in particular, where you're an owner. And how confident are you that product is going to come out of the gate and be robust from a product offering scalability perspective?

Look, I think the short answer is that the team at Hulu and certainly, what we're doing as well with our streaming apps, everyone is very, very focused on how do you solve some of the challenges in streaming, particularly when you have a lot of concurrent streams. So I think we've seen really, really good progress in terms of our ability to stream concurrent streams of live sports of the high-volume entertainment programming, for example, of the Hotstar platform that I mentioned to you earlier as well as what our affiliate, Sky, kind of routinely does with Sky Go and NOW TV. And Hulu's working very hard on making sure that, that experience for customers is as good as it's possibly can be. You never rule out teething problems. And I think it's instructive or it's worthwhile kind of just mentioning that some of these problems in streaming, particularly concurrent live events, when everyone's logging in at the same second, is -- it's nontrivial. That said, we have a high degree of confidence in the Hulu platform, in the team there, their ability to deliver really a ton of minutes of streaming across their subscriber base currently. So we think it's going to be pretty strong. I think some of the things you've seen over the last number of months are normal for new services. And certainly, we expect those kind of kinks to be worked out. But certainly, it's not a -- it's not an easy technical challenge, but it's one that is surmountable and the team at Hulu is very, very focused on it. And I think the experience is going to be pretty good."

And if there's opportunities to grow those brands, as we did with the STAR brand, launching services to the South Asian Diaspora across Europe and in particular, the U.K. a number of years ago with great success, these things can live in different territories.

And the second question is for John and it's about Cable Network profitability. So last summer, your announced an incremental $200 million in investment in programming in Nat Geo and FX; you've now lapped the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners. The question is when might you expect Cable Network segment margins to return to expansion?

Look, I think with respect to capital allocation, looking at the balance sheet going forward, I think the key thing to remember about the Sky transaction that we've kind of detailed in December was the rapid deleveraging profile of the combined business. So yes, we sort of land at around 4x, a little bit above. It really delevers rapidly, and we're going to be focused on deleveraging, right. So we're going to put that at the top of the agenda for the numbers of just kind of quarters and years postclosing. So I think it kind of delevers pretty quickly, and I think we have capacity to do other things, either to think about additional capital returns by way of buybacks and continuing, obviously, with a growing dividend. Or potential kind of medium-sized or bolt-on M&A where we think capabilities and kind of expanding our business can make sense. But at this point, we're really focused on the shape of the business, as we've outlined to you. And as you can -- as you've seen and as we've shown you, I think that deleveraging profile there is pretty rapid and is pretty manageable for us. So no, we don't think it really curtails us, and this is the most sensible thing. As Lachlan made out in his early comments, we really think this is the best use of our capital at this point with the highest returns available to all shareholders, given the accretive nature of it and the pace of deleveraging. And with respect to potentially the FCC relaxing ownership caps on terrestrial TV stations in the U.S., no, I guess, is the most straightforward way to answer the question. I hate to comment on future sort of speculation and hypotheticals, but I can -- I think you can rest easy there. We really like the shape of our station business right now and while there always may be affiliation swaps or other little bits and pieces around the edges, no, we don't have a big appetite for adding much to that. And then -- I think it was 3 questions, John. Do you want to talk about programming or...?"

The authenticated apps really have a potential to reach an enormous audience. That 90 million or so MVPD households out there under our agreements had access to these apps, and what we need to do is really ease and simplify the authentication pathways. We need to create single logins across multiple brands, which will really make it easy and a great experience for customers. And we think we can generate some real audience there. Now that said, what's exciting about that is that that's a platform for us to innovate in terms of advertising, so that's around dynamic ad insertion. It's around pricing a customer's time in a different way. It's about engagement units and other things, really lowering the ad votes and getting a higher yield. We're already seeing nonlinear advertising growth at a very, very good clip in the U.S. and internationally. And that's because, from a data perspective and then a monetization perspective flowing from that, with innovative new ad products and different loads, you can have a much better experience. So we're going to approach it, first of all, by making sure the app platform is stable. It's not easy dealing with a number of systems, the number of MVPDs, all the different authentication kind of issues that are out there. But first of all, we want to make it stable, we want to make it a great experience. We're very focused on having a very, very big -- a large volume of content available on those apps. And we're going to kind of iterate in terms of how the advertising and monetization works. It's already going pretty well with the existing apps, and we think we're going to be able to enhance that experience and enhance our capabilities over the next number of months and through the rest of the year; it'll be a big focus for us."

And then with Hulu, in particular, as you saw, I think Mike Hopkins did a great job kind of unveiling a lot of the details of the service at the plan service at CES earlier this year. I think that live viewing plus current plus past seasons and movies by really bundling the SVOD services with originals and library in past seasons in with what is the kind of current MVPD window, I think it's a very compelling offering that makes it simple for customers, that makes it exciting, and I think gives it a really unique, at this point, angle on the marketplace. So we think it could be very exciting. I think it's -- I would just say it is very early days.

In the U.S., you've got your Hulu product that you've talked about and what's coming with the virtual MVPD for Hulu. But just wondering, even what you're talking about in terms of the technology that you're going to be fully consolidating with Sky, and it seems like NOW TV, is there a path for FOX to build a -- I guess for a lack of a better word, a direct FOX-to-consumer relationship rather than everything going through Hulu? And what could that look like? And then secondly, when you think about Hulu, it's an amazing product at $8. And I think, James, I know I've heard you speak at conferences about how when you launched the $12 product, it's actually driven home to people the value of the $8 product and really showing people the value of watching ads. How do you prevent the launch of a $40-ish product from showing people how much value there is to not watching live, and essentially, highlighting how great the $8 is versus the $40? How do you protect against that?"

So look, I think the -- I think first of all, as I mentioned earlier, we're really focused on the streaming customer experience and a platform that we can deliver streaming content on to enable us to have the capabilities we talked ear",691,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. So look, I think the -- I think first of all, as I mentioned earlier, we're really focused on the streaming customer experience and a platform that we can deliver streaming content on to enable us to have the capabilities we talked earlier about advertising. We talked about discovery of content, engagement generally. I gave you some numbers in my opening comments around how some of that has worked around the world in terms of those levels of engagement. But I think the goal for us is first to, as I said, really, create this product, a direct streaming product for customers, available to many, many, many millions of households on an authenticated basis who are already paying for the programming, and we can really enhance their experience with that programming, and we can also really enhance our capability in terms of monetizing that in addition to advertising lighter loads, et cetera. But certainly, it's also an option for us in the future whether or not we'd like to have an independently priced access to that suite of apps. And that's a decision that we haven't yet made but one certainly that we feel we have the capability and the general wherewithal and experience in terms of managing direct-to-consumer businesses and subscriber businesses to tackle. But right now, we're very focused with our MVPD partners and our new digital MVPD partners to making a customer experience that is as good as it can be. And those decisions around independently priced D2C platforms are something -- in the U.S. is something that can wait. 
I would note that between the Hotstar platform, both the free one and the premium tier there, and then the businesses at our affiliate, Sky, and the Tata Sky in India as well, many tens of millions of customers are on this vast direct-to-consumer platform today that is generating a lot of engagement and a lot of growth and a lot of profit. So we feel really good about that around the world as well. And whether or not there's a future for us in that -- for example, the way that a TBS has taken some steps in those areas in the U.S., is a decision that we can take at a later date. 
And then with respect to pricing, look, I think pricing and packaging around these things is a challenging sort of art, if you will. It's a bit of science, but it's also a bit of art and the question is how do you make those -- how do you make the differentiation between those tiers really worthwhile for people, that they want to step up and do something that's a little bit more expensive -- and you try to create steps for them, both up and down, so it doesn't just become in or out of a service, and certainly we did that, have done that for years at the Skys, and I think the team at Hulu are approaching it in a pretty smart way. A lot of it has to do with just how they -- how they're planning the product in the future. So I think you have to watch it carefully and you have to create packaging around that, that makes it understandable for customers exactly what they're getting. It's simple. It's straightforward. And then they can choose the prices that they like. And I would say that I think that the live programming, current and live sports, et cetera, are hugely valuable. And we see that in the uptake and penetration of the MVPD world today and in the engagement numbers and audiences that we're delivering, either through our sports businesses at the RSNs or at the broadcast network as we talked earlier and with a kind of recency and immediacy of new programming as it launches. So I think that does have value for people. But pricing -- detailed pricing and packaging, going forward for Hulu is a matter for them that they're going to, I think, be articulating pretty, pretty soon and then also probably developing and changing it as it goes along."

91031,418071694,1125453,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2017",2017-02-06,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone from Houston, where last night, we were privileged to witness a brilliant Super Bowl telecast, beautifully produced and expertly delivered by Eric Shanks and his team at FOX Sports. I want to thank the literally",785,"Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone from Houston, where last night, we were privileged to witness a brilliant Super Bowl telecast, beautifully produced and expertly delivered by Eric Shanks and his team at FOX Sports. I want to thank the literally thousands of FOX Sports staff who brought us this amazing game. 
This single game is a great example of the strength of live sports, increasingly delivered across multiple platforms, the power of our core brands aligned with our ability to cross-promote them and the continued value broadcast television delivers to the world's leading marketers. And yesterday, the Super Bowl powered FOX' first $0.5 billion revenue day and that's something has made Mr. Nallen sitting across from me very happy.
Of course that revenue falls in the third quarter, but for the second quarter, we're pleased to have delivered another strong result, both from an operational and financial standpoint, as evidenced by the 15% EBITDA growth and 20% adjusted EPS growth that we have just reported. Importantly, this growth was broad-based with earnings gains in all of our operating segments, including strong double-digit increases in both Film and Television.
Core to our overarching long-term strategy is our steady focus on building the value of our video brands. That means partnering with the best creators and investing in the highest quality storytelling, the best journalism and premium sports rights to ensure our video experiences are vital for any consumer offering, established or emerging.
Testament to the progress we have made is our ability to again buck the broader industry trend of multichannel subscriber declines. In fact, this last quarter, we grew our cumulative domestic subscribers by 1.5% over last year's level on the back of subscriber additions at our younger channels, including FXX, the FOX Business Network, the National Geographic Channels and FOX Sports 1.
Our momentum underscores the strength of our brands across categories and genres, be it sports, news or entertainment, both scripted and nonscripted. The investments we have made to bolster our leadership in these areas are paying dividends.
We've been saying this for a while, but actions and outcomes speak louder than words. Clear and demonstrable evidence of the value we built is the meaningful affiliate renewals we recently achieved for our RSNs and Fox News with one of the nation's largest MSOs. We completed an agreement at the end of December, which delivered on the objectives we sought out. As part of the deal, this MSO will receive TV Everywhere rights across our entire RSN portfolio for the first time, a huge benefit to their subscribers and our passionate viewers.
In addition, our full suite of brands was included in DirecTV Now's November launch, and we expect the full suite to be included in the wave of emergent DMVPD services, including as previously announced, Hulu's live and on-demand service, which launches in the next couple of months.
These agreements with both established distributors and new entrants move us forward on another strategic priority, driving a more compelling user experience for our customers. This is one of the key strategic pillars behind the agreement we announced in December to acquire the 61% of Sky we do not already own. A combination of our 2 companies will give us leading direct-to-consumer capabilities and technologies while enhancing our sports and entertainment scale.
The Sky transaction will also deliver more balanced revenue streams and geographic spread. It further simplifies our structure and operating model. And in terms of the financial rationale, it is significantly accretive to our core earnings per share and our free cash flow.
As a founding shareholder of Sky, we are proud to have participated in its growth and development. Its transformation over the past 25 years into Europe's leading entertainment business has been extraordinary. We believe this transaction is the highest and most effective use of our capital to deliver shareholder value and returns over the long term.
Now before I hand it over to John for a financial review, I'm going to -- I want to conclude with some recent remarks on our cable news business.
On our last call, I noted the strength of Fox News. That strength has continued unabated. Fox News finished 2016 as the most-watched cable network and achieved its highest rated year in history. Postelection, Fox News is continuing to beat CNN and MSNBC combined. Adding to this strength is year-over-year growth in the important 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. time slots following recent programming changes. All of this underscores the underlying strength of the Fox News brand, the enduring power of its positioning and the continued loyalty of its viewers.
With that, I'd like to hand it over to John for his financial review."
91031,418071694,1125453,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2017",2017-02-06,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported another good quarter of financial results, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Our EBITDA growth was delivered across all of our business segments, with",823,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today, we reported another good quarter of financial results, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Our EBITDA growth was delivered across all of our business segments, with particular strength reported at the Television and Film segments.
Second quarter revenues increased $307 million or 4% to $7.68 billion led by growth at both the Cable Network and Television segments, partially offset by slightly lower revenues reported in the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.99 billion, a record for any quarter, and a 15% increase from the prior year, reflecting double-digit growth at our Television and Film segments and continued good growth at our Cable segment.
This quarter's results include a $44 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency rates. And absent this impact, our overall EBITDA growth rate was 18%.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $857 million or $0.46 per share. Excluding the net income effect in both years of other net and of equity earnings adjustments at Sky and the Endemol Shine Group, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.53, which is a 20% increase over the comparable $0.44 reported a year ago.
So with that, I'll provide some additional comments on the performance of our operating segments for the second quarter, starting with the Cable Networks segment, where EBITDA of $1.33 billion was up 6% on revenue growth of 7%. Total Cable Network expense growth was 8%, which includes a 2 percentage point increase from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners.
Domestic Cable revenues increased 10% in the aggregate, led by advertising increases of 12% and affiliate fee growth of 7%. Ad revenues continued to benefit from the ratings strength of Fox News as well as strong ratings and pricing grow at FS1, driven by Major League Baseball postseason and from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners, which added 2 percentage points to the ad growth. The affiliate fee increase primarily reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and continued growth at our expanding networks.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 12% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by increased Major League Baseball costs at FS1 and NBA costs at the RSNs and higher expenses from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners and the launch of our new programming initiative across the Nat Geo channels worldwide.
Second quarter reported international cable revenues grew 2%, driven by a 5% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 12% on a local currency basis. Advertising revenues declined 6% on a reported basis and 3% on a local currency basis versus the prior year. This primarily reflects an approximate $30 million decline at STAR's entertainment channels due principally to a negative impact from the demonetization policy implemented in India in early November, which meaningfully lowered overall market advertising spend. The marketing -- the market expects this dampening effect and disruption from the demonetization to substantially abate within another month or so as new Indian fiscal years commence.
Reported international EBITDA contributions decreased 13%, primarily due to the lower advertising revenues at STAR and a 9% impact from negative foreign exchange movements.
At our Television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $376 million, a 35% over last year, driven by increased revenues. We had strong advertising growth from a very successful broadcast of the World Series, which benefited from 2 additional games and viewership levels not seen in 2 decades and higher political advertising at the station. We also had continued double-digit retransmission consent revenue growth. And additionally, the stations generated incremental revenues from permitting the use of some spectrum in one of our markets. These total revenue gains were partially offset by higher sports and entertainment programming expenses at the network as well as higher promotion costs from the launch of new series.
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA of $389 million was $87 million higher than last year. This increase was primarily driven by lower marketing costs in the current year due to fewer theatrical releases versus last year. Additionally, revenues in the quarter were 4% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the difficult comparison against last year's worldwide theatrical performance of The Martian. It's worth noting that while we reported very strong fiscal year-to-date earnings in the segment, the comparisons become much more challenging in the second half of the fiscal year. In the next 2 quarters, for example, we will be comping against last year's very successful releases of Deadpool in theatrical and The Martian in home entertainment.
Shifting over to capital management, during the quarter, we purchased $132 million of FOXA shares, leaving our outstanding authorization of roughly $3.1 billion. And also, in the quarter, we issued $850 million of new debt and repaid $400 million in maturities. And now let me turn it over to James."

And so as you've heard and seen, the first half of the fiscal year has been a good one and the outlook for the next few quarters and years is also encouraging.
Now as noted, it seems an opportune time to talk a little bit about U.S. sports. It was a key driver in the quarter, and it's emblematic of our broader strategy around big brands and making investments in the programming that matters the most for our customers.
The MLB postseason was strong. The seventh game of the World Series was the most watched baseball game in a quarter century, while the National League Divisional Series was the highest rated week in FS1's history. Both drove strong ad revenues in the quarter while strengthening the overall franchise.
The NFL postseason was also strong. Average viewers per game exceeded 40 million in the playoffs. While we did see single-digit audience declines for our regular season NFL games on FOX, I want to note that our national games still averaged close to 20 million viewers. And yesterday, it looks like Super Bowl LI had more than 170 million total viewers.
So the power of sports really can't be overstated. In the U.S., 88 of the top 100 most viewed telecasts on television last year were live sports. And across all of our broadcasts, FOX Sports continue to deliver what we believe is a superior experience to viewers in terms of production, talent and technology, and we're very proud of what the team is doing.
We're also continuing to make great progress in entertainment, from Taboo, Legion, Fargo, Atlanta, Baskets, Archer and The Americans at FX to STAR, 24, The Mick and Empire at FOX; Genius, Mars and The Story of God at National Geographic; Gomorrah, Babylon Berlin, Fortitude and The Young Pope at our affiliate, Sky; and Malliswari, Dil Hai Hindustani and Neeli at STAR, creatively, the business is firing on all cylinders and at a high volume and velocity.
This year, across the group, we'll produce almost 500 original series, over 20,000 hours of entertainment programs. I'd like to touch on where all this puts us and on the future and the direction of 21CF and the potential to create what we believe is really incredible value here.
We've spoken with all of you many times over the last few years about simplifying our business, focusing on core brands and creative output that matters and taking the many steps required to get there. In December, with the announcement of our intention to acquire the balance of Sky and wholly consolidate that asset finally into the group, we took a major step, at least as far as intent, in a long process that started a number of years ago. We've shed noncore assets, consolidated joint ventures, invested in our core operations, created new capability sets within the group and simplified our management structure. All of this has been part of executing a core realignment of the company around the future of video.
The underlying revolution, ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end-user connected displays and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally presents an opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video platforms. We believe this is only just the beginning, and the combination of strengths required to operate a high-volume content business and a vast international video platform business is precisely the combination of strengths that we're developing.
In short, if content is indeed king, then using it to build a platform that is an expression of those underlying trends presents one of the most promising opportunities for our company in decades. And so far, we've made great strides to this end. 
A few quick data points. The Hotstar platform in India, barely 3 years old, continues to grow quickly. In December of '15, we saw about 16.5 million monthly active users. In this last December, that number was over 50 million. In terms of engagement, minutes of viewing in the December quarter grew year-on-year from 3.9 billion minutes of watch time to 17 billion minutes. 
Across Europe, the Sky has delivered online and over-the-top services to over 13 million customers and streamed in the December quarter almost 20 billion minutes. 
And in the U.S., within the next few months, we'll be rolling out a major overhaul of our streaming apps, which will deliver a step change for customers and future customers in quality, in discovery and in engagement.
The streaming business is not limited, of course, to our own platforms. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, our investment in our core brands has meant that our portfolio is very desirable to existing and new entrants alike, as demonstrated by our licensing last year to DirecTV Now, Sling, Hulu's soon-to-launch streaming MVPD and Google's upcoming service. We expect this explosion of competition to benefit customers, to spur innovation and grow the overall marketplace for video in the U.S. where top line subscriber trends have been previously not so great.

I think affiliate revenue growth decelerated from last quarter year-on-year, so if there's any color or noise in those numbers that could help explain that, that would be helpful. And then for anyone who wants to take it, we're all focused on these new streaming packages coming out and at least I would argue that Sling and DirecTV Now have had some technology challenges in terms of the scaling. And I'm curious, how focused Twenty-First Century Fox is on that topic as it relates to Hulu, in particular, where you're an owner. And how confident are you that product is going to come out of the gate and be robust from a product offering scalability perspective? And should your shareholders be expecting that when that comes out over the next couple of months?"

Look, I think the short answer is that the team at Hulu and certainly, what we're doing as well with our streaming apps, everyone is very, very focused on how do you solve some of the challenges in streaming, particularly when you have a lot of concurrent streams. So I think we've seen really, really good progress in terms of our ability to stream concurrent streams of live sports of the high-volume entertainment programming, for example, of the Hotstar platform that I mentioned to you earlier as well as what our affiliate, Sky, kind of routinely does with Sky Go and NOW TV. And Hulu's working very hard on making sure that, that experience for customers is as good as it's possibly can be. You never rule out teething problems. And I think it's instructive or it's worthwhile kind of just mentioning that some of these problems in streaming, particularly concurrent live events, when everyone's logging in at the same second, is -- it's nontrivial. That said, we have a high degree of confidence in the Hulu platform, in the team there, their ability to deliver really a ton of minutes of streaming across their subscriber base currently. So we think it's going to be pretty strong. I think some of the things you've seen over the last number of months are normal for new services. And certainly, we expect those kind of kinks to be worked out. But certainly, it's not a -- it's not an easy technical challenge, but it's one that is surmountable and the team at Hulu is very, very focused on it. And I think the experience is going to be pretty good."

And if there's opportunities to grow those brands, as we did with the STAR brand, launching services to the South Asian Diaspora across Europe and in particular, the U.K. a number of years ago with great success, these things can live in different territories.

And the second question is for John and it's about Cable Network profitability. So last summer, your announced an incremental $200 million in investment in programming in Nat Geo and FX; you've now lapped the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners. The question is when might you expect Cable Network segment margins to return to expansion? Or said another way, when you look at the programming investments in Nat Geo and FX, when do those start to taper off such that the programming expense growth moderates?"

Look, I think with respect to capital allocation, looking at the balance sheet going forward, I think the key thing to remember about the Sky transaction that we've kind of detailed in December was the rapid deleveraging profile of the combined business. So yes, we sort of land at around 4x, a little bit above. It really delevers rapidly, and we're going to be focused on deleveraging, right. So we're going to put that at the top of the agenda for the numbers of just kind of quarters and years postclosing. So I think it kind of delevers pretty quickly, and I think we have capacity to do other things, either to think about additional capital returns by way of buybacks and continuing, obviously, with a growing dividend. Or potential kind of medium-sized or bolt-on M&A where we think capabilities and kind of expanding our business can make sense. But at this point, we're really focused on the shape of the business, as we've outlined to you. And as you can -- as you've seen and as we've shown you, I think that deleveraging profile there is pretty rapid and is pretty manageable for us. So no, we don't think it really curtails us, and this is the most sensible thing. As Lachlan made out in his early comments, we really think this is the best use of our capital at this point with the highest returns available to all shareholders, given the accretive nature of it and the pace of deleveraging. And with respect to potentially the FCC relaxing ownership caps on terrestrial TV stations in the U.S., no, I guess, is the most straightforward way to answer the question. I hate to comment on future sort of speculation and hypotheticals, but I can -- I think you can rest easy there. We really like the shape of our station business right now and while there always may be affiliation swaps or other little bits and pieces around the edges, no, we don't have a big appetite for adding much to that. And then I think it was 3 questions, John. Do you want to talk about programming or...?"

The authenticated apps really have a potential to reach an enormous audience. That 90 million or so MVPD households out there under our agreements had access to these apps, and what we need to do is really ease and simplify the authentication pathways. We need to create single logins across multiple brands, which will really make it easy and a great experience for customers. And we think we can generate some real audience there. Now that said, what's exciting about that is that that's a platform for us to innovate in terms of advertising, so that's around dynamic ad insertion. It's around pricing a customer's time in a different way. It's about engagement units and other things, really lowering the ad votes and getting a higher yield. We're already seeing nonlinear advertising growth at a very, very good clip in the U.S. and internationally. And that's because, from a data perspective and then a monetization perspective flowing from that, with innovative new ad products and different loads, you can have a much better experience. So we're going to approach it, first of all, by making sure the app platform is stable. It's not easy dealing with a number of systems, the number of MVPDs, all the different authentication kind of issues that are out there. But first of all, we want to make it stable, we want to make it a great experience. We're very focused on having a very, very big -- a large volume of content available on those apps. And we're going to kind of iterate in terms of how the advertising and monetization works. It's already going pretty well with the existing apps, and we think we're going to be able to enhance that experience and enhance our capabilities over the next number of months and through the rest of the year; it'll be a big focus for us."

The impact is primarily associated with the entertainment advertising piece of this due to the nature of our clients and the nature of their business and how it's impacted by the demonetization.

So we think that, that, a, from a 21CF perspective, that proliferation is going to be a positive thing for our business, and we do believe that it can reverse some of these overall declines in subscriber trends in the total MVPD universe and have that go forward. And then with Hulu, in particular, as you saw, I think Mike Hopkins did a great job kind of unveiling a lot of the details of the service at the plan service at CES earlier this year. I think that live viewing plus current plus past seasons and movies by really bundling the SVOD services with originals and library in past seasons in with what is the kind of current MVPD window, I think it's a very compelling offering that makes it simple for customers, that makes it exciting, and I think gives it a really unique, at this point, angle on the marketplace. So we think it could be very exciting. I think it's -- I would just say it is very early days.

But just wondering, even what you're talking about in terms of the technology that you're going to be fully consolidating with Sky, and it seems like NOW TV, is there a path for FOX to build a, I guess for a lack of a better word, a direct FOX-to-consumer relationship rather than everything going through Hulu? And what could that look like? And then secondly, when you think about Hulu, it's an amazing product at $8. And I think, James, I know I've heard you speak at conferences about how when you launched the $12 product, it's actually driven home to people the value of the $8 product and really showing people the value of watching ads. How do you prevent the launch of a $40-ish product from showing people how much value there is to not watching live, and essentially, highlighting how great the $8 is versus the $40?

Thanks, Rich. So look, I think the -- I think first of all, as I mentioned earlier, we're really focused on the streaming customer experience and a platform that we can deliver streaming content on to enable us to have the capabilities we talked earlier about advertising. We talked about discovery of content, engagement generally. I gave you some numbers in my opening comments around how some of that has worked around the world in terms of those levels of engagement. But I think the goal for us is first to, as I said, really, create this product, a direct streaming product for customers, available to many, many, many millions of households on an authenticated basis who are already paying for the programming, and we can really enhance their experience with that programming, and we can also really enhance our capability in terms of monetizing that in addition to advertising lighter loads, et cetera. But certainly, it's also an option for us in the future whether or not we'd like to have an independently priced access to that suite of apps. And that's a decision that we haven't yet made but one certainly that we feel we have the capability and the general wherewithal and experience in terms of managing direct-to-consumer businesses and subscriber businesses to tackle. But right now, we're very focused with our MVPD partners and our new digital MVPD partners to making a customer experience that is as good as it can be. And those decisions around independently priced D2C platforms are something -- in the U.S. is something that can wait. 
I would note that between the Hotstar platform, both the free one and the premium tier there, and then the businesses at our affiliate, Sky, and the Tata Sky in India as well, many tens of millions of customers are on this vast direct-to-consumer platform today that is generating a lot of engagement and a lot of growth and a lot of profit. So we feel really good about that around the world as well. And whether or not there's a future for us in that, for example, the way that a TBS has taken some steps in those areas in the U.S., is a decision that we can take at a later date. 
And then with respect to pricing, look, I think pricing and packaging around these things is a challenging sort of art, if you will. It's a bit of science, but it's also a bit of art and the question is how do you make those -- how do you make the differentiation between those tiers really worthwhile for people, that they want to step up and do something that's a little bit more expensive, and you try to create steps for them, both up and down, so it doesn't just become in or out of a service, and certainly we did that, have done that for years at the Skys, and I think the team at Hulu are approaching it in a pretty smart way. A lot of it has to do with just how they -- how they're planning the product in the future. So I think you have to watch it carefully and you have to create packaging around that, that makes it understandable for customers exactly what they're getting. It's simple. It's straightforward. And then they can choose the prices that they like. And I would say that I think that the live programming, current and live sports, et cetera, are hugely valuable. And we see that in the uptake and penetration of the MVPD world today and in the engagement numbers and audiences that we're delivering, either through our sports businesses at the RSNs or at the broadcast network as we talked earlier and with a kind of recency and immediacy of new programming as it launches. So I think that does have value for people. But pricing, detailed pricing and packaging, going forward for Hulu is a matter for them that they're going to, I think, be articulating pretty, pretty soon and then also probably developing and changing it as it goes along."

We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of solid growth. The strength of these results generated the highest core earnings per share in the company's history. This record result reflects continued positive progress across our businesses, with revenue and EBITDA growth coming from both our cable networks and Television segments.
And whilst earnings at the Film studio decreased, when compared to one of our most profitable film quarters ever in the prior year, when we benefited significantly from Deadpool, they were robust, nonetheless.
Importantly, we have driven our business forward against all our strategic priorities, through growing the distribution of our video brands on both traditional and demand emerging platforms, through innovating digital advertising products and partnerships, such as open AP and most critically, to delivering outstanding spelling, sports and news broadcasting.
In fact, the scale and health of our sports and news broadcasting businesses continued to be differentiators for us, with over half the company's advertising revenues earned in these genres.
Of course, we had an incredible Super Bowl, but we also saw viewership gains for the Daytona 500 on SBC and for MLS soccer on FOX Sports 1, which, for the first time, with ESPN2 for an entire month in February.
Additionally, viewership at our regional sports networks continues to be exceptionally strong, with Major League Baseball leading the way. Yankee ratings are up 39% over last season, and the Atlanta Brave's ratings are up over 54% this season so far. The business is in great shape, with all expiring team rights deals satisfactorily renewed.
Not to be outdone, Fox News is the #1 basic cable channel in both total day and primetime viewing for 61 consecutive quarters. In fact, Fox News has delivered its highest rated quarter ever, ratings strength we expect to continue.
In scripted programming, our partnerships with the world's best storytellers continued to produce groundbreaking new series that drive the long-term value of our core brands. FX debuted successful first seasons of Taboo, Legion and FEUD, adding to the network's reputation as a creative powerhouse.
National Geographic has made great progress its goal to more closely align its programming with its brand. The recent Genius premier, from producers Ron Howard and Brian bracer, Nat Geo's first scripted anthology series, drew over 4 million viewers in the U.S. alone, and was distributed further across the global reach of the National Geographic international channels.
The FOX broadcasting network's mixed performance in ratings this season has been frustrating for all, but we are encouraged by our development for the fall and look forward to presenting a strong schedule at our upfront this Monday.
Of course, the network does provide our TV studio a powerful launch platform for its shows, and it is important to consider these 2 businesses together. 20th Century Fox Television is coming off a stellar 2016/2017 broadcast season. This past year, our TV studio produced the #1 show on 5 different networks, including Empire on FOX, American Crime Story on FX, Modern Family on ABC, This Is Us on NBC and American Dad on TBS.
The solid performance of our film studio, with the box office successes of Logan and Hidden Figures, underscores the range and quality of what we bring our audiences. Looking out over the next year, we feel good about our slate, with Alien Covenant, directed by Ridley Scott, coming later this month; followed by War for the Planet of the Apes in July; Kingsman, the Golden Circle in September; and the Greatest Showman at Christmas. We've also recently announced the June 2018 release of Deadpool 2, dumping my young boys are widely looking forward to, but which they won't be allowed to watch.
Turning to our international businesses. The financial impact of the Indian demonetization we believe is behind us, but the financial impact has skewered impressive operational progress, most notably Star India's increasing its viewership lead over our competitors and the continued rise and drive of Hotstar as the emergent platform of choice in India. James will have some more to say about that in a few minutes.
The company continues to attract great new leaders, such as a Amy Listerman, who has joined us as Fox News CFO; and Marianne Gabelli, who has joined us as President of Fox News' advertising sales, and we welcome them to the company.
We feel good about where we are and confident that the strategic plan we continue to execute against is differentiating us from our competitors and building long-term value across our businesses.
With that, I'll hand it over to John."
91031,426463170,1199597,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, May 10, 2017",2017-05-10,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of financial results, posting double-digit gains and adjusted earnings per share and growth in EBITDA, despite the very difficult year-on-year at our Film segment, wh",698,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of financial results, posting double-digit gains and adjusted earnings per share and growth in EBITDA, despite the very difficult year-on-year at our Film segment, which Lachlan referred to.
Third quarter revenues increased $336 million, or 5%, to $7.56 billion, led by higher advertising revenues at the Television segment from the broadcast of this year's Super Bowl and affiliate revenue growth at the Cable Network segment. This was partially offset by slightly lower content revenues at the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.94 billion, a 3% increase from the prior year, reflecting double-digit increases at our Television segment and mid-single-digit growth at the Cable Networks, offset in part by lower Film segment results from the challenging comp to a year ago.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $811 million, or $0.44 per share. This quarter included charges of $142 million reported in other net, which primarily represents the fair value adjustments on currency hedges related to the pending Sky transaction.
Excluding the net income effect in both years of other net, impairment and restructuring and equity earnings adjustments, third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.54, which is a 15% increase over the comparable $0.47 reported a year ago.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the third quarter. The cable network segment reported EBITDA of $1.45 billion, up 5% on revenue growth of 2%, with total segment expenses pretty much unchanged from last year. Domestic cable revenues increased 6%, led by affiliate fee growth of 8%, which reflects higher average rates across all of our brands.
Domestic ad revenues were equal to the prior year, as increases from the ratings strength at Fox News and at FS1 were offset by reductions from the nonchannel businesses at Nat Geo Partners. EBITDA at our domestic channel was equal to the prior year, as higher revenues were offset by increased investments in programming, most notably the planned investments to support our expansion of original series at FX and the new programming initiative at Nat Geo as well as contractual sports rights step-ups.
Third quarter reported international cable revenues declined 7%, as lower advertising and syndication revenues were partially offset by mid-single-digit affiliate fee growth. Reported advertising revenues were, as expected, down 18% versus the prior year, principally due to the absence of STAR's prior year broadcast of the ICC T20 World Cup and Asia Cup cricket tournaments and the continued negative impact from India's demonetization initiative.
Now, while the major effects of demonetization are now behind us, it negatively impacted the third quarter revenue by approximately $20 million. Reported international EBITDA contribution increased 44%, primarily due to the lower sports programming cost at STAR and affiliate fee growth.
At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $190 million increased 52% from last year on revenue increases of 30%. This revenue growth was driven by our broadcast of this year's Super Bowl, where we generated approximately $500 million in gross revenues on Super Bowl Sunday and from continued retransmission consent revenue growth. These increases more than offset the impact of lower primetime entertainment ratings from the absence of American Idol.
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $373 million was $97 million below a year ago. This quarter's very solid earnings were led by the theatrical releases of Logan and Hidden Figures, and higher television production contributions from the licensing of American Crime Story and Homeland.
The comparisons for last year's third quarter, as Lachlan mentioned, are challenging, since last year included significant contributions from the theatrical release of Deadpool and the home entertainment release of The Martian. These difficult comparisons will continue in the fourth quarter from the ongoing strength of these films last year as well as from the quarter -- quarterly timing of SVOD sales and reduced syndication sales versus last year's fourth quarter.
And finally, from a balance sheet perspective, we continue to accumulate cash reflecting our priority to point our capital towards a planned acquisition of Sky.
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

But I just like to spend a minute or 2 ad",964,"Thanks very much, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. So as you've heard, the first 9 months of the fiscal year have been strong, and we've made good progress on a number of fronts. But I just like to spend a minute or 2 addressing some of the key things we've been seeing in the marketplace and share some thoughts on our priorities going forward.
So a few points to make on the following subjects: the advertising trends and performance, the distribution universe for our video brands and the velocity of the business in terms of revenue that might not be so obvious at first glance.
So, first of all, we're very pleased with the advertising performance in the quarter, which grew 16% company-wide year-over-year. Now, obviously, as mentioned, at Super Bowl, was a major contributor, which was offset in part by the lack of both the Asian Cup and ICC T20 Championships at STAR, which we had in the comparable quarter last year and softer demand due to the effect of the demonization, as John mentioned, and the absence of America Idol at FBC, which had its final run on FOX last year. 
But it's important to note that all but one of our U.S. cable brands saw good advertising growth, with only the National Geographic Channel down, which we expected due to our shift in programming strategy that Lachlan talked about earlier. National Scatcher remains strong, although local appears a little softer than we'd like, particularly autos. But in months into the fourth quarter, we're looking for at least high digit growth for both our domestic and international cable portfolios.
As for the distribution landscape, a few highlights. Domestically, as John mentioned, we saw affiliate income growth year-on-year of about 8%, an acceleration from the same period last year and from the last quarter, as planned. We expect that growth to continue to accelerate in Q4 and into next year. 
The U.S. paid subscriber base for us was up slightly, about 0.5%, but, obviously, we saw some declines in the most widely distributed tiers of about 1.5% year-over-year, which we have not seen accelerating since last quarter.
In fact, everywhere we look, we see a landscape of opportunity, as downstream distribution becomes more innovative and competitive. Despite renewed market commentary over the last weeks, we remained of the view that innovation and competition from new entrants and incumbent operators, will ameliorate and then reverse the trends as digital rebundling drives overall universe growth.
At STAR, we continued to grow at a good pace, but the timing of some affiliate renewals last year affects this quarter's comparisons. You may recall that we had extraordinary growth last year in Q3 of some 20% in international cable affiliate revenue, so we're comping very nicely against a very high bar.
This year, we grew affiliate revenue in every key region, with some of the pace at FOX Network Group's international channels slowing due to some local events, such as the closure of 2 distributors in Thailand and some other weakness in Southeast Asia.
In the Hotstar platform in India continues to make strides, expanding its watch time over the prior quarter -- over the prior year quarter by 220%, making it, by some estimates, about 14x the watch time for Netflix.
In Europe, Asia and Latin America, we've introduced innovative nonlinear packages to each of their regions, under the labels Fox Plus and FOX premium, all tailored for a specific market and offering consumers more choice, a better experience and ultimately, for us, making a better business.
In the U.S., the digital MVPD revolution has only now reached the starting line. So taken altogether, if we exclude the Film segment, which, obviously, didn't have a Deadpool in the quarter, revenue globally grew at about 11%. We think that's a pretty good clip, and it's a testament to the diversity and the breadth of the business geographically and by mix. And year-to-date, our EBITDA is up 11%, which underscores how all these comes together, with a durable velocity underlying the business.
I want to reiterate that our strategy of focus on big brands that matter for customers and investment on screen that clearly differentiates and earns attention and a program of work to make our programming and products more available, not less, is paying dividends.
Our business has been an expression of a technological advance shaping our industry from way back, from silent movies to talkies, from featured film exhibitions to broadcast Television and from broadcast to multichannel cable and satellite TV. And the underlying technological advances today, ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end-user connected displays and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally, presents an opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video creators and platforms. We think this is only just the beginning, and a combination of strengths required to operate a high-volume content business and a vast international video platform is precisely the combination of strengths that we're developing.
In short, if content is indeed king and using it to build platforms that are an expression of these current underlying trends, presents the most promising opportunity for our company in decades.
Now, before closing, I'd like to quickly touch upon Sky. The business continues to deliver on its growth strategy, recently reporting good financial performance, with subscriber growth across the group. Last month, we welcomed the decision by the European Commission clearing unconditionally our proposed transaction. And we continue to work with U.K. regulators, and we're confident that the proposed transaction will be completed by the end of this calendar year, as we've said before.

But to date, it's a pretty small number because you really have really just DIRECTV NOW and Sling in the quarter, and a little bit of Sony, but it's really now, I think, the increased competition, YouTube launching after this quarter, I think it was just in April, and Hulu really just getting out of the gates last week. So it's really just early days there. So what's really driving us more is the fact that we've been investing in these brands. And some of our brands are less mature, and we have continued growth in a number of our channels in terms of the existing traditional MVPD subscriber base as well. And think, and I think there's actually one of our major brands saw any shrinkage in the quarter."

I think what we're seeing there today is -- Lachlan mentioned, increased level of leadership in terms of our entertainment share. Our sports business is really going from strength to strength, since we kind of -- since we acquired the half of the ESPN Star Sports joint venture a number of years ago, and really reinvented STAR Sports in the marketplace, it's been very, very successful. Not just in cricket, but also with the [indiscernible] and with the Indian Super League, the soccer league there, where they're rounding out the schedule, so feel good about it. When I look at the marketplace, we have is we had a disruption with the demonetization, as John mentioned. That's largely -- we're largely through that now it wasn't big an impact in the last quarter, and we're at the run rate that we need to be at to get to our target at this point. So we feel on target, we feel like the business is in pretty robust health. Creatively, is performing very, very well, and we feel confident about the overall Indian environment generally. I did note some of those comments. I heard about that, and I was surprised because at least from our business perspective, we take the view that you go into a market like India in the expectation that in success, it's really going to change your life. So you really don't go anything other than the whole hog, and that has really paid off well. We have a very profitable and exciting business there, and I think it speaks to really the differentiation you're seeing across the media sector today. When I look at all the very performance that I think I urge you to think about all of these firms of different strengths and weaknesses. And our business has been on a very clear path to that, investing in these big brands around the world, being global first, getting exposure to markets that we think in success can really, really move the dial for us and investing on screen for customers in a way that is committed to the best possible content experience they can have. And maybe that's different from other players."

We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of solid growth. The strength of these results generated the highest core earnings per share in the company's history. This record result reflects continued positive progress across our businesses, with revenue and EBITDA growth coming from both our cable networks and Television segments. And whilst earnings at the Film studio decreased, when compared to one of our most profitable film quarters ever in the prior year, when we benefited significantly from Deadpool, they were robust, nonetheless.
Importantly, we have driven our business forward against all our strategic priorities through growing the distribution of our video brands on both traditional and demand emerging platforms, through innovating digital advertising products and partnerships, such as open AP, and most critically to delivering outstanding [indiscernible], sports and news broadcasting.
In fact, the scale and health of our sports and news broadcasting businesses continue to be differentiators for us, with over half the company's advertising revenues earned in these genres. 
Of course, we had an incredible Super Bowl, but we also saw viewership gains for the Daytona 500 on FBC and for MLS Soccer on FOX Sports 1 which, for the first time, beat ESPN2 for an entire month in February.
Additionally, viewership at our regional sports networks continues to be exceptionally strong, with Major League Baseball leading the way. Yankee ratings are up 39% over last season, and the Atlanta Braves' ratings are up over 54% this season so far. The business is in great shape, with all expiring team rights deals satisfactorily renewed.
Not to be outdone, Fox News is the #1 basic cable channel in both total day and primetime viewing for 61 consecutive quarters. In fact, Fox News has delivered its highest rated quarter ever, rating strength we expect to continue.
In scripted programming, our partnerships with the world's best storytellers continue to produce groundbreaking new series that drive the long-term value of our core brands. FX debuted successful first seasons of Taboo, Legion and FEUD, adding to the network's reputation as a creative powerhouse.
National Geographic has made great progress in its goal to more closely align its programming with its brand. The recent Genius premier, from producers Ron Howard and Brian Gracer, Nat Geo's first scripted anthology series, drew over 4 million viewers in the U.S. alone, and was distributed further across the global reach of the National Geographic international channels.
The FOX Broadcasting network's mixed performance in ratings this season has been frustrating for all, but we are encouraged by our development for the fall and look forward to presenting a strong schedule at our upfront this Monday. Of course, the network does provide our TV studio a powerful launch platform for its shows, and it is important to consider these 2 businesses together. 20th Century Fox Television is coming off a stellar 2016/2017 broadcast season. This past year, our TV studio produced the #1 show on 5 different networks, including Empire on FOX, American Crime Story on FX, Modern Family on ABC, This Is Us on NBC and American Dad! on TBS.
The solid performance of our film studio, with the box office successes of Logan and Hidden Figures, underscores the range and quality of what we bring our audiences. Looking out over the next year, we feel good about our slate with Alien: Covenant, directed by Ridley Scott, coming later this month; followed by War for the Planet of the Apes in July; Kingsman: The Golden Circle, in September; and The Greatest Showman at Christmas. We've also recently announced the June 2018 release of Deadpool 2, something my young boys are widely looking forward to, but which they won't be allowed to watch.
Turning to our international businesses. The financial impact of the Indian demonetization, we believe, is behind us. But the financial impact has obscured impressive operational progress, most notably STAR India's increasing its viewership lead over our competitors and the continued rise and drive of Hotstar as the emerging platform of choice in India. James will have some more to say about that in a few minutes.
The company continues to attract great new leaders, such as a Amy Listerman, who has joined us as Fox News CFO; and Marianne Gambelli, who has joined us as President of Fox News' Advertising Sales, and we welcome them to the company.
We feel good about where we are and confident that the strategic plan we continue to execute against is differentiating us from our competitors and building long-term value across our businesses.
With that, I'll hand it over to John."

Today, we reported another strong quarter of financial results, posting double-digit gains and adjusted earnings per share and growth in EBITDA, despite the very difficult year-on-year comparisons at our Film segment, which Lachlan referred to.
Third quarter revenues increased $336 million, or 5%, to $7.56 billion, led by higher advertising revenues at the Television segment from the broadcast of this year's Super Bowl and affiliate revenue growth at the Cable Network segment. This was partially offset by slightly lower content revenues at the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.94 billion, a 3% increase from the prior year, reflecting double-digit increases at our Television segment and mid-single-digit growth at the Cable Networks, offset in part by lower Film segment results from the challenging comp to a year ago.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $811 million, or $0.44 per share. This quarter included charges of $142 million reported in other net, which primarily represents the fair value adjustments on currency hedges related to the pending Sky transaction.
Excluding the net income effect in both years of other net, impairment and restructuring and equity earnings adjustments, third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.54, which is a 15% increase over the comparable $0.47 reported a year ago.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the third quarter. The cable network segment reported EBITDA of $1.45 billion, up 5% on revenue growth of 2%, with total segment expenses pretty much unchanged from last year. Domestic cable revenues increased 6%, led by affiliate fee growth of 8%, which reflects higher average rates across all of our brands.
Domestic ad revenues were equal to the prior year, as increases from the rating strength at Fox News and at FS1, were offset by reductions from the non-channel businesses at Nat Geo Partners. EBITDA at our domestic channel was equal to the prior year, as higher revenues were offset by increased investments in programming, most notably the planned investments to support our expansion of original series at FX and the new programming initiative at Nat Geo, as well as contractual sports rights step-ups.
Third quarter reported international cable revenues declined 7%, as lower advertising and syndication revenues were partially offset by mid-single-digit affiliate fee growth. Reported advertising revenues were, as expected, down 18% versus the prior year, principally due to the absence of STAR's prior year broadcast of the ICC T20 World Cup and Asia Cup cricket tournaments and the continued negative impact from India's demonetization initiative. 
Now while the major effects of demonetization are now behind us, it negatively impacted the third quarter revenue by approximately $20 million. Reported international EBITDA contribution increased 44%, primarily due to the lower sports programming cost at STAR and affiliate fee growth.  
At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $190 million increased 52% from last year on revenue increases of 30%. This revenue growth was driven by our broadcast of this year's Super Bowl, where we generated approximately $500 million in gross revenues on Super Bowl Sunday, and from continued retransmission consent revenue growth. These increases more than offset the impact of lower primetime entertainment ratings from the absence of American Idol.
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $373 million was $97 million below a year ago. This quarter's very solid earnings were led by the theatrical releases of Logan and Hidden Figures, and higher television production contributions from the licensing of American Crime Story and Homeland.
The comparisons for last year's third quarter, as Lachlan mentioned, are challenging, since last year included significant contributions from the theatrical release of Deadpool and the home entertainment release of The Martian. These difficult comparisons will continue in the fourth quarter from the ongoing strength of these films last year as well as from the quarter -- quarterly timing of SVOD sales and reduced syndication sales versus last year's fourth quarter.
And finally, from a balance sheet perspective, we continue to accumulate cash reflecting our priority to point our capital toward the planned acquisition of Sky.
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. So as you've heard, the first 9 months of the fiscal year have been strong and we made good progress on a number of fronts. But I just like to spend a minute or 2 addres",963,"Thanks very much, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. So as you've heard, the first 9 months of the fiscal year have been strong and we made good progress on a number of fronts. But I just like to spend a minute or 2 addressing some of the key things we've been seeing in the marketplace and share some thoughts on our priorities going forward.
So a few points to make on the following subjects: the advertising trends and performance, the distribution universe for our video brands and the velocity of the business in terms of revenue that might not be so obvious at first glance.
So first of all, we're very pleased with the advertising performance in the quarter, which grew 16% company-wide year-over-year. Now, obviously, as mentioned, the Super Bowl was a major contributor, which was offset in part by the lack of both the Asia Cup and ICC T20 Championships at STAR, which we had in the comparable quarter last year, and softer demand due to the effect of the demonization, as John mentioned, and the absence of America Idol at FBC, which had its final run on FOX last year. 
But it's important to note that all but one of our U.S. cable brands saw good advertising growth, with only the National Geographic Channel down, which we expected due to our shift in programming strategy that Lachlan talked about earlier. National's scatter remains strong, although local appears a little softer than we'd like, particularly autos. But a month into the fourth quarter, we're looking for at least high-single-digit growth for both our domestic and international cable portfolios.
As for the distribution landscape, a few highlights. Domestically, as John mentioned, we saw affiliate income growth year-on-year of about 8%, an acceleration from the same period last year and from the last quarter, as planned. We expect that growth to continue to accelerate in Q4 and into next year. The U.S. paid subscriber base, for us, was up slightly about 0.5%. But obviously, we saw some declines in the most widely distributed tiers of about 1.5% year-over-year, which we have not seen accelerating since last quarter.
In fact, everywhere we look, we see a landscape of opportunity, as downstream distribution becomes more innovative and competitive. Despite renewed market commentary over the last weeks, we remain of the view that innovation and competition from new entrants and incumbent operators will ameliorate and then reverse the trends as digital rebundling drives overall universe growth.
At STAR, we continue to grow at a good pace, but the timing of some affiliate renewals last year affects this quarter's comparisons. You may recall that we had extraordinary growth last year in Q3 of some 20% in international cable affiliate revenue, so we're comping very nicely against a very high bar.
This year, we grew affiliate revenue in every key region, with some of the pace at FOX Network Group's international channels slowing due to some local events, such as the closure of 2 distributors in Thailand and some other weakness in Southeast Asia.
In the Hotstar platform in India continues to make strides, expanding its watch time over the prior quarter -- over the prior year quarter by 220%. Making it, by some estimates, about 14x the watch time for Netflix.
In Europe, Asia and Latin America, we've introduced innovative nonlinear packages to each of their regions, under the labels Fox Plus and FOX Premium, all tailored for its specific market and offering consumers more choice, a better experience and ultimately, for us, making a better business.
And in the U.S., the digital MVPD revolution has only now reached the starting line. So taken altogether, if we exclude the Film segment which, obviously, didn't have a Deadpool in the quarter, revenue globally grew at about 11%. We think that's a pretty good clip, and it's a testament to the diversity and breadth of the business geographically and by mix. And year-to-date, our EBITDA is up 11%, which underscores how all these comes together with a durable velocity underlying the business.
I want to reiterate that our strategy of focus on big brands that matter for customers and investment on screen that clearly differentiates and earns attention and a program of work to make our programming and products more available, not less, is paying dividends.
Our business has been an expression of a technological advances shaping our industry from way back, from silent movies to talkies, from featured film exhibition to broadcast television and from broadcast to multichannel cable and satellite TV. And the underlying technological advances today, ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end-user connected displays and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally, presents an opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video creators and platforms. We think this is only just the beginning, and the combination of strengths required to operate a high-volume content business and a vast international video platform is precisely the combination of strengths that we're developing.
In short, if content is indeed king, then using it to build platforms that are an expression of these current underlying trends, presents the most promising opportunity for our company in decades.
Now before closing, I'd like to quickly touch upon Sky. The business continues to deliver on its growth strategy, recently reporting good financial performance with subscriber growth across the group. Last month, we welcomed the decision by the European Commission clearing unconditionally our proposed transaction. And we continue to work with U.K. regulators and we're confident that the proposed transaction will be completed by the end of this calendar year, as we've said before.
Thanks very much, and we're happy to take any questions you may have. Reed?"

And really, I think mostly for us, the thing that I'd point out is, number one, the inclusion of our core brands and the investment in those core brands that we've been making over the last couple of years has really worked in terms of inclusion in new virtual MVPDs in every major one. Pretty much all of our brands are there and we see that growing pretty fast over the next number of quarters and years. But to date, it's a pretty small number because you really have really just DIRECTV NOW and Sling in the quarter, and a little bit of Sony. But it's really, now, I think the increased competition, YouTube launching after this quarter, I think it was just in April, and Hulu really just getting out of the gates last week. So it's really just early days there. So what's really driving us more is the fact that we've been investing in these brands and some of our brands are less mature. And we have continued growth in a number of our channels in terms of the existing traditional MVPD subscriber base as well. And I think, actually, only one of our major brands saw any shrinkage in the quarter."

The really pleasing thing from our point of view is how different all the emerging key MVPDs are, and they're targeting different segments of the consumer audience. So between DIRECTV NOW and Sling TV, YouTube, obviously, Hulu and PlayStation Vue, they're all very different services. And we think this is incredibly important because not only are they designed, or many of them are designed to replace traditional MVPD subscriber numbers and losses, but they're targeting entirely new segments of the -- of U.S. households. Segments that don't -- that have broadband now, but potentially don't have traditional MVPD. So that's why it gives us a lot of confidence, as James mentioned in his remarks, that not only will these new services ameliorate decline in traditional MVPDs but will actually grow the universe quite significantly over time."

I think what we're seeing there today, as Lachlan mentioned, an increased level of leadership in terms of our entertainment share. Our sports business is really going from strength to strength, since we've kind of -- since we acquired the half of the ESPN Star Sports joint venture a number of years ago and really reinvented STAR Sports in the marketplace, it's been very, very successful. Not just in cricket, but also with Kavadi and with the Indian Super League, the soccer league there, where they're rounding out the schedule. So feel good about it. I mean, when I look at the marketplace, we obviously had a disruption with the demonetization, as John mentioned. That's largely -- we're largely through that now. It wasn't that big an impact in the last quarter. And we're at the run rate that we need to be at to get to our target at this point. So we feel on target. We feel like the business is in pretty robust health. Creatively, it's performing very, very well, and we feel confident about the overall Indian environment generally. I did note some of those comments. I heard about that, and I was surprised because, at least from our business perspective, we take the view that you'd go into a market like India in the expectation that in success, it's really going to change your life. So you really don't go anything other than the whole hog, and that has really paid off well. We have a very profitable and exciting business there. And I think it speaks to really the differentiation you're seeing across the media sector today. When I look at all the varied performance I think -- I'd urge you to think about all of these firms of different strengths and weaknesses. And our business has been on a very clear path to that, investing in these big brands around the world, being global first, getting exposure to markets that we think in success can really, really move the dial for us and investing on screen for customers in a way that is committed to the best possible content experience they can have. And maybe that's different from other players."

We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of solid growth. The strength of these results generated the highest core earnings per share in the company's history. This record result reflects continued positive progress across our businesses, with revenue and EBITDA growth coming from both our cable networks and Television segments. And whilst earnings at the Film studio decreased, when compared to one of our most profitable film quarters ever in the prior year, when we benefited significantly from Deadpool, they were robust, nonetheless.
Importantly, we have driven our business forward against all our strategic priorities through growing the distribution of our video brands on both traditional and demand emerging platforms, through innovating digital advertising products and partnerships, such as open AP, and most critically to delivering outstanding [ sterling ], sports and news broadcasting.
In fact, the scale and health of our sports and news broadcasting businesses continue to be differentiators for us, with over half the company's advertising revenues earned in these genres. 
Of course, we had an incredible Super Bowl, but we also saw viewership gains for the Daytona 500 on FBC and for MLS Soccer on FOX Sports 1 which, for the first time, beat ESPN2 for an entire month in February.
Additionally, viewership at our regional sports networks continues to be exceptionally strong, with Major League Baseball leading the way. Yankee ratings are up 39% over last season, and the Atlanta Braves' ratings are up over 54% this season so far. The business is in great shape, with all expiring team rights deals satisfactorily renewed.
Not to be outdone, Fox News is the #1 basic cable channel in both total day and primetime viewing for 61 consecutive quarters. In fact, Fox News has delivered its highest rated quarter ever, rating strength we expect to continue.
In scripted programming, our partnerships with the world's best storytellers continue to produce groundbreaking new series that drive the long-term value of our core brands. FX debuted successful first seasons of Taboo, Legion and FEUD, adding to the network's reputation as a creative powerhouse.
National Geographic has made great progress in its goal to more closely align its programming with its brand. The recent Genius premier, from producers Ron Howard and Brian Gracer, Nat Geo's first scripted anthology series, drew over 4 million viewers in the U.S. alone, and was distributed further across the global reach of the National Geographic international channels.
The FOX Broadcasting Network's mixed performance in ratings this season has been frustrating for all, but we are encouraged by our development for the fall and look forward to presenting a strong schedule at our upfront this Monday. Of course, the network does provide our TV studio a powerful launch platform for its shows, and it is important to consider these 2 businesses together. 20th Century Fox Television is coming off a stellar 2016/2017 broadcast season. This past year, our TV studio produced the #1 show on 5 different networks, including Empire on FOX, American Crime Story on FX, Modern Family on ABC, This Is Us on NBC and American Dad! on TBS.
The solid performance of our film studio, with the box office successes of Logan and Hidden Figures, underscores the range and quality of what we bring our audiences. Looking out over the next year, we feel good about our slate with Alien: Covenant, directed by Ridley Scott, coming later this month; followed by War for the Planet of the Apes in July; Kingsman: The Golden Circle, in September; and The Greatest Showman at Christmas. We've also recently announced the June 2018 release of Deadpool 2, something my young boys are wildly looking forward to, but which they won't be allowed to watch.
Turning to our international businesses. The financial impact of the Indian demonetization, we believe, is behind us. But the financial impact has obscured impressive operational progress, most notably STAR India's increasing its viewership lead over our competitors and the continued rise and drive of Hotstar as the emerging platform of choice in India. James will have some more to say about that in a few minutes.
The company continues to attract great new leaders, such as a Amy Listerman, who has joined us as Fox News CFO; and Marianne Gambelli, who has joined us as President of Fox News' Advertising Sales, and we welcome them to the company.
We feel good about where we are and confident that the strategic plan we continue to execute against is differentiating us from our competitors and building long-term value across our businesses.
With that, I'll hand it over to John."

Today, we reported another strong quarter of financial results, posting double-digit gains and adjusted earnings per share and growth in EBITDA, despite the very difficult year-on-year comparisons at our Film",699,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of financial results, posting double-digit gains and adjusted earnings per share and growth in EBITDA, despite the very difficult year-on-year comparisons at our Film segment, which Lachlan referred to.
Third quarter revenues increased $336 million, or 5%, to $7.56 billion, led by higher advertising revenues at the Television segment from the broadcast of this year's Super Bowl and affiliate revenue growth at the Cable Network segment. This was partially offset by slightly lower content revenues at the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.94 billion, a 3% increase from the prior year, reflecting double-digit increases at our Television segment and mid-single-digit growth at the Cable Networks, offset in part by lower Film segment results from the challenging comp to a year ago.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $811 million, or $0.44 per share. This quarter included charges of $142 million reported in other net, which primarily represents the fair value adjustments on currency hedges related to the pending Sky transaction.
Excluding the net income effect in both years of other net, impairment and restructuring and equity earnings adjustments, third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.54, which is a 15% increase over the comparable $0.47 reported a year ago.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the third quarter. The cable network segment reported EBITDA of $1.45 billion, up 5% on revenue growth of 2%, with total segment expenses pretty much unchanged from last year. Domestic cable revenues increased 6%, led by affiliate fee growth of 8%, which reflects higher average rates across all of our brands.
Domestic ad revenues were equal to the prior year, as increases from the rating strength at Fox News and at FS1, were offset by reductions from the non-channel businesses at Nat Geo Partners. EBITDA at our domestic channel was equal to the prior year, as higher revenues were offset by increased investments in programming, most notably the planned investments to support our expansion of original series at FX and the new programming initiative at Nat Geo, as well as contractual sports rights step-ups.
Third quarter reported international cable revenues declined 7%, as lower advertising and syndication revenues were partially offset by mid-single-digit affiliate fee growth. Reported advertising revenues were, as expected, down 18% versus the prior year, principally due to the absence of STAR's prior year broadcast of the ICC T20 World Cup and Asia Cup cricket tournaments and the continued negative impact from India's demonetization initiative. 
Now while the major effects of demonetization are now behind us, it negatively impacted the third quarter revenue by approximately $20 million. Reported international EBITDA contribution increased 44%, primarily due to the lower sports programming cost at STAR and affiliate fee growth.  
At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $190 million increased 52% from last year on revenue increases of 30%. This revenue growth was driven by our broadcast of this year's Super Bowl, where we generated approximately $500 million in gross revenues on Super Bowl Sunday, and from continued retransmission consent revenue growth. These increases more than offset the impact of lower primetime entertainment ratings from the absence of American Idol.
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $373 million was $97 million below a year ago. This quarter's very solid earnings were led by the theatrical releases of Logan and Hidden Figures, and higher television production contributions from the licensing of American Crime Story and Homeland.
The comparisons to last year's third quarter, as Lachlan mentioned, are challenging, since last year included significant contributions from the theatrical release of Deadpool and the home entertainment release of The Martian. These difficult comparisons will continue in the fourth quarter from the ongoing strength of these films last year as well as from the quarter -- quarterly timing of SVOD sales and reduced syndication sales versus last year's fourth quarter.
And finally, from a balance sheet perspective, we continue to accumulate cash reflecting our priority to point our capital toward the planned acquisition of Sky.
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. So as you've heard, the first 9 months of the fiscal year have been strong and we made good progress on a number of fronts. But I just like to spend a minute or 2 addres",962,"Thanks very much, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. So as you've heard, the first 9 months of the fiscal year have been strong and we made good progress on a number of fronts. But I just like to spend a minute or 2 addressing some of the key things we've been seeing in the marketplace and share some thoughts on our priorities going forward.
So a few points to make on the following subjects: the advertising trends and performance, the distribution universe for our video brands and the velocity of the business in terms of revenue that might not be so obvious at first glance.
So first of all, we're very pleased with the advertising performance in the quarter, which grew 16% company-wide year-over-year. Now, obviously, as mentioned, the Super Bowl was a major contributor, which was offset in part by the lack of both the Asia Cup and ICC T20 Championships at STAR, which we had in the comparable quarter last year, and softer demand due to the effect of the demonization, as John mentioned, and the absence of America Idol at FBC, which had its final run on FOX last year. 
But it's important to note that all but one of our U.S. cable brands saw good advertising growth, with only the National Geographic Channel down, which we expected due to our shift in programming strategy that Lachlan talked about earlier. National's scatter remains strong, although local appears a little softer than we'd like, particularly autos. But a month into the fourth quarter, we're looking for at least high-single-digit growth for both our domestic and international cable portfolios.
As for the distribution landscape, a few highlights. Domestically, as John mentioned, we saw affiliate income growth year-on-year of about 8%, an acceleration from the same period last year and from the last quarter, as planned. We expect that growth to continue to accelerate in Q4 and into next year. The U.S. paid subscriber base, for us, was up slightly about 0.5%. But obviously, we saw some declines in the most widely distributed tiers of about 1.5% year-over-year, which we have not seen accelerating since last quarter.
In fact, everywhere we look, we see a landscape of opportunity, as downstream distribution becomes more innovative and competitive. Despite renewed market commentary over the last weeks, we remain of the view that innovation and competition from new entrants and incumbent operators will ameliorate and then reverse the trends as digital rebundling drives overall universe growth.
At STAR, we continue to grow at a good pace, but the timing of some affiliate renewals last year affects this quarter's comparisons. You may recall that we had extraordinary growth last year in Q3 of some 20% in international cable affiliate revenue, so we're comping very nicely against a very high bar.
This year, we grew affiliate revenue in every key region, with some of the pace at FOX Network Group's international channels slowing due to some local events, such as the closure of 2 distributors in Thailand and some other weakness in Southeast Asia.
In the Hotstar platform in India continues to make strides, expanding its watch time over the prior quarter -- over the prior year quarter by 220%. Making it, by some estimates, about 14x the watch time for Netflix.
In Europe, Asia and Latin America, we've introduced innovative nonlinear packages to each of their regions, under the labels Fox Plus and FOX Premium, all tailored for its specific market and offering consumers more choice, a better experience and ultimately, for us, making a better business.
And in the U.S., the digital MVPD revolution has only now reached the starting line. So taken altogether, if we exclude the Film segment which, obviously, didn't have a Deadpool in the quarter, revenue globally grew at about 11%. We think that's a pretty good clip, and it's a testament to the diversity and breadth of the business geographically and by mix. And year-to-date, our EBITDA is up 11%, which underscores how all this comes together with a durable velocity underlying the business.
I want to reiterate that our strategy of focus on big brands that matter for customers and investment on-screen that clearly differentiates and earns attention and a program of work to make our programming and products more available, not less, is paying dividends.
Our business has been an expression of the technological advances shaping our industry from way back, from silent movies to talkies, from featured film exhibition to broadcast television and from broadcast to multichannel cable and satellite TV. And the underlying technological advances today, ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end-user connected displays and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally, presents an opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video creators and platforms. We think this is only just the beginning, and the combination of strengths required to operate a high-volume content business and a vast international video platform is precisely the combination of strengths that we're developing.
In short, if content is indeed king, then using it to build platforms that are an expression of these current underlying trends, presents the most promising opportunity for our company in decades.
Now before closing, I'd like to quickly touch upon Sky. The business continues to deliver on its growth strategy, recently reporting good financial performance with subscriber growth across the group. Last month, we welcomed the decision by the European Commission clearing unconditionally our proposed transaction. And we continue to work with U.K. regulators and we're confident that the proposed transaction will be completed by the end of this calendar year, as we've said before.

But to date, it's a pretty small number because you really have really just DIRECTV NOW and Sling in the quarter, and a little bit of Sony. But it's really, now, I think the increased competition, YouTube launching after this quarter, I think it was just in April, and Hulu really just getting out of the gates last week. So it's really just early days there. So what's really driving this more is the fact that we've been investing in these brands and some of our brands are less mature. And we have continued growth in a number of our channels in terms of the existing traditional MVPD subscriber base as well. And I think, actually, only one of our major brands saw any shrinkage in the quarter."

The really pleasing thing from our point of view is how different all the emerging key MVPDs are, and they're targeting different segments of the consumer audience. So between DIRECTV NOW and Sling TV, YouTube, obviously, Hulu and PlayStation Vue, they're all very different services. And we think this is incredibly important because not only are they designed, or many of them are designed to replace traditional MVPD subscriber numbers and losses, but they're targeting entirely new segments of the -- of U.S. households. Segments that don't -- that have broadband now, but potentially don't have traditional MVPD. So that's why it gives us a lot of confidence, as James mentioned in his remarks, that not only will these new services ameliorate decline in traditional MVPDs but will actually grow the universe quite significantly over time."

I mean, when I look at the marketplace, we obviously had a disruption with the demonetization, as John mentioned. That's largely -- we're largely through that now. It wasn't that big an impact in the last quarter. And we're at the run rate that we need to be at to get to our targets at this point. So we feel on target. We feel like the business is in pretty robust health. Creatively, it's performing very, very well, and we feel confident about the overall Indian environment generally. I did note some of those comments. I heard about that, and I was surprised because, at least from our business perspective, we take the view that you'd go into a market like India in the expectation that in success, it's really going to change your life. So you really don't go anything other than the whole hog, and that has really paid off well. We have a very profitable and exciting business there. And I think it speaks to really the differentiation you're seeing across the media sector today. When I look at all the varied performance I think -- I'd urge you to think about all of these firms of different strengths and weaknesses. And our business has been on a very clear path to that, investing in these big brands around the world, being global first, getting exposure to markets that we think in success can really, really move the dial for us and investing on-screen for customers in a way that is committed to the best possible content experience they can have. And maybe that's different from other players."

We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of solid growth. The strength of these results generated the highest core earnings per share in the company's history. This record result reflects continued positive progress across our businesses, with revenue and EBITDA growth coming from both our cable networks and Television segments. And whilst earnings at the Film studio decreased, when compared to one of our most profitable film quarters ever in the prior year, when we benefited significantly from Deadpool, they were robust, nonetheless.
Importantly, we have driven our business forward against all our strategic priorities through growing the distribution of our video brands on both traditional and demand emerging platforms, through innovating digital advertising products and partnerships, such as open AP, and most critically to delivering outstanding [ sterling ], sports and news broadcasting.
In fact, the scale and health of our sports and news broadcasting businesses continue to be differentiators for us, with over half the company's advertising revenues earned in these genres. 
Of course, we had an incredible Super Bowl, but we also saw viewership gains for the Daytona 500 on FBC and for MLS Soccer on FOX Sports 1 which, for the first time, beat ESPN2 for an entire month in February.
Additionally, viewership at our regional sports networks continues to be exceptionally strong, with Major League Baseball leading the way. Yankee ratings are up 39% over last season, and the Atlanta Braves' ratings are up over 54% this season so far. The business is in great shape, with all expiring team rights deals satisfactorily renewed.
Not to be outdone, Fox News is the #1 basic cable channel in both total day and primetime viewing for 61 consecutive quarters. In fact, Fox News has delivered its highest rated quarter ever, rating strength we expect to continue.
In scripted programming, our partnerships with the world's best storytellers continue to produce groundbreaking new series that drive the long-term value of our core brands. FX debuted successful first seasons of Taboo, Legion and FEUD, adding to the network's reputation as a creative powerhouse.
National Geographic has made great progress in its goal to more closely align its programming with its brand. The recent Genius premier, from producers Ron Howard and Brian Gracer, Nat Geo's first scripted anthology series, drew over 4 million viewers in the U.S. alone, and was distributed further across the global reach of the National Geographic international channels.
The FOX Broadcasting Network's mixed performance in ratings this season has been frustrating for all, but we are encouraged by our development for the fall and look forward to presenting a strong schedule at our upfront this Monday. Of course, the network does provide our TV studio a powerful launch platform for its shows, and it is important to consider these 2 businesses together. 20th Century Fox Television is coming off a stellar 2016/2017 broadcast season. This past year, our TV studio produced the #1 show on 5 different networks, including Empire on FOX, American Crime Story on FX, Modern Family on ABC, This Is Us on NBC and American Dad! on TBS.
The solid performance of our film studio, with the box office successes of Logan and Hidden Figures, underscores the range and quality of what we bring our audiences. Looking out over the next year, we feel good about our slate with Alien: Covenant, directed by Ridley Scott, coming later this month; followed by War for the Planet of the Apes in July; Kingsman: The Golden Circle, in September; and The Greatest Showman at Christmas. We've also recently announced the June 2018 release of Deadpool 2, something my young boys are wildly looking forward to, but which they won't be allowed to watch.
Turning to our international businesses. The financial impact of the Indian demonetization, we believe, is behind us. But the financial impact has obscured impressive operational progress, most notably STAR India's increasing its viewership lead over our competitors and the continued rise and drive of Hotstar as the emerging platform of choice in India. James will have some more to say about that in a few minutes.
The company continues to attract great new leaders, such as a Amy Listerman, who has joined us as Fox News CFO; and Marianne Gambelli, who has joined us as President of Fox News' Advertising Sales, and we welcome them to the company.
We feel good about where we are and confident that the strategic plan we continue to execute against is differentiating us from our competitors and building long-term value across our businesses.
With that, I'll hand it over to John."
91031,426463170,1206340,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, May 10, 2017",2017-05-10,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of financial results, posting double-digit gains and adjusted earnings per share and growth in EBITDA, despite the very difficult year-on-year comparisons at our Film",699,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of financial results, posting double-digit gains and adjusted earnings per share and growth in EBITDA, despite the very difficult year-on-year comparisons at our Film segment, which Lachlan referred to.
Third quarter revenues increased $336 million, or 5%, to $7.56 billion, led by higher advertising revenues at the Television segment from the broadcast of this year's Super Bowl and affiliate revenue growth at the Cable Network segment. This was partially offset by slightly lower content revenues at the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.94 billion, a 3% increase from the prior year, reflecting double-digit increases at our Television segment and mid-single-digit growth at the Cable Networks, offset in part by lower Film segment results from the challenging comp to a year ago.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $811 million, or $0.44 per share. This quarter included charges of $142 million reported in other net, which primarily represents the fair value adjustments on currency hedges related to the pending Sky transaction.
Excluding the net income effect in both years of other net, impairment and restructuring and equity earnings adjustments, third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.54, which is a 15% increase over the comparable $0.47 reported a year ago.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the third quarter. The cable network segment reported EBITDA of $1.45 billion, up 5% on revenue growth of 2%, with total segment expenses pretty much unchanged from last year. Domestic cable revenues increased 6%, led by affiliate fee growth of 8%, which reflects higher average rates across all of our brands.
Domestic ad revenues were equal to the prior year, as increases from the rating strength at Fox News and at FS1, were offset by reductions from the non-channel businesses at Nat Geo Partners. EBITDA at our domestic channel was equal to the prior year, as higher revenues were offset by increased investments in programming, most notably the planned investments to support our expansion of original series at FX and the new programming initiative at Nat Geo, as well as contractual sports rights step-ups.
Third quarter reported international cable revenues declined 7%, as lower advertising and syndication revenues were partially offset by mid-single-digit affiliate fee growth. Reported advertising revenues were, as expected, down 18% versus the prior year, principally due to the absence of STAR's prior year broadcast of the ICC T20 World Cup and Asia Cup cricket tournaments and the continued negative impact from India's demonetization initiative. 
Now while the major effects of demonetization are now behind us, it negatively impacted the third quarter revenue by approximately $20 million. Reported international EBITDA contribution increased 44%, primarily due to the lower sports programming cost at STAR and affiliate fee growth.  
At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $190 million increased 52% from last year on revenue increases of 30%. This revenue growth was driven by our broadcast of this year's Super Bowl, where we generated approximately $500 million in gross revenues on Super Bowl Sunday, and from continued retransmission consent revenue growth. These increases more than offset the impact of lower primetime entertainment ratings from the absence of American Idol.
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $373 million was $97 million below a year ago. This quarter's very solid earnings were led by the theatrical releases of Logan and Hidden Figures, and higher television production contributions from the licensing of American Crime Story and Homeland.
The comparisons to last year's third quarter, as Lachlan mentioned, are challenging, since last year included significant contributions from the theatrical release of Deadpool and the home entertainment release of The Martian. These difficult comparisons will continue in the fourth quarter from the ongoing strength of these films last year as well as from the quarter -- quarterly timing of SVOD sales and reduced syndication sales versus last year's fourth quarter.
And finally, from a balance sheet perspective, we continue to accumulate cash reflecting our priority to point our capital toward the planned acquisition of Sky.
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

So first of all, we're very pleased with the advertising performance in the quarter, which grew 16% company-wide year-over-year. Now, obviously, as mentioned, the Super Bowl was a major contributor, which was offset in part by the lack of both the Asia Cup and ICC T20 Championships at STAR, which we had in the comparable quarter last year, and softer demand due to the effect of the demonization, as John mentioned, and the absence of America Idol at FBC, which had its final run on FOX last year. 
But it's important to note that all but one of our U.S. cable brands saw good advertising growth, with only the National Geographic Channel down, which we expected due to our shift in programming strategy that Lachlan talked about earlier. National's scatter remains strong, although local appears a little softer than we'd like, particularly autos. But a month into the fourth quarter, we're looking for at least high-single-digit growth for both our domestic and international cable portfolios.
As for the distribution landscape, a few highlights. Domestically, as John mentioned, we saw affiliate income growth year-on-year of about 8%, an acceleration from the same period last year and from the last quarter, as planned. We expect that growth to continue to accelerate in Q4 and into next year. The U.S. paid subscriber base, for us, was up slightly about 0.5%. But obviously, we saw some declines in the most widely distributed tiers of about 1.5% year-over-year, which we have not seen accelerating since last quarter.
In fact, everywhere we look, we see a landscape of opportunity, as downstream distribution becomes more innovative and competitive. Despite renewed market commentary over the last weeks, we remain of the view that innovation and competition from new entrants and incumbent operators will ameliorate and then reverse the trends as digital rebundling drives overall universe growth.
At STAR, we continue to grow at a good pace, but the timing of some affiliate renewals last year affects this quarter's comparisons. You may recall that we had extraordinary growth last year in Q3 of some 20% in international cable affiliate revenue, so we're comping very nicely against a very high bar.
This year, we grew affiliate revenue in every key region, with some of the pace at FOX Network Group's international channels slowing due to some local events, such as the closure of 2 distributors in Thailand and some other weakness in Southeast Asia.
In the Hotstar platform in India continues to make strides, expanding its watch time over the prior quarter -- over the prior year quarter by 220%. Making it, by some estimates, about 14x the watch time for Netflix.
In Europe, Asia and Latin America, we've introduced innovative nonlinear packages to each of their regions, under the labels Fox Plus and FOX Premium, all tailored for its specific market and offering consumers more choice, a better experience and ultimately, for us, making a better business.
And in the U.S., the digital MVPD revolution has only now reached the starting line. So taken altogether, if we exclude the Film segment which, obviously, didn't have a Deadpool in the quarter, revenue globally grew at about 11%. We think that's a pretty good clip, and it's a testament to the diversity and breadth of the business geographically and by mix. And year-to-date, our EBITDA is up 11%, which underscores how all this comes together with a durable velocity underlying the business.
I want to reiterate that our strategy of focus on big brands that matter for customers and investment on-screen that clearly differentiates and earns attention and a program of work to make our programming and products more available, not less, is paying dividends.
Our business has been an expression of the technological advances shaping our industry from way back, from silent movies to talkies, from featured film exhibition to broadcast television and from broadcast to multichannel cable and satellite TV. And the underlying technological advances today, ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end-user connected displays and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally, presents an opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video creators and platforms. We think this is only just the beginning, and the combination of strengths required to operate a high-volume content business and a vast international video platform is precisely the combination of strengths that we're developing.
In short, if content is indeed king, then using it to build platforms that are an expression of these current underlying trends, presents the most promising opportunity for our company in decades.
Now before closing, I'd like to quickly touch upon Sky. The business continues to deliver on its growth strategy, recently reporting good financial performance with subscriber growth across the group. Last month, we welcomed the decision by the European Commission clearing unconditionally our proposed transaction. And we continue to work with U.K. regulators and we're confident that the proposed transaction will be completed by the end of this calendar year, as we've said before.
Thanks very much, and we're happy to take any questions you may have. Reed?"

And really, I think mostly for us, the thing that I'd point out is, number one, the inclusion of our core brands and the investment in those core brands that we've been making over the last couple of years has really worked in terms of inclusion in new virtual MVPDs in every major one all--pretty much all of our brands are there and we see that growing pretty fast over the next number of quarters and years. But to date, it's a pretty small number because you really have really just DIRECTV NOW and Sling in the quarter, and a little bit of Sony. But it's really, now, I think the increased competition, YouTube launching after this quarter, I think it was just in April, and Hulu really just getting out of the gates last week. So it's really just early days there. So what's really driving this more is the fact that we've been investing in these brands and some of our brands are less mature. And we have continued growth in a number of our channels in terms of the existing traditional MVPD subscriber base as well. And I think, actually, only one of our major brands saw any shrinkage in the quarter."

The really pleasing thing from our point of view is how different all the emerging key MVPDs are, and they're targeting different segments of the consumer audience. So between DIRECTV NOW and Sling TV, YouTube, obviously, Hulu and PlayStation Vue, they're all very different services. And we think this is incredibly important because not only are they designed, or many of them are designed to replace traditional MVPD subscriber numbers and losses, but they're targeting entirely new segments of the -- of U.S. households. Segments that don't -- that have broadband now, but potentially don't have traditional MVPD. So that's why it gives us a lot of confidence, as James mentioned in his remarks, that not only will these new services ameliorate decline in traditional MVPDs but will actually grow the universe quite significantly over time."

I think what we're seeing there today, as Lachlan mentioned, an increased level of leadership in terms of our entertainment share. Our sports business is really going from strength to strength, since we've kind of -- since we acquired the half of the ESPN Star Sports joint venture a number of years ago and really reinvented STAR Sports in the marketplace, it's been very, very successful. Not just in cricket, but also with Kavadi and with the Indian Super League, the soccer league there, really rounding out the schedule. So feel good about it. I mean, when I look at the marketplace, we obviously had a disruption with the demonetization, as John mentioned. That's largely -- we're largely through that now. It wasn't that big an impact in the last quarter. And we're at the run rate that we need to be at to get to our targets at this point. So we feel on target. We feel like the business is in pretty robust health. Creatively, it's performing very, very well, and we feel confident about the overall Indian environment generally. I did note some of those comments. I heard about that, and I was surprised because, at least from our business perspective, we take the view that you'd go into a market like India in the expectation that in success, it's really going to change your life. So you really don't go anything other than the whole hog, and that has really paid off well. We have a very profitable and exciting business there. And I think it speaks to really the differentiation you're seeing across the media sector today. When I look at all the varied performance I think -- I'd urge you to think about all of these firms of different strengths and weaknesses. And our business has been on a very clear path to that, investing in these big brands around the world, being global first, getting exposure to markets that we think in success can really, really move the dial for us and investing on-screen for customers in a way that is committed to the best possible content experience they can have. And maybe that's different from other players."

And thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. [indiscernible] to us as we sit here in August that our new fiscal year begins with real momentum. The achievements of 2017 set us up well for the next year and beyond.In the last 12 mo",548,"Thanks, Reed. And thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. [indiscernible] to us as we sit here in August that our new fiscal year begins with real momentum. The achievements of 2017 set us up well for the next year and beyond.
In the last 12 months, we delivered 9% full year EBITDA growth, driven by 8% global affiliate fee growth and solid year-over-year growth of 5% in global advertising revenues. As you know, the last few years, we've focused on investments on our core video brands. This has proven to be the right strategy and as a result, these brands are experiencing robust domestic affiliate fee gains reaching 10% for the most recent quarter.
And while it's true the broader industry loss approximately 2% of subscribers over the last year, we have maintained our aggregate subscriber level. This includes subscriber additions from all of the emerging DMVPD products, including from the newest launches, YouTube TV and Hulu Live, as well as growth in our younger channels.
We are excited by the progress of this new marketplace and believe advances in the viewing experience and increased value to customers will provoke further innovation across all platforms and distributors and underscores the core pay TV bundle as the best video proposition for customers.
Creatively as well, 2017 has been a year of achievement for our teams. Our Television studio produced #1 shows on 5 networks, including the biggest new hit of the season, This is Us. And was also a key contributor to FOX broadcast having its highest number of returning shows in a decade, a positive for both businesses.
FEUD and Legion reinforced FX Networks position as a creative leader, highlighted this year -- this past year by the most Emmy wins ever for basic cable channel. James will talk later about how we plan to leverage FX's creative success.
At our Film studio, Logan and Hidden Figures exceeded expectations while serving as great examples of the benefit of original storytelling. 
In news, the FOX News Channel was the most-watched cable network for the last 12 months, during which it achieved its highest rated quarter ever in 24-hour viewership.
We believe that as time shifted on-demand and add freebie and continue to grow in popularity, our strengths and live news and sports globally is a great advantage. 
News and sports, the least likely programming to be watched delayed, comprised more than half of our advertising revenues. In fact, network entertainment programming, while important, accounts for less than 3% of our total revenue.
Underpinning our momentum is a keen focus on our organization with an eye to the future, we have evolved the leadership at our Film business, Fox News and at our national ad sales organization. And have brought in a small handful of senior executives at the corporate level to ensure we empower our businesses globally with the best talent and technology to drive us forward, especially in this time of transformation and opportunity.
We ended fiscal '17 in a strong position by any measure. But importantly, the work we achieved last year, including completing key long-term programming and affiliate deals, provides us with a superb platform for the new fiscal year and for the longer term.
And with that, I hand it over to John."

As Lachlan said, we are very pleased with the overall financial results for the full fiscal year and then I'll start my comments there, followed by more specific comments on the fourth quarter.Total full year",1111,"Great. Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. As Lachlan said, we are very pleased with the overall financial results for the full fiscal year and then I'll start my comments there, followed by more specific comments on the fourth quarter.
Total full year revenues were $28.5 billion, up 4% over last year, led by an 8% increase in worldwide affiliate revenues and a 5% increase in advertising revenue. 
Total full year segment EBITDA was $7.17 billion, up 9% over last year, led by strong growth at both our cable network and Television segments. Overall, unfavorable foreign currency rates reduced our EBITDA results by approximately $105 million and our growth rate by 2 percentage points.
Reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $3 billion this year or $1.61 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.93 this year, up 12%. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 2% over last year led by double-digit growth at our cable networks segment, partially offset by reduced revenues at both the Television and Film segments. 
Total segment EBITDA of $1.45 billion was equal to last year's results, as strong gains at our cable networks were offset by lower Television and Film contributions. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported EPS of $0.27 while adjusted EPS was $0.36, down from a comparable $0.45 last year, which as you will probably remember, included a tax benefit of $0.07 per share from a favorable ruling we received.
Now let me provide some added context on the fourth quarter performance at our operating segments, starting with the cable network segment, where we had very strong results with total segment EBITDA of $1.44 billion, 19% higher than last year on revenue growth of 10%. 
Domestic cable revenue increased 10%, driven by accelerated affiliate fee growth of 10% and strong advertising growth of 6%. The affiliate fee growth was supported by the renewal of 2 major affiliate agreements and the advertising growth primarily reflects higher ratings and pricing at Fox News.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 22%, reflecting the strong revenue growth partially offset by modestly higher programming costs at both the FX Networks and National Geographic. 
Fourth quarter reported international cable revenues increased 11%, driven by 9% growth in affiliate revenue and 9% increase in advertising revenues, which was led by STARs current year broadcast of the ICC Cricket Champions Trophy.
Reported international EBITDA increased 6% over last year as higher contributions from FNG International were partially offset by reduced contributions from STAR due to the expected higher champions trophy costs.
Now turning to our Television segment, fourth quarter EBITDA of $137 million was 5% below last year, has a 4% decline in revenues was partially offset by a similar percent decline in expenses. 
Lower advertising revenues from lower primetime ratings, including comping against the final season of American Idol and a softer local advertising market, were partially offset by continued double-digit growth in retransmission consent revenue.
At the Film segment, we faced difficult comparisons to a year ago. This quarter, we reported an EBITDA loss of $22 million versus $164 million in profits a year ago. This quarter included significant releasing costs for our summer movie slate, including War for the Planet of the Apes and the Alien: Covenant, whereas last year, we had very substantial contributions from Deadpool and The Martian and significantly higher pay TV avails from the timing of prior releases. Additionally, this year, we had lower TV library contributions from international markets.
So, all in all, a strong earnings quarter and year and equally strong cash flow generation for the year, where we delivered $3.4 billion in cash from operations less CapEx, a 22% increase over a year ago. And from a capital standpoint, we ended the fiscal year with $6.2 billion in cash and approximately $20 billion in debt. Our capital allocation priority continues to be focused on funding the Sky acquisition.
So as we look to fiscal 2018, there are several items worth drawing attention to on which we have visibility. Hopefully you notice that we achieved virtually all of the metrics provided for fiscal 2017, and we'd like to again provide a framework for this fiscal year.
At our cable networks, the momentum seen in this past quarter will carry into fiscal 2018. We expect every quarter in fiscal '18 will show at least high single-digit domestic affiliate fee growth and our confidence in this, our largest revenue stream, is underpinned by locked-in contracts. 
Internationally, we're expecting strong total revenue growth, driven by STAR advertising increases, where will continue to generate market leading organic growth, will lap the impact of the demonetization policy and we'll hit the $500 million EBITDA milestone.
On the cable network cost side, we're expecting roughly mid-single-digit expense growth from our core operations. In addition, we'll welcome 2 new sports agreements to our roster, specifically the Big Ten and the Argentine Football Association, as well as broadcasting the next cycle of the World Cup, which will bridge fiscal '18 and '19. 
These new sports events are expected to increase total expense growth to the high single-digit range and for completeness, we'll have a matching gross up in expenses and content revenues owing to the accounting treatment of the new Big 10 contract, where will sublicense certain events to third parties. While this has no impact on net earnings, it will inflate segment reported expense growth by about 2 percentage points.
At the Television segment, we'll have unusual advertising revenue comparisons from several events that either don't recur in fiscal '18 or that we're just not expecting at the same level, notably, we're not broadcasting the Super Bowl in fiscal '18. We'll have 1 less additional NFL divisional playoff game and it's an off-cycle political year. 
Additionally, we're not expecting an epic seven-game World Series nor any local station revenue from spectrum use, both of which we had in fiscal '17.
We will continue to have double-digit retransmission consent growth and the ad revenue impact of the new sporting events. Segment expenses are expected to be flat over the prior year, as low single-digit core growth plus the increases from the new World Cup and Big Ten broadcasts offset the absence of the Super Bowl.
At our Film segment, we have a promising line up of Television series and Film releases, where we end the fiscal year with the release of Deadpool 2 in early June. Additionally, this segment will see the inaugural investments into mobile game development following our acquisition of Aftershock.
And finally, below the line, we expect our reported tax rate to remain in the low 30% range.
And with that, over to James."

So fiscal 2017, as you've heard, finished well, and we've made progress in multiple fronts. So as John just mentioned, while we benefited from a number of notable events in the year, we, nonetheless, expect the underlying velocity to continue. 
But I'd like to talk with you for a few minutes on the direction of the company and the potential to create what we think is really incredible value here, as we enter a new year and look ahead considerably farther than that.
As we simplified our business, focused on these core brands and creative output and directed all of our enterprise to those things, we've started to see good results. As we described earlier, this has been about aligning the company around the future of video. The underlying changes of universal connectivity, the proliferation of connected displays and the potential for untethered access to these creative assets for customers globally and what made possible the acceleration and expansion of engagement with our customers. 
From Hotstar in India to Hulu Live and Sky Go and Sky Q, we've never been able to reach customers and as diverse, flexible and rewarding a fashion as we can now. This is, of course, just the beginning. We've got great confidence in the future of this video business for us.
Our commitment to making our programming more available and not less, combined with the increased and sustained investment and extraordinary storytelling, manifest everywhere in the business. 
Domestically, the new digital MVPD market has already delivered an aggregate 2 plus million subscribers, set new benchmarks in user experience and packaging innovation, and I'm convinced will prove to be a great catalyst increased and accelerated innovation in the sector. And whenever that happens that means growth is coming. 
This week, we announced FX Plus. Comcast Xfinity will offer an on-demand ad free viewing experience with unfettered access to more than 30 current and back library FX and FXX originals for just $5.99 a months. 
And earlier this year, we overhauled our authenticated FOX NOW app available in more than 90 million households domestically. 
In Europe, Asia and Latin America, we've introduced Fox Plus and FOX Premium, then your access to programming and a digital live experience that is second to none. 
And Hotstar set the pace for the streaming market in the world's fastest-growing economy, crossing 1 billion minutes of watch time in a single day during the fourth quarter.
So as you can see, the transformation of the company is not only well underway but is gaining taste. In 2017, across the whole business, the team delivered against almost every metric we established for ourselves. And importantly, this sets us up for greater velocity across the business, especially in the key areas of affiliate revenues, how we license our brands and how we shape new experiences for customers and shape this company to create extraordinary value.
Before turning it over to questions, I'd like to quickly touch upon the Sky transaction. The transaction has been cleared in all of its markets except for the U.K., where the process is still underway and where the U.K. regulator, Ofcom, concluded that the concessions we offered mitigated its morality concerns and further was unequivocal about our commitment to broadcasting standards. We remain confident our transaction will be approved but more likely in the first half of 2018 than before the end of this calendar year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Reed, and we're happy to take whatever questions you have, so thanks."

And as you can see across all the emerging DMVPDs, we've included our -- our brands has been included in these core bundles. Having said that, I think it's not mutually exclusive that you can launch a more highly sort of refined bundle within that. So for instance, for us, with FX+, it's also a service which offer much of the same programming on FX it's on a core bundle, but in a way that's direct-to-consumer in a beneficial way."

It's not mutually exclusive to say that other kinds of bundles and other kinds of packaging are going to live along side that for certain customers who want in a different way. So I think it's all part and parcel of what we've been talking about for a while with you, which is the downstream regional market for our Television is becoming much, much more competitive and that's driving innovation and in terms of customer experience as well as packaging innovation with some narrow bundles and some wider ones. We have really been focusing on the customer experience on how we build and -- how we build these products and how we license our content and brands in the third-party products, but also we remain very open-minded about an independently priced direct-to-consumer offering as well, and we're certainly mindful of what we're seeing in the marketplace. And we're mindful of how these things are progressing for some other firms out there as they on the packaging as well. One thing we found around the world with bundling digital products, be it at Sky Go and NOW TV or at Hotstar, is that constant iterations and constant innovation and experimentation with packaging is really beneficial. And to be able to do that at the high pace, is the best way to build our business and find the best combination. You -- also your question about ad strategy?"

So as John mentioned earlier in his comments, we're well on track for our targets in India of $500 million profit -- of EBITDA next year and thereafter. So no, we don't have any plans to do anything complicated with cricket rights that would jeopardize that. Although when we see any new rights come up, we approach them in a disciplined way and in a way that we think is going to be end of the best thing for customers and for the business. And then in terms of the regional sports networks, subscriber numbers, it's important to remember that we've been able to achieve our regional sports networks inclusion in all of the emerging DMVPDs as their critical viewing for most viewers. And so as such, I think there would be subscriber numbers are down very slightly, so less than 0.5%."

So it's not -- as these things develop, you are always kind of playing that game and as you go along alone with these renewals and these renewal cycles that are not all coming up at the same time, different churns and different opportunities emerge. I think Lachlan's right. I mean, in every way, the good digital MVPD customer and partnership is one that is -- can be more valuable and should be over time. I think that the flexibility it requires -- it gives us for packaging and pricing and advertising innovation is tremendous. And so we find it -- we think is a very, very attractive new entrant category in the marketplace. Much us Fios and U-verse world when they first enter the market as well as when folks started licensing the Ku-band and DB satellites back of the day. So new choice and new competition has always been great for the content business, but you have to invest in the content in a concentrated way to really make it work and make sure that you are desired and a key part of those so called bundles, which is a segue into your second question. Look, the content marketplace is incredibly competitive and always has been. The news marketplace is super competitive right now. And I anticipate it's going to continue to be. I think you already see so much news consumption in the digital world as well. An all-news channels have to deal with that and try to put something together that's really going to matter for their viewers and that they're going to care about. And sports competition is always been very, very intense. We've seen multiple rights holders around the world selling to new entrants had new categories of rights out there. And that's something that we deal with everywhere from the Netherlands to Argentina and in the U.S. and I think digital entrants are a certainty in that marketplace but that doesn't mean that new entrants are necessarily any less or more rational than existing competitors."

It's pleasing to us, as we sit here in August, that our new fiscal year begins with real momentum. The achievements of 2017 set us up well for the next year and beyond.
In the last 12 months, we delivered 9% full year EBITDA growth, driven by 8% global affiliate fee growth and solid year-over-year growth of 5% in global advertising revenues. As you know, the last few years, we've focused our investments on our core video brands. This has proven to be the right strategy, and as a result, these brands are experiencing robust domestic affiliate fee gains, reaching 10% for the most recent quarter.
And while it's true the broader industry loss approximately 2% of subscribers over the last year, we have maintained our aggregate subscriber level. This includes subscriber additions from all of the emerging DMVPD products, including from the newest launches, YouTube TV and Hulu Live, as well as growth in our younger channels.
We are excited by the progress of this new marketplace and believe advances in the viewing experience and increased value to customers will provoke further innovation across all platforms and distributors and underscores the core pay TV bundle as the best video proposition for customers.
Creatively as well, 2017 has been a year of achievement for our teams. Our Television studio produced #1 shows on 5 networks, including the biggest new hit of the season, This is Us. And was also a key contributor to FOX broadcast having its highest number of returning shows in a decade, a positive for both businesses.
FEUD and Legion reinforced FX Networks position as a creative leader, highlighted this year -- this past year by the most Emmy wins ever for basic cable channel. James will talk later about how we plan to leverage FX' creative success.
At our Film studio, Logan and Hidden Figures exceeded expectations while serving as great examples of the benefit of original storytelling. 
In news, the FOX News Channel was the most-watched cable network for the last 12 months, during which it achieved its highest rated quarter ever in 24-hour viewership.
We believe that as time shifted on-demand and add freebie and continue to grow in popularity, our strengths in live news and sports globally is a great advantage. News and sports, the least likely programming to be watched delayed, comprised more than half of our advertising revenues. In fact, network entertainment programming, while important, accounts for less than 3% of our total revenue.
Underpinning our momentum is a keen focus on our organization with an eye to the future, we have evolved the leadership at our Film business, at Fox News and at our national ad sales organization. And have brought in a small handful of senior executives at the corporate level to ensure we empower our businesses globally with the best talent and technology to drive us forward, especially in this time of transformation and opportunity.
We ended fiscal '17 in a strong position by any measure. But importantly, the work we achieved last year, including completing key long-term programming and affiliate deals, provides us with a superb platform for the new fiscal year and for the longer term.
And with that, I'll hand it over to John."

Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. As Lachlan said, we are very pleased with the overall financial results for the full fiscal year, and I'll start my comments there, followed by more specific comments on the fourth quarter.
Total full year revenues were $28.5 billion, up 4% over last year, led by an 8% increase in worldwide affiliate revenues and a 5% increase in advertising revenue. 
Total full year segment EBITDA was $7.17 billion, up 9% over last year, led by strong growth at both our Cable Network and Television segments. Overall, unfavorable foreign currency rates reduced our EBITDA results by approximately $105 million and our growth rate by 2 percentage points.
Reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $3 billion this year or $1.61 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.93 this year, up 12%. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 2% over last year led by double-digit growth at our cable networks segment, partially offset by reduced revenues at both the Television and Film segments. Total segment EBITDA of $1.45 billion was equal to last year's result, as strong gains at our Cable Networks were offset by lower Television and Film contributions. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported EPS of $0.27 while adjusted EPS was $0.36, down from a comparable $0.45 last year, which as you will probably remember, included a tax benefit of $0.07 per share from a favorable ruling we received.
Now let me provide some added context on the fourth quarter performance at our operating segments, starting with the Cable Network segment, where we had very strong results with total segment EBITDA of $1.44 billion, 19% higher than last year on revenue growth of 10%. 
Domestic cable revenue increased 10%, driven by accelerated affiliate fee growth of 10% and strong advertising growth of 6%. The affiliate fee growth was supported by the renewal of 2 major affiliate agreements and the advertising growth primarily reflects higher ratings and pricing at Fox News.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 22%, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by modestly higher programming costs at both the FX Networks and National Geographic. 
Fourth quarter reported international cable revenues increased 11%, driven by 9% growth in affiliate revenue and 9% increase in advertising revenues, which was led by STARs current year broadcast of the ICC Cricket Champions Trophy.
Reported international EBITDA increased 6% over last year as higher contributions from FNG International were partially offset by reduced contributions from STAR, due to the expected higher champions trophy costs.
Now turning to our Television segment, fourth quarter EBITDA of $137 million was 5% below last year, has a 4% decline in revenues was partially offset by a similar percent decline in expenses. 
Lower advertising revenues from lower primetime ratings, including comping against the final season of American Idol and a softer local advertising market, were partially offset by continued double-digit growth in retransmission consent revenue.
At the Film segment, we faced difficult comparisons to a year ago. This quarter, we reported an EBITDA loss of $22 million versus $164 million in profits a year ago. This quarter included significant releasing costs for our summer movie slate, including War for the Planet of the Apes and the Alien: Covenant, whereas last year, we had very substantial contributions from Deadpool and The Martian and significantly higher pay TV avails from the timing of prior releases. Additionally, this year, we had lower TV library contributions from international markets.
So all in all, a strong earnings quarter and year and equally strong cash flow generation for the year, where we delivered $3.4 billion in cash from operations less CapEx, a 22% increase over a year ago. And from a capital standpoint, we ended the fiscal year with $6.2 billion in cash and approximately $20 billion in debt. Our capital allocation priority continues to be focused on funding the Sky acquisition.
So as we look to fiscal 2018, there are several items worth drawing attention to on which we have visibility. Hopefully, you notice that we achieved virtually all of the metrics provided for fiscal 2017, and we'd like to again provide a framework for this fiscal year.
At our cable networks, the momentum seen in this past quarter will carry into fiscal 2018. We expect every quarter in fiscal '18 will show at least high single-digit domestic affiliate fee growth and our confidence in this, our largest revenue stream, is underpinned by locked-in contracts. 
Internationally, we're expecting strong total revenue growth, driven by STAR advertising increases, where we'll continue to generate market leading organic ad growth, we'll lap the impact of the demonetization policy and we'll hit the $500 million EBITDA milestone.
On the cable network cost side, we're expecting roughly mid-single-digit expense growth from our core operations. In addition, we'll welcome 2 new sports agreements to our roster, specifically the Big Ten and the Argentine Football Association, as well as broadcasting the next cycle of the World Cup, which will bridge fiscal '18 and '19. 
These new sports events are expected to increase total expense growth to the high single-digit range. And for completeness, we'll have a matching gross up in expenses and content revenues owing to the accounting treatment of the new Big Ten contract, where we'll sublicense certain events to third parties. While this has no impact on net earnings, it will inflate segment reported expense growth by about 2 percentage points.
At the Television segment, we'll have unusual advertising revenue comparisons from several events that either don't recur in fiscal '18 or that we're just not expecting at the same level, notably, we're not broadcasting the Super Bowl in fiscal '18. We'll have 1 less additional NFL divisional playoff game and it's an off-cycle political year. 
Additionally, we're not expecting an epic seven-game World Series nor any local station revenue from spectrum use, both of which we had in fiscal '17.
We will continue to have double-digit retransmission consent growth and the ad revenue impact of the new sporting events. Segment expenses are expected to be flat over the prior year, as low single-digit core growth plus the increases from the new World Cup and Big Ten broadcasts offset the absence of the Super Bowl.
At our Film segment, we have a promising lineup of Television series and Film releases, where we end the fiscal year with the release of Deadpool 2 in early June. Additionally, this segment will see the inaugural investments into mobile game development following our acquisition of Aftershock.
And finally, below the line, we expect our reported tax rate to remain in the low 30% range.
And with that, over to James."

From Hotstar in India to Hulu Live and Sky Go and Sky Q, we've never been able to reach customers and as diverse, flexible and rewarding a fashion as we can now. This is, of course, just the beginning. We've got great confidence in the future of this video business for us.
Our commitment to making our programming more available and not less, combined with the increased and sustained investment and extraordinary storytelling, manifest everywhere in the business. 
Domestically, the new digital MVPD market has already delivered an aggregate 2-plus million subscribers, set new benchmarks in user experience and packaging innovation, and I'm convinced will prove to be a great catalyst to increase an accelerated innovation in the sector. And whenever that happens that means growth is coming. 
This week, we announced FX+. Comcast Xfinity will offer an on-demand, ad-free viewing experience with unfettered access to more than 30 current and back library FX and FXX originals for just $5.99 a month. 
And earlier this year, we overhauled our authenticated FOX NOW app available in more than 90 million households domestically. 
In Europe, Asia and Latin America, we've introduced FX+ and FOX Premium, nonlinear access to programming and a digital live experience that is second to none. And Hotstar set the pace for the streaming market in the world's fastest-growing economy, crossing 1 billion minutes of watch time in a single day during the fourth quarter.
So as you can see, the transformation of the company is not only well underway but is gaining taste. In 2017, across the whole business, the team delivered against almost every metric we established for ourselves. And importantly, this sets us up for greater velocity across the business, especially in the key areas of affiliate revenues, how we license our brands and how we shape new experiences for customers and shape this company to create extraordinary value.
Before turning it over to questions, I'd like to quickly touch upon the Sky transaction. The transaction has been cleared in all of its markets except for the U.K., where the process is still underway and where the U.K. regulator, Ofcom, concluded that the concessions we offered mitigated its plurality concerns and further was unequivocal about our commitment to broadcasting standards. We remain confident our transaction will be approved but more likely in the first half of 2018 than before the end of this calendar year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Reed, and we're happy to take whatever questions you have, so thanks."

James, we can both tackle these questions. Hi, Jessica. So when we talk about the core bundle, we're fundamentally talking about an offering that allows the consumer to have the highest amount of viewing for the brands and the programming that they want to engage with for lowest possible price. And as you can see across all the emerging DMVPDs, we've included our -- our brands have been included in these core bundles. Having said that, I think it's not mutually exclusive that you can launch a more highly sort of refined bundle within that. So for instance, for us, with FX+, it's also a service which will offer much of the same programming, on FX, it's in a core bundle, but in a way there's direct-to-consumer in a beneficial way."

It's not mutually exclusive to say that other kinds of bundles and other kinds of packaging are going to live along side that for certain customers who want it in a different way. So I think this is just all part and parcel of what we've been talking about for a while with you, which is the downstream retail market for our Television is becoming much, much more competitive and that's driving innovation in both in terms of customer experience as well as packaging innovation with some narrow bundles and some wider ones. We have really been focusing on the customer experience on how we build and -- how we build these products and how we license our content and brands in the third-party products, but also we remain very open-minded about an independently priced direct-to-consumer offering as well, and we're certainly mindful of what we're seeing in the marketplace. And we're mindful of how these things are progressing for some other firms out there as they experiment with packaging as well. One thing we found around the world with bundling digital products, be it at Sky Go and NOW TV or at Hotstar, is that constant iterations and constant innovation and experimentation with packaging is really beneficial. And to be able to do that at a high pace, is the best way to build our business and find the best combination. You -- also your question about ad strategy?"

So as John mentioned earlier in his comments, we're well on track for our targets in India of $500 million of profit -- of EBITDA next year and thereafter. So no, we don't have any plans to do anything complicated with Cricket rights that would jeopardize that. Although when we see any new rights come up, we approach them in a disciplined way and in a way that we think is going to be and of the best thing for our customers and for the business.

I think that the flexibility it requires -- it gives us for packaging and pricing and advertising innovation is tremendous. And so we find it -- we think is a very, very attractive new entrant category in the marketplace. Much us Fios and U-verse were when they first enter the market as well as when folks started licensing more broadly the Ku-band and DBS satellites back in the day. So new choice and new competition has always been great for the content business, but you have to invest in the content in a concentrated way to really make it work and make sure that you are desired and a key part of those so called bundles, which is a segue into your second question. Look, the content marketplace is incredibly competitive and it always has been. The news marketplace is super competitive right now. And I anticipate it's going to continue to be. I think you already see so much news consumption in the digital world as well. And all news channels have to deal with that and try to put something together that's really going to matter for their viewers and that they're going to care about. And sports competition has always been very, very intense. We've seen multiple rights holders around the world selling to new entrants and new categories of rights out there. And that's something that we deal with everywhere from the Netherlands to Argentina and in the U.S., and I think digital entrants are a certainty in that marketplace, but that doesn't mean that new entrants are necessarily any less or more rational than existing competitors."

It's pleasing to us, as we sit here in August, that our new fiscal year begins with real momentum. The achievements of 2017 set us up well for the next year and beyond.
In the last 12 months, we delivered 9% full year EBITDA growth, driven by 8% global affiliate fee growth and solid year-over-year growth of 5% in global advertising revenues. As you know, the last few years, we've focused our investments on our core video brands. This has proven to be the right strategy, and as a result, these brands are experiencing robust domestic affiliate fee gains, reaching 10% for the most recent quarter.
And while it's true the broader industry loss approximately 2% of subscribers over the last year, we have maintained our aggregate subscriber level. This includes subscriber additions from all of the emerging DMVPD products, including from the newest launches, YouTube TV and Hulu Live, as well as growth in our younger channels.
We are excited by the progress of this new marketplace and believe advances in the viewing experience and increased value to customers will provoke further innovation across all platforms and distributors and underscores the core pay TV bundle as the best video proposition for customers.
Creatively as well, 2017 has been a year of achievement for our teams. Our Television studio produced #1 shows on 5 networks, including the biggest new hit of the season, This is Us. And was also a key contributor to FOX broadcast having its highest number of returning shows in a decade, a positive for both businesses.
FEUD and Legion reinforced FX Networks position as a creative leader, highlighted this year -- this past year by the most Emmy wins ever for basic cable channel. James will talk later about how we plan to leverage FX' creative success.
At our Film studio, Logan and Hidden Figures exceeded expectations while serving as great examples of the benefit of original storytelling. 
In news, the FOX News Channel was the most-watched cable network for the last 12 months, during which it achieved its highest rated quarter ever in 24-hour viewership.
We believe that as time shifted on-demand and add freebie and continue to grow in popularity, our strengths in live news and sports globally is a great advantage. News and sports, the least likely programming to be watched delayed, comprised more than half of our advertising revenues. In fact, network entertainment programming, while important, accounts for less than 3% of our total revenue.
Underpinning our momentum is a keen focus on our organization with an eye to the future, we have evolved the leadership at our Film business, at Fox News and at our national ad sales organization. And have brought in a small handful of senior executives at the corporate level to ensure we empower our businesses globally with the best talent and technology to drive us forward, especially in this time of transformation and opportunity.
We ended fiscal '17 in a strong position by any measure. But importantly, the work we achieved last year, including completing key long-term programming and affiliate deals, provides us with a superb platform for the new fiscal year and for the longer term.
And with that, I'll hand it over to John."

Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. As Lachlan said, we are very pleased with the overall financial results for the full fiscal year, and I'll start my comments there, followed by more specific comments on the fourth quarter.
Total full year revenues were $28.5 billion, up 4% over last year, led by an 8% increase in worldwide affiliate revenues and a 5% increase in advertising revenue. 
Total full year segment EBITDA was $7.17 billion, up 9% over last year, led by strong growth at both our Cable Network and Television segments. Overall, unfavorable foreign currency rates reduced our EBITDA results by approximately $105 million and our growth rate by 2 percentage points.
Reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $3 billion this year or $1.61 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.93 this year, up 12%. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 2% over last year led by double-digit growth at our cable networks segment, partially offset by reduced revenues at both the Television and Film segments. Total segment EBITDA of $1.45 billion was equal to last year's result, as strong gains at our Cable Networks were offset by lower Television and Film contributions. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported EPS of $0.27 while adjusted EPS was $0.36, down from a comparable $0.45 last year, which as you will probably remember, included a tax benefit of $0.07 per share from a favorable ruling we received.
Now let me provide some added context on the fourth quarter performance at our operating segments, starting with the Cable Network segment, where we had very strong results with total segment EBITDA of $1.44 billion, 19% higher than last year on revenue growth of 10%. 
Domestic cable revenue increased 10%, driven by accelerated affiliate fee growth of 10% and strong advertising growth of 6%. The affiliate fee growth was supported by the renewal of 2 major affiliate agreements and the advertising growth primarily reflects higher ratings and pricing at Fox News.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 22%, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by modestly higher programming costs at both the FX Networks and National Geographic. 
Fourth quarter reported international cable revenues increased 11%, driven by 9% growth in affiliate revenue and 9% increase in advertising revenues, which was led by STARs current year broadcast of the ICC Cricket Champions Trophy.
Reported international EBITDA increased 6% over last year as higher contributions from FNG International were partially offset by reduced contributions from STAR, due to the expected higher champions trophy costs.
Now turning to our Television segment, fourth quarter EBITDA of $137 million was 5% below last year, has a 4% decline in revenues was partially offset by a similar percent decline in expenses. 
Lower advertising revenues from lower primetime ratings, including comping against the final season of American Idol and a softer local advertising market, were partially offset by continued double-digit growth in retransmission consent revenue.
At the Film segment, we faced difficult comparisons to a year ago. This quarter, we reported an EBITDA loss of $22 million versus $164 million in profits a year ago. This quarter included significant releasing costs for our summer movie slate, including War for the Planet of the Apes and the Alien: Covenant, whereas last year, we had very substantial contributions from Deadpool and The Martian and significantly higher pay TV avails from the timing of prior releases. Additionally, this year, we had lower TV library contributions from international markets.
So all in all, a strong earnings quarter and year and equally strong cash flow generation for the year, where we delivered $3.4 billion in cash from operations less CapEx, a 22% increase over a year ago. And from a capital standpoint, we ended the fiscal year with $6.2 billion in cash and approximately $20 billion in debt. Our capital allocation priority continues to be focused on funding the Sky acquisition.
So as we look to fiscal 2018, there are several items worth drawing attention to on which we have visibility. Hopefully, you notice that we achieved virtually all of the metrics provided for fiscal 2017, and we'd like to again provide a framework for this fiscal year.
At our cable networks, the momentum seen in this past quarter will carry into fiscal 2018. We expect every quarter in fiscal '18 will show at least high single-digit domestic affiliate fee growth and our confidence in this, our largest revenue stream, is underpinned by locked-in contracts. 
Internationally, we're expecting strong total revenue growth, driven by STAR advertising increases, where we'll continue to generate market leading organic ad growth, we'll lap the impact of the demonetization policy and we'll hit the $500 million EBITDA milestone.
On the cable network cost side, we're expecting roughly mid-single-digit expense growth from our core operations. In addition, we'll welcome 2 new sports agreements to our roster, specifically the Big Ten and the Argentine Football Association, as well as broadcasting the next cycle of the World Cup, which will bridge fiscal '18 and '19. 
These new sports events are expected to increase total expense growth to the high single-digit range. And for completeness, we'll have a matching gross up in expenses and content revenues owing to the accounting treatment of the new Big Ten contract, where we'll sublicense certain events to third parties. While this has no impact on net earnings, it will inflate segment reported expense growth by about 2 percentage points.
At the Television segment, we'll have unusual advertising revenue comparisons from several events that either don't recur in fiscal '18 or that we're just not expecting at the same level, notably, we're not broadcasting the Super Bowl in fiscal '18. We'll have 1 less additional NFL divisional playoff game and it's an off-cycle political year. 
Additionally, we're not expecting an epic seven-game World Series nor any local station revenue from spectrum use, both of which we had in fiscal '17.
We will continue to have double-digit retransmission consent growth and the ad revenue impact of the new sporting events. Segment expenses are expected to be flat over the prior year, as low single-digit core growth plus the increases from the new World Cup and Big Ten broadcasts offset the absence of the Super Bowl.
At our Film segment, we have a promising lineup of Television series and Film releases, where we end the fiscal year with the release of Deadpool 2 in early June. Additionally, this segment will see the inaugural investments into mobile game development following our acquisition of Aftershock.
And finally, below the line, we expect our reported tax rate to remain in the low 30% range.
And with that, over to James."

So fiscal 2017, as you've heard, finished well, and we've made progress in multiple fronts. So as John just mentioned, while we benefited from a number of notable events in the year, we, nonetheless, expect the underlying velocity to continue. 
But I'd like to talk with you for a few minutes on the direction of the company and the potential to create what we think is really incredible value here, as we enter a new year and look ahead considerably farther than that.
As we simplified our business, focused on these core brands and creative output and directed all of our enterprise to those things, we've started to see good results. As we described earlier, this has been about aligning the company around the future of video. The underlying changes of universal connectivity, the proliferation of connected displays and the potential for unfettered access to these creative assets for customers globally are what made possible the acceleration and expansion of engagement with our customers. 
From Hotstar in India to Hulu Live and Sky Go and Sky Q, we've never been able to reach customers and as diverse, flexible and rewarding a fashion as we can now. This is, of course, just the beginning. We've got great confidence in the future of this video business for us.
Our commitment to making our programming more available and not less, combined with the increased and sustained investment in extraordinary storytelling, manifest everywhere in the business. 
Domestically, the new digital MVPD market has already delivered an aggregate 2-plus million subscribers, set new benchmarks in user experience and packaging innovation, and I'm convinced will prove to be a great catalyst to increase an accelerated innovation in the sector. And whenever that happens that means growth is coming. 
This week, we announced FX+. Comcast Xfinity will offer an on-demand, ad-free viewing experience with unfettered access to more than 30 current and back library FX and FXX originals for just $5.99 a month. 
And earlier this year, we overhauled our authenticated FOX NOW app available in more than 90 million households domestically. 
In Europe, Asia and Latin America, we've introduced FX+ and FOX Premium, nonlinear access to programming and a digital live experience that is second to none. And Hotstar set the pace for the streaming market in the world's fastest-growing economy, crossing 1 billion minutes of watch time in a single day during the fourth quarter.
So as you can see, the transformation of the company is not only well underway but is gaining pace. In 2017, across the whole business, the team delivered against almost every metric we established for ourselves. And importantly, this sets us up for greater velocity across the business, especially in the key areas of affiliate revenues, how we license our brands and how we shape new experiences for customers and shape this company to create extraordinary value.
Before turning it over to questions, I'd like to quickly touch upon the Sky transaction. The transaction has been cleared in all of its markets except for the U.K., where the process is still underway and where the U.K. regulator, Ofcom, concluded that the concessions we offered mitigated its plurality concerns and further was unequivocal about our commitment to broadcasting standards. We remain confident our transaction will be approved but more likely in the first half of 2018 than before the end of this calendar year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Reed, and we're happy to take whatever questions you have, so thanks."

So when we talk about the core bundle, we're fundamentally talking about an offering that allows the consumer to have the highest amount of viewing for the brands and the programming that they want to engage with for the lowest possible price. And so you can see across all the emerging DMVPDs, we've included our -- our brands have been included in these core bundles. Having said that, I think it's not mutually exclusive that you can launch a more highly sort of refined bundle within that. So for instance, for us, with FX+, it's also a service which will offer much of the same programming, on FX, it's in a core bundle, but in a way there's direct-to-consumer in a beneficial way."

It's not mutually exclusive to say that other kinds of bundles and other kinds of packaging are going to live along side that for certain customers who want it in a different way. So I think this is just all part and parcel of what we've been talking about for a while with you, which is the downstream retail market for our Television is becoming much, much more competitive and that's driving innovation in both in terms of customer experience as well as packaging innovation with some narrow bundles and some wider ones. We have really been focusing on the customer experience on how we build and -- how we build these products and how we license our content and brands into third-party products, but also we remain very open-minded about an independently priced direct-to-consumer offering as well, and we're certainly mindful of what we're seeing in the marketplace. And we're mindful of how these things are progressing for some other firms out there as they experiment with packaging as well. One thing we found around the world with bundling digital products, be it at Sky Go and NOW TV or at Hotstar, is that constant iterations and constant innovation and experimentation with packaging is really beneficial. And to be able to do that at a high pace, is the best way to build our business and find the best combination. You -- also your question about ad strategy?"

Or any divergence there versus your more general cable networks?"

From time to time, new rights are available in the market, and I would just say to you that, the STAR Sports, Cricket portfolio is very strong right now. If we could really strengthen it, we'd look to do so, but we'll be very disciplined about that, and we certainly don't want to be -- we don't want to do things that are going to make a problem in terms of our near-term and longer-term goals for the business. So as John mentioned earlier in his comments, we're well on track for our targets in India of $500 million of profit -- of EBITDA next year and thereafter. So no, we don't have any plans to do anything complicated with Cricket rights that would jeopardize that. Although when we see any new rights come up, we approach them in a disciplined way and in a way that we think is going to be -- and of the best thing for our customers and for the business."

So amongst the traditional MVPDs, there are some that we would much prefer to steal customers from others. So it's not -- as these things develop, you're always kind of playing that game. And as you go along alone with these renewals and these renewal cycles that are not all coming up at the same time, different terms and different opportunities emerge. I think Lachlan's right. I mean, in every way, the digital MVPD customer and partnership is one that is -- can be more valuable and should be over time. I think that the flexibility it requires -- it gives us for packaging and pricing and advertising innovation is tremendous. And so we find it -- we think is a very, very attractive new entrant category in the marketplace. Much us Fios and U-verse were when they first enter the market as well as when folks started licensing more broadly the Ku-band and DBS satellites back in the day. So new choice and new competition has always been great for the content business, but you have to invest in the content in a concentrated way to really make it work and make sure that you are desired and a key part of those so called bundles, which is a segue into your second question. Look, the content marketplace is incredibly competitive and it always has been. The news marketplace is super competitive right now. And I anticipate it's going to continue to be. I think you already see so much news consumption in the digital world as well. And all news channels have to deal with that and try to put something together that's really going to matter for their viewers and that they're going to care about. And sports competition has always been very, very intense. We've seen multiple rights holders around the world selling to new entrants and new categories of rights out there. And that's something that we deal with everywhere from the Netherlands to Argentina and in the U.S., and I think digital entrants are a certainty in that marketplace, but that doesn't mean that new entrants are necessarily any less or more rational than existing competitors."

We generally look at minority stakes and investments there as both either opportunistic, where we think there's a new category or brand or something that's going to be successful that there's opportunities to work together with them as well. And there might be a small investment or an investment that goes along with that. But also, I think we look at it over time and say, what's the -- how do we exit those? Can we create a return around those? So it's a mixed. We have an investment, as you mentioned, in Vice, which we're excited about. We think that's a great company and is doing really well. We also have investments in some virtual-reality innovators, where a minority was available and a partnership could be struck, and we think we could really learn and build capabilities amongst ourselves and create value on both sides. Roku, I think, is another good example of that. So there's been a variety of places where that's been effective, but it's not a -- we don't have a sort of approach to it as a venture capital operation like some other firms in our space do. It's more opportunistic, and we try to do it less often because we really like to keep our business sample and we like to keep it straightforward as we've discussed, and we've really made a lot of progress on that over the last number of years. But sometimes it's a -- it is the way things work. Tata Sky is another good example where, from a regulatory perspective, we couldn't own more of it than a certain amount, but we think it's really important to drive that business froward and great for the Indian Television marketplace and for our business there. So it's a mix set of rational, but something that we would generally prefer to focus on our core operations than in investment portfolio."

It's pleasing to us, as we sit here in August, that our new fiscal year begins with real momentum. The achievements of 2017 set us up well for the next year and beyond.
In the last 12 months, we delivered 9% full year EBITDA growth, driven by 8% global affiliate fee growth and solid year-over-year growth of 5% in global advertising revenues. As you know, the last few years, we've focused our investments on our core video brands. This has proven to be the right strategy, and as a result, these brands are experiencing robust domestic affiliate fee gains, reaching 10% for the most recent quarter.
And while it's true the broader industry loss approximately 2% of subscribers over the last year, we have maintained our aggregate subscriber level. This includes subscriber additions from all of the emerging DMVPD products, including from the newest launches, YouTube TV and Hulu Live as well as growth in our younger channels.
We are excited by the progress of this new marketplace and believe advances in the viewing experience and increased value to customers will provoke further innovation across all platforms and distributors and underscores the core pay TV bundle as the best video proposition for customers.
Creatively as well, 2017 has been a year of achievement for our teams. Our Television studio produced #1 shows on 5 networks, including the biggest new hit of the season, This is Us. And was also a key contributor to FOX broadcast having its highest number of returning shows in a decade, a positive for both businesses.
FEUD and Legion reinforced FX Networks position as a creative leader, highlighted this year -- this past year by the most Emmy wins ever for basic cable channel. James will talk later about how we plan to leverage FX' creative success.
At our Film studio, Logan and Hidden Figures exceeded expectations while serving as great examples of the benefit of original storytelling. 
In news, the FOX News Channel was the most-watched cable network for the last 12 months, during which it achieved its highest rated quarter ever in 24-hour viewership.
We believe that as time shifted on-demand and add freebie and continue to grow in popularity, our strengths in live news and sports globally is a great advantage. News and sports, the least likely programming to be watched delayed, comprised more than half of our advertising revenues. In fact, network entertainment programming, while important, accounts for less than 3% of our total revenue.
Underpinning our momentum is a keen focus on our organization with an eye to the future, we have evolved the leadership at our Film business, at Fox News and at our national ad sales organization. And have brought in a small handful of senior executives at the corporate level to ensure we empower our businesses globally with the best talent and technology to drive us forward, especially in this time of transformation and opportunity.
We ended fiscal '17 in a strong position by any measure. But importantly, the work we achieved last year, including completing key long-term programming and affiliate deals, provides us with a superb platform for the new fiscal year and for the longer term.
And with that, I'll hand it over to John."

Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. As Lachlan said, we are very pleased with the overall financial results for the full fiscal year, and I'll start my comments there, followed by more specific comments on the fourth quarter.
Total full year revenues were $28.5 billion, up 4% over last year, led by an 8% increase in worldwide affiliate revenues and a 5% increase in advertising revenue. 
Total full year segment EBITDA was $7.17 billion, up 9% over last year, led by strong growth at both our Cable Network and Television segments. Overall, unfavorable foreign currency rates reduced our EBITDA results by approximately $105 million and our growth rate by 2 percentage points.
Reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $3 billion this year or $1.61 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.93 this year, up 12%. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 2% over last year led by double-digit growth at our cable networks segment, partially offset by reduced revenues at both the Television and Film segments. Total segment EBITDA of $1.45 billion was equal to last year's result, as strong gains at our Cable Networks were offset by lower Television and Film contributions. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported EPS of $0.27 while adjusted EPS was $0.36, down from a comparable $0.45 last year, which as you will probably remember, included a tax benefit of $0.07 per share from a favorable ruling we received.
Now let me provide some added context on the fourth quarter performance at our operating segments, starting with the Cable Network segment, where we had very strong results with total segment EBITDA of $1.44 billion, 19% higher than last year on revenue growth of 10%. 
Domestic cable revenue increased 10%, driven by accelerated affiliate fee growth of 10% and strong advertising growth of 6%. The affiliate fee growth was supported by the renewal of 2 major affiliate agreements and the advertising growth primarily reflects higher ratings and pricing at Fox News.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 22%, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by modestly higher programming costs at both the FX Networks and National Geographic. 
Fourth quarter reported international cable revenues increased 11%, driven by 9% growth in affiliate revenue and 9% increase in advertising revenues, which was led by STARs current year broadcast of the ICC Cricket Champions Trophy.
Reported international EBITDA increased 6% over last year as higher contributions from FNG International were partially offset by reduced contributions from STAR, due to the expected higher champions trophy costs.
Now turning to our Television segment, fourth quarter EBITDA of $137 million was 5% below last year, has a 4% decline in revenues was partially offset by a similar percent decline in expenses. 
Lower advertising revenues from lower primetime ratings, including comping against the final season of American Idol and a softer local advertising market, were partially offset by continued double-digit growth in retransmission consent revenue.
At the Film segment, we faced difficult comparisons to a year ago. This quarter, we reported an EBITDA loss of $22 million versus $164 million in profits a year ago. This quarter included significant releasing costs for our summer movie slate, including War for the Planet of the Apes and the Alien: Covenant, whereas last year, we had very substantial contributions from Deadpool and The Martian and significantly higher pay TV avails from the timing of prior releases. Additionally, this year, we had lower TV library contributions from international markets.
So all in all, a strong earnings quarter and year and equally strong cash flow generation for the year, where we delivered $3.4 billion in cash from operations less CapEx, a 22% increase over a year ago. And from a capital standpoint, we ended the fiscal year with $6.2 billion in cash and approximately $20 billion in debt. Our capital allocation priority continues to be focused on funding the Sky acquisition.
So as we look to fiscal 2018, there are several items worth drawing attention to on which we have visibility. Hopefully, you notice that we achieved virtually all of the metrics provided for fiscal 2017, and we'd like to again provide a framework for this fiscal year.
At our cable networks, the momentum seen in this past quarter will carry into fiscal 2018. We expect every quarter in fiscal '18 will show at least high single-digit domestic affiliate fee growth and our confidence in this, our largest revenue stream, is underpinned by locked-in contracts. 
Internationally, we're expecting strong total revenue growth, driven by STAR advertising increases, where we'll continue to generate market leading organic ad growth, we'll lap the impact of the demonetization policy and we'll hit the $500 million EBITDA milestone.
On the cable network cost side, we're expecting roughly mid-single-digit expense growth from our core operations. In addition, we'll welcome 2 new sports agreements to our roster, specifically the Big Ten and the Argentine Football Association as well as broadcasting the next cycle of the World Cup, which will bridge fiscal '18 and '19. 
These new sports events are expected to increase total expense growth to the high single-digit range. And for completeness, we'll have a matching gross up in expenses and content revenues owing to the accounting treatment of the new Big Ten contract, where we'll sublicense certain events to third parties. While this has no impact on net earnings, it will inflate segment reported expense growth by about 2 percentage points.
At the Television segment, we'll have unusual advertising revenue comparisons from several events that either don't recur in fiscal '18 or that we're just not expecting at the same level, notably, we're not broadcasting the Super Bowl in fiscal '18. We'll have 1 less additional NFL divisional playoff game and it's an off-cycle political year. 
Additionally, we're not expecting an epic seven-game World Series nor any local station revenue from spectrum use, both of which we had in fiscal '17.
We will continue to have double-digit retransmission consent growth and the ad revenue impact of the new sporting events. Segment expenses are expected to be flat over the prior year, as low single-digit core growth plus the increases from the new World Cup and Big Ten broadcasts offset the absence of the Super Bowl.
At our Film segment, we have a promising lineup of Television series and Film releases, where we end the fiscal year with the release of Deadpool 2 in early June. Additionally, this segment will see the inaugural investments into mobile game development following our acquisition of Aftershock.
And finally, below the line, we expect our reported tax rate to remain in the low 30% range.
And with that, over to James."

So fiscal 2017, as you've heard, finished well, and we've made progress in multiple fronts. So as John just mentioned, while we benefited from a number of notable events in the year, we, no",593,"Thanks very much, John and Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. So fiscal 2017, as you've heard, finished well, and we've made progress in multiple fronts. So as John just mentioned, while we benefited from a number of notable events in the year, we, nonetheless, expect the underlying velocity to continue. 
But I'd like to talk with you for a few minutes on the direction of the company and the potential to create what we think is really incredible value here, as we enter a new year and look ahead considerably farther than that.
As we simplified our business, focused on these core brands and creative output and directed all of our enterprise to those things, we've started to see good results. As we described earlier, this has been about aligning the company around the future of video. The underlying changes of universal connectivity, the proliferation of connected displays and the potential for unfettered access to these creative assets for customers globally are what made possible the acceleration and expansion of engagement with our customers. 
From Hotstar in India to Hulu Live and Sky Go and Sky Q, we've never been able to reach customers and as diverse, flexible and rewarding a fashion as we can now. This is, of course, just the beginning. We've got great confidence in the future of this video business for us.
Our commitment to making our programming more available and not less, combined with the increased and sustained investment in extraordinary storytelling, manifest everywhere in the business. 
Domestically, the new digital MVPD market has already delivered an aggregate 2-plus million subscribers, set new benchmarks in user experience and packaging innovation, and I'm convinced will prove to be a great catalyst to increase an accelerated innovation in the sector. And whenever that happens that means growth is coming. 
This week, we announced FX+. Comcast Xfinity will offer an on-demand, ad-free viewing experience with unfettered access to more than 30 current and back library FX and FXX originals for just $5.99 a month. 
And earlier this year, we overhauled our authenticated FOX NOW app available in more than 90 million households domestically. 
In Europe, Asia and Latin America, we've introduced FX+ and FOX Premium, nonlinear access to programming and a digital live experience that is second to none. And Hotstar set the pace for the streaming market in the world's fastest-growing economy, crossing 1 billion minutes of watch time in a single day during the fourth quarter.
So as you can see, the transformation of the company is not only well underway but is gaining pace. In 2017, across the whole business, the team delivered against almost every metric we established for ourselves. And importantly, this sets us up for greater velocity across the business, especially in the key areas of affiliate revenues, how we license our brands and how we shape new experiences for customers and shape this company to create extraordinary value.
Before turning it over to questions, I'd like to quickly touch upon the Sky transaction. The transaction has been cleared in all of its markets except for the U.K., where the process is still underway and where the U.K. regulator, Ofcom, concluded that the concessions we offered mitigated its plurality concerns and further was unequivocal about our commitment to broadcasting standards. We remain confident our transaction will be approved but more likely in the first half of 2018 than before the end of this calendar year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Reed, and we're happy to take whatever questions you have, so thanks."

James, you and I can both tackle these questions. Hi, Jessica. So when we talk about the core bundle, we're fundamentally talking about an offering that allows the consumer to have the highest amount of viewing for the brands and the programming that they want to engage with for the lowest possible price. And so you can see across all the emerging DMVPDs, we've included our -- our brands have been included in these core bundles. Having said that, I think it's not mutually exclusive that you can launch a more highly sort of refined bundle within that. So for instance, for us, with FX+, it's also a service which will offer much of the same programming, on FX, it's in a core bundle, but in a way there's direct-to-consumer in a beneficial way."

So it's a real positive for customers and it's very much in line we're trying to make our products more available and not less. I think Lachlan's right. It's not mutually exclusive to say that other kinds of bundles and other kinds of packaging are going to live alongside that for certain customers who want it in a different way. So I think this is just all part and parcel of what we've been talking about for a while with you, which is the downstream retail market for our Television is becoming much, much more competitive and that's driving innovation in both in terms of customer experience as well as packaging innovation with some narrow bundles and some wider ones. We have really been focusing on the customer experience on how we build and -- how we build these products and how we license our content and brands into third-party products, but also we remain very open-minded about an independently priced direct-to-consumer offering as well, and we're certainly mindful of what we're seeing in the marketplace. And we're mindful of how these things are progressing for some other firms out there as they experiment with packaging as well. One thing we found around the world with bundling digital products, be it at Sky Go and NOW TV or at Hotstar, is that constant iterations and constant innovation and experimentation with packaging is really beneficial. And to be able to do that at a high pace, is the best way to build our business and find the best combination. You -- also your question about ad strategy?"

And a growing amount is viewed, obviously, on our own apps and a slightly shrinking amount is viewed on sort of delayed sort of nonstreaming DVR's and whatnot. So within this environment, we've achieved a lot of success in terms of streaming advertising and nonlinear advertising. I think this past year alone, our nonlinear advertising has grown by 30% and within that, our advanced advertising products revenue has grown by 40%, which is something that's really pleasing to us."

Much us Fios and U-verse were when they first enter the market as well as when folks started licensing more broadly the Ku-band and DBS satellites back in the day.

Look, the content marketplace is incredibly competitive and it always has been. The news marketplace is super competitive right now. And I anticipate it's going to continue to be. I think you already see so much news consumption in the digital world as well. And all news channels have to deal with that and try to put something together that's really going to matter for their viewers and that they're going to care about. And sports competition has always been very, very intense. We've seen multiple rights holders around the world selling to new entrants and new categories of rights out there. And that's something that we deal with everywhere from the Netherlands to Argentina and in the U.S., and I think digital entrants are a certainty in that marketplace, but that doesn't mean that new entrants are necessarily any less or more rational than existing competitors."

We generally look at minority stakes and investments there as both either opportunistic, where we think there's a new category or brand or something that's going to be successful that there's opportunities to work together with them as well. And there might be a small investment or an investment that goes along with that. But also, I think we look at it over time and say, what's the -- how do we exit those? Can we create a return around those? So it's a mixed. We have an investment, as you mentioned, in Vice, which we're excited about. We think that's a great company and is doing really well. We also have investments in some virtual-reality innovators, where a minority was available and a partnership could be struck, and we think we could really learn and build capabilities amongst ourselves and create value on both sides. Roku, I think, is another good example of that. So there's been a variety of places where that's been effective, but it's not a -- we don't have a sort of approach to it as a venture capital operation like some other firms in our space do. It's more opportunistic, and we try to do it less often because we really like to keep our business sample and we like to keep it straightforward as we've discussed, and we've really made a lot of progress on that over the last number of years. But sometimes it's a -- it is the way things work. Tata Sky is another good example where, from a regulatory perspective, we couldn't own more of it than a certain amount, but we think it's really important to drive that business forward and great for the Indian Television marketplace and for our business there. So it's a mix set of rational, but something that we would generally prefer to focus on our core operations than in investment portfolio."

Let me be very clear upfront that we have a long-standing policy of not commentating -- commenting on speculation around corporate activity or transactions. 
We will continue to adhere to that policy, meaning that we will not be responding at all to questions or comments regarding recent press speculation. 
The purpose of this call is to focus on the growing and robust business of 21st Century Fox. We are pleased to report a solid start to fiscal 2018, which continues the operational and financial progress we delivered in fiscal '17. 
In the last quarter, we delivered 8% top line growth with increases across all our reporting segments and revenue categories. We drove an acceleration in domestic affiliate revenue, which grew by 11%, sequentially surpassing the strong 10% growth in the prior quarter. 
We maintained our aggregate domestic subscriber levels, offsetting declines in the traditional pay TV universe, with growing contribution from our growing channel and our new digital MVPD partners. 
The latter now approaches 3 million subscribers despite only limited marketing for their products so far. 
We talk often about our unique competitive advantage of our strength in local and national sports and news, an environment with increased viewing optionality and this trend continues. 
We essentially doubled college football viewership through higher ratings and more games. We grew our Major League Baseball regular season ratings at our RSNs by 5%, with 17s, up double digits. And more recently finished October as the most watched month in FOX Sports 1 history on the back of postseason baseball. 
And speaking of baseball, it was another great 7-game World Series for us, both on-screen and financially. 
Fox News maintains its position as the #1 network in basic cable, and had its 63rd consecutive quarter as their highest-rated cable news channel in total viewers. 
And while the local stations face a difficult comparison with the heavy political advertising last year, the underlying market is up, led by a healthy auto category and improving retail advertising. 
In entertainment, our Film and Television divisions continue to create new hits to refresh longer-term content revenue streams. 
At FBC, the Gifted, the Orville and Ghosted have all performed well at freshman series. At FX, 3 returning shows, the Strain, Better Things and American Horror Story, all increase their viewership over the prior year quarter. 
And National Geographic continues its focus on brand-supportive content, including upcoming Long Road Home series. 
At our Film studio, we have a strong upcoming slate that includes Murder on the Orient Express this weekend, The Greatest Showman, The Post by Steven Spielberg, X-Men New Mutants and Deadpool 2. 
Overall, our performance underscores the success of our core strategies, including owning and investing in distinctive must-have brands and IP, distributed to global consumers every minute of everyday. 
The power of these strong and unique brands supports our content, our advertising and critically, our leading growth in affiliate fee revenue. 
Continually expanding our deep and unique access to international markets through an unparalleled global footprint, with particular emphasis in one of the largest growth economies in the world, India. 
And challenging the status quo by consistently driving innovation across our businesses by leaning into new distribution models, new ad tech monetization capability and being a global leader in direct-consumer offerings. 
For example, we told you many years ago that innovative disruption would come to our industry. We embraced it and continued to see more and more exciting changes and resulting opportunities. 
We move early to jettison our same brands and went deep with investments into our rich, distinctive brands when many market pundits were skeptical of this approach. Because of these investments, our brands have been rewarded with full distribution on all traditional and newly launched platforms. 
Now there is a lot of talk about the growing importance of scale in the media industry and let me be very clear, FOX has the required scale to continue to both execute on our growth strategy and deliver increased returns to shareholders. 
We are specifically seeing this in our affiliate fee growth again this quarter and the success of Hulu and in our inclusion in all of the emerging DMVPDs. 
We are excited about all of our brands and the breadth of opportunities they continue to offer the company. All in all, our progress in the quarter keeps us on pace with our fiscal 2018 objectives and directly in line with our long-term plan. 
However, long-term delivery coming from an intense day-to-day focus towards being the very best in storytelling, in journalism, in sports and an innovation to consumers worldwide. 
Driving these businesses is a stellar management team from Peter Rice as the Fox Networks Groups, Buddha Shankar, Stacey Snider, John Landgraf, Eric Shanks, Crossman Martinez, Dana Walden, Gary Newman, Jack Abernathy, Brian Sullivan, along with our 22,000 colleagues around the world, we are singularly and intensely focused on delivering on our strategic plan. 
Our businesses and brands are stronger than ever and have the right management and strategies to achieve market-leading value accretion. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to John."
91031,542384955,1338578,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2017",2017-11-08,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone.

We reported our first quarter financial results today, highlighted by revenue growing 8% to reach $7 billion. It was led by double-digit growth at the Cable Network segment and increases at the Film and Television segments. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter of $1.79 billion was in line with last year's results as company-wide revenue growth was offset by expected higher costs, largely due to the higher volume of sports events broadcast in the current quarter at the Cable and Television segments. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $839 million or $0.45 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.49. 
So with those highlights, I'll provide some added comments on the performance of our operating segments for the quarter and starting with the cable network segment, where EBITDA of $1.51 billion was up 9% on revenue growth of 10% and expense growth, primarily from sports volume, of 11%. But notably, this expense increase reflects a 2 percentage point impact from the inclusion of sublicense sports rights. 
Domestic cable revenues increased 9%, led by 11% affiliate fee growth, and advertising revenue growth of 3%. The affiliate fee increase reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brand. The advertising growth, largely reflects higher viewership across our Sports network. 
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 11% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by increased costs from added college football and soccer games at FS1 and Major League Baseball rights increases at FS1 and the RSNs. 
Reported international cable revenues grew 13%, driven also by an 11% increase in reported affiliate revenue and a 10% increase in reported advertising revenue. 
International content and other revenues increased 35% over the prior year due to the sublicensing of Latin American soccer rights to third parties, which is offset in expenses. 
Reported international EBITDA contributions were consistent with the prior year, reflecting a higher revenues being offset by expected higher programming costs, largely from increased soccer in Latin America from the inaugural broadcast of the Argentine Football Association and from the timing of CONMEBOL matches. 
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $122 million, 36% below last year. Television segment revenues grew 3% on higher retransmission consent revenue and increased sports advertising revenue from a higher volume of college football games and 1 additional NFL game. These ad sell gains were partially offset by reduced political advertising at the stations. 
Our net revenue improvement was more than offset by higher sports rights from the increased volume of football games and normal rates increases. 
At the Film segment, first quarter EBITDA of $256 million was $55 million below a year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by lower contributions at the Film division, led by lower sales in international TV markets. 
Overall, Film segment revenues in the quarter were 3% higher than the prior year, primarily due to higher Television production revenues led by the domestic syndication sale of Futurama. 
And finally, from a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in cash and $19.8 billion in debt. Our capital allocation priority continues to be focused on funding the Sky acquisition. 
So, all in all, a good start to achieving our fiscal 2018 financial objectives. In our last earnings call, I mentioned a number of comparability items to be aware of as we progress through this fiscal year and at this time, I don't have any meaningful changes to those items. 
One addition of note since the call is our successful acquisition of the IPL Cricket rights in India starting this coming spring. These worldwide rights will add approximately 3 percentage points of cost growth to the cable segment, and we expect a similar dollar amount of incremental revenues to be generated from these matches all in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

Thanks, everyone for joining the call today. 
So as you've heard, fiscal 2018 has started pretty well. One quarter in, we're on track to generate meaningful growth and to deliver operational advances that are going to serve the company well going forward. 
We're committed to our strategy of reducing both highly localized content around the world and broad global franchises that travel well and together, build resident brands in our marketplace -- in our key markets. 
New digital platforms in partnership with us are leading the way and improving the customer experience and allowing us to make high-quality storytelling, sports and news programming more available, not less, which will drive further consumption of our content and more visibility into that consumption by our customers, strengthening our business. 
And across the company, the whole company, we're making really good progress. For example, in Argentina, which will soon be our largest South American market, the launch of our premium sports business anchored by our long-term rights agreement with the AFA has exceeded all of our expectations. 
We've added more local stations in sports to FOX NOW. The international rollout of Fox Plus and FOX Premium continue to gain traction. In Hotstar, which continues to set the pace for streaming in India, recently launched internationally for the Indian diaspora, providing opportunities to further monetize our Indian investments. 
Additionally, the rollout of FX+ and Comcast systems, which allows us to resurface, repackage and monetize great content from our library as well as current output in an ad free premium environment, is showing great promise. 
It also recently launched on systems and others are expected to follow shortly. Our commitment to deliver a less cluttered viewing experience does not necessarily come at the expense of low advertising yields. 
6-second spots during the NFL, the launch of Open AP, addressable ads and on-demand and streaming on Hulu are all examples of innovation we have embraced in this space. In fact, FOX Network Digital revenue in aggregate is up 30% year-over-year, with revenue per stream on our apps up 50% at FBC, 130% at FX and up 300% at FOX Sports. 
Perhaps most encouragingly, as we predicted to you over 1 year ago, at our broadcast network entertainment business, the combination of ad free premiums and nonlinear advertising sales now outpaces the linear revenue decline driven by customer's preference for timeshifting their viewing. 
Before closing, I'd like to reiterate 2 meaningful milestones we expect to achieve before the end of this fiscal year. First, at STAR, significant past investments and current investments in entertainment, sports, regional and our mobile platform, Hotstar, position the company as a premier Indian content and digital distribution company. 
First quarter results keep us on plan to achieve $500 million of EBITDA target this fiscal year, as projected, and with velocity heading into the next few years. 
And as John mentioned, STAR just recently took its final step in the realignment of its sports portfolio with the acquisition of those 5-year rights of the Indian Premier League, the most attended and most watched cricket league in the world. Exclusive global rights across broadcasting and digital will be the key growth driver this business going forward. 
These rights cement our confidence in achieving our financial targets for Indian business and our aspiration for the business over the long-term continues to grow. 
Secondly, we're engaging with the U.K. regulators on our proposed Sky acquisition. We're confident this transaction will accelerate the company's operational and financial growth and we anticipate the transaction to close by the middle of 2018. 
In conclusion, the trajectory and the velocity of the business are good. The business is well positioned, we've made a lot of progress and we're excited about the upcoming years. 
As Lachlan pointed out, we can't comment on market speculation, but we're happy to discuss our business and the quarter's results. So over to you."

So we have this rate increase from previous -- step ups from previous affiliate agreements, not in the quarter, but volume holding up well. And look, it's a little bit mix. I think you saw the telco kind of distributors shrink at a greater rate than some of the cable and DBS. But fundamentally, new competition is driving growth, right? And I think from a billable subs perspective, this is a couple of months lag in these numbers, of about 2 million but just in the last few months, they've added another 1 million of the VMVPDs, right? So it's almost 3 million, as Lachlan mentioned today. And that's all going to accelerate from here because really that's prior to the marketing that we saw from YouTube, the upcoming kind of more aggressive marketing from Hulu, and we think others as well. DIRECTV NOW, Swing, foobar with its sports focus in slightly different kind of package is growing well, so we feel really good about that. And I think it's important, just before I get to Hulu, to reemphasize that the streaming MVPD, the VMVPD, if you will, is a really great platform for us. And we think it's incredible set of platforms were monetizing our programming and our investment and it's a great user as well. And it's really in line with what we've been trying to accomplish and have been talking to all give you guys about over the last couple of years, and I think you can really start to see that coming through in this quarter. With respect to Hulu, yes, look, I wouldn't read too much into the management change. I mean Mike popped into last a great job at Sony is a longtime colleague of ours and was a great leader of Hulu, and we're really excited for Randy Freer, who came out of the FOX Networks group to go over to Hulu very recently, and we're sure that that's going to continue its going to help continue the momentum and really good pace that the Hulu business has. So we feel good about Hulu Live. It's growing well. It's early days. We feel great about Hulu's product and product road map. And I think what we're going to see is Hulu and a number of these other VMVPD's continue to be real pacesetters in the marketplace, both from a customer experience perspective, content offering perspective and a volume perspective offsetting a lot of the declines that we've seen over the last sort of while. And as I think I said in the last quarterly call, expected actually -- we think that so-called pay TV universe, the universe of people paying for video services in these multiservice providers is actually going to grow."

It terms of advertising capability, we continue to improve our capability across the piece. I think there are few milestones to look at. I think the adoption of standards across the sort of streaming video industry, I think the Open AP platform, which we're a big proponent off, I think is important. I think seeing third-party verification really take root across digital advertising, both on -- from social networks to streaming video platforms, I think is going to be really important. And I think there's industry thing that we're working very hard to sort of get in place. But fundamentally, we're not waiting on that to innovate, right? So I look at it and think, let's not wait to try to move this kind of armada of companies to something, let's actually go out there and iterate and find the ad products that are going to make sense for customers. And that's an ad product that, for example, you could buy out if you're a customer and not have ads, and you value your time more than Coca-Cola does or its ad products that are great for customers in pitching changes like the 6-second spots and picture-in-picture stuff. So it's not just digital advertising but it's across the keys, how do we present solutions to our clients, the marketers who are trying reach our audiences. And our audiences valuable in growing, but also there's technical innovation that we can bring to bear as well. So I think it's hard to pick it sort of any one milestone. I think a really important milestone was what I mentioned in my opening comments, which was if you take the ad free premium royalties that we get the people buy out there is and divide the Hulu premium stuff and our nonlinear advertising inventory monetization, we actually overtook the decline that's coming from time-shifted viewing away from the live window. And that's in the broadcast and entertainment business. I had a big milestone, and it's one we talked about a couple of quarters ago and it's important. So those are the sorts of things we're really focused on. And with respect to the Sky approval, as I said, we're confident we're going to get the deal done in the first half of next year. We're engaged with the regulators. This is a transaction that's cleared every relevant part in all the markets that we operate in, and it has been a thorough Phase 1 in the U.K. with Ofcom. We've looked at all these issues, are pretty confident that's done. In general, in terms of capital allocation, I think hopefully we've shown you over the last number of years that we are very, very focused on being good stewards of capital. We're very, very focused on deploying capital where we can get great returns for all our shareholders, and that's what we're going to continue to do."

And I think he do his as well as understanding that licensing terms under what where these rights can have overall long-term that we can monetize overtime that sometimes these big global exclusive SVOD licenses that Netflix, for example, favor. They don't fit for some strategies. So we said that in the past, and that's going to continue. We're actually -- actually our licensing on the Netflix side, for example, is actually we blend a bit more than -- it's been offset by other licenses we've been able to put in place. So we feel pretty good about that, and I think our product performs particularly well in the streaming marketplace as well and I look at everything from a animation business with -- from Futurama to Family Guy to Bob's burgers to our scripted dramas and comedies from FX and NBC, we still -- we feel real good about its performance of the studio marketplace. So that's where that is. Look, I don't want to get into any particular sports rights contract or negotiations that may be upcoming, but just philosophically, we look at this -- we have to look at it and around, we think that sports continue to be a key driver of consumption, dedifferentiate for a lot of our brands, but we always have to balance costs and benefit as you do. And we'll look at all of those things as they come up and try to make a decision around what's the right thing for our bottom line and for our customers. So we sometimes we choose to walk away from things and sometimes we choose to renew things, but we look at each and every one on the kind of merits and around those rights, so."

Just on the STAR business, look, we are confident about it. We think we have a great team, we've got a great business and the marketplace is one of extraordinary opportunity in terms of its scale, in terms of the vibrancy of the creative community, the vibrancy of the storytelling and sports there, et cetera. So we feel -- we do feel really good about it. As I mentioned earlier, we're on track for our short-term targets of $500 million of EBITDA this fiscal year. And I think we're -- and we're on track for the longer-term target, as you mentioned, a $1 billion of EBITDA in 2020. So I think that all feels good, even with the additional cost of the IPL. As John mentioned, in this fiscal year to the last quarter, we expect that increase in costs to be offset by an increase in revenue. And we think that the IPL is one of the great sports franchises in the world, and we think it's going to be delivered for the business. So it doesn't change that trajectory, but I think it makes it over the course of the 5 years, quite a bit maybe a bit stronger. So we're -- we feel pretty good about it. With respect to Hotstar in general, look, I guess, as I think I've mentioned to all of you folks before, the real exciting opportunity here is an environment where you have just this incredible proliferation of video distribution on connected devices everywhere, where you have this -- and video consumption really driving so much of that consumption up front, connectivity generally. The opportunity in an environment where content really is getting us to use that to build platforms. And we see Hotstar as a platform in that way. So we're going to continue to iterate the product. We think there's a lot to be done with it growth from a monetization point of view as well as engagement point of view with customers. And we'll see new features. I hope I encourage everyone -- the product is launched in the U.S. I'd encourage everybody to use it and use it. There's a lot of interesting features, a lot of social features particularly around the way people watch sports together. So we feel great about it, but it's going to continue to change and the Hotstar platform will evolve rapidly."

Let me be very clear upfront that we have a long-standing policy of not commentating -- commenting on speculation around corporate activity or transactions. 
We will continue to adhere to that policy, meaning that we will not be responding at all to questions or comments regarding recent press speculation. 
The purpose of this call is to focus on the growing and robust business of 21st Century Fox. We are pleased to report a solid start to fiscal 2018, which continues the operational and financial progress we delivered in fiscal '17. 
In the last quarter, we delivered 8% top line growth, with increases across all our reporting segments and revenue categories. We drove an acceleration in domestic affiliate revenue, which grew by 11%, sequentially surpassing the strong 10% growth in the prior quarter. 
We maintained our aggregate domestic subscriber levels, offsetting declines in the traditional pay TV universe, with growing contribution from our younger channel and our new digital MVPD partners. 
The latter now approaches 3 million subscribers despite only limited marketing for their products so far. 
We talk often about our unique competitive advantage of our strength in local and national sports and news in an environment with increased viewing optionality, and this trend continues. 
We essentially doubled college football viewership from higher ratings and more games. We grew our Major League Baseball regular season ratings at our RSNs by 5%, with 7 teams up double digits, and more recently finished October as the most watched month in FOX Sports 1 history on the back of postseason baseball. 
And speaking of baseball, it was another great 7-game World Series for us, both onscreen and financially. 
Fox News maintains its position as the #1 network on basic cable and had its 63rd consecutive quarter as the highest-rated cable news channel in total viewers. 
And while the local stations face a difficult comparison with the heavy political advertising last year, the underlying market is up, led by a healthy auto category and improving retail advertising. 
In entertainment, our Film and Television divisions continue to create new hits to refresh longer-term content revenue streams.
At FBC, The Gifted, The Orville and Ghosted have all performed well as freshmen series. At FX, 3 returning shows, The Strain, Better Things and American Horror Story, all increased their viewership over the prior year quarter. 
And National Geographic continues its focus on brand-supportive content, including the upcoming Long Road Home series. 
And at our film studio, we have a strong upcoming slate that includes Murder on the Orient Express this weekend, The Greatest Showman, The Post by Steven Spielberg, X-Men: New Mutants and Deadpool 2. 
Overall, our performance underscores the success of our core strategies, including owning and investing in distinctive must-have brands and IP, distributed to global consumers every minute of every day. 
The power of these strong and unique brands supports our content, our advertising and critically, our leading growth in affiliate fee revenues; continually expanding our deep and unique access to international markets through an unparalleled global footprint, with particular emphasis in one of the largest growth economies in the world, India; and challenging the status quo by consistently driving innovation across our businesses by leaning into new distribution models, new ad tech monetization capabilities and being a global leader in direct-to-consumer offerings. 
For example, we told you many years ago that innovative disruption would come to our industry. We embraced it and continued to see more and more exciting changes and resulting opportunities. 
We moved early to jettison our thin brands and went deep with investments into our rich, distinctive brands when many market pundits were skeptical of this approach. Because of these investments, our brands have been rewarded with full distribution on all traditional and newly launched platforms. 
Now there is a lot of talk about the growing importance of scale in the media industry, and let me be very clear, FOX has the required scale to continue to both execute on our growth strategy and deliver increased returns to shareholders. 
We are specifically seeing this in our affiliate fee growth again this quarter, in the success of Hulu and in our inclusion in all of the emerging VMVPDs. 
We are excited about all of our brands and the breadth of opportunities they continue to offer the company. All in all, our progress in the quarter keeps us on pace with our fiscal 2018 objectives and directly in line with our long-term plan, however, long-term delivery coming from an intense day-to-day focus towards being the very best in storytelling, in journalism, in sports and in innovation to consumers worldwide. 
Driving these businesses is a stellar management team, from Peter Rice at the Fox Networks Groups, to Uday Shankar's STAR, Stacey Snider, John Landgraf, Eric Shanks, Carlos Martinez, Dana Walden, Gary Newman, Jack Abernethy, Brian Sullivan, along with our 22,000 colleagues around the world, we are singularly and intensely focused on delivering on our strategic plan. 
Our businesses and brands are stronger than ever and have the right management and strategies to achieve market-leading value accretion. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to John."
91031,542384955,1338925,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2017",2017-11-08,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone.

We reported our first quarter financial results today, highlighted by revenue growing 8% to reach $7 billion. It was led by double-digit growth at the Cable Network segment and increases at the Film and Television segments. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter of $1.79 billion was in line with last year's result as company-wide revenue growth was offset by expected higher cost, largely due to the higher volume of sports events broadcasts in the current quarter at the Cable and Television segments. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $839 million or $0.45 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.49. 
So with those highlights, I'll provide some added comments on the performance of our operating segments for the quarter and starting with the Cable Network segment, where EBITDA of $1.51 billion was up 9% on revenue growth of 10% and expense growth, primarily from sports volume, of 11%. But notably, this expense increase reflects a 2 percentage point impact from the inclusion of sublicense sports rights. 
Domestic cable revenues increased 9%, led by 11% affiliate fee growth and advertising revenue growth of 3%. The affiliate fee increase reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands. The advertising growth largely reflects higher viewership across our sports network. 
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 11% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by increased costs from added college football and soccer games at FS1 and Major League Baseball rights increases at FS1 and the RSNs. 
Reported international cable revenues grew 13%, driven also by an 11% increase in reported affiliate revenue and a 10% increase in reported advertising revenue. 
International content and other revenues increased 35% over the prior year due to the sublicensing of Latin American soccer rights to third parties, which is offset in expenses. 
Reported international EBITDA contributions were consistent with the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues being offset by expected higher programming costs, largely from increased soccer in Latin America from the inaugural broadcast of the Argentine Football Association and from the timing of Conmebol matches. 
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $122 million, 36% below last year. Television segment revenues grew 3% on higher retransmission consent revenue and increased sports advertising revenue from a higher volume of college football games and one additional NFL game. These ad sale gains were partially offset by reduced political advertising at the stations. 
Our net revenue improvement was more than offset by higher sports rights from the increased volume of football games and normal rights increases. 
At the Film segment, first quarter EBITDA of $256 million was $55 million below a year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by lower contributions at the Film division, led by lower sales in international TV markets. 
Overall, Film segment revenues in the quarter were 3% higher than the prior year, primarily due to higher Television production revenues led by the domestic syndication sale of Futurama. 
And finally, from a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in cash and $19.8 billion in debt. Our capital allocation priority continues to be focused on funding the Sky acquisition. 
So all in all, a good start to achieving our fiscal 2018 financial objectives. On our last earnings call, I mentioned a number of comparability items to be aware of as we progressed through this fiscal year, and at this time, I don't have any meaningful changes to those items. 
So one addition of note since the call is our successful acquisition of the IPL cricket rights in India starting this coming spring. These worldwide rights will add approximately 3 percentage points of cost growth to the Cable segment, and we expect a similar dollar amount of incremental revenues to be generated from these matches all in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. So as you've heard, fiscal 2018 has started pretty well. 1 quarter in, we're on track to generate meaningful growth and to deliver operational advances that are going to s",658,"Thanks very much, John and Lachlan. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. 
So as you've heard, fiscal 2018 has started pretty well. 1 quarter in, we're on track to generate meaningful growth and to deliver operational advances that are going to serve the company well going forward. 
We're committed to our strategy of reducing both highly localized content around the world and broad global franchises that travel well and together, build resident brands in our marketplace -- in our key markets. 
New digital platforms, in partnership with us, are leading the way and improving the customer experience and allowing us to make high-quality storytelling, sports and news programming more available, not less, which will drive further consumption of our content and more visibility into that consumption by our customers, strengthening our business. 
And across the company, the whole company, we're making really good progress. For example, in Argentina, which will soon be our largest South American market, the launch of our premium sports business, anchored by our long-term rights agreement with the AFA, has exceeded all of our expectations. 
We've added more local stations in sports to FOX NOW. The international rollouts of Fox Plus and FOX Premium continue to gain traction. And Hotstar, which continues to set the pace for streaming in India, recently launched internationally for the Indian diaspora, providing opportunities to further monetize our Indian investments. 
Additionally, the rollout of FX+ on Comcast systems, which allows us to resurface, repackage and monetize great content from our library as well as current output in an ad-free premium environment, is showing great promise. 
It also recently launched on Cox systems, and others are expected to follow shortly. 
Our commitment to deliver a less cluttered viewing experience does not necessarily come at the expense of lower advertising yields. 6-second spots during the NFL, the launch of Open AP, addressable ads in on-demand and streaming on Hulu are all examples of innovation we have embraced in this space. In fact, Fox Networks Group digital ad revenue in aggregate is up 30% year-over-year, with revenue per stream on our apps up 50% at FBC, 130% at FX and up 300% at FOX Sports. 
Perhaps most encouragingly, as we predicted to you over a year ago at our broadcast network entertainment business, the combination of ad-free premiums and nonlinear advertising sales now outpaces the linear revenue decline driven by customers' preference for timeshifting their viewing. 
Before closing, I'd like to reiterate 2 meaningful milestones we expect to achieve before the end of this fiscal year. First, at STAR, our significant past investments and current investments in entertainment, sports, regional and our mobile platform, Hotstar, position the company as the premier Indian content and digital distribution company. 
First quarter results keep us on plan to achieve $500 million of EBITDA target this fiscal year as projected and with velocity heading into the next few years. 
And as John mentioned, STAR just recently took its final step in the realignment of its sports portfolio with the acquisition of those 5-year rights of the Indian Premier League, the most attended and watched cricket league in the world. Exclusive global rights across broadcasting and digital will be a key growth driver of this business going forward. 
These rights cement our confidence in achieving our financial targets for our Indian business, and our aspiration for the business over the long-term continues to grow. 
Secondly, we're engaging with the U.K. regulators on our proposed Sky acquisition. We're confident this transaction will accelerate the company's operational and financial growth, and we anticipate the transaction to close by the middle of 2018. 
In conclusion, the trajectory and the velocity of the business are good. The business is well positioned, we've made a lot of progress, and we're excited about the upcoming years. 
And as Lachlan pointed out, we can't comment on market speculation, but we're happy to discuss our business and the quarter's results. So over to you."

So I'm wondering if maybe the volumes got better overall for you. So any color there would be helpful. And then I wanted to ask the team about Hulu, which is obviously a major player in that 3 million subscriber number you mentioned. You made a management change -- or there was a management change made there recently.

So you have this -- we have this  rate increase from previous -- step-ups from previous affiliate agreements, not in the quarter, but volume holding up well. And look, it's a little bit mixed. I think you saw the telco kind of distributors shrink at a greater rate than some of the cable and DBS. But fundamentally, new competition is driving growth, right? And I think in the -- from a billable subs perspective, this is on a couple of months' lag in these numbers of about 2 million, but just in the last few months, they have added another million of VMVPDs, right? So it's almost 3 million, as Lachlan mentioned today. And that's only going to accelerate from here because really, that's prior to the marketing that we saw from YouTube, the upcoming kind of more aggressive marketing from Hulu, and we think others as well. DIRECTV NOW, Sling, fubo, with its sports focus and a slightly different kind of package, is growing well. So we feel really good about that. And I think it's important, just before I get to Hulu, to reemphasize that the streaming MVPD, the VMVPD, if you will, is a really great platform for us. And we think it's an incredible set of platforms for monetizing our programming and our investment, and it's a great user experience as well. And it's really in line with what we've been trying to accomplish and have been talking to all of you guys about over the last couple of years, and I think you can really start to see that coming through in this quarter. With respect to Hulu, yes, look, I wouldn't read too much into the management change. I mean, Mike hopped into last to take a great job at Sony, is a longtime colleague of ours and was a great leader of Hulu. And we're really excited for Randy Freer, who came out of the Fox Networks Group to go over to Hulu very recently, and we're sure that that's going to continue -- that's going to help continue the momentum and really good pace that the Hulu business has. So we feel good about Hulu Live. It's growing well. It's early days. We feel great about Hulu's product and product road map. And I think what we're going to see is Hulu and a number of other of these VMVPDs continue to be real pacesetters in the marketplace, both from a customer experience perspective, a content offering perspective and a volume perspective, offsetting a lot of the declines that we've seen over the last sort of while. And as I think I've said in the last quarterly call, we expected actually -- we think that the so-called pay TV universe, the universe of people paying for video services, in these multiservice providers is actually going to grow."

It terms of the advertising capability, we continue to improve our ad capability across the piece. I think there are a few milestones to look at. I think the adoption of standards across the sort of streaming video industry, I think the Open AP platform, which we're a big proponent of, I think is important. I think seeing third-party verification really take root across digital advertising, both on -- from social networks to streaming video platforms, I think is going to be really important. And then there's an industry thing that we're working very hard to sort of get in place. But fundamentally, we're not waiting on that to innovate, right? So I look at it and think, let's not wait to try to move this whole kind of armada of companies to something, let's actually go out there and iterate and find the ad products that are going to make sense for customers. And that's an ad product that, for example, you could buy out if you're a customer and not have ads and you value your time more than Coca-Cola does, or it's ad products that are great for customers in pitching changes, like the 6-second spots and picture-in-picture stuff. So it's not just digital advertising, but it's across the piece. How do we present solutions to our clients, the marketers who are trying reach our audience, and our audience is valuable when they're growing. But also, there's technical innovation that we can bring to bear as well. So I think it's hard to pick sort of any one milestone. I think a really important milestone was what I mentioned in my opening comments, which was if you take the ad-free premium royalties that we get when people buy out their ads and they buy the Hulu premium stuff, and our nonlinear advertising inventory monetization, we actually overtook the decline that's coming from timeshifted viewing away from the live window. And that's in the broadcast and entertainment business. I think that is a big milestone, and it's one that we talked about a number of quarters ago and it's important. So those are the sorts of things that we're really focused on. And with respect to the Sky approval, as I said, we're confident we're going to get the deal done in the first half of next year. We're engaged with the regulators. This is a transaction that has cleared every relevant regulator in all the markets we operate in and has been through a thorough Phase 1 in the U.K. with Ofcom, which has looked at all these issues. And we're pretty confident it gets done. In general, in terms of capital allocation, I think, hopefully, we've shown you over the last number of years that we're very, very focused on being good stewards of capital, we're very, very focused on deploying capital where we can get great returns for all our shareholders, and that's what we're going to continue to do."

Just on the STAR business, look, we are confident about it. We think we have a great team there, we have got a great business, and the marketplace is one of extraordinary opportunity in terms of its scale, in terms of the vibrancy of the creative community, the vibrancy of the storytelling and sports there, et cetera. So we feel -- we do feel really good about it. As I mentioned earlier, we're on track for our short-term targets of $500 million of EBITDA this fiscal year. And I think we're -- and we're on track for the longer-term target, as you mentioned, of  $1 billion of EBITDA in 2020. So I think that all feels good, even with the additional cost of the IPL. As John mentioned, in this fiscal year, it's the last quarter, we expect that increase in costs to be offset by an increase in revenue. And we think that the IPL is one of the great sports franchises in the world, and we think it's going to be able to deliver for the business. So it doesn't change that trajectory, but I think it makes it, over the course of the 5 years, quite a bit -- maybe a bit stronger. So we're -- we feel pretty good about it. With respect to Hotstar in general, look, I guess, as I think I've mentioned to all of you folks before, the real exciting opportunity here is an environment where you have just this incredible proliferation of video distribution on connected devices everywhere, where you have this -- and video consumption really driving so much of that consumption of connectivity generally. The opportunity in an environment where content really is king is to use that to build platforms. And we really see Hotstar as a platform in that way. So we're going to continue to iterate that product. But we think there's a lot to be done with it, both from a monetization point of view as well as an engagement point of view with customers, and you'll see new features. I hope -- I'd encourage everyone, the product is launched in the U.S. I'd encourage everybody to use it and use it. There's a lot of interesting features, a lot of social features, particularly around the way people watch sports together. So we feel great about it, but it's going to continue to change and the Hotstar platform will evolve rapidly."

Let me be very clear upfront that we have a long-standing policy of not commentating -- commenting on speculation around corporate activity or transactions. 
We will continue to adhere to that policy, meaning that we will not be responding at all to questions or comments regarding recent press speculation. 
The purpose of this call is to focus on the growing and robust business of 21st Century Fox. We are pleased to report a solid start to fiscal 2018, which continues the operational and financial progress we delivered in fiscal '17. 
In the last quarter, we delivered 8% top line growth, with increases across all our reporting segments and revenue categories. We drove an acceleration in domestic affiliate revenue, which grew by 11%, sequentially surpassing the strong 10% growth in the prior quarter. 
We maintained our aggregate domestic subscriber levels, offsetting declines in the traditional pay TV universe, with growing contribution from our younger channel and our new digital MVPD partners. 
The latter now approaches 3 million subscribers despite only limited marketing for their products so far. 
We talk often about our unique competitive advantage of our strength in local and national sports and news in an environment with increased viewing optionality, and this trend continues. 
We essentially doubled college football viewership from higher ratings and more games. We grew our Major League Baseball regular season ratings at our RSNs by 5%, with 7 teams up double digits, and more recently finished October as the most watched month in FOX Sports 1 history on the back of postseason baseball. 
And speaking of baseball, it was another great 7-game World Series for us, both onscreen and financially. 
Fox News maintains its position as the #1 network on basic cable and had its 63rd consecutive quarter as the highest-rated cable news channel in total viewers. 
And while the local stations face a difficult comparison with the heavy political advertising last year, the underlying market is up, led by a healthy auto category and improving retail advertising. 
In entertainment, our Film and Television divisions continue to create new hits to refresh longer-term content revenue streams.
At FBC, The Gifted, The Orville and Ghosted have all performed well as freshmen series. At FX, 3 returning shows, The Strain, Better Things and American Horror Story, all increased their viewership over the prior year quarter. 
And National Geographic continues its focus on brand-supportive content, including the upcoming Long Road Home series. 
And at our film studio, we have a strong upcoming slate that includes Murder on the Orient Express this weekend, The Greatest Showman, The Post by Steven Spielberg, X-Men: New Mutants and Deadpool 2. 
Overall, our performance underscores the success of our core strategies, including owning and investing in distinctive must-have brands and IP, distributed to global consumers every minute of every day. 
The power of these strong and unique brands supports our content, our advertising and critically, our leading growth in affiliate fee revenues; continually expanding our deep and unique access to international markets through an unparalleled global footprint, with particular emphasis in one of the largest growth economies in the world, India; and challenging the status quo by consistently driving innovation across our businesses by leaning into new distribution models, new ad tech monetization capabilities and being a global leader in direct-to-consumer offerings. 
For example, we told you many years ago that innovative disruption would come to our industry. We embraced it and continued to see more and more exciting changes and resulting opportunities. 
We moved early to jettison our thin brands and went deep with investments into our rich, distinctive brands when many market pundits were skeptical of this approach. Because of these investments, our brands have been rewarded with full distribution on all traditional and newly launched platforms. 
Now there is a lot of talk about the growing importance of scale in the media industry, and let me be very clear, FOX has the required scale to continue to both execute on our growth strategy and deliver increased returns to shareholders. 
We are specifically seeing this in our affiliate fee growth again this quarter, in the success of Hulu and in our inclusion in all of the emerging VMVPDs. 
We are excited about all of our brands and the breadth of opportunities they continue to offer the company. All in all, our progress in the quarter keeps us on pace with our fiscal 2018 objectives and directly in line with our long-term plan, however, long-term delivery coming from an intense day-to-day focus towards being the very best in storytelling, in journalism, in sports and in innovation to consumers worldwide. 
Driving these businesses is a stellar management team, from Peter Rice at the Fox Networks Groups, to Uday Shankar's STAR, Stacey Snider, John Landgraf, Eric Shanks, Carlos Martinez, Dana Walden, Gary Newman, Jack Abernethy, Brian Sullivan, along with our 22,000 colleagues around the world, we are singularly and intensely focused on delivering on our strategic plan. 
Our businesses and brands are stronger than ever and have the right management and strategies to achieve market-leading value accretion. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to John."
91031,542384955,1339090,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2017",2017-11-08,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone.

We reported our first quarter financial results today, highlighted by revenue growing 8% to reach $7 billion. It was led by double-digit growth at the Cable Network segment and increases at the Film and Television segments. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter of $1.79 billion was in line with last year's result as company-wide revenue growth was offset by expected higher cost, largely due to the higher volume of sports events broadcasts in the current quarter at the Cable and Television segments. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $839 million or $0.45 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.49. 
So with those highlights, I'll provide some added comments on the performance of our operating segments for the quarter and starting with the Cable Network segment, where EBITDA of $1.51 billion was up 9% on revenue growth of 10% and expense growth, primarily from sports volume, of 11%. But notably, this expense increase reflects a 2-percentage point impact from the inclusion of sublicense sports rights. 
Domestic cable revenues increased 9%, led by 11% affiliate fee growth and advertising revenue growth of 3%. The affiliate fee increase reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands. The advertising growth largely reflects higher viewership across our sports network. 
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 11% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by increased costs from added college football and soccer games at FS1 and Major League Baseball rights increases at FS1 and the RSNs. 
Reported international cable revenues grew 13%, driven also by an 11% increase in reported affiliate revenue and a 10% increase in reported advertising revenue. 
International content and other revenues increased 35% over the prior year due to the sublicensing of Latin American soccer rights to third parties, which is offset in expenses. 
Reported international EBITDA contributions were consistent with the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues being offset by expected higher programming costs, largely from increased soccer in Latin America from the inaugural broadcast of the Argentine Football Association and from the timing of Conmebol matches. 
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $122 million, 36% below last year. Television segment revenues grew 3% on higher retransmission consent revenue and increased sports advertising revenue from a higher volume of college football games and one additional NFL game. These ad sale gains were partially offset by reduced political advertising at the stations. 
Our net revenue improvement was more than offset by higher sports rights from the increased volume of football games and normal rights increases. 
At the Film segment, first quarter EBITDA of $256 million was $55 million below a year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by lower contributions at the Film division, led by lower sales in international TV markets. 
Overall, Film segment revenues in the quarter were 3% higher than the prior year, primarily due to higher Television production revenues led by the domestic syndication sale of Futurama. 
And finally, from a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in cash and $19.8 billion in debt. Our capital allocation priority continues to be focused on funding the Sky acquisition. 
So all in all, a good start to achieving our fiscal 2018 financial objectives. On our last earnings call, I mentioned a number of comparability items to be aware of as we progressed through this fiscal year, and at this time, I don't have any meaningful changes to those items. 
So one addition of note since the call is our successful acquisition of the IPL cricket rights in India starting this coming spring. These worldwide rights will add approximately 3 percentage points of cost growth to the Cable segment, and we expect a similar dollar amount of incremental revenues to be generated from these matches all in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. 
So as you've heard, fiscal 2018 has started pretty well. 1 quarter in, we're on track to generate meaningful growth and to deliver operational advances that are going to serve the company well going forward. 
We're committed to our strategy of producing both highly localized content around the world and broad global franchises that travel well and together, build resident brands in our marketplace -- in our key markets. 
New digital platforms, in partnership with us, are leading the way and improving the customer experience and allowing us to make high-quality storytelling, sports and news programming more available, not less, which will drive further consumption of our content and more visibility into that consumption by our customers, strengthening our business. 
And across the company, the whole company, we're making really good progress. For example, in Argentina, which will soon be our largest South American market, the launch of our premium sports business, anchored by our long-term rights agreement with the AFA, has exceeded all of our expectations. 
We've added more local stations in sports to FOX NOW. The international rollouts of Fox Plus and FOX Premium continue to gain traction. And Hotstar, which continues to set the pace for streaming in India, recently launched internationally for the Indian diaspora, providing opportunities to further monetize our Indian investments. 
Additionally, the rollout of FX+ on Comcast systems, which allows us to resurface, repackage and monetize great content from our library as well as current output in an ad-free premium environment, is showing great promise. 
It also recently launched on Cox systems, and others are expected to follow shortly. 
Our commitment to deliver a less cluttered viewing experience does not necessarily come at the expense of lower advertising yields. 6-second spots during the NFL, the launch of Open AP, addressable ads in on-demand and streaming on Hulu are all examples of innovation we have embraced in this space. In fact, Fox Networks Group digital ad revenue in aggregate is up 30% year-over-year, with revenue per stream on our apps up 50% at FBC, 130% at FX and up 300% at FOX Sports. 
Perhaps most encouragingly, as we predicted to you over a year ago at our broadcast network entertainment business, the combination of ad-free premiums and nonlinear advertising sales now outpaces the linear revenue decline driven by customers' preference for timeshifting their viewing. 
Before closing, I'd like to reiterate 2 meaningful milestones we expect to achieve before the end of this fiscal year. First, at STAR, our significant past investments and current investments in entertainment, sports, regional and our mobile platform, Hotstar, position the company as the premier Indian content and digital distribution company. 
First quarter results keep us on plan to achieve $500 million of EBITDA target this fiscal year as projected and with velocity heading into the next few years. 
And as John mentioned, STAR just recently took its final step in the realignment of its sports portfolio with the acquisition of those 5-year rights for the Indian Premier League, the most attended and watched cricket league in the world. Exclusive global rights across broadcasting and digital will be a key growth driver of this business going forward. 
These rights cement our confidence in achieving our financial targets for our Indian business, and our aspiration for the business over the long-term continues to grow. 
Secondly, we're engaging with the U.K. regulators on our proposed Sky acquisition. We're confident this transaction will accelerate the company's operational and financial growth, and we anticipate the transaction to close by the middle of 2018. 
In conclusion, the trajectory and the velocity of the business are good. The business is well positioned, we've made a lot of progress, and we're excited about the upcoming years. 
And as Lachlan pointed out, we can't comment on market speculation, but we're happy to discuss our business and the quarter's results. So over to you."

And then I wanted to ask the team about Hulu, which is obviously a major player in that 3 million subscriber number you mentioned.

So you have this -- we have this rate increase from previous -- step-ups from previous affiliate agreements, not in the quarter, but volume holding up well. And look, it's a little bit mixed. I think you saw the telco kind of distributors shrink at a greater rate than some of the cable and DBS. But fundamentally, new competition is driving growth, right? And I think in the -- from a billable subs perspective, this is on a couple of months' lag in these numbers of about 2 million, but just in the last few months, they have added another million of VMVPDs, right? So it's almost 3 million, as Lachlan mentioned today. And that's only going to accelerate from here because really, that's prior to the marketing that we saw from YouTube, the upcoming kind of more aggressive marketing from Hulu, and we think others as well. DIRECTV NOW, Sling, fubo, with its sports focus and a slightly different kind of package, is growing well. So we feel really good about that. And I think it's important, just before I get to Hulu, to reemphasize that the streaming MVPD, the VMVPD, if you will, is a really great platform for us. And we think it's an incredible set of platforms for monetizing our programming and our investment, and it's a great user experience as well. And it's really in line with what we've been trying to accomplish and have been talking to all of you guys about over the last couple of years, and I think you can really start to see that coming through in this quarter. 
With respect to Hulu, yes, look, I wouldn't read too much into the management change. I mean, Mike Hopkins left to take a great job at Sony, is a longtime colleague of ours and was a great leader of Hulu. And I'm really excited for Randy Freer, who came out of the Fox Networks Group to go over to Hulu very recently, and we're sure that that's going to continue -- that's going to help continue the momentum and really good pace that the Hulu business has. So we feel good about Hulu Live. It's growing well. It's early days. We feel great about Hulu's product and product road map. And I think what we're going to see is Hulu and a number of other of these VMVPDs continue to be real pacesetters in the marketplace, both from a customer experience perspective, a content offering perspective and a volume perspective, offsetting a lot of the declines that we've seen over the last sort of while. And as I think I've said in the last quarterly call, we expected actually -- we think that the so-called pay TV universe, the universe of people paying for video services, in these multiservice providers is actually going to grow."

And as you know, we've taken a lot of steps to change our portfolio over the last number of years, simplifying our mix of assets, investing in these core brands, selling assets that weren't going to change our lives in terms of a lot of the -- I can go all the way back to the Russian outdoor business, which we exited a number of years ago. So I think the point for us is we've really simplified our operating model. We've got a great set of brands and a great set of assets that we really like. And as you can see from these quarterly results and from the last couple of quarters, I hope, a real trajectory of good performance in those. It's never easy. We're focused on operating these businesses as best we can with a really incredible management team at all of these businesses, and we can continue to be focused on that. So we like that mix, we like these brands, and we're seeing them really perform around the world, from STAR to the FOX businesses around the world, National Geographic. These are big brands that really matter for their customers, and we like where we are."

It terms of the advertising capability, we continue to improve our ad capability across the piece. I think there are a few milestones to look at. I think the adoption of standards across the sort of streaming video industry, I think the Open AP platform, which we're a big proponent of, I think is important. I think seeing third-party verification really take root across digital advertising, both on -- from social networks to streaming video platforms, I think is going to be really important. And then there's an industry thing that we're working very hard to sort of get in place. But fundamentally, we're not waiting on that to innovate, right? So I look at it and think, let's not wait to try to move this whole kind of armada of companies to something, let's actually go out there and iterate and find the ad products that are going to make sense for customers. And that's an ad product that, for example, you could buy out if you're a customer and not have ads and you value your time more than Coca-Cola does, or it's ad products that are great for customers in pitching changes, like the 6-second spots and picture-in-picture stuff. So it's not just digital advertising, but it's across the piece. How do we present solutions to our clients, the marketers who are trying reach our audience, and our audience is valuable when they're growing. But also, there's technical innovation that we can bring to bear as well. So I think it's hard to pick sort of any one milestone. I think a really important milestone was what I mentioned in my opening comments, which was if you take the ad-free premium royalties that we get when people buy out their ads and they buy the Hulu premium stuff, and our nonlinear advertising inventory monetization, we actually overtook the decline that's coming from time shifted viewing away from the live window. And that's in the broadcast entertainment business. I think that is a big milestone, and it's one that we talked about a number of quarters ago and it's important. So those are the sorts of things that we're really focused on. 
And with respect to the Sky approval, as I said, we're confident we're going to get the deal done in the first half of next year. We're engaged with the regulators. This is a transaction that has cleared every relevant regulator in all the markets we operate in and has been through a thorough Phase 1 in the U.K. with Ofcom, which has looked at all these issues. And we're pretty confident it gets done. 
In general, in terms of capital allocation, I think, hopefully, we've shown you over the last number of years that we're very, very focused on being good stewards of capital, we're very, very focused on deploying capital where we can get great returns for all our shareholders, and that's what we're going to continue to do."

We think we have a great team there, we have got a great business, and the marketplace is one of extraordinary opportunity in terms of its scale, in terms of the vibrancy of the creative community, the vibrancy of the storytelling and sports there, et cetera. So we feel -- we do feel really good about it. As I mentioned earlier, we're on track for our short-term targets of $500 million of EBITDA this fiscal year. And I think we're -- and we're on track for the longer-term target, as you mentioned, of $1 billion of EBITDA in 2020. So I think that all feels good, even with the additional cost of the IPL. As John mentioned, in this fiscal year, it's the last quarter, we expect that increase in costs to be offset by an increase in revenue. And we think that the IPL is one of the great sports franchises in the world, and we think it's going to be able to deliver for the business. So it doesn't change that trajectory, but I think it makes it, over the course of the 5 years, quite a bit -- maybe a bit stronger. So we're -- we feel pretty good about it. 
With respect to Hotstar in general, look, I guess, as I think I've mentioned to all of you folks before, the real exciting opportunity here is an environment where you have just this incredible proliferation of video distribution on connected devices everywhere, where you have this -- and video consumption really driving so much of that consumption of connectivity generally. The opportunity in an environment where content really is king is to use that to build platforms. And we really see Hotstar as a platform in that way. So we're going to continue to iterate that product. But we think there's a lot to be done with it, both from a monetization point of view as well as an engagement point of view with customers, and you'll see new features. I hope -- I'd encourage everyone, the product is launched in the U.S. I'd encourage everybody to use it and use it. There's a lot of interesting features, a lot of social features, particularly around the way people watch sports together. So we feel great about it, but it's going to continue to change and the Hotstar platform will evolve rapidly."

Let me be very clear upfront that we have a long-standing policy of not commentating -- commenting on speculation around corporate activity or transactions. 
We will continue to adhere to that policy, meaning that we will not be responding at all to questions or comments regarding recent press speculation. 
The purpose of this call is to focus on the growing and robust business of 21st Century Fox. We are pleased to report a solid start to fiscal 2018, which continues the operational and financial progress we delivered in fiscal '17. 
In the last quarter, we delivered 8% top line growth, with increases across all our reporting segments and revenue categories. We drove an acceleration in domestic affiliate revenue, which grew by 11%, sequentially surpassing the strong 10% growth in the prior quarter. 
We maintained our aggregate domestic subscriber levels, offsetting declines in the traditional pay TV universe, with growing contribution from our younger channel and our new digital MVPD partners. 
The latter now approaches 3 million subscribers despite only limited marketing for their products so far. 
We talk often about our unique competitive advantage of our strength in local and national sports and news in an environment with increased viewing optionality, and this trend continues. 
We essentially doubled college football viewership from higher ratings and more games. We grew our Major League Baseball regular season ratings at our RSNs by 5%, with 7 teams up double digits, and more recently finished October as the most watched month in FOX Sports 1 history on the back of postseason baseball. 
And speaking of baseball, it was another great 7-game World Series for us, both onscreen and financially. 
Fox News maintains its position as the #1 network on basic cable and had its 63rd consecutive quarter as the highest-rated cable news channel in total viewers. 
And while the local stations face a difficult comparison with the heavy political advertising last year, the underlying market is up, led by a healthy auto category and improving retail advertising. 
In entertainment, our Film and Television divisions continue to create new hits to refresh longer-term content revenue streams.
At FBC, The Gifted, The Orville and Ghosted have all performed well as freshmen series. At FX, 3 returning shows, The Strain, Better Things and American Horror Story, all increased their viewership over the prior year quarter. 
And National Geographic continues its focus on brand-supportive content, including the upcoming Long Road Home series. 
And at our film studio, we have a strong upcoming slate that includes Murder on the Orient Express this weekend, The Greatest Showman, The Post by Steven Spielberg, X-Men: New Mutants and Deadpool 2. 
Overall, our performance underscores the success of our core strategies, including owning and investing in distinctive must-have brands and IP, distributed to global consumers every minute of every day. 
The power of these strong and unique brands supports our content, our advertising and critically, our leading growth in affiliate fee revenues; continually expanding our deep and unique access to international markets through an unparalleled global footprint, with particular emphasis in one of the largest growth economies in the world, India; and challenging the status quo by consistently driving innovation across our businesses by leaning into new distribution models, new ad tech monetization capabilities and being a global leader in direct-to-consumer offerings. 
For example, we told you many years ago that innovative disruption would come to our industry. We embraced it and continued to see more and more exciting changes and resulting opportunities. 
We moved early to jettison our thin brands and went deep with investments into our rich, distinctive brands when many market pundits were skeptical of this approach. Because of these investments, our brands have been rewarded with full distribution on all traditional and newly launched platforms. 
Now there is a lot of talk about the growing importance of scale in the media industry, and let me be very clear, FOX has the required scale to continue to both execute on our growth strategy and deliver increased returns to shareholders. 
We are specifically seeing this in our affiliate fee growth again this quarter, in the success of Hulu and in our inclusion in all of the emerging VMVPDs. 
We are excited about all of our brands and the breadth of opportunities they continue to offer the company. All in all, our progress in the quarter keeps us on pace with our fiscal 2018 objectives and directly in line with our long-term plan, however, long-term delivery coming from an intense day-to-day focus towards being the very best in storytelling, in journalism, in sports and in innovation to consumers worldwide. 
Driving these businesses is a stellar management team, from Peter Rice at the Fox Networks Groups, to Uday Shankar's STAR, Stacey Snider, John Landgraf, Eric Shanks, Carlos Martinez, Dana Walden, Gary Newman, Jack Abernethy, Brian Sullivan, along with our 22,000 colleagues around the world, we are singularly and intensely focused on delivering on our strategic plan. 
Our businesses and brands are stronger than ever and have the right management and strategies to achieve market-leading value accretion. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to John."

We reported our first quarter financial results today, highlighted by revenue growing 8% to reach $7 billion. It was led by double-digit growth at the Cable Network segment and increases at the Film and Television segments. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter of $1.79 billion was in line with last year's result as company-wide revenue growth was offset by expected higher cost, largely due to the higher volume of sports events broadcasts in the current quarter at the Cable and Television segments. 
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $839 million or $0.45 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.49. 
So with those highlights, I'll provide some added comments on the performance of our operating segments for the quarter and starting with the Cable Network segment, where EBITDA of $1.51 billion was up 9% on revenue growth of 10% and expense growth, primarily from sports volume, of 11%. But notably, this expense increase reflects a 2-percentage point impact from the inclusion of sublicense sports rights. 
Domestic cable revenues increased 9%, led by 11% affiliate fee growth and advertising revenue growth of 3%. The affiliate fee increase reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands. The advertising growth largely reflects higher viewership across our sports network. 
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 11% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by increased costs from added college football and soccer games at FS1 and Major League Baseball rights increases at FS1 and the RSNs. 
Reported international cable revenues grew 13%, driven also by an 11% increase in reported affiliate revenue and a 10% increase in reported advertising revenue. 
International content and other revenues increased 35% over the prior year due to the sublicensing of Latin American soccer rights to third parties, which is offset in expenses. 
Reported international EBITDA contributions were consistent with the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues being offset by expected higher programming costs, largely from increased soccer in Latin America from the inaugural broadcast of the Argentine Football Association and from the timing of Conmebol matches. 
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $122 million, 36% below last year. Television segment revenues grew 3% on higher retransmission consent revenue and increased sports advertising revenue from a higher volume of college football games and one additional NFL game. These ad sale gains were partially offset by reduced political advertising at the stations. 
Our net revenue improvement was more than offset by higher sports rights from the increased volume of football games and normal rights increases. 
At the Film segment, first quarter EBITDA of $256 million was $55 million below a year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by lower contributions at the Film division, led by lower sales in international TV markets. 
Overall, Film segment revenues in the quarter were 3% higher than the prior year, primarily due to higher Television production revenues led by the domestic syndication sale of Futurama. 
And finally, from a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in cash and $19.8 billion in debt. Our capital allocation priority continues to be focused on funding the Sky acquisition. 
So all in all, a good start to achieving our fiscal 2018 financial objectives. On our last earnings call, I mentioned a number of comparability items to be aware of as we progressed through this fiscal year, and at this time, I don't have any meaningful changes to those items. 
So one addition of note since the call is our successful acquisition of the IPL cricket rights in India starting this coming spring. These worldwide rights will add approximately 3 percentage points of cost growth to the Cable segment, and we expect a similar dollar amount of incremental revenues to be generated from these matches all in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, let me turn it over to James."

Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. 
So as you've heard, fiscal 2018 has started pretty well. One quarter in, we're on track to generate meaningful growth and to deliver operational advances that are going to serve the company well going forward. 
We're committed to our strategy of producing both highly localized content around the world and broad global franchises that travel well and together, build resident brands in our marketplace -- in our key markets. 
New digital platforms, in partnership with us, are leading the way and improving the customer experience and allowing us to make high-quality storytelling, sports and news programming more available, not less, which will drive further consumption of our content and more visibility into that consumption by our customers, strengthening our business. 
And across the company, the whole company, we're making really good progress. For example, in Argentina, which will soon be our largest South American market, the launch of our premium sports business, anchored by our long-term rights agreement with the AFA, has exceeded all of our expectations. 
We've added more local stations in sports to FOX NOW. The international rollouts of Fox Plus and FOX Premium continue to gain traction. And Hotstar, which continues to set the pace for streaming in India, recently launched internationally for the Indian diaspora, providing opportunities to further monetize our Indian investments. 
Additionally, the rollout of FX+ on Comcast systems, which allows us to resurface, repackage and monetize great content from our library as well as current output in an ad-free premium environment, is showing great promise. 
It also recently launched on Cox systems, and others are expected to follow shortly. 
Our commitment to deliver a less cluttered viewing experience does not necessarily come at the expense of lower advertising yields. 6-second spots during the NFL, the launch of Open AP, addressable ads in on-demand and streaming on Hulu are all examples of innovation we have embraced in this space. In fact, Fox Networks Group digital ad revenue in aggregate is up 30% year-over-year, with revenue per stream on our apps up 50% at FBC, 130% at FX and up 300% at FOX Sports. 
Perhaps most encouragingly, as we predicted to you over a year ago at our broadcast network entertainment business, the combination of ad-free premiums and nonlinear advertising sales now outpaces the linear revenue decline driven by customers' preference for time-shifting their viewing. 
Before closing, I'd like to reiterate 2 meaningful milestones we expect to achieve before the end of this fiscal year. First, at STAR, our significant past investments and current investments in entertainment, sports, regional and our mobile platform, Hotstar, position the company as the premier Indian content and digital distribution company. 
First quarter results keep us on plan to achieve $500 million of EBITDA target this fiscal year as projected and with velocity heading into the next few years. 
And as John mentioned, STAR just recently took its final step in the realignment of its sports portfolio with the acquisition of those 5-year rights for the Indian Premier League, the most attended and watched cricket league in the world. Exclusive global rights across broadcasting and digital will be a key growth driver of this business going forward. 
These rights cement our confidence in achieving our financial targets for our Indian business, and our aspiration for the business over the long-term continues to grow. 
Secondly, we're engaging with the U.K. regulators on our proposed Sky acquisition. We're confident this transaction will accelerate the company's operational and financial growth, and we anticipate the transaction to close by the middle of 2018. 
In conclusion, the trajectory and the velocity of the business are good. The business is well positioned, we've made a lot of progress, and we're excited about the upcoming years. 
And as Lachlan pointed out, we can't comment on market speculation, but we're happy to discuss our business and the quarter's results. So over to you."

And then I wanted to ask the team about Hulu, which is obviously a major player in that 3 million subscriber number you mentioned.

So you have this -- we have this rate increase from previous -- step-ups from previous affiliate agreements, not in the quarter, but volume holding up well. And look, it's a little bit mixed. I think you saw the telco kind of distributors shrink at a greater rate than some of the cable and DBS. But fundamentally, new competition is driving growth, right? And I think in the -- from a billable subs perspective, this is on a couple of months' lag in these numbers of about 2 million, but just in the last few months, they have added another million of VMVPDs, right? So it's almost 3 million, as Lachlan mentioned today. And that's only going to accelerate from here because really, that's prior to the marketing that we saw from YouTube, the upcoming kind of more aggressive marketing from Hulu, and we think others as well. DIRECTV NOW, Sling, fubo, with its sports focus and a slightly different kind of package, is growing well. So we feel really good about that. And I think it's important, just before I get to Hulu, to reemphasize that the streaming MVPD, the VMVPD, if you will, is a really great platform for us. And we think it's an incredible set of platforms for monetizing our programming and our investment, and it's a great user experience as well. And it's really in line with what we've been trying to accomplish and have been talking to all of you guys about over the last couple of years, and I think you can really start to see that coming through in this quarter. 
With respect to Hulu, yes, look, I wouldn't read too much into the management change. I mean, Mike Hopkins left to take a great job at Sony, is a longtime colleague of ours and was a great leader of Hulu. And I'm really excited for Randy Freer, who came out of the Fox Networks Group to go over to Hulu very recently, and we're sure that that's going to continue -- that's going to help continue the momentum and really good pace that the Hulu business has. So we feel good about Hulu Live. It's growing well. It's early days. We feel great about Hulu's product and product road map. And I think what we're going to see is Hulu and a number of other of these VMVPDs continue to be real pacesetters in the marketplace, both from a customer experience perspective, a content offering perspective and a volume perspective, offsetting a lot of the declines that we've seen over the last sort of while. And as I think I've said in the last quarterly call, we expected actually -- we think that the so-called pay TV universe, the universe of people paying for video services, in these multiservice providers is actually going to grow."

It terms of the advertising capability, we continue to improve our ad capability across the piece. I think there are a few milestones to look at. I think the adoption of standards across the sort of streaming video industry, I think the Open AP platform, which we're a big proponent of, I think is important. I think seeing third-party verification really take root across digital advertising, both on -- from social networks to streaming video platforms, I think is going to be really important. And then there's an industry thing that we're working very hard to sort of get in place. But fundamentally, we're not waiting on that to innovate, right? So I look at it and think, let's not wait to try to move this whole kind of armada of companies to something, let's actually go out there and iterate and find the ad products that are going to make sense for customers. And that's an ad product that, for example, you could buy out if you're a customer and not have ads and you value your time more than Coca-Cola does, or it's ad products that are great for customers in pitching changes, like the 6-second spots and picture-in-picture stuff. So it's not just digital advertising, but it's across the piece. How do we present solutions to our clients, the marketers who are trying reach our audience, and our audience is valuable when they're growing. But also, there's technical innovation that we can bring to bear as well. So I think it's hard to pick sort of any one milestone. I think a really important milestone was what I mentioned in my opening comments, which was if you take the ad-free premium royalties that we get when people buy out their ads and they buy the Hulu premium stuff, and our nonlinear advertising inventory monetization, we actually overtook the decline that's coming from time shifted viewing away from the live window. And that's in the broadcast entertainment business. I think that is a big milestone, and it's one that we talked about a number of quarters ago and it's important. So those are the sorts of things that we're really focused on. 
And with respect to the Sky approval, as I said, we're confident we're going to get the deal done in the first half of next year. We're engaged with the regulators. This is a transaction that has cleared every relevant regulator in all the markets we operate in and has been through a thorough Phase 1 in the U.K. with Ofcom, which has looked at all these issues. And we're pretty confident it gets done. 
In general, in terms of capital allocation, I think, hopefully, we've shown you over the last number of years that we're very, very focused on being good stewards of capital, we're very, very focused on deploying capital where we can get great returns for all our shareholders, and that's what we're going to continue to do."

Given the new IPL contract, which is $0.5 billion more, I think, in cost a year or for the next 5 years, can you talk about how that product is evolving and the confidence of the profitability measures you talked about for not only 2018, but 2020 that -- for $1 billion? And then just a clarification, obviously, you talked about your subscriber base being pretty stable and the virtual MVPDs growing. In those subscriber counts, are you counting the virtual MVPDs on your minimums or what's sort of been reported 2 months in areas?"

Just on the STAR business, look, we are confident about it. We think we have a great team there, we have got a great business, and the marketplace is one of extraordinary opportunity in terms of its scale, in terms of the vibrancy of the creative community, the vibrancy of the storytelling and sports there, et cetera. So we feel -- we do feel really good about it. As I mentioned earlier, we're on track for our short-term targets of $500 million of EBITDA this fiscal year. And I think we're -- and we're on track for the longer-term target, as you mentioned, of $1 billion of EBITDA in 2020. So I think that all feels good, even with the additional cost of the IPL. As John mentioned, in this fiscal year, it's the last quarter, we expect that increase in costs to be offset by an increase in revenue. And we think that the IPL is one of the great sports franchises in the world, and we think it's going to be able to deliver for the business. So it doesn't change that trajectory, but I think it makes it, over the course of the 5 years, quite a bit -- maybe a bit stronger. So we're -- we feel pretty good about it. 
With respect to Hotstar in general, look, I guess, as I think I've mentioned to all of you folks before, the real exciting opportunity here is an environment where you have just this incredible proliferation of video distribution on connected devices everywhere, where you have this -- and video consumption really driving so much of that consumption of connectivity generally. The opportunity in an environment where content really is king is to use that to build platforms. And we really see Hotstar as a platform in that way. So we're going to continue to iterate that product. But we think there's a lot to be done with it, both from a monetization point of view as well as an engagement point of view with customers, and you'll see new features. I hope -- I'd encourage everyone, the product is launched in the U.S. I'd encourage everybody to use it and use it. There's a lot of interesting features, a lot of social features, particularly around the way people watch sports together. So we feel great about it, but it's going to continue to change and the Hotstar platform will evolve rapidly."
