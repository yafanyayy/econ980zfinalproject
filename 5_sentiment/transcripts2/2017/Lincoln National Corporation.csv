Fourth quarter results were strong with operating earnings per share up [ph] 15% compared to last year. This capped a solid year, which included record EPS, a 9% increase in book value per share and a 12% ROE. Notably, we have a multiyear track record of similarly strong financial results and, more importantly, we continue to believe these results are sustainable over time. 
Our financial success and stability are the result of our clear and straightforward business model. As you know, we lead with distribution and product breadth. Nearly 90,000 independent brokers, agents and financial advisers have sold a Lincoln product in the past 2 [ph] years, and we consistently focus on expanding our distribution reach. Our 1,300 highly sophisticated wholesalers and reps provide our independent producers with customer solutions and product education. We match of this distribution with one of the broadest product portfolios in the industry and are at the forefront of product innovation. This strategy works throughout cycles and was successful once again in 2016. This year, individual Life Insurance sales increased 7%; Group Protection sales were up 17%; and RPS deposit reached a record $7.7 billion. 
2016 was a challenging year for self growth in the annuity business, which reflect somewhat of an adjusting market, but I am confident in our distribution and the product initiatives we are putting in place to respond. We expect these actions will rebuild sales momentum and enable us to return to full year positive net flows in 2018. In response to our lower annuity sales, we increased our share repurchases as we said we would, executing on another one of our core strategies, which is to actively direct capital to the highest and best use. When combined with our solid capital generation, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders this year. 
I won't touch on all strategies within our business model, but I do want to note that this year, we're launching another dimension of strategy, and that is to accelerate our utilization of digitization to improve our customer experience and increase efficiency. The borne digital companies such as Uber and Amazon are raising customer service expectations and we're moving to meet this expectation. Additionally, through increased use of robotics and other innovative tools, we intend to lower our cost. This will require some investment, and Randy will get into the financial details. But at a high level, after 2 years, the project will be self funding, and by 4 to 5 years out, we will see significant cost saves as well as potential revenue enhancements. 
Now turning to our business lines, starting with individual life. Our earnings were once again robust, and excluding notable items, we showed sequential improvement in earnings each quarter this year. Our sales were also outstanding with total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $231 million, a 17% increase from the prior year quarter. Notably, nearly every product line generated double-digit growth. Individual Life Insurance sales increased 12% in the quarter and a solid 7% for the full year. 
Let me spend a minute highlighting some product stories. MoneyGuard sales increased 19% in the quarter as we are benefiting from continued demand for linked benefit products and our multichannel distribution approach. For the full year, MoneyGuard sales reached a record $214 million. Term sales of $29 million increased 16% as we continue to benefit from several product and process enhancements over the past year. Indexed Universal Life sales increased 15% as IUL has seen outpaced growth over recent years due to an increase in GUL pricing. I also note that the industry has settled into last year's IUL illustration regulation, which has brought more consistency to the marketplace. Overall, our mix of sales continues to achieve our strategic objectives, including diversification as all individual life products represented between 10% and 30% [ph] of total Life Insurance sales [indiscernible] tilt away from long-term guarantees, 66% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees up [ph] slightly. And lastly, strong returns. As expected, new business returns are achieving our target range of 12% to 15%. Our outlook for the Life Insurance business remain strong, and we expect growth to continue, driven by our diversified product portfolio combined with our leading distribution. 
Turning to Group Protection. We continue to see a positive trajectory in our growth and profitability trends. Fourth quarter sales of $263 [ph] million were up 18% from the same period last year and full-year sales were up nearly the same percentage following 2 straight years of sales decline. We are pleased with this very strong sales rebound, and it indicates the resilience of our distribution channel. Our pricing remains disciplined and our outlook for future sales growth is aligned with our long-term target of middle single-digit increases. 
Just as important to drive future premium growth will be persistency improvements, and the fourth quarter continue to indicate positive renewal persistency trends. With sales growth and improving persistency, our topline is also showing momentum as our premiums grew sequentially for the second straight quarter, and we expect to reestablish annual premium growth in 2017. 
As we have noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. And we have seen many encouraging signs that support strong top and bottom line trends in our group business. 
Turning to Annuities. We posted strong operating results in the fourth quarter as the power of our high quality in-force business overcame a challenging year of variable annuity sales, though I would note that sales have largely stabilized in recent quarters. We continue to expect long-term growth in the annuity marketplace given demographic trends and framing of traditional government and corporate safety nets. As I noted upfront, there is some adjusting taking place in the market driven by a shift in consumer preferences. Importantly, many of the trends are once we can address, and we actually see them as an opportunity to expand our distribution reach and the annuity marketplace over time. So let me describe our strategies to regain momentum in the annuity business. As you know, there has been a trend towards fee-based compensation. Historically, the annuity market has been mostly commission based, something we expect will continue. However, we are responding to this movement as we refreshed all of our fee-based products in January. We expect this will enable us to reach new advisers, and we believe fee-based annuities present a significant long-term growth opportunity. Another shift has been the increase in passive investments. As a result, we created a new product category. To this point, I hope you saw this announcement of our collaboration with BlackRock, where we designed a simple, transparent and lower cost fee-based annuity. We expect this product to help capture the shift towards passive investments as it is comprised exclusively of   ETFs. Additionally, this product positions us well in the growing IRA advisers space. 
Lastly, we are responding to the adviser feedback with product enhancements that provide clients more investment choice and flexibility, which should offer them better upside potential, aligning with our historical value proposition of lower initial income, but the potential for greater upside. As you can see, we are leveraging our longtime successful playbook of expanding and developing distribution coupled with product evolution. We expect all these actions to contribute to our sales recovery and build on our impressive track record of growth and profitability in our annuity business. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with recent quarters and net flows were in line with our outlook. Total deposits for the quarter of $2.4 billion were [ph] up 15% as we benefited from strength in both the small and mid to large markets. Full year results were a very good story with record total deposits of $7.7 billion. Total net flows for the quarter were $386 million. This marked our best quarter for net flows since the financial crisis. Full year net flows increased 25% to $565 million. The increase was driven by a combination of growth in deposits and improvement in our withdrawal rate. 
Looking ahead to 2017, our outlook is similar to this time last year in that we will not be surprised to see lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows. However, we expect another year of net flow improvement. Our confidence is driven by our strategy, which aligns the fastest-growing markets with customers that value our high-touch service model. Importantly, we have a proven ability to distinguish ourselves in these markets while achieving our targeted returns, which is giving us a lot of positive momentum. 
And briefly on investment results. Alternative investment had another solid quarter as both our private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to a 12% annualized return consistent with the third quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to increase our alternative earnings over time as we grow the portfolio and further shift mix towards private equity. In terms of new money, we have seen a meaningful increase in yields since the election. Post election, we have been investing new money at 4.1%. This has reduced the spread between new money and the fixed income portfolio yield to 70 basis points and cut the headwind to earnings growth from 3% to 2%. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape with high quality and broadly diversified. Below investment-grade assets represent just 5.2% of our fixed income portfolio consistent with last year as the derisking actions we took earlier in the year significantly reduced our exposure to negative ratings migration and improve our credit portfolio profile. 
Before turning the call over to Randy, I would like to just touch on some potential impacts from the new administration, recognizing it is too early to reach specific conclusion. First, it is important to note, we build our strategy, financial growth plans and shareholder value creation around things within our control. But I would point out that some of the new administration policies and proposals have the possibility of providing us incremental tailwinds. An increased economic growth and possibly higher interest rates can help with margin compression, but just as important, will provide more flexibility in terms of our ability to offer consumers an even better value proposition for our products. Although not assured, there is an increasing likelihood of the delay to the Department of Labor fiduciary rule and a focus on improving the rule's ultimate objective, something we support. If this were to occur, we believe it could remove some of the confusion in the marketplace that is contributing to the decline in annuity sales. 
Lastly, on tax reform, hard to pinpoint where this will land, but we will also see this as an additional benefit. So again, still early, but there is potential for incremental growth levers, and we will be sure to update you on the impacts of these as we learn more. 
So I'm pleased with our solid fourth quarter results and our record operating earnings per share in 2016. Importantly, we are proving time and time again that our business model enables us to take advantage of emerging opportunities as well as overcome cyclical or structural headwinds. As we enter 2017, we have a lot of positive momentum and I like the fact that we continue to be on the offensive as key drivers of our financial success remain well within our control. Notably, we are positioned to drive organic growth through our leading distribution channels and our broad set of customer solutions. We continue to find opportunities to leverage the strength of our in-force business, and we will continue our successful track record of returning capital to shareholders. In closing, Lincoln's business model is simple, clear and straightforward and it produces solid and repeatable financial results. We're proud of our long-term performance and pleased that it continues to reward our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."
867423,413987272,1122396,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2017",2017-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $409 million or $1.77 per share for the fourth quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year. I would note a few items that drove some variability within the segments this quarter. On the",1820,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $409 million or $1.77 per share for the fourth quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year. I would note a few items that drove some variability within the segments this quarter. On the positive side, we're $8 million of benefit on the tax line and other operations, and $13 million of benefit of favorable variable investment income spread across the businesses. These 2 items were completely offset by some expense items, including an increase in deferred comp-related expenses associated with a $19 increase in our share price during the quarter and higher variable expenses from strong sales growth in most of our businesses. Additionally, we had favorable mortality, which I will speak to later. 
Now let me touch on the performance of key financial metrics. For the full year, reported operating EPS of $6.50 was a record and up 19%. Our EPS, excluding notable items, was also a record, up 7%. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% to $57.5. Operating return on equity was strong at 12.7% in the quarter and 12% for the full year. Positive consolidated net flows have contributed to account values that continue to grow from depressed levels earlier in the year, providing a nice earnings tailwind. Our balance sheet remains an important source of strength, supported by solid liquidity metrics and strong capital generation. This enabled us to return $261 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year. 
Further highlighting the strength of our balance sheet, our yearend cash flow testing continues to point to significant statutory reserve adequacy, and we do not anticipate any reserve deficiencies. And we completed our good will review, which did not have any impairment. 
Net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by a few items. The largest item was a $178 million net loss from variable annuity net derivative results, with more than half of this being a noneconomic charge related to non-performance risk, which is the result of our own credit spread narrowing in the quarter. Fund basis risk made up the majority of the remaining amount. I would remind you that over time, this sort of break is just summed up to essentially 0, so I wouldn't be surprised to see that come back at some point in time. 
Taking advantage of that narrowing credit spread, we did complete an economically advantageous tender for some higher coupon debt in December, which resulted in a $41 million loss on the early extinguishment. 
Before shifting to segment results, let me discuss the digitization initiative. In addition to the strategic benefits Dennis discussed in his remarks, I would note that we do see an opportunity to take significant expenses out of the business over the next several years. Now analogous to an M&A transaction, there will be integration cost or investments made to ultimately get the run rate savings. You can see in our statistical supplement, we have begun reporting a strategic digitization expense in other operations. In the fourth quarter, it was $8 million pretax. And we would expect roughly $10 million a quarter in 2017, but we could see some quarterly variability based on the timing of certain projects. I would note, we are trying to strike the right balance in terms of protecting near-term results while also capitalizing on efficiency opportunities, which will lower our expense base. To this point, during the first 2 years of this initiative, we would expect annual net cost of $40 million pretax. By year 3, the earnings impact should be neutral, and then in the fourth year, we will begin to see meaningful cost savings, which I would size at 6% to 10% of our $1.5 billion in addressable G&A expenses. Hopefully, this gives you a good sense of the positive long-term opportunity around digitization and also the visibility and transparency to incorporate assumptions within your models. 
Now I will turn to segment results. Starting with Life Insurance. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $154 million compared to $119 [ph] million last year. Included in the current quarter's earnings were favorable mortality results consistent with our expectations for the fourth quarter of any year. 
I want to spend a minute analyzing 2016 mortality experience as I believe it represents a reasonable proxy for how we think about long-term results and seasonality. For the year, we had good mortality results with our actual to expected mortality coming in at 99%. Now we do see quite a bit of variability in mortality quarter-to-quarter, much of which I would attribute to seasonality. For example, mortality negatively impacted earnings by $30 million in the first quarter, with roughly 2/3 of that related to typical seasonality. Ultimately, what we expect is to make up this negative seasonality during the second half of the year and this is what occurred this year. 
Shifting to spreads. Base spreads, which exclude variable investment income, were down 6 basis points for the full year, within the 5 to 10 basis point range we have discussed in the past. Given the movement in interest rates, we would expect to be at the low end of that range in 2017. Earnings drivers remain steady for the quarter and year with average account balances and Life Insurance in-force both up [ph] 4% to 5%. Overall, this year's earnings were consistent with our expectations, while our strong sales results and key driver growth support earnings growth looking forward. 
Group Protection earnings of $16 million increased from $13 million in the prior-year quarter. Our loss ratios continued to show improvement, though this was somewhat offset by higher variable expenses tied to strong sales growth. Our nonmedical loss ratio improved to 70.9% from 75.3% in the prior-year quarter. This 440 basis point improvement was driven by better loss experience in all of our product lines. Notably, our full year loss ratios showed similar improvements, which resulted in an annual -- an increase in annual earnings of over 50%. 
As we have discussed, top line growth is expected to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. And as Dennis noted, we expect annual premium growth to reemerge in 2017. As you recall, we typically experience seasonally higher DAC amortization in the first quarter. This is tied to the first quarter being our heaviest renewal period. This year, given improvement in our persistency, we expect amortization to be roughly half of what we experienced in the first quarter of 2016. So overall, another solid quarter and strong year for the group business, and we expect that positive momentum to continue. 
In Annuities, reported earnings for the quarter were $242 million, flat versus the prior year quarter. Average account values were down 1% for the year as negative net flows more than offset positive market performance. So I would note that end of period balances did increase 3% on the back of strong equity market performance over the last 3 quarters. As a result, we saw sequential growth in reported earnings during every quarter of the year. 
Return metrics remained strong. Our ROA in the quarter was 78 basis points, while ROE came in at 21% for the quarter and full year. Notably, return on equity has exceeded 20% for the past 4 years and has averaged 20% for a decade. Outstanding results that highlight our differentiated and high-quality Annuities book. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $34 million, in line with the prior year. Fourth quarter revenue was up 3% compared to the prior year period while spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 13 basis points for the full year. This is near the midpoint of our 10 to 15 basis points guidance, and looking forward, we expect to be at the low end of that range. Return on assets was 23 basis points for the fourth quarter and the full year. Account values have benefited from several quarters of positive net flows, including nearly $400 million of flows in the fourth quarter. Combined with positive changes in equity markets over the past year, end-of-period account values increased 8% to more than $58 billion. 2016 was a good year for the retirement business, highlighted by record deposits, a 25% increase in net flows and consistent returns. As our outlook for net flows remains positive, we are well positioned for continued momentum in 2017. 
Let me discuss our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. First, in capital. We are extremely well positioned as our statutory surplus stands at $8.8 billion, up nearly $400 million from the prior year period. We estimate our RBC ratio end-of-the-year at approximately 490%, consistent with the prior year. Our capital and liquidity profile is further bolstered by $561 million of cash at the holding company. In terms of capital deployment, I noted upfront, we returned more than $1.1 billion to shareholders this year, up slightly from the prior year. As you know, our mix of cash, return to shareholders have been weighted more towards buybacks than dividends. We expect that trend to continue as we see the current share price is undervalued and an excellent use of capital. We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow and a track record of getting that cash back to shareholders. For example, in the past 6 years, we have returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders, with $4 billion of this through buybacks at an average price of under $38, reducing our shares outstanding by nearly 1/3. This year, we returned 72% of our operating earnings to shareholders, which is above our long-term free cash flow target of 50% to 55%. While our long-term target remains unchanged, we expect to be approximately 10 points above that range in 2017 as we leverage the strength of our balance sheet. Notably, the board recently approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing it back up to $1 billion. 
So to conclude, 2016 was an excellent year. We reported record operating EPS. Book value per share grew to over $57, a record, and up 9%. And our ROE was strong at 12%. Let me remind you, this follows a period where over the past 6 years, EPS has grown at an annual rate of 12%, book value per share has increased at a 7% rate and our ROE is expanded nearly 300 basis points. As we look forward, we are excited about our digitization initiative, which will deliver real value to the bottom line. We fully expect to continue generating positive net flows and premium growth across all our businesses. And lastly, our balance sheet is as strong as it has ever been, and our ability to generate capital remains robust, which will enable us to continue our strong track record of returning capital to shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

And then just a strength of our balance sheet will drive the other piece."

Is it -- do you think it's that you've seen a big shift move away from front load commission type products broadly, and that's predominantly how VAs have been sold and the move to level fee commissions? It's kind of a tricky transition because that's not historically a lot of the way those products have been sold. Can you talk a bit about is that's really what's driving it? And do you think that despite what happens with DOL that you think a lot of distributors have moved in that direction and they're going to stay there so we're going to see a depressing impact for a while here?"

And that quality was built off of a basic value proposition to the consumer of upside potential and lower initial guarantees. So that value proposition remains in the marketplace. It's been hurt a little bit by lower returns inside the subaccount, some of that related to risk-managed funds. So our response to that -- and we're able to be responsive inside of that category because interest rates have moved up a little bit, giving us a little more flexibility. So what we're doing in that product category is providing more investment flexibility. So for example, in the past, we may have had a requirement of 70% equity, 30% debt and we're modifying that a little bit. Again, because of interest rate environment, we're able to a little bit up [ph] the initial payout rate or the initial income payout rates. So you've got that block of business. And again, it's been affected a little bit by fund performance but were responding to that. Then, as a second value proposition, which is even more investment flexibility but with a lower initial income payout, and that's very exciting. Again, taking our initial equity debt relationship with 70-30 -- or excuse me, 60-40 to 70-30 so there is an ability to get more equity into the account, getting more upside potential. And also, the removal of the risk-managed funds in that particular product category. So lower income initially with more investment restrictions because one of them have upside potential and the other one I just described. Then a whole new product category is what we talked about in terms of the BlackRock product, both in terms of the structure of the product as well as the opportunity to go with the retirement income -- excuse me, the register investment adviser channel. And then finally, the -- there is a lot of activity in the sort of the traditional deferred income annuity accumulation product space. That's the fixed income and fixed indexed annuity being a part of that and we're strengthening that as well. So I can't say that there's one market adjustment that's affecting the overall market. It's a whole series of things, and we have products and plans in place to address each one of them. I do think they're coming back specifically to the Department of Labor and the whole issue around commissions and the lack of -- because there's been so much, what would I say -- it's been unclear at our distribution partners exactly how this was going to start out. Even if the existing rule was to turn out, the rule had to be interpreted, technology changes, and so the distribution partners have been slow -- a little bit slow to communicate to their own advisers where we're going to end up. So I think that the DOL issue is probably had a lot more impact. And whether or not it's delayed, I think, that confusion will go away on April 17 [ph] when everybody has to implement their final plans. So a lot of different effects in the marketplace. I'll finish with 2 things. One, I continue to believe that long term, the individual annuity market, whether it's for market, whether it's for accumulation or for guaranteed lifetime income, is going to be robust and vibrant. And our product development is addressing the issues that we can address, and I'm confident that we will recover our sales momentum."

And so that's going to move -- those 2 pieces are going to move a little bit. Instead of just commissions, we're going to have fee-based products and, as I mentioned, more passive opportunities for investments inside. And let me differentiate that for a second. When I talk about commission and active, that's a set of financial advisers that exist in our selling Annuities. And some of the refreshment activities we've had in our products that address that particular adviser cohort such as reducing the fees within -- on the fee-based part of it, reducing the fees, paying for that with lower payments out to the broker dealers. That will move, I think, gradually over time as between the amount of people that use commissions and the amount of people that's for fees. And that's going to be, in, part based on what their customers preferences, and so that's going to move forward. The second issue is a little different, and that is the RIAA market, which is pretty significant market in the United States where Annuities haven't been a big piece of what they've provided. There's 1 firm that's been reasonably successful. I think, that's the area for additional cohort of financial advisers expanding the distribution opportunity beyond what exists today."

I think the products most impacted will be in the annuity and the life business. In the annuity businesses Dennis has talked, about the increase in interest rates has allowed us to make some changes on the products, which we believe will make them more attractive to consumers. So I don't think that the increase in interest rates has had a huge impact on the returns that we expect of those products. I think, maybe on fixed annuities, you got a little bit of a boost because as you get a little higher return on your surplus, you get a little better [indiscernible] but I wouldn't say it's a material impact. On the life side, we have been running strong returns, 12% to 15% for some time now and I don't expect that to change materially.

So you take that and that's a big deal, both for that business and the company in total. So the biggest financial impact and the impact you're going to see immediately is because that spread compression never goes down. As you mentioned, we were at between 2% to 3%. We're now down at about 2%, so you've got a little bit less spread compression and that's a benefit across the company from that standpoint. On new business, Dennis mentioned this in his comments, it allows products to become -- to get adjusted in a way that makes them more attractive to consumers. You are able to offer more benefits for lower premiums, which makes these products not only more attractive to consumers, but more competitive with the other options they may have. So I think, that's a big steel from a new business standpoint  if you can see those new sales levels move up. Factually, new business has never had a huge impact on earnings we expect in the next year or 2. That's more about the growth of the business.

But roughly speaking, what we said came true in that we were able to overcome the drag on earnings cost by the lower annuity sales through share repurchases in 2016. Now I would note when you look forward, that math changes a little bit because of the increase in share price. We can't buy quite back the same number of shares per dollar that we use.

So that's to strategy. Deals coming to the market come episodically. We'll continue to look at things. We've looked at some properties in the last 24 months.

And if something comes along that fits with our long-term strategy, all of which points we articulated, we will take a look. I will say that we wouldn't do anything that would materially affect our share buyback program over time."

Good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results were strong with operating earnings per share up 15% compared to last year. This capped a solid year, which included record EPS, a 9% increase in book value per share and a 12% ROE. Notabl",1975,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. 
Fourth quarter results were strong with operating earnings per share up 15% compared to last year. This capped a solid year, which included record EPS, a 9% increase in book value per share and a 12% ROE. Notably, we have a multiyear track record of similarly strong financial results. And more importantly, we continue to believe these results are sustainable over time. 
Our financial success and stability are the result of our clear and straightforward business model. As you know, we lead with distribution and product breadth. Nearly 90,000 independent brokers, agents and financial advisers have sold a Lincoln product in the past 2 years, and we consistently focus on expanding our distribution reach. Our 1,300 highly sophisticated wholesalers and reps provide our independent producers with customer solutions and product education. We match this distribution with one of the broadest product portfolios in the industry and are at the forefront of product innovation. This strategy works throughout cycles and was successful, once again, in 2016. This year, individual Life Insurance sales increased 7%; Group Protection sales were up 17%; and RPS deposits reached a record $7.7 billion. 
2016 was a challenging year for sales growth in annuity business, which reflect somewhat of an adjusting market, but I am confident in our distribution and the product initiatives we are putting into place to respond. We expect these actions will rebuild sales momentum and enable us to return to full year positive net flows in 2018. 
In response to our lower annuity sales, we increased our share repurchases as we said we would, executing on another one of our core strategies, which is to actively direct capital to the highest and best use. When combined with our solid capital generation, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders this year. 
I won't touch on all strategies within our business model, but I do want to note that this year, we are launching another dimension of strategy, and that is to accelerate our utilization of digitization to improve our customer experience and increase efficiency. The born [ph] digital companies such as Uber and Amazon are raising customer service expectations and we're moving to meet this expectation. 
Additionally, through increased use of robotics and other innovative tools, we intend to lower our cost. This will require some investments, and Randy will get into the financial details. But at a high level, after 2 years, the project will be self funding and by 4 to 5 years out, we will see significant cost saves as well as potential revenue enhancements. 
Now turning to our business lines, starting with individual life. Our earnings were once again robust, and excluding notable items, we showed sequential improvement in earnings each quarter this year. Our sales were also outstanding with total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $231 million, a 17% increase from the prior year quarter. Notably, nearly every product line generated double-digit growth. Individual Life Insurance sales increased 12% in the quarter and a solid 7% for the full year. 
Let me spend a minute highlighting some product stories. MoneyGuard sales increased 19% in the quarter as we are benefiting from continued demand for linked benefit products and our multichannel distribution approach. For the full year, MoneyGuard sales reached a record $214 million. Term sales of $29 million increased 16% as we continue to benefit from several product and process enhancements over the past year. Indexed universal life sales increased 15% as IUL has seen outpaced growth over recent years due to an increase in GUL pricing. I would also note that the industry has settled into last year's IUL illustration regulation which has brought more consistency to the marketplace. 
Overall, our mix of sales continues to achieve our strategic objectives, including diversification as all individual life products represented between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales. A tilt away from long-term guarantees, 66% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees up slightly. And lastly, strong returns. As expected, new business returns are achieving our target range of 12% to 15%. Our outlook for the Life Insurance business remains strong, and we expect growth to continue, driven by our diversified product portfolio combined with our leading distribution. 
Turning to Group Protection. We continue to see a positive trajectory in our growth and profitability trends. Fourth quarter sales of $263 million were up 18% from the same period last year and full year sales were up nearly the same percentage following 2 straight years of sales declines. We are pleased with this very strong sales rebound and it indicates the resilience of our distribution channel. Our pricing remains disciplined and our outlook for future sales growth is aligned with our long-term target of middle single-digit increases. 
Just as important to drive future premium growth will be persistency improvements, and the fourth quarter continue to indicate positive renewal persistency trends. With sales growth and improving persistency, our top line is also showing momentum as our premiums grew sequentially for the second straight quarter, and we expect to re-establish annual premium growth in 2017. As we have noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we have seen many encouraging signs that support strong top and bottom line trends in our group business. 
Turning to Annuities. We posted strong operating results in the fourth quarter as the power of our high quality in-force business overcame a challenging year of variable annuity sales, though I would note that sales have largely stabilized in recent quarters. We continue to expect long-term growth in the annuity marketplace given demographic trends and the preying of traditional government and corporate safety nets. As I noted upfront, there is some adjusting taking place in the market driven by shift in consumer preferences. Importantly, many of the trends are once we can address, and we actually see them as an opportunity to expand our distribution reach and the annuity marketplace over time. So let me describe our strategies to regain momentum in the annuity business. 
As you know, there has been a trend towards fee-based compensation. Historically, the annuity market has been mostly commission-based, something we expect will continue. However, we are responding to this movement as we refreshed all of our fee-based products in January. We expect this will enable us to reach new advisers, and we believe fee-based annuities present a significant long-term growth opportunity. 
Another shift has been the increase in passive investments. As a result, we created a new product category. To this point, I hope you saw the announcement of our collaboration with BlackRock, where we designed a simple, transparent and lower cost fee-based annuity. We expect this product to help capture the shift towards passive investments as it is comprised exclusively of ETFs. Additionally, this product positions us well in the growing IRA advisers space. 
Lastly, we are responding to the adviser feedback with product enhancements that provide clients more investment choice and flexibility, which should offer them better upside potential, aligning with our historical value proposition of lower initial income but the potential for greater upside. As you can see, we are leveraging our longtime successful playbook of expanding and developing distribution coupled with product evolution. We expect all these actions to contribute to our sales recovery and build on our impressive track record of growth and profitability in our annuity business. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with recent quarters and net flows were in line with our outlook. Total deposits for the quarter of $2.4 billion were up 15% as we benefited from strength in both the small and mid to large markets. Full year results were a very good story with record total deposits of $7.7 billion. Total net flows for the quarter were $386 million. This marked our best quarter for net flows since the financial crisis. Full year net flows increased 25% to $565 million. The increase was driven by a combination of growth in deposits and improvement in our withdrawal rate. 
Looking ahead to 2017, our outlook is similar to this time last year and that we would not be surprised to see lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows. However, we expect another year of net flow improvement. 
Our confidence is driven by our strategy, which aligns the fastest-growing markets with customers that value our high-touch service model. Importantly, we have a proven ability to distinguish ourselves in these markets while achieving our targeted returns, which is giving us a lot of positive momentum. 
And briefly on investment results. Alternative investment had another solid quarter as both our private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to a 12% annualized return consistent with the third quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to increase our alternative earnings over time as we grow the portfolio and further shift mix towards private equity. In terms of new money, we have seen a meaningful increase in yields since the election. Post election, we have been investing new money at 4.1%. This has reduced the spread between new money and the fixed income portfolio yield to 70 basis points and cut the headwind to earnings growth from 3% to 2%. 
Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape, high quality and broadly diversified. Below investment-grade assets represent just 5.2% of our fixed income portfolio consistent with last year as the de-risking actions we took earlier in the year significantly reduced our exposure to negative ratings migration and improved our credit portfolio profile. 
Before turning the call over to Randy, I'd like to just touch on some potential impacts from the new administration, recognizing it is too early to reach specific conclusion. First, it is important to note, we build our strategy, financial growth plans and shareholder value creation around things within our control. But I would point out that some of the new administration policies and proposals have the possibility of providing us incremental tailwinds. An increased economic growth and possibly higher interest rates can help with margin compression, but just as important, would provide more flexibility in terms of our ability to offer consumers an even better value proposition for our products. Although not assured, there is an increasing likelihood of the delay to the Department of Labor fiduciary rule and a focus on improving the rule's ultimate objective, something we support. If this were to occur, we believe it could remove some of the confusion in the marketplace that is contributing to the decline in annuity sales. 
Lastly, on tax reform, hard to pinpoint where this will land, but we also see this as an additional benefit. So again, still early, but there is potential for incremental growth levers, and we'll be sure to update you on the impacts of these as we learn more. 
So I'm pleased with our solid fourth quarter results and our record operating earnings per share in 2016. Importantly, we are proving time and time again that our business model enables us to take advantage of emerging opportunities as well as overcome cyclical or structural headwinds. As we enter 2017, we have a lot of positive momentum and I like the fact that we continue to be on the offensive as key drivers of our financial success remain well within our control. 
Notably, we are positioned to drive organic growth through our leading distribution channels and our broad set of customer solutions. We continue to find opportunities to leverage the strength of our in-force business, and we will continue our successful track record of returning capital to shareholders. 
In closing, Lincoln's business model is simple, clear and straightforward and it produces solid and repeatable financial results. We're proud of our long-term performance and pleased that it continues to reward our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."
867423,413987272,1122741,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2017",2017-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $409 million or $1.77 per share for the fourth quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year.

Last night, we reported income from operations of $409 million or $1.77 per share for the fourth quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year. I would note a few items that drove some variability within the segments this quarter. On the positive side, were $8 million of benefit on the tax line and other operations and $13 million of favorable, variable investment income spread across the businesses. These 2 items were completely offset by some expense items, including an increase in deferred comp-related expenses associated with a $19 increase in our share price during the quarter and higher variable expenses from strong sales growth in most of our businesses. Additionally, we had favorable mortality, which I will speak to later. 
Now let me touch on the performance of key financial metrics. For the full year, reported operating EPS of $6.50 was a record and up 19%. Our EPS, excluding notable items, was also a record, up 7%. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% to $57.5. Operating return on equity was strong at 12.7% in the quarter and 12% for the full year. Positive consolidated net flows have contributed to account values that continue to grow from depressed levels earlier in the year, providing a nice earnings tailwind. Our balance sheet remains an important source of strength, supported by solid liquidity metrics and strong capital generation. This enabled us to return $261 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year. 
Further highlighting the strength of our balance sheet, our year end cash flow testing continues to point to significant statutory reserve adequacy and we do not anticipate any reserve deficiencies. And we completed our good will review, which did not have any impairment. 
Net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by a few items. The largest item was a $178 million net loss from variable annuity net derivative results, with more than half of this being a noneconomic charge related to non-performance risk, which is the result of our own credit spread narrowing in the quarter. Fund basis risk made up the majority of the remaining amount. I would remind you that over time, this sort of break is just summed up to essentially 0, so I wouldn't be surprised to see that come back at some point in time. Taking advantage of that narrowing credit spread, we did complete an economically advantageous tender for some higher coupon debt in December, which resulted in a $41 million loss on the early extinguishment. 
Before shifting to segment results, let me discuss the digitization initiative. In addition to the strategic benefits Dennis discussed in his remarks, I would note that we do see an opportunity to take significant expenses out of the business over the next several years. 
Now analogous to an M&A transaction, there will be integration costs or investments made to ultimately get the run rate savings. You can see in our statistical supplement, we have begun reporting a strategic digitization expense in other operations. In the fourth quarter, it was $8 million pretax. And we would expect roughly $10 million a quarter in 2017, but we could see some quarterly variability based on the timing of certain projects. I would note, we are trying to strike the right balance in terms of protecting near-term results while also capitalizing on efficiency opportunities, which will lower our expense base. 
To this point, during the first 2 years of this initiative, we would expect annual net cost of $40 million pretax. By year 3, the earnings impact should be neutral. And then in the fourth year, we will begin to see meaningful cost savings, which I would size at 6% to 10% of our $1.5 billion in addressable G&A expenses. Hopefully, this gives you a good sense of the positive long-term opportunity around digitization and also the visibility and transparency to incorporate assumptions within your models. 
Now I will turn to segment results starting with Life Insurance. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $154 million compared to $119 million last year. Included in the current quarter's earnings were favorable mortality results consistent with our expectations for the fourth quarter of any year. 
I want to spend a minute analyzing 2016 mortality experience as I believe it represents a reasonable proxy for how we think about long-term results and seasonality. For the year, we have good mortality results with our actual to expected mortality coming in at 99%. Now we did see quite a bit of variability in mortality quarter-to-quarter, much of which I would attribute to seasonality. For example, mortality negatively impacted earnings by $30 million in the first quarter with roughly 2/3 of that related to typical seasonality. Ultimately, what we expect is to make up this negative seasonality during the second half of the year and this is what occurred this year. 
Shifting to spreads. Base spreads, which exclude variable investment income, were down 6 basis points for the full year, within the 5 to 10 basis point range we have discussed in the past. Given the movement in interest rates, we would expect to be at the low end of that range in 2017. Earnings drivers remained steady for the quarter and year with average account balances and Life Insurance in-force both up 4% to 5%. Overall, this year's earnings were consistent with our expectations, while our strong sales results and key driver growth support earnings growth looking forward. 
Group Protection earnings of $16 million increased from $13 million in the prior-year quarter. Our loss ratios continued to show improvement, though this was somewhat offset by higher variable expenses tied to strong sales growth. Our nonmedical loss ratio improved to 70.9% from 75.3% in the prior-year quarter. This 440 basis point improvement was driven by better loss experience in all of our product lines. Notably, our full year loss ratios showed similar improvements, which resulted in an annual -- an increase in annual earnings of over 50%. 
As we have discussed, top line growth is expected to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. And as Dennis noted, we expect annual premium growth to re-emerge in 2017. As you recall, we typically experience seasonally higher DAC amortization in the first quarter. This is tied to the first quarter being our heaviest renewal period. This year, given improvement in our persistency, we expect amortization to be roughly half of what we experienced in the first quarter of 2016. So overall, another solid quarter and strong year for the group business, and we expect that positive momentum to continue. 
In Annuities, reported earnings for the quarter were $242 million, flat versus the prior year quarter. Average account values were down 1% for the year as negative net flows more than offset positive market performance. So I would note that end of period balances did increase 3% on the back of strong equity market performance over the last 3 quarters. As a result, we saw sequential growth in reported earnings during every quarter of the year. 
Return metrics remained strong. Our ROA in the quarter was 78 basis points, while ROE came in at 21% for the quarter and full year. Notably, return on equity has exceeded 20% for the past 4 years and has averaged 20% for a decade, outstanding results that highlight our differentiated and high-quality Annuities book. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $34 million, in line with the prior year. Fourth quarter revenue was up 3% compared to the prior year period while spreads, excluding variable investment income, comprised 13 basis points for the full year. This is near the midpoint of our 10 to 15 basis point guidance. And looking forward, we expect to be at the low end of that range. 
Return on assets was 23 basis points for the fourth quarter and the full year. Account values have benefited from several quarters of positive net flows, including nearly $400 million of flows in the fourth quarter. Combined with positive changes in equity markets over the past year, end-of-period account values increased 8% to more than $58 billion. 
2016 was a good year for the retirement business, highlighted by record deposits, a 25% increase in net flows and consistent returns. As our outlook for net flows remains positive, we are well positioned for continued momentum in 2017. 
Let me discuss our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. First, at capital. We are extremely well positioned as our statutory surplus stands at $8.8 billion, up nearly $400 million from the prior year period. We estimate our RBC ratio end-of-the-year at approximately 490%, consistent with the prior year. Our capital and liquidity profile is further bolstered by $561 million of cash at the holding company. In terms of capital deployment, I noted upfront, we returned more than $1.1 billion to shareholders this year, up slightly from the prior year. As you know, our mix of cash, return to shareholders have been weighted more towards buyback than dividends. We expect that trend to continue as we see the current share price is undervalued at an excellent use of capital. 
We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow and a track record of getting that cash back to shareholders. For example, in the past 6 years, we have returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders, with $4 billion of this through buybacks at an average price of under $38, reducing our shares outstanding by nearly 1/3. This year, we returned 72% of our operating earnings to shareholders, which is above our long-term free cash flow target of 50% to 55%. While our long-term target remains unchanged, we expect to be approximately 10 points above that range in 2017 as we leverage the strength of our balance sheet. Notably, the board recently approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing it back up to $1 billion. 
So to conclude, 2016 was an excellent year. We reported record operating EPS. Book value per share grew to over $57, a record, and up 9%. And our ROE was strong at 12%. Let me remind you, this follows a period where over the past 6 years, EPS is growing at an annual rate of 12%, book value per share has increased at a 7% rate and our ROE is expanded nearly 300 basis points. As we look forward, we are excited about our digitization initiative, which will deliver real value to the bottom line. We fully expect to continue generating positive net flows and premium growth across all our businesses. And lastly, our balance sheet is as strong as it has ever been, and our ability to generate capital remains robust, which will enable us to continue our strong track record of returning capital to shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

If you broke that down, I would say about $200 million of that came from the reinsurance transaction we did earlier in the year, which generated a significant amount of capital. And about 100 of it came from the fact that variable annuity sales were below where they had been in the past. As you look forward and as Dennis talked about, I would continue to expect the VA sales to be below our long-term expectations, so I think that will drive some of the continued increase that I talked about.

Is it -- do you think it's that you've seen a big shift move away from front load commission type products broadly and that's predominantly how VAs have been sold and the move to level fee commissions? It's kind of a tricky transition because that's not historically a lot of the way those products have been sold. Can you talk a bit about that really what's driving it? And do you think that despite what happens with DOL that you think a lot of distributors have moved in that direction and they're going to stay there so we're going to see a depressing impact for a while here?"

And that quality was built off of a basic value proposition to the consumer of upside potential and lower initial guarantees. So that value proposition remains in the marketplace. It's been hurt a little bit by lower returns inside the subaccount, some of that related to risk-managed funds. So our response to that and we're able to be responsive inside of that category because interest rates have moved up a little bit, giving us a little more flexibility. So what we're doing in that product category is providing more investment flexibility. So for example, in the past, we may have had a requirement of 70% equity, 30% debt and we're modifying that a little bit. Again, because of the interest rate environment, we're able to a little bit up the initial payout rates or the initial income payout rates. So you've got that block of business. And again, it's been affected a little bit by fund performance but we're responding to that. Then, as a second value proposition, which is even more investment flexibility but with a lower initial income payout, and that's very exciting. Again, taking our initial equity debt relationship with 70-30 -- or excuse me, 60-40 to 70-30 so there is an ability to get more equity into the account, getting more upside potential. And also, the removal of the risk-managed funds in that particular product category. So lower income initially with more investment restrictions because one of them have upside potential and the other one I just described. Then a whole new product category is what we talked about in terms of the BlackRock product, both in terms of the structure of the product as well as the opportunity to go into the retirement income -- excuse me, the registered investment adviser channel. And then finally, the -- there is a lot of activity in the, sort of, the traditional deferred income annuity accumulation product space, the fixed income and fixed indexed annuity as being a part of that and we're strengthening that as well. So I can't say that there's one market adjustment that's affecting the overall market. It's a whole series of things, and we have products and plans in place to address each one of them. I do think they're coming back specifically to the Department of Labor and the whole issue around commissions and the lack of -- because there's been so much, what would I say -- it's been unclear at our distribution partners exactly how this was going to turn out. Even if the existing rule was to turn out, the rule had to be interpreted, technology changes. And so the distribution partners have been slow -- a little bit slow to communicate to their own advisers where we're going to end up. So I think that the DOL issue is probably had a lot more impact. And whether or not it's delayed, I think that confusion will go away on April 17 [ph] when everybody has to implement their final plans. So a lot of different effects on the marketplace. I'll finish with 2 things. One, I continue to believe that long term, the individual annuity mark, whether it's for -- market, whether it's for accumulation or for guaranteed lifetime income is going to be robust and vibrant. And our product development is addressing the issues that we can address. And I'm confident that we'll recover our sales momentum."

And so, that's going to move -- those 2 pieces are going to move a little bit. Instead of just commissions, we're going to have fee-based products and, as I mentioned, more passive opportunities for investments inside. And let me differentiate that for a second. When I talk about commission and active, that's a set of financial advisers that exist in our selling Annuities. And some of the refreshment activities we've had in our products that address that particular adviser cohort such as reducing the fees within -- on the fee-based part of it, reducing the fees, paying for that with lower payments out to the broker dealers. That'll move, I think, gradually over time as between the amount of people that use commissions and the amount of people that's for fees. And that's going to be, in part, based on what their customers' preferences. And so, that's going to move forward. The second issue is a little different and that is the RIA market, which is a pretty significant market in the United States where Annuities haven't been a big piece of what they've provided. There's 1 firm that's been reasonably successful. I think, that's the area for additional cohort of financial advisers expanding the distribution opportunity beyond what exists today."

I think the products most impacted will be in the Annuity and the Life business.

I think maybe on fixed annuities, you got a little bit of a boost because if you get a little higher return on your surplus, you get a little better metro care [ph] but I wouldn't say it's a material impact. On the Life side, we have been running strong returns, 12% to 15% for some time now and I don't expect that to change materially.

So you take that and that's a big deal, both for that business and the company in total. So the biggest financial impact and the impact you're going to see immediately is because that spread compression never goes down. As you mentioned, we were at between 2% to 3%. We're now down at about 2%. So you've got a little bit less spread compression and that's a benefit across the company from that standpoint. On new business, Dennis mentioned this in his comments, it allows products to become -- to get adjusted in a way that makes them more attractive to consumers. You are able to offer more benefits or lower premiums, which makes these products not only more attractive to consumers, but more competitive with the other options they may have. So I think, that's a big deal from a new business standpoint if you can see those new sales levels move up.

So that was a little bit of a drag on the math. But roughly speaking, what we said came true in that we were able to overcome the drag on earnings caused by the lower annuity sales through share repurchases in 2016. Now I would note when you look forward, that math changes a little bit because of the increase in share price. We can't buy quite -- back quite the same number of shares per dollar that we use.

So at the end of the day, what you just had was mortality, really good mortality driving the $154 million of earnings which, just coincidentally, was almost an exact mirror of the first quarter of the year. As I said in the first quarter of the year, about $20 million of expected seasonality. We had about $10 million of additional, total of $30 million this quarter. About $29 million of benefit, over all, compared to an average quarter from good strong mortality, which we expect to happen in that quarter of the year."

In total, it came up to about $13 million after-tax as I mentioned in my script. I would say, that was fairly evenly split, maybe a little skewed towards prepayment income. If you broaden this out and you think about alternatives and prepayment income over a longer cycle, if you look at the last couple of years, what you've seen is that alternatives in both those years were a little below our long-term expectation. So for the full year, we were about $40 million lower than we would expect on the alternative side, whereas prepayment income was a little stronger. When you add them together, I don't think we're materially different from what a longer-term expectation might be for the sum of those 2 items."

And so whenever we do M&A, it's because we're trying to accelerate a strategy to do it for the sake of doing it. You're correct. We have said that we have a longer-term strategy of increasing the percentage of our income that comes from mortality and morbidity. And that in terms of our businesses, we would probably think of the group business as the top priority. So that's the strategy. Deals coming to the market come episodically. We'll continue to look at things. We've looked at some properties in the last 24 months and back to our allocating capital to the best use, it was way more expensive. The properties sold for way more than what we think would make sense for our use of capital. It would make a lot of good sense for the people who bought it, I don't know what their strategies were. So prices would probably have to come down a little bit before we get real interested in a deal, but we'll keep looking.  We're good at assessing M&A. We're good at integrating M&A. And if something comes along that fits with our long-term strategy, all of which points we've articulated, we would take a look.

Good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results were strong, with operating earnings per share up 15% compared to last year. This capped a solid year, which included record EPS, a 9% increase in book value per share and a 12% ROE. Notab",1974,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. 
Fourth quarter results were strong, with operating earnings per share up 15% compared to last year. This capped a solid year, which included record EPS, a 9% increase in book value per share and a 12% ROE. Notably, we have a multiyear track record of similarly strong financial results. And more importantly, we continue to believe these results are sustainable over time. 
Our financial success and stability are the result of our clear and straightforward business model. As you know, we lead with distribution and product breadth. Nearly 90,000 independent brokers, agents and financial advisers have sold a Lincoln product in the past 2 years, and we consistently focus on expanding our distribution reach. Our 1,300 highly sophisticated wholesalers and reps provide our independent producers with customer solutions and product education. We match this distribution with one of the broadest product portfolios in the industry and are at the forefront of product innovation. This strategy works throughout cycles and was successful, once again, in 2016. This year, individual Life Insurance sales increased 7%; Group Protection sales were up 17%; and RPS deposits reached a record $7.7 billion. 
2016 was a challenging year for sales growth in the annuity business, which reflect somewhat of an adjusting market, but I am confident in our distribution and the product initiatives we are putting into place to respond. We expect these actions will rebuild sales momentum and enable us to return to full year positive net flows in 2018. 
In response to our lower annuity sales, we increased our share repurchases as we said we would, executing on another one of our core strategies, which is to actively direct capital to the highest and best use. When combined with our solid capital generation, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders this year. 
I won't touch on all strategies within our business model, but I do want to note that this year, we are launching another dimension of strategy, and that is to accelerate our utilization of digitization to improve our customer experience and increase efficiency. The born digital companies, such as Uber and Amazon, are raising customer service expectations and we're moving to meet this expectation. 
Additionally, through increased use of robotics and other innovative tools, we intend to lower our cost. This will require some investments, and Randy will get into the financial details. But at a high level, after 2 years, the project will be self-funding and by 4 to 5 years out, we will see significant cost saves as well as potential revenue enhancements. 
Now turning to our business lines, starting with individual life. Our earnings were once again robust, and excluding notable items, we showed sequential improvement in earnings each quarter this year. Our sales were also outstanding, with total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $231 million, a 17% increase from the prior year quarter. Notably, nearly every product line generated double-digit growth. Individual Life Insurance sales increased 12% in the quarter and a solid 7% for the full year. 
Let me spend a minute highlighting some product stories. MoneyGuard sales increased 19% in the quarter, as we are benefiting from continued demand for linked benefit products and our multichannel distribution approach. For the full year, MoneyGuard sales reached a record $214 million. Term sales of $29 million increased 16% as we continued to benefit from several product and process enhancements over the past year. Indexed universal life sales increased 15% as IUL has seen outpaced growth over recent years due to an increase in GUL pricing. I would also note that the industry has settled into last year's IUL illustration regulation which has brought more consistency to the marketplace. 
Overall, our mix of sales continues to achieve our strategic objectives, including diversification, as all individual life products represented between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales; a tilt away from long-term guarantees; 66% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees up slightly; and lastly, strong returns. As expected, new business returns are achieving our target range of 12% to 15%. Our outlook for the Life Insurance business remains strong, and we expect growth to continue, driven by our diversified product portfolio combined with our leading distribution. 
Turning to Group Protection. We continue to see a positive trajectory in our growth and profitability trends. Fourth quarter sales of $263 million were up 18% from the same period last year and full year sales were up nearly the same percentage following 2 straight years of sales declines. We are pleased with this very strong sales rebound and it indicates the resilience of our distribution channel. Our pricing remains disciplined and our outlook for future sales growth is aligned with our long-term target of middle single-digit increases. 
Just as important to drive future premium growth will be persistency improvements, and the fourth quarter continued to indicate positive renewal persistency trends. With sales growth and improving persistency, our top line is also showing momentum as our premiums grew sequentially for the second straight quarter, and we expect to re-establish annual premium growth in 2017. As we have noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we have seen many encouraging signs that support strong top and bottom line trends in our group business. 
Turning to Annuities. We posted strong operating results in the fourth quarter as the power of our high quality in-force business overcame a challenging year of variable annuity sales, though I would note that sales have largely stabilized in recent quarters. We continue to expect long-term growth in the annuity marketplace given demographic trends and the preying of traditional government and corporate safety nets. As I noted upfront, there is some adjusting taking place in the market driven by shift in consumer preferences. Importantly, many of the trends are ones we can address, and we actually see them as an opportunity to expand our distribution reach and the annuity marketplace over time. So let me describe our strategies to regain momentum in the annuity business. 
As you know, there has been a trend towards fee-based compensation. Historically, the annuity market has been mostly commission-based, something we expect will continue. However, we are responding to this movement as we refreshed all of our fee-based products in January. We expect this will enable us to reach new advisers, and we believe fee-based annuities present a significant long-term growth opportunity. 
Another shift has been the increase in passive investments. As a result, we created a new product category. To this point, I hope you saw the announcement of our collaboration with BlackRock, where we designed a simple, transparent and lower-cost fee-based annuity. We expect this product to help capture the shift towards passive investments as it is comprised exclusively of ETFs. Additionally, this product positions us well in the growing RIA advisers space. 
Lastly, we are responding to adviser feedback with product enhancements that provide clients more investment choice and flexibility, which should offer them better upside potential, aligning with our historical value proposition of lower initial income but the potential for greater upside. As you can see, we are leveraging our longtime successful playbook of expanding and developing distribution coupled with product evolution. We expect all these actions to contribute to our sales recovery and build on our impressive track record of growth and profitability in our annuity business. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with recent quarters and net flows were in line with our outlook. Total deposits for the quarter of $2.4 billion were up 15% as we benefited from strength in both the small and mid to large markets. Full year results were a very good story, with record total deposits of $7.7 billion. Total net flows for the quarter were $386 million. This marked our best quarter for net flows since the financial crisis. Full year net flows increased 25% to $565 million. The increase was driven by a combination of growth in deposits and improvement in our withdrawal rate. 
Looking ahead to 2017, our outlook is similar to this time last year in that we would not be surprised to see lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows. However, we expect another year of net flow improvement. 
Our confidence is driven by our strategy, which aligns the fastest-growing markets with customers that value our high-touch service model. Importantly, we have a proven ability to distinguish ourselves in these markets while achieving our targeted returns, which is giving us a lot of positive momentum. 
And briefly on investment results. Alternative investments had another solid quarter as both our private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to a 12% annualized return, consistent with the third quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to increase our alternative earnings over time as we grow the portfolio and further shift mix towards private equity. In terms of new money, we have seen a meaningful increase in yields since the election. Post election, we have been investing new money at 4.1%. This has reduced the spread between new money and the fixed income portfolio yield to 70 basis points and cut the headwind to earnings growth from 3% to 2%. 
Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape, high quality and broadly diversified. Below investment-grade assets represent just 5.2% of our fixed income portfolio consistent with last year as the de-risking actions we took earlier in the year significantly reduced our exposure to negative ratings migration and improved our credit portfolio -- profile. 
Before turning the call over to Randy, I'd like to just touch on some potential impacts from the new administration, recognizing it is too early to reach specific conclusions. First, it is important to note we build our strategy, financial growth plans and shareholder value creation around things within our control. But I would point out that some of the new administration policies and proposals have the possibility of providing us incremental tailwinds. An increase in economic growth and possibly higher interest rates can help with margin compression, but just as important, would provide more flexibility in terms of our ability to offer consumers an even better value proposition for our products. Although not assured, there is an increasing likelihood of a delay to the Department of Labor fiduciary rule and a focus on improving the rule's ultimate objective, something we support. If this were to occur, we believe it could remove some of the confusion in the marketplace that is contributing to the decline in annuity sales. 
Lastly, on tax reform, hard to pinpoint where this will land, but we also see this as an additional benefit. So again, still early, but there is potential for incremental growth levers, and we'll be sure to update you on the impacts of these as we learn more. 
So I'm pleased with our solid fourth quarter results and our record operating earnings per share in 2016. Importantly, we are proving time and time again that our business model enables us to take advantage of emerging opportunities as well as overcome cyclical or structural headwinds. As we enter 2017, we have a lot of positive momentum and I like the fact that we continue to be on the offensive as key drivers of our financial success remain well within our control. 
Notably, we are positioned to drive organic growth through our leading distribution channels and our broad set of customer solutions. We continue to find opportunities to leverage the strength of our in-force business, and we will continue our successful track record of returning capital to shareholders. 
In closing, Lincoln's business model is simple, clear and straightforward and it produces solid and repeatable financial results. We're proud of our long-term performance and pleased that it continues to reward our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported income from operations of $409 million or $1.77 per share for the fourth quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year. I would note a few items that drove some variability within the segments this quarter. On the positive side, were $8 million of benefit on the tax line and other operations and $13 million of favorable variable investment income spread across the businesses. These 2 items were completely offset by some expense items, including an increase in deferred comp-related expenses associated with a $19 increase in our share price during the quarter and higher variable expenses from strong sales growth in most of our businesses. Additionally, we had favorable mortality, which I will speak to later. 
Now let me touch on the performance of key financial metrics. For the full year, reported operating EPS of $6.50 was a record and up 19%. Our EPS, excluding notable items, was also a record, up 7%. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% to $57.5. Operating return on equity was strong at 12.7% in the quarter and 12% for the full year. Positive consolidated net flows have contributed to account values that continue to grow from depressed levels earlier in the year, providing a nice earnings tailwind. Our balance sheet remains an important source of strength, supported by solid liquidity metrics and strong capital generation. This enabled us to return $261 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year. 
Further highlighting the strength of our balance sheet, our year end cash flow testing continues to point to significant statutory reserve adequacy and we do not anticipate any reserve deficiencies. And we completed our good will review, which did not have any impairment. 
Net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by a few items. The largest item was a $178 million net loss from variable annuity net derivative results, with more than half of this being a noneconomic charge related to non-performance risk, which is the result of our own credit spread narrowing in the quarter. Fund basis risk made up the majority of the remaining amount. I would remind you that over time, this sort of breakage is summed up to essentially 0, so I wouldn't be surprised to see that come back at some point in time. Taking advantage of that narrowing credit spread, we did complete an economically advantageous tender for some higher coupon debt in December, which resulted in a $41 million loss on the early extinguishment. 
Before shifting to segment results, let me discuss the digitization initiative. In addition to the strategic benefits Dennis discussed in his remarks, I would note that we do see an opportunity to take significant expenses out of the business over the next several years. 
Now analogous to an M&A transaction, there will be integration costs or investments made to ultimately get the run rate savings. You can see in our statistical supplement, we have begun reporting a strategic digitization expense in other operations. In the fourth quarter, it was $8 million pretax. And we would expect roughly $10 million a quarter in 2017, but we could see some quarterly variability based on the timing of certain projects. I would note, we are trying to strike the right balance in terms of protecting near-term results while also capitalizing on efficiency opportunities, which will lower our expense base. 
To this point, during the first 2 years of this initiative, we would expect annual net costs of $40 million pretax. By year 3, the earnings impact should be neutral. And then in the fourth year, we will begin to see meaningful cost savings, which I would size at 6% to 10% of our $1.5 billion in addressable G&A expenses. Hopefully, this gives you a good sense of the positive long-term opportunity around digitization and also the visibility and transparency to incorporate assumptions within your models. 
Now I will turn to segment results starting with Life Insurance. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $154 million compared to $119 million last year. Included in the current quarter's earnings were favorable mortality results consistent with our expectations for the fourth quarter of any year. 
I want to spend a minute analyzing 2016 mortality experience as I believe it represents a reasonable proxy for how we think about long-term results and seasonality. For the year, we had good mortality results, with our actual to expected mortality coming in at 99%. Now we did see quite a bit of variability in mortality quarter-to-quarter, much of which I would attribute to seasonality. For example, mortality negatively impacted earnings by $30 million in the first quarter, with roughly 2/3 of that related to typical seasonality. Ultimately, what we expect is to make up this negative seasonality during the second half of the year and this is what occurred this year. 
Shifting to spreads. Base spreads, which exclude variable investment income, were down 6 basis points for the full year, within the 5 to 10 basis point range we have discussed in the past. Given the movement in interest rates, we would expect to be at the low end of that range in 2017. Earnings drivers remained steady for the quarter and year with average account balances and Life Insurance in-force both up 4% to 5%. Overall, this year's earnings were consistent with our expectations, while our strong sales results and key driver growth support earnings growth looking forward. 
Group Protection earnings of $16 million increased from $13 million in the prior-year quarter. Our loss ratios continued to show improvement, though this was somewhat offset by higher variable expenses tied to strong sales growth. Our nonmedical loss ratio improved to 70.9% from 75.3% in the prior-year quarter. This 440 basis point improvement was driven by better loss experience in all of our product lines. Notably, our full year loss ratios showed similar improvements, which resulted in an annual -- an increase in annual earnings of over 50%. 
As we have discussed, top line growth is expected to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. And as Dennis noted, we expect annual premium growth to re-emerge in 2017. As you'll recall, we typically experience seasonally higher DAC amortization in the first quarter. This is tied to the first quarter being our heaviest renewal period. This year, given improvement in our persistency, we expect amortization to be roughly half of what we experienced in the first quarter of 2016. So overall, another solid quarter and strong year for the group business, and we expect that positive momentum to continue. 
In Annuities, reported earnings for the quarter were $242 million, flat versus the prior year quarter. Average account values were down 1% for the year as negative net flows more than offset positive market performance. So I would note that end of period balances did increase 3% on the back of strong equity market performance over the last 3 quarters. As a result, we saw sequential growth in reported earnings during every quarter of the year. 
Return metrics remained strong. Our ROA in the quarter was 78 basis points, while ROE came in at 21% for the quarter and full year. Notably, return on equity has exceeded 20% for the past 4 years and has averaged 20% for a decade, outstanding results that highlight our differentiated and high-quality Annuities book. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $34 million, in line with the prior year. Fourth quarter revenue was up 3% compared to the prior year period, while spreads, excluding variable investment income, comprised 13 basis points for the full year. This is near the midpoint of our 10 to 15 basis point guidance. And looking forward, we expect to be at the low end of that range. 
Return on assets was 23 basis points for the fourth quarter and the full year. Account values have benefited from several quarters of positive net flows, including nearly $400 million of flows in the fourth quarter. Combined with positive changes in equity markets over the past year, end-of-period account values increased 8% to more than $58 billion. 
2016 was a good year for the retirement business, highlighted by record deposits, a 25% increase in net flows and consistent returns. As our outlook for net flows remains positive, we are well positioned for continued momentum in 2017. 
Let me discuss our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. First, at capital. We are extremely well positioned, as our statutory surplus stands at $8.8 billion, up nearly $400 million from the prior year period. We estimate our RBC ratio end-of-the-year at approximately 490%, consistent with the prior year. Our capital and liquidity profile is further bolstered by $561 million of cash at the holding company. In terms of capital deployment, I noted upfront, we returned more than $1.1 billion to shareholders this year, up slightly from the prior year. As you know, our mix of cash, return to shareholders have been weighted more towards buyback than dividends. We expect that trend to continue as we see the current share price is undervalued at an excellent use of capital. 
We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow and a track record of getting that cash back to shareholders. For example, in the past 6 years, we have returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders, with $4 billion of this through buybacks at an average price of under $38, reducing our shares outstanding by nearly 1/3. This year, we returned 72% of our operating earnings to shareholders, which is above our long-term free cash flow target of 50% to 55%. While our long-term target remains unchanged, we expect to be approximately 10 points above that range in 2017 as we leverage the strength of our balance sheet. Notably, the board recently approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing it back up to $1 billion. 
So to conclude, 2016 was an excellent year. We reported record operating EPS. Book value per share grew to over $57, a record, and up 9%. And our ROE was strong at 12%. Let me remind you, this follows a period where over the past 6 years, EPS has grown at an annual rate of 12%, book value per share has increased at a 7% rate and our ROE has expanded nearly 300 basis points. As we look forward, we are excited about our digitization initiative, which will deliver real value to the bottom line. We fully expect to continue generating positive net flows and premium growth across all our businesses. And lastly, our balance sheet is as strong as it has ever been, and our ability to generate capital remains robust, which will enable us to continue our strong track record of returning capital to shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

If you broke that down, I would say about $200 million of that came from the reinsurance transaction we did earlier in the year, which generated a significant amount of capital. And about 100 of it came from the fact that variable annuity sales were below where they had been in the past. As you look forward, and as Dennis talked about, I would continue to expect the VA sales to be below our long-term expectations, so I think that will drive some of the continued increase that I talked about.

Is it -- do you think it's that you've seen a big shift move away from front load commission-type products broadly and that's predominantly how VAs have been sold and the move to level fee commissions? It's kind of a tricky transition because that's not historically a lot of the way those products have been sold. Can you talk a bit about is that really what's driving it? And do you think that despite what happens with DOL that you think a lot of distributors had moved in that direction and they're going to stay there so we're going to see a depressing impact for a while here?"

And let me talk first about our core value proposition that has led to what we all know as the strongest in-force block of business from a quality, risk and earnings perspective in the industry. And that quality was built off of a basic value proposition to the consumer of upside potential and lower initial guarantees. So that value proposition remains in the marketplace. It's been hurt a little bit by lower returns inside the subaccount, some of that related to risk-managed funds. So our response to that and we're able to be responsive inside of that category because interest rates have moved up a little bit, giving us a little more flexibility. So what we're doing in that product category is providing more investment flexibility. So for example, in the past, we may have had a requirement of 70% equity, 30% debt and we're modifying that a little bit. Again, because of the interest rate environment, we're able to, a little bit, up the initial payout rates or the initial income payout rates. So you've got that block of business. And again, it's been affected a little bit by fund performance, but we're responding to that. Then there is a second value proposition, which is even more investment flexibility but with a lower initial income payout, and that's very exciting. Again, taking our initial equity debt relationship with 70-30 -- or excuse me, 60-40 to 70-30 so there is an ability to get more equity into the account, getting more upside potential. And also, the removal of the risk-managed funds in that particular product category. So lower income initially with more investment restrictions because one of them has upside potential and the other one I just described. Then a whole new product category is what we talked about in terms of the BlackRock product, both in terms of the structure of the product as well as the opportunity to go into the retirement income -- excuse me, the registered investment adviser channel. And then finally, the -- there is a lot of activity in the, sort of, the traditional deferred income annuity accumulation product space, the fixed income and fixed indexed annuity as being a part of that and we're strengthening that as well. So I can't say that there's one market adjustment that's affecting the overall market. It's a whole series of things, and we have products and plans in place to address each one of them. I do think, though, coming back specifically to the Department of Labor and the whole issue around commissions and the lack of -- because there's been so much, what would I say? It's been unclear at our distribution partners exactly how this was going to turn out. Even if the existing rule was to turn out, the rule had to be interpreted, technology changes. And so the distribution partners have been slow -- a little bit slow to communicate to their own advisers where we're going to end up. So I think that the DOL issue has probably had a lot more impact. And whether or not it's delayed, I think that confusion will go away on April 17, when everybody has to implement their final plans. So a lot of different effects on the marketplace. I'll finish with 2 things. One, I continue to believe that long term, the individual annuity mark, whether it's for market, whether it's for accumulation or for guaranteed lifetime income is going to be robust and vibrant. And our product development is addressing the issues that we can address. And I'm confident that we'll recover our sales momentum."

And so, that's going to move -- those 2 pieces are going to move a little bit. Instead of just commissions, we're going to have fee-based products and, as I mentioned, more passive opportunities for investments inside. And let me differentiate that for a second. When I talk about commission and active, that's a set of financial advisers that exist and are selling Annuities. And some of the refreshment activities we've had in our products that address that particular adviser cohort, such as reducing the fees within -- on the fee-based part of it, reducing the fees, paying for that with lower payments out to the broker dealers, that'll move, I think, gradually over time as between the amount of people that use commissions and the amount of people that prefer fees. And that's going to be, in part, based on what their customer's preference is. And so, that's going to move forward. The second issue is a little different and that is the RIA market, which is a pretty significant market in the United States, where Annuities haven't been a big piece of what they've provided. There's 1 firm that's been reasonably successful. I think that's the area for additional cohort of financial advisers expanding the distribution opportunity beyond what exists today."

I think the products most impacted would be in the Annuity and the Life business. In the Annuity businesses Dennis has talked about the increase in interest rates has allowed us to make some changes on the products, which we believe will make them more attractive to consumers. So I don't think that the increase in interest rates has had a huge impact on the returns that we expect on those products. I think maybe on fixed annuities, you get a little bit of a boost because if you get a little higher return on your surplus, you get a little better metric here, but I wouldn't say it's a material impact. On the Life side, we have been running strong returns, 12% to 15% for some time now, and I don't expect that to change materially. I think the market will respond to rates with either benefit changes or premium decreases. So I wouldn't expect a material change in the returns we're getting on the Life business, which have been strong for a number of years now."

So you take that and that's a big deal, both for that business and the company in total. So the biggest financial impact and the impact you're going to see immediately is because that spread compression number goes down. As you mentioned, we were at between 2% to 3%. We're now down at about 2%. So you've got a little bit less spread compression and that's a benefit across the company from that standpoint. On new business, and Dennis mentioned this in his comments, it allows products to become -- to get adjusted in a way that makes them more attractive to consumers. You are able to offer more benefits or lower premiums, which makes these products not only more attractive to consumers, but more competitive with other options they may have. So I think that's a big deal from a new-business standpoint, if you can see those new sales levels move up. Factually, new business has never had a huge impact on the earnings we expect in the next year or 2. That's more about the growth of the business.

So that would be one aspect. You also saw a shift in some products to fix annuity sales a little bit, which are a little more capital-intensive than variable annuities. So that was a little bit of a drag on the math. But roughly speaking, what we said came true, in that we were able to overcome the drag on earnings caused by the lower annuity sales through share repurchases in 2016. Now I would note when you look forward, that math changes a little bit because of the increase in share price. We can't buy quite -- back quite the same number of shares per dollar that we use. So there's a little bit of drag just using that math. But in 2016, factually, we were able to overcome the drag from lower sales through share repurchases."

If you broaden this out and you think about alternatives and prepayment income over a longer cycle, even over the last couple of years, what you've seen is that alternatives in both those years were a little below our long-term expectations. So for the full year, we were about $40 million lower than we would expect on the alternative side, whereas prepayment income was a little stronger.

We have said that we have a longer-term strategy of increasing the percentage of our income that comes from mortality and morbidity and that sort of in terms of our businesses, we would probably think of the group business as the top priority. So that's the strategy. Deals coming to the market come episodically. We'll continue to look at things. We've looked at some properties in the last 24 months and back to our allocating capital to the best use, it was way more expensive. The properties sold for way more than what we think would make sense for our use of capital. It would make a lot of good sense for the people who bought it. I don't know what their strategies were. So prices would probably have to come down a little bit before we get real interested in a deal, but we'll keep looking.  We're good at assessing M&A. We're good at integrating M&A. And if something comes along that fits with our long-term strategy, all of which points we've articulated, we would take a look.

Fourth quarter results were strong, with operating earnings per share up 15% compared to last year. This capped a solid year, which included record EPS, a 9% increase in book value per share and a 12% ROE. Notably, we have a multiyear track record of similarly strong financial results. And more importantly, we continue to believe these results are sustainable over time. 
Our financial success and stability are the result of our clear and straightforward business model. As you know, we lead with distribution and product breadth. Nearly 90,000 independent brokers, agents and financial advisers have sold a Lincoln product in the past 2 years, and we consistently focus on expanding our distribution reach. Our 1,300 highly sophisticated wholesalers and reps provide our independent producers with customer solutions and product education. We match this distribution with one of the broadest product portfolios in the industry and are at the forefront of product innovation. This strategy works throughout cycles and was successful, once again, in 2016. This year, individual Life Insurance sales increased 7%; Group Protection sales were up 17%; and RPS deposits reached a record $7.7 billion. 
2016 was a challenging year for sales growth in the annuity business, which reflect somewhat of an adjusting market, but I am confident in our distribution and the product initiatives we are putting into place to respond. We expect these actions will rebuild sales momentum and enable us to return to full year positive net flows in 2018. 
In response to our lower annuity sales, we increased our share repurchases as we said we would, executing on another one of our core strategies, which is to actively direct capital to the highest and best use. When combined with our solid capital generation, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders this year. 
I won't touch on all strategies within our business model, but I do want to note that this year, we are launching another dimension of strategy, and that is to accelerate our utilization of digitization to improve our customer experience and increase efficiency. The born digital companies, such as Uber and Amazon, are raising customer service expectations and we're moving to meet this expectation. 
Additionally, through increased use of robotics and other innovative tools, we intend to lower our cost. This will require some investments, and Randy will get into the financial details. But at a high level, after 2 years, the project will be self-funding and by 4 to 5 years out, we will see significant cost saves as well as potential revenue enhancements. 
Now turning to our business lines, starting with individual life. Our earnings were once again robust, and excluding notable items, we showed sequential improvement in earnings each quarter this year. Our sales were also outstanding, with total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $231 million, a 17% increase from the prior year quarter. Notably, nearly every product line generated double-digit growth. Individual Life Insurance sales increased 12% in the quarter and a solid 7% for the full year. 
Let me spend a minute highlighting some product stories. MoneyGuard sales increased 19% in the quarter, as we are benefiting from continued demand for linked benefit products and our multichannel distribution approach. For the full year, MoneyGuard sales reached a record $214 million. Term sales of $29 million increased 16% as we continued to benefit from several product and process enhancements over the past year. Indexed universal life sales increased 15% as IUL has seen outpaced growth over recent years due to an increase in GUL pricing. I would also note that the industry has settled into last year's IUL illustration regulation which has brought more consistency to the marketplace. 
Overall, our mix of sales continues to achieve our strategic objectives, including diversification, as all individual life products represented between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales; a tilt away from long-term guarantees; 66% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees up slightly; and lastly, strong returns. As expected, new business returns are achieving our target range of 12% to 15%. Our outlook for the Life Insurance business remains strong, and we expect growth to continue, driven by our diversified product portfolio combined with our leading distribution. 
Turning to Group Protection. We continue to see a positive trajectory in our growth and profitability trends. Fourth quarter sales of $263 million were up 18% from the same period last year and full year sales were up nearly the same percentage following 2 straight years of sales declines. We are pleased with this very strong sales rebound and it indicates the resilience of our distribution channel. Our pricing remains disciplined and our outlook for future sales growth is aligned with our long-term target of middle single-digit increases. 
Just as important to drive future premium growth will be persistency improvements, and the fourth quarter continued to indicate positive renewal persistency trends. With sales growth and improving persistency, our top line is also showing momentum as our premiums grew sequentially for the second straight quarter, and we expect to re-establish annual premium growth in 2017. As we have noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we have seen many encouraging signs that support strong top and bottom line trends in our group business. 
Turning to Annuities. We posted strong operating results in the fourth quarter as the power of our high quality in-force business overcame a challenging year of variable annuity sales, though I would note that sales have largely stabilized in recent quarters. We continue to expect long-term growth in the annuity marketplace given demographic trends and the preying of traditional government and corporate safety nets. As I noted upfront, there is some adjusting taking place in the market driven by shift in consumer preferences. Importantly, many of the trends are ones we can address, and we actually see them as an opportunity to expand our distribution reach and the annuity marketplace over time. So let me describe our strategies to regain momentum in the annuity business. 
As you know, there has been a trend towards fee-based compensation. Historically, the annuity market has been mostly commission-based, something we expect will continue. However, we are responding to this movement as we refreshed all of our fee-based products in January. We expect this will enable us to reach new advisers, and we believe fee-based annuities present a significant long-term growth opportunity. 
Another shift has been the increase in passive investments. As a result, we created a new product category. To this point, I hope you saw the announcement of our collaboration with BlackRock, where we designed a simple, transparent and lower-cost fee-based annuity. We expect this product to help capture the shift towards passive investments as it is comprised exclusively of ETFs. Additionally, this product positions us well in the growing RIA advisers space. 
Lastly, we are responding to adviser feedback with product enhancements that provide clients more investment choice and flexibility, which should offer them better upside potential, aligning with our historical value proposition of lower initial income but the potential for greater upside. As you can see, we are leveraging our longtime successful playbook of expanding and developing distribution coupled with product evolution. We expect all these actions to contribute to our sales recovery and build on our impressive track record of growth and profitability in our annuity business. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with recent quarters and net flows were in line with our outlook. Total deposits for the quarter of $2.4 billion were up 15% as we benefited from strength in both the small and mid to large markets. Full year results were a very good story, with record total deposits of $7.7 billion. Total net flows for the quarter were $386 million. This marked our best quarter for net flows since the financial crisis. Full year net flows increased 25% to $565 million. The increase was driven by a combination of growth in deposits and improvement in our withdrawal rate. 
Looking ahead to 2017, our outlook is similar to this time last year in that we would not be surprised to see lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows. However, we expect another year of net flow improvement. 
Our confidence is driven by our strategy, which aligns the fastest-growing markets with customers that value our high-touch service model. Importantly, we have a proven ability to distinguish ourselves in these markets while achieving our targeted returns, which is giving us a lot of positive momentum. 
And briefly on investment results. Alternative investments had another solid quarter as both our private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to a 12% annualized return, consistent with the third quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to increase our alternative earnings over time as we grow the portfolio and further shift mix towards private equity. In terms of new money, we have seen a meaningful increase in yields since the election. Post election, we have been investing new money at 4.1%. This has reduced the spread between new money and the fixed income portfolio yield to 70 basis points and cut the headwind to earnings growth from 3% to 2%. 
Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape, high quality and broadly diversified. Below investment-grade assets represent just 5.2% of our fixed income portfolio consistent with last year as the de-risking actions we took earlier in the year significantly reduced our exposure to negative ratings migration and improved our credit portfolio -- profile. 
Before turning the call over to Randy, I'd like to just touch on some potential impacts from the new administration, recognizing it is too early to reach specific conclusions. First, it is important to note we build our strategy, financial growth plans and shareholder value creation around things within our control. But I would point out that some of the new administration policies and proposals have the possibility of providing us incremental tailwinds. An increase in economic growth and possibly higher interest rates can help with margin compression, but just as important, would provide more flexibility in terms of our ability to offer consumers an even better value proposition for our products. Although not assured, there is an increasing likelihood of a delay to the Department of Labor fiduciary rule and a focus on improving the rule's ultimate objective, something we support. If this were to occur, we believe it could remove some of the confusion in the marketplace that is contributing to the decline in annuity sales. 
Lastly, on tax reform, hard to pinpoint where this will land, but we also see this as an additional benefit. So again, still early, but there is potential for incremental growth levers, and we'll be sure to update you on the impacts of these as we learn more. 
So I'm pleased with our solid fourth quarter results and our record operating earnings per share in 2016. Importantly, we are proving time and time again that our business model enables us to take advantage of emerging opportunities as well as overcome cyclical or structural headwinds. As we enter 2017, we have a lot of positive momentum and I like the fact that we continue to be on the offensive as key drivers of our financial success remain well within our control. 
Notably, we are positioned to drive organic growth through our leading distribution channels and our broad set of customer solutions. We continue to find opportunities to leverage the strength of our in-force business, and we will continue our successful track record of returning capital to shareholders. 
In closing, Lincoln's business model is simple, clear and straightforward and it produces solid and repeatable financial results. We're proud of our long-term performance and pleased that it continues to reward our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

These 2 items were completely offset by some expense items, including an increase in deferred comp-related expenses associated with a $19 increase in our share price during the quarter and higher variable expenses from strong sales growth in most of our businesses. Additionally, we had favorable mortality, which I will speak to later. 
Now let me touch on the performance of key financial metrics. For the full year, reported operating EPS of $6.50 was a record and up 19%. Our EPS, excluding notable items, was also a record, up 7%.

Positive consolidated net flows have contributed to account values that continue to grow from depressed levels earlier in the year, providing a nice earnings tailwind. Our balance sheet remains an important source of strength, supported by solid liquidity metrics and strong capital generation. This enabled us to return $261 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year. 
Further highlighting the strength of our balance sheet, our year end cash flow testing continues to point to significant statutory reserve adequacy and we do not anticipate any reserve deficiencies. And we completed our good will review, which did not have any impairment. 
Net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by a few items. The largest item was a $178 million net loss from variable annuity net derivative results, with more than half of this being a noneconomic charge related to non-performance risk, which is the result of our own credit spread narrowing in the quarter. Fund basis risk made up the majority of the remaining amount. I would remind you that over time, this sort of breakage is summed up to essentially 0, so I wouldn't be surprised to see that come back at some point in time. Taking advantage of that narrowing credit spread, we did complete an economically advantageous tender for some higher coupon debt in December, which resulted in a $41 million loss on the early extinguishment. 
Before shifting to segment results, let me discuss the digitization initiative. In addition to the strategic benefits Dennis discussed in his remarks, I would note that we do see an opportunity to take significant expenses out of the business over the next several years. 
Now analogous to an M&A transaction, there will be integration costs or investments made to ultimately get the run rate savings. You can see in our statistical supplement, we have begun reporting a strategic digitization expense in other operations. In the fourth quarter, it was $8 million pretax. And we would expect roughly $10 million a quarter in 2017, but we could see some quarterly variability based on the timing of certain projects. I would note, we are trying to strike the right balance in terms of protecting near-term results while also capitalizing on efficiency opportunities, which will lower our expense base. 
To this point, during the first 2 years of this initiative, we would expect annual net costs of $40 million pretax. By year 3, the earnings impact should be neutral. And then in the fourth year, we will begin to see meaningful cost savings, which I would size at 6% to 10% of our $1.5 billion in addressable G&A expenses. Hopefully, this gives you a good sense of the positive long-term opportunity around digitization and also the visibility and transparency to incorporate assumptions within your models. 
Now I will turn to segment results starting with Life Insurance. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $154 million compared to $119 million last year. Included in the current quarter's earnings were favorable mortality results consistent with our expectations for the fourth quarter of any year. 
I want to spend a minute analyzing 2016 mortality experience as I believe it represents a reasonable proxy for how we think about long-term results and seasonality. For the year, we had good mortality results, with our actual to expected mortality coming in at 99%. Now we did see quite a bit of variability in mortality quarter-to-quarter, much of which I would attribute to seasonality. For example, mortality negatively impacted earnings by $30 million in the first quarter, with roughly 2/3 of that related to typical seasonality. Ultimately, what we expect is to make up this negative seasonality during the second half of the year and this is what occurred this year. 
Shifting to spreads. Base spreads, which exclude variable investment income, were down 6 basis points for the full year, within the 5 to 10 basis point range we have discussed in the past. Given the movement in interest rates, we would expect to be at the low end of that range in 2017. Earnings drivers remained steady for the quarter and year with average account balances and Life Insurance in-force both up 4% to 5%. Overall, this year's earnings were consistent with our expectations, while our strong sales results and key driver growth support earnings growth looking forward. 
Group Protection earnings of $16 million increased from $13 million in the prior-year quarter. Our loss ratios continued to show improvement, though this was somewhat offset by higher variable expenses tied to strong sales growth. Our nonmedical loss ratio improved to 70.9% from 75.3% in the prior-year quarter. This 440 basis point improvement was driven by better loss experience in all of our product lines. Notably, our full year loss ratios showed similar improvements, which resulted in an annual -- an increase in annual earnings of over 50%. 
As we have discussed, top line growth is expected to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. And as Dennis noted, we expect annual premium growth to re-emerge in 2017. As you'll recall, we typically experience seasonally higher DAC amortization in the first quarter. This is tied to the first quarter being our heaviest renewal period. This year, given improvement in our persistency, we expect amortization to be roughly half of what we experienced in the first quarter of 2016. So overall, another solid quarter and strong year for the group business, and we expect that positive momentum to continue. 
In Annuities, reported earnings for the quarter were $242 million, flat versus the prior year quarter. Average account values were down 1% for the year as negative net flows more than offset positive market performance. So I would note that end of period balances did increase 3% on the back of strong equity market performance over the last 3 quarters. As a result, we saw sequential growth in reported earnings during every quarter of the year. 
Return metrics remained strong. Our ROA in the quarter was 78 basis points, while ROE came in at 21% for the quarter and full year. Notably, return on equity has exceeded 20% for the past 4 years and has averaged 20% for a decade, outstanding results that highlight our differentiated and high-quality Annuities book. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $34 million, in line with the prior year. Fourth quarter revenue was up 3% compared to the prior year period, while spreads, excluding variable investment income, comprised 13 basis points for the full year. This is near the midpoint of our 10 to 15 basis point guidance. And looking forward, we expect to be at the low end of that range. 
Return on assets was 23 basis points for the fourth quarter and the full year. Account values have benefited from several quarters of positive net flows, including nearly $400 million of flows in the fourth quarter. Combined with positive changes in equity markets over the past year, end-of-period account values increased 8% to more than $58 billion. 
2016 was a good year for the retirement business, highlighted by record deposits, a 25% increase in net flows and consistent returns. As our outlook for net flows remains positive, we are well positioned for continued momentum in 2017. 
Let me discuss our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. First, at capital. We are extremely well positioned, as our statutory surplus stands at $8.8 billion, up nearly $400 million from the prior year period. We estimate our RBC ratio end-of-the-year at approximately 490%, consistent with the prior year. Our capital and liquidity profile is further bolstered by $561 million of cash at the holding company. In terms of capital deployment, I noted upfront, we returned more than $1.1 billion to shareholders this year, up slightly from the prior year. As you know, our mix of cash, return to shareholders have been weighted more towards buyback than dividends. We expect that trend to continue as we see the current share price is undervalued at an excellent use of capital. 
We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow and a track record of getting that cash back to shareholders. For example, in the past 6 years, we have returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders, with $4 billion of this through buybacks at an average price of under $38, reducing our shares outstanding by nearly 1/3. This year, we returned 72% of our operating earnings to shareholders, which is above our long-term free cash flow target of 50% to 55%. While our long-term target remains unchanged, we expect to be approximately 10 points above that range in 2017 as we leverage the strength of our balance sheet. Notably, the board recently approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing it back up to $1 billion. 
So to conclude, 2016 was an excellent year. We reported record operating EPS. Book value per share grew to over $57, a record, and up 9%. And our ROE was strong at 12%. Let me remind you, this follows a period where over the past 6 years, EPS has grown at an annual rate of 12%, book value per share has increased at a 7% rate and our ROE has expanded nearly 300 basis points. As we look forward, we are excited about our digitization initiative, which will deliver real value to the bottom line. We fully expect to continue generating positive net flows and premium growth across all our businesses. And lastly, our balance sheet is as strong as it has ever been, and our ability to generate capital remains robust, which will enable us to continue our strong track record of returning capital to shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

If you broke that down, I would say about $200 million of that came from the reinsurance transaction we did earlier in the year, which generated a significant amount of capital. And about 100 of it came from the fact that variable annuity sales were below where they had been in the past. As you look forward, and as Dennis talked about, I would continue to expect the VA sales to be below our long-term expectations, so I think that will drive some of the continued increase that I talked about.

Is it -- do you think it's that you've seen a big shift move away from front load commission-type products broadly and that's predominantly how VAs have been sold and the move to level fee commissions?

And let me talk first about our core value proposition that has led to what we all know as the strongest in-force block of business from a quality, risk and earnings perspective in the industry. And that quality was built off of a basic value proposition to the consumer of upside potential and lower initial guarantees. So that value proposition remains in the marketplace. It's been hurt a little bit by lower returns inside the subaccount, some of that related to risk-managed funds. So our response to that and we're able to be responsive inside of that category because interest rates have moved up a little bit, giving us a little more flexibility. So what we're doing in that product category is providing more investment flexibility. So for example, in the past, we may have had a requirement of 70% equity, 30% debt and we're modifying that a little bit. Again, because of the interest rate environment, we're able to, a little bit, up the initial payout rates or the initial income payout rates. So you've got that block of business. And again, it's been affected a little bit by fund performance, but we're responding to that. Then there is a second value proposition, which is even more investment flexibility but with a lower initial income payout, and that's very exciting. Again, taking our initial equity debt relationship with 70-30 -- or excuse me, 60-40 to 70-30 so there is an ability to get more equity into the account, getting more upside potential. And also, the removal of the risk-managed funds in that particular product category. So lower income initially with more investment restrictions because one of them has upside potential and the other one I just described. Then a whole new product category is what we talked about in terms of the BlackRock product, both in terms of the structure of the product as well as the opportunity to go into the retirement income -- excuse me, the registered investment adviser channel. And then finally, the -- there is a lot of activity in the, sort of, the traditional deferred income annuity accumulation product space, the fixed income and fixed indexed annuity as being a part of that and we're strengthening that as well. So I can't say that there's one market adjustment that's affecting the overall market. It's a whole series of things, and we have products and plans in place to address each one of them. I do think, though, coming back specifically to the Department of Labor and the whole issue around commissions and the lack of -- because there's been so much, what would I say? It's been unclear at our distribution partners exactly how this was going to turn out. Even if the existing rule was to turn out, the rule had to be interpreted, technology changes. And so the distribution partners have been slow -- a little bit slow to communicate to their own advisers where we're going to end up. So I think that the DOL issue has probably had a lot more impact. And whether or not it's delayed, I think that confusion will go away on April 17, when everybody has to implement their final plans. So a lot of different effects on the marketplace. I'll finish with 2 things. One, I continue to believe that long term, the individual annuity mark, whether it's for market, whether it's for accumulation or for guaranteed lifetime income is going to be robust and vibrant. And our product development is addressing the issues that we can address. And I'm confident that we'll recover our sales momentum."

And so, that's going to move -- those 2 pieces are going to move a little bit. Instead of just commissions, we're going to have fee-based products and, as I mentioned, more passive opportunities for investments inside. And let me differentiate that for a second. When I talk about commission and active, that's a set of financial advisers that exist and are selling Annuities. And some of the refreshment activities we've had in our products that address that particular adviser cohort, such as reducing the fees within -- on the fee-based part of it, reducing the fees, paying for that with lower payments out to the broker dealers, that'll move, I think, gradually over time as between the amount of people that use commissions and the amount of people that prefer fees. And that's going to be, in part, based on what their customer's preference is. And so, that's going to move forward. The second issue is a little different and that is the RIA market, which is a pretty significant market in the United States, where Annuities haven't been a big piece of what they've provided. There's 1 firm that's been reasonably successful. I think that's the area for additional cohort of financial advisers expanding the distribution opportunity beyond what exists today."

I think the products most impacted would be in the Annuity and the Life business.

So I don't think that the increase in interest rates has had a huge impact on the returns that we expect on those products. I think maybe on fixed annuities, you get a little bit of a boost because if you get a little higher return on your surplus, you get a little better metric here, but I wouldn't say it's a material impact. On the Life side, we have been running strong returns, 12% to 15% for some time now, and I don't expect that to change materially. I think the market will respond to rates with either benefit changes or premium decreases.

I'd remind you that if you just took one of our businesses, the Life business, the sum total over the last 4 or 5 years of nearly $100 million of impact from spread compression from its in-force. So you take that and that's a big deal, both for that business and the company in total. So the biggest financial impact and the impact you're going to see immediately is because that spread compression number goes down. As you mentioned, we were at between 2% to 3%. We're now down at about 2%. So you've got a little bit less spread compression and that's a benefit across the company from that standpoint. On new business, and Dennis mentioned this in his comments, it allows products to become -- to get adjusted in a way that makes them more attractive to consumers. You are able to offer more benefits or lower premiums, which makes these products not only more attractive to consumers, but more competitive with other options they may have. So I think that's a big deal from a new-business standpoint, if you can see those new sales levels move up. Factually, new business has never had a huge impact on the earnings we expect in the next year or 2. That's more about the growth of the business. So anything, I think, that drives sales higher is a positive for the long-term outlook for the organization."

So that would be one aspect. You also saw a shift in some products to fix annuity sales a little bit, which are a little more capital-intensive than variable annuities. So that was a little bit of a drag on the math. But roughly speaking, what we said came true, in that we were able to overcome the drag on earnings caused by the lower annuity sales through share repurchases in 2016. Now I would note when you look forward, that math changes a little bit because of the increase in share price. We can't buy quite -- back quite the same number of shares per dollar that we use.

In total, it came up to about $13 million after-tax, as I mentioned in my script. I would say that was fairly evenly split, maybe a little skewed towards prepayment income. If you broaden this out and you think about alternatives and prepayment income over a longer cycle, even over the last couple of years, what you've seen is that alternatives in both those years were a little below our long-term expectations. So for the full year, we were about $40 million lower than we would expect on the alternative side, whereas prepayment income was a little stronger.

And so whenever we do M&A, it's because we're trying to accelerate a strategy to do it for the sake of doing it. You're correct. We have said that we have a longer-term strategy of increasing the percentage of our income that comes from mortality and morbidity and that sort of in terms of our businesses, we would probably think of the group business as the top priority. So that's the strategy. Deals coming to the market come episodically. We'll continue to look at things. We've looked at some properties in the last 24 months and back to our allocating capital to the best use, it was way more expensive. The properties sold for way more than what we think would make sense for our use of capital. It would make a lot of good sense for the people who bought it. I don't know what their strategies were. So prices would probably have to come down a little bit before we get real interested in a deal, but we'll keep looking.  We're good at assessing M&A. We're good at integrating M&A. And if something comes along that fits with our long-term strategy, all of which points we've articulated, we would take a look.

As I noted in my closing comments, on our Year-end Conference Call, we entered 2017 with a lot of positive momentum. Looking at first quarter results, this was clearly evident as we reported record operating e",1772,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As I noted in my closing comments, on our Year-end Conference Call, we entered 2017 with a lot of positive momentum. Looking at first quarter results, this was clearly evident as we reported record operating earnings and EPS, aided by positive onetime tax adjustments, book value per share increased double digits and our ROE exceeded 12%, excluding the noted tax items. These were high-quality results as all 4 of our businesses delivered significant year-over-year earnings growth.
Looking forward, I'm confident our franchise and actions can drive both near and long-term growth. In the near term, we are well positioned to drive organic growth through our multi-channel distribution model, where we benefit from industry-leading shelf space and our broad set of customer solutions.
Notably, first quarter sales growth was strong in most of our businesses, including sequential growth in annuity sales for the first time in nearly 2 years. Disciplined expense management remains a core strength. And with revenues up 5% over the prior year quarter, we should continue to have positive operating leverage.
Account values continued to grow, driving earnings tailwinds to our capital market sensitive businesses. The first quarter is also typically our lowest earnings quarter for the mortality and morbidity businesses. As a result, we are set up well for subsequent quarters.
Lastly, our balance sheet remained strong, and statutory capital is at an all-time high. This, coupled with consistent capital generation, will enable capital deployment to remain robust.
Longer-term, I also see significant opportunities. Demographic trends and individuals shouldering more responsibility for their financial security make our financial protection product solutions and retail centric model more relevant and more valuable than ever.
Last quarter, we announced our digital initiative, which is targeted at improving our customer experience. As we noted, we also expect significant cost savings over time as well as potential revenue enhancements.
While interest rates remained low, we have continuously repriced our products to reflect this environment, and we have no further new businesses -- new business pricing changes scheduled. However, at some point, interest rates will increase. Although we are already seeing spread compression abate, higher rates would accelerate this trend. But just as important, we'll provide more flexibility in terms of our ability to offer consumers and even better value proposition for our products.
Finally, we have a strategic focus to decrease the percentage of sales from products with long-term guarantees and to increase the percentage of earnings coming from mortality and morbidity businesses. Both of these strategies are seeing favorable results, which will lead to further diversification in our sources of earnings. So a lot to be excited about, much of which is within our control and a long runway of opportunities.
Now turning to our business segments, starting with annuities. An 8% increase in average account values resulted in double-digit earnings growth for our annuity business, while results were further bolstered by onetime tax adjustments. As we all know, annuity sales for Lincoln and the industry have been dampened for a variety of reasons, including confusion in the marketplace around the DOL fiduciary rule. However, even in the current environment, we are regaining sales momentum based on our historical strategy of levering distribution with product actions.
Importantly, this strategy is entirely in our control, and we began to see early successes in the first quarter. Total annuity sales in the quarter were $2 billion, an 11% increase from the fourth quarter, with growth in both fixed and variable annuities. This quarter's progress was driven by product enhancements that have been well received in the marketplace. As a result, throughout the first quarter, we saw monthly sales increases. Looking forward, momentum should continue as leading sales indicators are strong, and we will benefit from another product introduction scheduled for the second quarter.
Let me briefly touch on some specific product stories from the quarter. We saw DA sales without living benefits increased sequentially and 26% from the prior year quarter. Guaranteed VA sales saw monthly increases as we added products with more investment choice and flexibility, while we further penetrate a nonqualified market, where we have a competitive advantage with i4LIFE.
Lastly, fixed annuity sales increased 37% sequentially, as higher interest rates are helping our consumer-friendly shorter surrender charge index annuities to sell well in the bank and financial adviser channels. It's also worth noting that in addition to higher volumes, new business returns also improved sequentially.
As we noted on last quarter's call, we are also broadening our product portfolio to capture trends towards fee-based compensation and passive investments. Near Term, adoption will likely be slow, though we believe both have significant long-term growth opportunities. So strong quarter for the annuity business. We are very encouraged by our sales momentum, and we remained confident in our ability to navigate the evolving marketplace and further build sales.
In retirement plan services, we are pleased to see double-digit increases over the prior year quarter in earnings, deposits and net flows, as our strategy and franchise continues to drive positive results. 
Deposits in the quarter of $2.3 billion were up 26% from a year ago. First year sales more than doubled to $800 million, as we delivered strong results in both our small and mid- to large markets, aided by continued success from recent product launches, combined with increased wholesaler productivity.
Recurring deposits increased 4% to a record $1.5 billion as a combination of our high-touch model and our new digital functionality, like click to contribute, encourages participants to save more in their retirement plans.
For the quarter, net flows totaled $116 million, up nearly 50% from last year's first quarter. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of positive net flows. During the quarter, we did have one large relationship terminate, though our higher sales levels were sufficient to overcome this termination. Looking forward, we expect this year's net flows to exceed 2016.
Bottom line, we remained confident in growth opportunities for our RPS business and our strategy positions us well to drive future earnings.
Turning to life insurance. Earnings improved significantly from the prior year, as variable investment income recovered and mortality was favorable relative to the prior year and typical seasonality.
Our sales were also excellent. Total individual life insurance sales in the quarter were $158 million, a 20% increase from the prior year quarter. In aggregate, expected new business returns for the quarter were at the top end of our targeted range of 12% to 15%, reflecting a series of pricing changes over the past several quarters.
We continue to benefit from a broad product portfolio and are tilt towards products without long-term guarantees. As examples, our term sales increased 8% compared to the prior year quarter, wire our UL sales declined 6%, driven by pricing actions we took on GUL late last year. Our VUL sales increased 24% as sales in last year's first quarter were negatively impacted by market volatility.
MoneyGuard sales followed a record 2016, with further growth in the first quarter as we are benefiting from our multichannel distribution approach and continued demand for linked benefit products, as highlighted by industry sales growth of nearly 20% in 2016.
Given our leadership position in linked benefit products and reduced market availability of long-term cared funding solutions, we believe we have some additional pricing power. As a result, we recently adjusted prices, which will improve returns.
Lastly, we continue to remain opportunistic with respect to executive benefit sales, which contributed $23 million to total life sales. So our life business got off to a great start this year. Looking forward, our sales pipeline remains strong. And given our product breadth, and the strength of our distribution, we remained optimistic about our ability to further grow the business.
Turning to group protection, in what is typically our lowest earnings quarter, due to higher seasonal DAC amortization, earnings grew over the prior year period, as amortization expenses declined and loss ratios remained favorable.
I have noted in recent quarters that premium growth will be important as we look to drive the next leg of margin improvement. Therefore, I am pleased that premiums grew over the prior year period for the first time since 2014 and we expect annual premium growth this year, driven by improving persistency and sales growth.
In the first quarter, we continued to experience improving persistency trends. Total block persistency rates increased over 5 percentage points from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by improved renewal persistency, which reached the top end of our 70% to 75% targeted range and disability coverages.
While sales decreased 3% from the same period last year, I would note first quarter represents the smallest contribution for full year sales, and we have a strong pipeline heading into the second quarter.
Importantly, our pricing remains disciplined and our outlook for sales growth over the remainder of the year is aligned with our long-term target of mid-single-digit increases.
So, in summary, we are pleased with the positive business fundamentals and look forward to moving past the typical first quarter DAC amortization. We expect to benefit from further premium growth, favorable loss ratios and, therefore, stronger earnings over the remainder of the year.
Shifting to investment results. After an $8 million loss in the prior quarter, alternative investments had an outstanding quarter, as both our private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to our 15% pretax annualized return.
In terms of new money, we invest over $3 billion in the quarter, at an average yield of 4.2%, 50 basis points higher than in the fourth quarter, as we benefited from higher treasury rates and asset mix. Notably, our fixed income portfolio yield was unchanged compared to year-end at 4.79%.
Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape, high-quality and broadly diversified. Below investment-grade assets represent less than 5% of our fixed income portfolio, down 60 basis points sequentially due to maturities and prepayments.
So in closing, I am pleased with the start to our year, which includes record operating earnings and solid sales trends. As I look forward, I remain confident that our key strategic objectives: Manufacture, primary retail products, target the fastest-growing segments of the broader U.S. market, maintain industry-leading risk management, utilize digital to drive a differentiated customer experience and increased efficiencies and actively direct capital to the highest and best uses will drive long-term sustainable growth.
More importantly, our simple, clear and straightforward business model has a track record of financial success and earnings stability, and we see clear near and long-term opportunities to drive further shareholder value.
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.19 from oneti",1290,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $442 million, or $1.92 per share for the first quarter, compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.19 from onetime tax adjustments. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 37% year-over-year as all 4 of our businesses delivered double-digit growth.
Beyond items that caused typical variability quarter-to-quarter, I would note a couple items that impacted the current quarter. First, within other operations, the adoption of stock compensation accounting guidance will now cause some variability in our taxes, but the biggest impact likely occurring the first quarter of each year tied to vest these schedules. In the current quarter, this increased earnings by $9 million.
Next, within our group business, earnings were reduced by $13 million, as DAC amortization was higher than our typical quarterly run rate.
Now, shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased 5% in the quarter, driven by a 9% increase in average account values and strong sales results over the past year from our mortality and morbidity businesses. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 10% to $58.37, an all-time high. Reported operating ROE was 13.6%. When adjusting for notable items, ROE was 12.2%, 20 basis points above our annual ROE in 2016.
Finally, our balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $266 million to shareholders in the quarter. Net income results for the quarter largely neared operating earnings, as both credit performance and hedge program results were excellent.
Now, I'll turn to segment results, starting with annuities. Reported earnings per quarter were $281 million. Excluding the benefit of onetime tax adjustments, earnings totaled $240 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from an 8% increase in average account values, as equity market strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows.
Operating revenues increased 2%, even with 1 less fee day in the current quarter, and the prior year benefiting from more fixed income annuity deposits. Excluding notable items, return metrics remained strong, as ROE came in at 21% and our ROA was 75 basis points, up 1 basis point versus the prior year.
Our strategy of consistency and selling in our terms has produced differentiated results and a high-quality book of business. One way to highlight this is looking at net amount at risk, which sits at less than 8/10 of 1% of account value for both our living and death benefits, truly outstanding risk results on an absolute basis and relative to our peers.
So a solid quarter for the annuity business and with end of period account values 1% above the quarterly average, we entered the second quarter with a tailwind.
In retirement plan services, we reported earnings of $37 million, up from $31 million in the prior year. Excluding $2 million from tax adjustments in the current quarter, the earnings increase is attributable to growth in fee income from higher account values and expense management. Positive net flows of $603 million over the trailing 12 months, combined with favorable equity markets, resulted in a 12% increase and average account values, while end of period account values reached a record $61 billion.
SG&A expenses net of amounts capitalized increased to just 1%, trailing revenue growth of 6%. As a result, the RPS expense ratio decreased approximately 100 basis points.
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 16 basis points versus the prior year quarter, slightly above our expectations for spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points. Looking forward, we expect to be at the low end of that range.
For the quarter, our ROA was 24 basis points, excluding notable items, consistent with recent quarters. So a good start to the year for our retirement business, highlighted by double-digit growth in deposits, net flows and assets, all of which led to excellent earnings and positions the retirement business for continued momentum.
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $130 million increased substantially from $75 million in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to a recovery in variable investment income, combined with favorable mortality relative to the prior year quarter and typical seasonality. While these 2 items always [indiscernible] variability, I would estimate that relative to our assumptions, each added about $5 million to this quarter's earnings.
Earnings drivers remained solid for the quarter, with average account balances in life insurance and forks both up 5%. Revenues were up more than driver growth, primarily due to the recovery in variable investment income.
Shifting to spreads. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 7 basis points year-over-year, within the 5- to 10-basis-point range we have discussed. Similar to RPS, we would expect to be at the low end of that range in 2017. So a great quarter as variable investment income recovered and we experienced from our favorable mortality relative to last year's first quarter. Our outlook for earnings, driver growth and seasonality remained consistent with comments I made last year, all of which support long-term earnings growth for our life business.
Group Protection earned $7 million compared to $5 million in the prior year quarter, with both periods impacted by accelerated DAC amortization. As a reminder, with the first quarter representing our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period, but decreases in subsequent quarters. As I noted upfront, the acceleration of amortization reduced earnings by approximately $13 million when compared to our typical quarterly run rate for amortization.
Our nonmedical loss ratio of 71% continues to be strong, but was up 140 basis points compared to very favorable results in the prior year. Recall last year, I noted our loss ratio at 1 to 2 points of favorable variability, primarily from our disability block. Therefore, similar to last year, loss ratios were solid across all of our businesses. As Dennis noted, we are encouraged by year-over-year increase in premiums, we expect this to advance our margins in 2017 and for future premium growth to further improve our margins.
Let me discuss our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. First, in capital, we are extremely well-positioned as our statutory surplus stands at $8.9 billion. We estimate our RBC ratio ended the quarter at nearly 500%, up nicely from our year-end RBC of 489%. Our capital and liquidity profile is further bolstered by $551 million of cash to holding company.
This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares. And when combined with our shareholder dividend, we deployed 60% of our operating earnings, above our long-term target of 50% to 55%, but consistent with our guidance for 2017.
We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow and a track record of getting that cash back to shareholders. This remains an important priority. To this point, we implemented a 10b5-1 trading program, enabling us to better spread our repurchases over the course of the quarter. Through yesterday, we have repurchased $76 million in the quarter.
So wrapping things up, an excellent quarter for Lincoln. We reported record operating EPS in a quarter that is historically one of our weakest. Earnings quality was high as all 4 of our businesses delivered double-digit growth and net income represented 98% of operating earnings.
Sales were particularly strong in the life and retirement businesses, and we are seeing sales momentum in our annuity business. Operating revenue grew 5%, book value per share increased 10%, our ROE, excluding notable items, was strong at 12.2%; and finally, capital generation and deployment remain important parts of our shareholder value creation.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

I don't see -- we don't see any people reaching for business through pricing actions. And certainly, we're not reaching for business for pricing actions. I mentioned that our sales growth came from, for example, variable universal life, which was up 24% over the first quarter. That has to do with DUL sales being a little depressed in the first quarter of last year because of the volatility in the equity markets and people not wanting to pull the trigger on products that were equity-based. We also mentioned, MoneyGuard, we're just a leader in that business. Equity link products growing at 20%, we are a leader, we're growing a little bit faster than that. So it stems from having good growth in a couple products this quarter over prior quarter, but more importantly, on a long-term basis, having a pretty broad portfolio, so as consumer preferences change, we can offer another solution, and I would use VUL as an example, of that in the first quarter last year. It wasn't a strong preference for the reason I mentioned, but this year, it is. So I come back to distribution, strength, shelf space and broad product solutions as the answer to your question."

So when I think about M&A, broadly speaking, and we've discussed this publicly a number of times, probably our first choice would be the group business, which would help with that target source of earnings from morbidity and mortality. And again, I'm going to it turn over, the second half of that question, to Randy. We are going to be very disciplined about any transaction we do.

Let me focus on the increase in sales of our nonguaranteed VA business, which is up pretty substantially. What we're seeing on that product, again this comes back to having a lot of products available in the market and changing consumer preferences. We added a death benefit to investor advantage, which again is a nonliving benefit product, and people just seem to be wanting to lock in some of their equity gains. The benefit -- that benefit provides for sort of a mortality option for them, so we've seen sales there increased. When I look at our adjustments on the guaranteed business, guaranteed lifetime benefits, we've made some modest increases in the benefits, maybe 25 basis points on the payout of one of our core products. But we have been able to because of rising interest rates, increased the investment flexibility. Our value proposition for our financial adviser is to let them have as much flexibility as we can provide to choose good outcomes for their customers. And so as we provided more financial flexibility, that has helped with sales. When the product for introduction in the second quarter is in the category of guaranteed lifetime income, and we're just offering another solution in the marketplace as a slightly higher guaranteed payout, but there are slightly lower guarantees in it overall. It's a product that has been successfully sold by our competitors. And again, we think, for a segment of the market, it is potentially going to be popular. So, again, I come back to distribution broad product breadth, trying to find additional segments of the market that would add incrementally to our sales, not subtract from sales that we're already making."

One, I think it's a difficult item to model. The -- it reflects the difference in performance really in equity from the assumptions that go in to the granting of equity compensation to employee, so I think it's an inherently difficult item to model. I would say that you should expect some seasonality in the number in the first quarter should be, I would imagine the quarter when you would see the most impact. And that's because there were 2 elements of what drives this number: One, you have stock option exercises, which would have a SKU into the first quarter because that's when you cross an anniversary, and that is often time a trigger for some sort of event; and separately, the first quarter is would be when all of the performance shares that we grant and the restricted stock that we grant vest, and that would be the event that drives part of the results. So I think you should see a seasonality in that -- in it in the first quarter, but you should see some level each and every quarter, I think the $9 million number we experienced this quarter would be at the very high end of what we would expect in a typical quarter."

So inside of the annuity results, we talked about we had $41 million of what I would call normalizing items, which brought the result down to about 2 40, which is right in line with our expectations for the business. If you were to factor in equity market growth, the negative net flows, the fact that international markets underperformed S&P, when you factor all those things, 2 40, is great in line with our expectations. Inside of that result, you would have had some other pluses and minuses. One of the pluses would have been the fact that every year, in the first quarter, we have a normal truing up of our DRD, as we get the actual information from the funds. That has a positive impact on the annuity business of roughly $8 million. Now that positive $8 million was -- that's a recurring item, by the way, that's going to occur on a regular basis. Never know how big it will be, but this year it happened to be a little bit about $8 million. That was offset by the fact that the first quarter of this year had 1 less fee day than last year, and also the fact that we had some noise in our commissions this quarter, really a swing between fourth and first quarter, which negatively impacted the quarter probably by $4 million to $5 million. So when you factor that in, that additional just normal DRD true-up that we experienced in the fourth quarter, if you would add that in also and life had a couple million of this impact also, you would see that the normal life tax rate, if you want to add them back, would be in the 22% range, which I think would in line with our expectations all else being equal for about that number would be as you move forward."

867423,424349700,1190894,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As I noted in my closing comments on our year-end conference call, we entered 2017 with a lot of positive momentum.  Looking at first quarter results, this was clearly evident as we reported record operating",1773,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As I noted in my closing comments on our year-end conference call, we entered 2017 with a lot of positive momentum.  
Looking at first quarter results, this was clearly evident as we reported record operating earnings and EPS, aided by positive onetime tax adjustments; book value per share increased double digits; and our ROE exceeded 12%, excluding the noted tax items. These were high-quality results as all 4 of our businesses delivered significant year-over-year earnings growth. Looking forward, I'm confident our franchise and actions can drive both near- and long-term growth. 
In the near term, we are well positioned to drive organic growth through our multichannel distribution model, where we benefit from industry-leading shelf space and our broad set of customer solutions.
Notably, first quarter sales growth was strong in most of our businesses, including sequential growth in annuity sales for the first time in nearly 2 years. Disciplined expense management remains a core strength. And with revenues up 5% over the prior year quarter, we should continue to have positive operating leverage.
Account values continued to grow, driving earnings tailwinds to our capital market-sensitive businesses. The first quarter is also typically our lowest earnings quarter for the mortality and morbidity businesses. As a result, we are set up well for subsequent quarters. Lastly, our balance sheet remains strong, and statutory capital is at an all-time high. This, coupled with consistent capital generation, will enable capital deployment to remain robust.
Longer term, I also see significant opportunities. Demographic trends and individuals shouldering more responsibility for their financial security make our financial protection product solutions and retail-centric model more relevant and more valuable than ever. Last quarter, we announced our digital initiative, which is targeted at improving our customer experience. As we noted, we also expect significant cost savings over time as well as potential revenue enhancements.
While interest rates remain low, we have continuously repriced our products to reflect this environment, and we have no further new businesses -- new business pricing changes scheduled. However, at some point, interest rates will increase. Although we are already seeing spread compression abate, higher rates would accelerate this trend, but just as important, will provide more flexibility in terms of our ability to offer consumers an even better value proposition for our products.
Finally, we have a strategic focus to decrease the percentage of sales from products with long-term guarantees and to increase the percentage of earnings coming from mortality and morbidity businesses. Both of these strategies are seeing favorable results, which will lead to further diversification in our sources of earnings. So a lot to be excited about, much of which is within our control, and a long runway of opportunities.
Now turning to our business segments, starting with annuities. An 8% increase in average account values resulted in double-digit earnings growth for our annuity business while results were further bolstered by onetime tax adjustments. As we all know, annuity sales for Lincoln and the industry have been dampened for a variety of reasons, including confusion in the marketplace around the DOL fiduciary rule. However, even in the current environment, we are regaining sales momentum based on our historical strategy of levering distribution with product actions. Importantly, this strategy is entirely in our control, and we began to see early successes in the first quarter. 
Total annuity sales in the quarter were $2 billion, an 11% increase from the fourth quarter, with growth in both fixed and variable annuities. This quarter's progress was driven by product enhancements that have been well received in the marketplace. As a result, throughout the first quarter, we saw monthly sales increases. Looking forward, momentum should continue as leading sales indicators are strong and we will benefit from another product introduction scheduled for the second quarter.
Let me briefly touch on some specific product stories from the quarter. We saw VA sales without living benefits increase sequentially and 26% from the prior year quarter. Guaranteed VA sales saw monthly increases as we added products with more investment choice and flexibility while we further penetrated the nonqualified market, where we have a competitive advantage with i4LIFE.
Lastly, fixed annuity sales increased 37% sequentially as higher interest rates are helping our consumer-friendly, shorter surrender charge, indexed annuities sell well in the bank and financial adviser channels. It's also worth noting that in addition to higher volumes, new business returns also improved sequentially.
As we noted on last quarter's call, we are also broadening our product portfolio to capture trends towards fee-based compensation and passive investments. Near term, adoption will likely be slow, though we believe both have significant long-term growth opportunities. So strong quarter for the annuity business. We are very encouraged by our sales momentum, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate the evolving marketplace and further build sales.
In retirement plan services, we are pleased to see double-digit increases over the prior year quarter in earnings, deposits and net flows as our strategy and franchise continues to drive positive results. 
Deposits in the quarter of $2.3 billion were up 26% from a year ago. First year sales more than doubled to $800 million as we delivered strong results in both our small and mid to large markets, aided by continued success from recent product launches, combined with increased wholesaler productivity.
Recurring deposits increased 4% to a record $1.5 billion as the combination of our high-touch model and our new digital functionality, like click to contribute, encourages participants to save more in their retirement plans.
For the quarter, net flows totaled $116 million, up nearly 50% from last year's first quarter. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of positive net flows. During the quarter, we did have one large relationship terminate, though our higher sales levels were sufficient to overcome this termination. Looking forward, we expect this year's net flows to exceed 2016. Bottom line, we remain confident in growth opportunities for our RPS business, and our strategy positions us well to drive future earnings.
Turning to Life Insurance. Earnings improved significantly from the prior year as variable investment income recovered and mortality was favorable relative to the prior year and typical seasonality. Our sales were also excellent. Total individual life insurance sales in the quarter were $158 million, a 20% increase from the prior year quarter. In aggregate, expected new business returns for the quarter were at the top end of our targeted range of 12% to 15%, reflecting a series of pricing changes over the past several quarters.
We continue to benefit from our broad product portfolio and our tilt towards products without long-term guarantees. As examples, our term sales increased 8% compared to the prior year quarter while our UL sales declined 6%, driven by pricing actions we took on GUL late last year. Our VUL sales increased 24% as sales in last year's first quarter were negatively impacted by market volatility.
MoneyGuard sales followed a record 2016 with further growth in the first quarter as we are benefiting from our multichannel distribution approach and continued demand for linked benefit products, as highlighted by industry sales growth of nearly 20% in 2016. Given our leadership position in linked benefit products and reduced market availability of long-term care funding solutions, we believe we have some additional pricing power. As a result, we recently adjusted prices, which will improve returns.
Lastly, we continue to remain opportunistic with respect to Executive Benefit sales, which contributed $23 million to total life sales. So our life business got off to a great start this year. Looking forward, our sales pipeline remains strong. And given our product breadth and the strength of our distribution, we remain optimistic about our ability to further grow the business.
Turning to Group Protection. In what is typically our lowest earnings quarter due to higher seasonal DAC amortization, earnings grew over the prior year period as amortization expenses declined and loss ratios remained favorable. I have noted in recent quarters that premium growth will be important as we look to drive the next leg of margin improvement. Therefore, I am pleased that premiums grew over the prior year period for the first time since 2014, and we expect annual premium growth this year driven by improving persistency and sales growth.
In the first quarter, we continued to experience improving persistency trends. Total block  persistency rates increased over 5 percentage points from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by improved renewal persistency, which reached the top end of our 70% to 75% targeted 
[Audio Gap] 
and disability coverages.
While sales decreased 3% from the same period last year, I would note the first quarter represents the smallest contribution to full year sales, and we have a strong pipeline heading into the second quarter. Importantly, our pricing remains disciplined, and our outlook for sales growth over the remainder of the year is aligned with our long-term target of mid-single-digit increases.
So in summary, we are pleased with the positive business fundamentals and look forward to moving past this typical first quarter DAC amortization. We expect to benefit from further premium growth, favorable loss ratios and, therefore, stronger earnings over the remainder of the year.
Shifting to investment results. After an $8 million loss in the prior quarter, alternative investments had an outstanding quarter as both our private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to our 15% pretax annualized return. In terms of new money, we invested over $3 billion in the quarter at an average yield of 4.2%, 50 basis points higher than in the fourth quarter, as we benefited from higher treasury rates and asset mix. Notably, our fixed income portfolio yield was unchanged compared to year-end at 4.79%. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape, high quality and broadly diversified. Below investment-grade assets represent less than 5% of our fixed income portfolio, down 60 basis points sequentially due to maturities and prepayments.
So in closing, I am pleased with the start to our year, which includes record operating earnings and solid sales trends. As I look forward, I remain confident that our key strategic objectives, manufacture primarily retail products, target the fastest-growing segments of the broader U.S. market, maintain industry-leading risk management, utilize digital to drive a differentiated customer experience and increase efficiencies and actively direct capital to the highest and best uses, will drive long-term sustainable growth. More importantly, our simple, clear and straightforward business model has a track record of financial success and earnings stability, and we see clear near- and long-term opportunities to drive further shareholder value.
I will now turn the call over to Randy."
867423,424349700,1190894,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $442 million or $1.92 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.19 from onetime",1290,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $442 million or $1.92 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.19 from onetime tax adjustments. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 37% year-over-year as all 4 of our businesses delivered double-digit growth.
Beyond items that caused typical variability quarter-to-quarter, I would note a couple items that impacted the current quarter. First, within other operations, the adoption of stock compensation accounting guidance will now cause some variability in our taxes, with the biggest impact likely occurring the first quarter of each year tied to vesting schedules. In the current quarter, this increased earnings by $9 million. Next, within our group business, earnings were reduced by $13 million as DAC amortization was higher than our typical quarterly run rate.
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased 5% in the quarter, driven by a 9% increase in average account values and strong sales results over the past year from our mortality and morbidity businesses. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 10% to $58.37, an all-time high. Reported operating ROE was 13.6%. When adjusting for notable items, ROE was 12.2%, 20 basis points above our annual ROE in 2016. Finally, our balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $266 million to shareholders in the quarter. Net income results for the quarter largely mirrored operating earnings as both credit performance and hedge program results were excellent.
Now we will turn to segment results. Starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $281 million. Excluding the benefit of onetime tax adjustments, earnings totaled $240 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from an 8% increase in average account values as equity market strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. Operating revenues increased 2% even with 1 less fee day in the current quarter and the prior year benefiting from more fixed income annuity deposits. Excluding notable items, return metrics remained strong as ROE came in at 21% and our ROA was 75 basis points, up 1 basis point versus the prior year.
Our strategy of consistency and selling in our terms has produced differentiated results and a high-quality book of business. One way to highlight this is looking at net amount at risk, which sits at less than 0.8% of account value for both our living and death benefits, truly outstanding risk results on an absolute basis and relative to our peers.
So a solid quarter for the annuity business, and with end-of-period account values 1% above the quarterly average, we entered the second quarter with a tailwind.
In retirement plan services, we reported earnings of $37 million, up from $31 million in the prior year. Excluding $2 million from tax adjustments in the current quarter, the earnings increase is attributable to growth in fee income from higher account values and expense management. Positive net flows of $603 million over the trailing 12 months, combined with favorable equity markets, resulted in a 12% increase in average account values while end-of-period account values reached a record $61 billion. G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, increased just 1%, trailing revenue growth of 6%. As a result, the RPS expense ratio decreased approximately 100 basis points. 
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 16 basis points versus the prior year quarter, slightly above our expectations for spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points. Looking forward, we expect to be at the low end of that range. For the quarter, our ROA was 24 basis points, excluding notable items, consistent with recent quarters. So a good start to the year for our retirement business, highlighted by double-digit growth in deposits, net flows and assets, all of which led to excellent earnings and positions the retirement business for continued momentum.
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $130 million increased substantially from $75 million in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to a recovery in variable investment income, combined with favorable mortality relative to the prior year quarter and typical seasonality. While these 2 items always [ comes with ] variability, I would estimate that relative to our assumptions, each added about $5 million to this quarter's earnings. Earnings drivers remained solid for the quarter, with average account balances and Life Insurance in-force both up 5%. Revenues were up more than driver growth, primarily due to the recovery in variable investment income.
Shifting to spreads. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 7 basis points year-over-year, within the 5 to 10 basis point range we have discussed. Similar to RPS, we would expect to be at the low end of that range in 2017. So a great quarter as variable investment income recovered and we experienced more favorable mortality relative to last year's first quarter. Our outlook for earnings, driver growth and seasonality remain consistent with comments I made last year, all of which support long-term earnings growth for our life business.
Group Protection earned $7 million compared to $5 million in the prior year quarter, with both periods impacted by accelerated DAC amortization. As a reminder, with the first quarter representing our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period but decreases in subsequent quarters. As I noted upfront, the acceleration of amortization reduced earnings by approximately $13 million when compared to our typical quarterly run rate for amortization.
Our nonmedical loss ratio of 71% continues to be strong, but was up 140 basis points compared to very favorable results in the prior year. Recall, last year, I noted that our loss ratio had 1 to 2 points of favorable variability, primarily from our disability block. Therefore, similar to last year, loss ratios were solid across all of our businesses. As Dennis noted, we are encouraged by year-over-year increase in premiums, we expect this to advance our margins in 2017 and for future premium growth to further improve our margins.
Let me discuss our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. First, in capital, we are extremely well positioned as our statutory surplus stands at $8.9 billion. We estimate our RBC ratio ended the quarter at nearly 500%, up nicely from our year-end RBC of 489%. Our capital and liquidity profile is further bolstered by $551 million of cash to the holding company. 
This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares. And when combined with our shareholder dividend, we deployed 60% of our operating earnings, above our long-term target of 50% to 55% but consistent with our guidance for 2017. We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow and a track record of getting that cash back to shareholders. This remains an important priority. To this point, we implemented a 10b5-1 trading program, enabling us to better spread our repurchases over the course of a quarter. Through yesterday, we have repurchased $76 million in the quarter.
So wrapping things up, an excellent quarter for Lincoln. We reported record operating EPS in a quarter that is historically one of our weakest. Earnings quality was high as all 4 of our businesses delivered double-digit growth, and net income represented 98% of operating earnings. Sales were particularly strong in the life and retirement businesses, and we are seeing sales momentum in our annuity business. Operating revenue grew 5%. Book value per share increased 10%. Our ROE, excluding notable items, was strong at 12.2%. And finally, capital generation and deployment remain important parts of our shareholder value creation.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

I don't see -- we don't see any people reaching for business through pricing actions. And certainly, we're not reaching for business through pricing actions. I mentioned that our sales growth came from, for example, variable universal life, which was up 24% over the first quarter. That has to do with VUL sales being a little depressed in the first quarter of last year because of the volatility in the equity markets and people not wanting to pull the trigger on products that were equity-based. We also mentioned MoneyGuard. We're just a leader in that business. Equity-linked products are growing at 20%. We're a leader, we're growing a little bit faster than that. So it stems from having good growth in a couple products this quarter over prior quarter, but more importantly, on a long-term basis, having a pretty broad portfolio so as consumer preferences change, we can offer another solution. And I would use VUL as an example of that in the first quarter last year. It wasn't a strong preference for the reason I mentioned, but this year, it is. So I come back to distribution strength, shelf space and broad product solutions as the answer to your question."

So when I think about M&A, broadly speaking, and we've discussed this publicly a number of times, probably our first choice would be the group business, which would help with that target source of earnings from morbidity and mortality. And again -- I'm going to turn over the second half of that question to Randy. We are going to be very disciplined about any transaction we do. We're not reaching for any transactions by paying a high price. As we say -- I've said and I said again this morning, we're very careful about the return on the capital that we deploy.

I also think, in the context of an acquisition, on the leverage front, there's some capacity that we would have. Once again, an acquisition that delivers cash flow to the holding company, opens up some capacity, I think probably in the $300 million to $500 million range. Separate from that, we obviously have been and will continue to generate a significant amount of free cash flow, and we've deployed well over $1 billion last couple of years into share buybacks. It represented nearly $900 million for the last couple years. Obviously, we did $200 million this quarter. So I'd point to those items when you think about potential capacity."

Ryan, the -- we've made a series of product moves that have been well received, some of them this quarter; some of them, over the past couple of quarters. Let me focus on the increase in sales of our non-guaranteed VA business, which is up pretty substantially. What we're seeing on that product -- and again, this comes back to having a lot of products available in the market and changing consumer preferences. We added a death benefit to Investor Advantage, which, again, is a nonliving benefit product, and people just seem to be wanting to lock in some of their equity gains. The benefit -- that benefit provides for sort of a mortality option for them, and so we've seen sales there increase. When I look at our adjustments on the guaranteed business, guaranteed lifetime benefits, we've made some modest increases in the benefits, maybe 25 basis points on the payout of one of our core products. But we have been able to, because of rising interest rates, increase the investment flexibility. Our value proposition for our financial adviser is to let them have as much flexibility as we can provide to choose good outcomes for their customers. And so as we provided more financial flexibility, that has helped with sales. When -- the product for introduction in the second quarter is in the category of guaranteed lifetime income. And we're just offering another solution in the marketplace that has a slightly higher guaranteed payout, but there are slightly lower guarantees in it overall. It's a product that has been successfully sold by our competitors. And again, we think, for a segment of the market, it is potentially going to be popular. So again, I come back to distribution, broad -- product breadth, trying to find additional segments of the market that would add incrementally to our sales, not subtract from sales that we're already making."

With the lack of defined benefit plans, more shouldering of financial responsibility on individual consumers, that has got to be a compelling long-term value proposition, so I think it will remain a good product in the marketplace. The DOL is creating confusion, more than anything else, and so you're seeing some of our distribution partners not coming forward with their specific plans because they are waiting to see what the final rule is really going to be. So I think the whole market, candidly, both qualified and nonqualified business, is being affected by the uncertainty created by this rule and the distribution partners waiting for certainty so they can formalize what their practices and policies are going to be. So I'm hopeful that we'll get to that certainty sooner rather than later, and I think that will help annuity sales overall."

And that's because -- there were 2 elements of what drives this number. One, you have stock option exercises, which would have a skew into the first quarter because that's when you cross an anniversary, and that is oftentimes a trigger for some sort of event. And separately, the first quarter would be when all of the performance shares that we grant and the restricted stock that we grant vest, and that would be the event that drives part of the results.

I think the difference is in the annuities segment itself. So inside of the annuity results, we talked about we had $41 million of what I would call normalizing items, which brought the result down to about $240 million, which is right in line with our expectations for the business. If you were to factor in equity market growth, the negative net flows, the fact that international markets underperformed the S&P, when you factor all those things, $240 million is right in line with our expectations. Inside of that result, you would have had some other pluses and minuses. One of the pluses would have been the fact that every year, in the first quarter, we have a normal truing up of our DRD as we get actual information in from the funds. That had a positive impact on the annuity business of roughly $8 million. Now that positive $8 million was -- that's a recurring item, by the way. That's going to occur on a regular basis. You never know how big it will be, but this year, it happened to be a little bit -- about $8 million. That was offset by the fact that the first quarter of this year had 1 less fee day than last year and also the fact that we had some noise in our commissions this quarter, really a swing between fourth and first quarter, which negatively impacted the quarter probably by $4 million to $5 million. So when you factor that in, that additional just normal DRD true-up that we experienced in the first quarter, if you would add that in also, and life had a couple million of this impact also, you would see that the normalized tax rate, if you want to add them back, would be in the 22% range, which I think would be in line with our expectations, all else being equal, for what that number would be as you move forward."

I'm not sure that the change as it's presented, which is the removal of estate taxes but a tax step-up in basis at the transfer of the asset, won't actually give the industry a bigger opportunity for tax. That would be income tax planning. But right now -- I'll just use a simple example. Right now, if you have a $10 million estate and you're husband and wife, you could pass that on estate tax-free, and there's no step-up on basis that you're taxed on. If that estate tax goes away and you have a $9 million step-up in your $10 million estate, now all of a sudden, where you didn't have an estate tax, you now have a $9 million -- you have the tax on $9 billion -- $9 million step-up. So I don't -- it's not as simple as the estate tax goes away from an industry perspective."

As I noted in my closing comments on our year-end conference call, we entered 2017 with a lot of positive momentum.  Looking at first quarter results, this was clearly evident as we reported record operating",1773,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As I noted in my closing comments on our year-end conference call, we entered 2017 with a lot of positive momentum.  
Looking at first quarter results, this was clearly evident as we reported record operating earnings and EPS, aided by positive onetime tax adjustments; book value per share increased double digits; and our ROE exceeded 12%, excluding the noted tax items. These were high-quality results as all 4 of our businesses delivered significant year-over-year earnings growth. Looking forward, I'm confident our franchise and actions can drive both near- and long-term growth. 
In the near term, we are well positioned to drive organic growth through our multichannel distribution model, where we benefit from industry-leading shelf space and our broad set of customer solutions.
Notably, first quarter sales growth was strong in most of our businesses, including sequential growth in annuity sales for the first time in nearly 2 years. Disciplined expense management remains a core strength. And with revenues up 5% over the prior year quarter, we should continue to have positive operating leverage.
Account values continued to grow, driving earnings tailwinds to our capital market-sensitive businesses. The first quarter is also typically our lowest earnings quarter for the mortality and morbidity businesses. As a result, we are set up well for subsequent quarters. Lastly, our balance sheet remains strong, and statutory capital is at an all-time high. This, coupled with consistent capital generation, will enable capital deployment to remain robust.
Longer term, I also see significant opportunities. Demographic trends and individuals shouldering more responsibility for their financial security make our financial protection product solutions and retail-centric model more relevant and more valuable than ever. Last quarter, we announced our digital initiative, which is targeted at improving our customer experience. As we noted, we also expect significant cost savings over time as well as potential revenue enhancements.
While interest rates remain low, we have continuously repriced our products to reflect this environment, and we have no further new businesses -- new business pricing changes scheduled. However, at some point, interest rates will increase. Although we are already seeing spread compression abate, higher rates would accelerate this trend, but just as important, will provide more flexibility in terms of our ability to offer consumers an even better value proposition for our products.
Finally, we have a strategic focus to decrease the percentage of sales from products with long-term guarantees and to increase the percentage of earnings coming from mortality and morbidity businesses. Both of these strategies are seeing favorable results, which will lead to further diversification in our sources of earnings. So a lot to be excited about, much of which is within our control, and a long runway of opportunities.
Now turning to our business segments, starting with annuities. An 8% increase in average account values resulted in double-digit earnings growth for our annuity business while results were further bolstered by onetime tax adjustments. As we all know, annuity sales for Lincoln and the industry have been dampened for a variety of reasons, including confusion in the marketplace around the DOL fiduciary rule. However, even in the current environment, we are regaining sales momentum based on our historical strategy of levering distribution with product actions. Importantly, this strategy is entirely in our control, and we began to see early successes in the first quarter. 
Total annuity sales in the quarter were $2 billion, an 11% increase from the fourth quarter, with growth in both fixed and variable annuities. This quarter's progress was driven by product enhancements that have been well received in the marketplace. As a result, throughout the first quarter, we saw monthly sales increases. Looking forward, momentum should continue as leading sales indicators are strong and we will benefit from another product introduction scheduled for the second quarter.
Let me briefly touch on some specific product stories from the quarter. We saw VA sales without living benefits increase sequentially and 26% from the prior year quarter. Guaranteed VA sales saw monthly increases as we added products with more investment choice and flexibility while we further penetrated the nonqualified market, where we have a competitive advantage with i4LIFE.
Lastly, fixed annuity sales increased 37% sequentially as higher interest rates are helping our consumer-friendly, shorter surrender charge, indexed annuities sell well in the bank and financial adviser channels. It's also worth noting that in addition to higher volumes, new business returns also improved sequentially.
As we noted on last quarter's call, we are also broadening our product portfolio to capture trends towards fee-based compensation and passive investments. Near term, adoption will likely be slow, though we believe both have significant long-term growth opportunities. So strong quarter for the annuity business. We are very encouraged by our sales momentum, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate the evolving marketplace and further build sales.
In retirement plan services, we are pleased to see double-digit increases over the prior year quarter in earnings, deposits and net flows as our strategy and franchise continues to drive positive results. 
Deposits in the quarter of $2.3 billion were up 26% from a year ago. First year sales more than doubled to $800 million as we delivered strong results in both our small and mid to large markets, aided by continued success from recent product launches, combined with increased wholesaler productivity.
Recurring deposits increased 4% to a record $1.5 billion as the combination of our high-touch model and our new digital functionality, like click to contribute, encourages participants to save more in their retirement plans.
For the quarter, net flows totaled $116 million, up nearly 50% from last year's first quarter. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of positive net flows. During the quarter, we did have one large relationship terminate, though our higher sales levels were sufficient to overcome this termination. Looking forward, we expect this year's net flows to exceed 2016. Bottom line, we remain confident in growth opportunities for our RPS business, and our strategy positions us well to drive future earnings.
Turning to Life Insurance. Earnings improved significantly from the prior year as variable investment income recovered and mortality was favorable relative to the prior year and typical seasonality. Our sales were also excellent. Total individual life insurance sales in the quarter were $158 million, a 20% increase from the prior year quarter. In aggregate, expected new business returns for the quarter were at the top end of our targeted range of 12% to 15%, reflecting a series of pricing changes over the past several quarters.
We continue to benefit from our broad product portfolio and our tilt towards products without long-term guarantees. As examples, our term sales increased 8% compared to the prior year quarter while our UL sales declined 6%, driven by pricing actions we took on GUL late last year. Our VUL sales increased 24% as sales in last year's first quarter were negatively impacted by market volatility.
MoneyGuard sales followed a record 2016 with further growth in the first quarter as we are benefiting from our multichannel distribution approach and continued demand for linked benefit products, as highlighted by industry sales growth of nearly 20% in 2016. Given our leadership position in linked benefit products and reduced market availability of long-term care funding solutions, we believe we have some additional pricing power. As a result, we recently adjusted prices, which will improve returns.
Lastly, we continue to remain opportunistic with respect to Executive Benefit sales, which contributed $23 million to total life sales. So our life business got off to a great start this year. Looking forward, our sales pipeline remains strong. And given our product breadth and the strength of our distribution, we remain optimistic about our ability to further grow the business.
Turning to Group Protection. In what is typically our lowest earnings quarter due to higher seasonal DAC amortization, earnings grew over the prior year period as amortization expenses declined and loss ratios remained favorable. I have noted in recent quarters that premium growth will be important as we look to drive the next leg of margin improvement. Therefore, I am pleased that premiums grew over the prior year period for the first time since 2014, and we expect annual premium growth this year driven by improving persistency and sales growth.
In the first quarter, we continued to experience improving persistency trends. Total block  persistency rates increased over 5 percentage points from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by improved renewal persistency, which reached the top end of our 70% to 75% targeted 
[Audio Gap] 
and disability coverages.
While sales decreased 3% from the same period last year, I would note the first quarter represents the smallest contribution to full year sales, and we have a strong pipeline heading into the second quarter. Importantly, our pricing remains disciplined, and our outlook for sales growth over the remainder of the year is aligned with our long-term target of mid-single-digit increases.
So in summary, we are pleased with the positive business fundamentals and look forward to moving past this typical first quarter DAC amortization. We expect to benefit from further premium growth, favorable loss ratios and, therefore, stronger earnings over the remainder of the year.
Shifting to investment results. After an $8 million loss in the prior quarter, alternative investments had an outstanding quarter as both our private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to our 15% pretax annualized return. In terms of new money, we invested over $3 billion in the quarter at an average yield of 4.2%, 50 basis points higher than in the fourth quarter, as we benefited from higher treasury rates and asset mix. Notably, our fixed income portfolio yield was unchanged compared to year-end at 4.79%. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape, high quality and broadly diversified. Below investment-grade assets represent less than 5% of our fixed income portfolio, down 60 basis points sequentially due to maturities and prepayments.
So in closing, I am pleased with the start to our year, which includes record operating earnings and solid sales trends. As I look forward, I remain confident that our key strategic objectives, manufacture primarily retail products, target the fastest-growing segments of the broader U.S. market, maintain industry-leading risk management, utilize digital to drive a differentiated customer experience and increase efficiencies and actively direct capital to the highest and best uses, will drive long-term sustainable growth. More importantly, our simple, clear and straightforward business model has a track record of financial success and earnings stability, and we see clear near- and long-term opportunities to drive further shareholder value.
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported income from operations of $442 million or $1.92 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.19 from onetime",1291,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $442 million or $1.92 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.19 from onetime tax adjustments. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 37% year-over-year as all 4 of our businesses delivered double-digit growth.
Beyond items that caused typical variability quarter-to-quarter, I would note a couple items that impacted the current quarter. First, within other operations, the adoption of stock compensation accounting guidance will now cause some variability in our taxes, with the biggest impact likely occurring in the first quarter of each year tied to vesting schedules. In the current quarter, this increased earnings by $9 million. Next, within our group business, earnings were reduced by $13 million as DAC amortization was higher than our typical quarterly run rate.
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased 5% in the quarter, driven by a 9% increase in average account values and strong sales results over the past year from our mortality and morbidity businesses. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 10% to $58.37, an all-time high. Reported operating ROE was 13.6%. When adjusting for notable items, ROE was 12.2%, 20 basis points above our annual ROE in 2016. Finally, our balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $266 million to shareholders in the quarter. Net income results for the quarter largely mirrored operating earnings as both credit performance and hedge program results were excellent.
Now we will turn to segment results. Starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $281 million. Excluding the benefit of onetime tax adjustments, earnings totaled $240 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from an 8% increase in average account values as equity market strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. Operating revenues increased 2% even with 1 less fee day in the current quarter and the prior year benefiting from more fixed income annuity deposits. Excluding notable items, return metrics remained strong as ROE came in at 21% and our ROA was 75 basis points, up 1 basis point versus the prior year.
Our strategy of consistency and selling in our terms has produced differentiated results and a high-quality book of business. One way to highlight this is looking at net amount at risk, which sits at less than 0.8% of account value for both our living and death benefits, truly outstanding risk results on an absolute basis and relative to our peers.
So a solid quarter for the annuity business, and with end-of-period account values 1% above the quarterly average, we entered the second quarter with a tailwind.
In retirement plan services, we reported earnings of $37 million, up from $31 million in the prior year. Excluding $2 million from tax adjustments in the current quarter, the earnings increase is attributable to growth in fee income from higher account values and expense management. Positive net flows of $603 million over the trailing 12 months, combined with favorable equity markets, resulted in a 12% increase in average account values while end-of-period account values reached a record $61 billion. G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, increased just 1%, trailing revenue growth of 6%. As a result, the RPS expense ratio decreased approximately 100 basis points. 
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 16 basis points versus the prior year quarter, slightly above our expectations for spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points. Looking forward, we expect to be at the low end of that range. For the quarter, our ROA was 24 basis points, excluding notable items, consistent with recent quarters. So a good start to the year for our retirement business, highlighted by double-digit growth in deposits, net flows and assets, all of which led to excellent earnings and positions the retirement business for continued momentum.
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $130 million increased substantially from $75 million in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to a recovery in variable investment income, combined with favorable mortality relative to the prior year quarter and typical seasonality. While these 2 items always [ comes with ] variability, I would estimate that relative to our assumptions, each added about $5 million to this quarter's earnings. Earnings drivers remained solid for the quarter, with average account balances and Life Insurance in-force both up 5%. Revenues were up more than driver growth, primarily due to the recovery in variable investment income.
Shifting to spreads. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 7 basis points year-over-year, within the 5 to 10 basis point range we have discussed. Similar to RPS, we would expect to be at the low end of that range in 2017. So a great quarter as variable investment income recovered and we experienced more favorable mortality relative to last year's first quarter. Our outlook for earnings, driver growth and seasonality remain consistent with comments I made last year, all of which support long-term earnings growth for our life business.
Group Protection earned $7 million compared to $5 million in the prior year quarter, with both periods impacted by accelerated DAC amortization. As a reminder, with the first quarter representing our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period but decreases in subsequent quarters. As I noted upfront, the acceleration of amortization reduced earnings by approximately $13 million when compared to our typical quarterly run rate for amortization.
Our nonmedical loss ratio of 71% continues to be strong, but was up 140 basis points compared to very favorable results in the prior year. Recall, last year, I noted that our loss ratio had 1 to 2 points of favorable variability, primarily from our disability block. Therefore, similar to last year, loss ratios were solid across all of our businesses. As Dennis noted, we are encouraged by year-over-year increase in premiums, we expect this to advance our margins in 2017 and for future premium growth to further improve our margins.
Let me discuss our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. First, in capital, we are extremely well positioned as our statutory surplus stands at $8.9 billion. We estimate our RBC ratio ended the quarter at nearly 500%, up nicely from our year-end RBC of 489%. Our capital and liquidity profile is further bolstered by $551 million of cash to the holding company. 
This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares. And when combined with our shareholder dividend, we deployed 60% of our operating earnings, above our long-term target of 50% to 55% but consistent with our guidance for 2017. We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow and a track record of getting that cash back to shareholders. This remains an important priority. To this point, we implemented a 10b5-1 trading program, enabling us to better spread our repurchases over the course of a quarter. Through yesterday, we have repurchased $76 million in the quarter.
So wrapping things up, an excellent quarter for Lincoln. We reported record operating EPS in a quarter that is historically one of our weakest. Earnings quality was high as all 4 of our businesses delivered double-digit growth, and net income represented 98% of operating earnings. Sales were particularly strong in the life and retirement businesses, and we are seeing sales momentum in our annuity business. Operating revenue grew 5%. Book value per share increased 10%. Our ROE, excluding notable items, was strong at 12.2%. And finally, capital generation and deployment remain important parts of our shareholder value creation.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

I don't see -- we don't see any people reaching for business through pricing actions. And certainly, we're not reaching for business through pricing actions. I mentioned that our sales growth came from, for example, variable universal life, which was up 24% over the first quarter. That has to do with VUL sales being a little depressed in the first quarter of last year because of the volatility in the equity markets and people not wanting to pull the trigger on products that were equity-based. We also mentioned MoneyGuard. We're just a leader in that business. Equity-linked products are growing at 20%. We're a leader, we're growing a little bit faster than that. So it stems from having good growth in a couple products this quarter over prior quarter, but more importantly, on a long-term basis, having a pretty broad portfolio so as consumer preferences change, we can offer another solution. And I would use VUL as an example of that in the first quarter last year. It wasn't a strong preference for the reason I mentioned, but this year, it is. So I come back to distribution strength, shelf space and broad product solutions as the answer to your question."

So when I think about M&A, broadly speaking, and we've discussed this publicly a number of times, probably our first choice would be the group business, which would help with that target source of earnings from morbidity and mortality. And again -- I'm going to turn over the second half of that question to Randy. We are going to be very disciplined about any transaction we do. We're not reaching for any transactions by paying a high price. As we say -- I've said and I said again this morning, we're very careful about the return on the capital that we deploy. So if we do go after a transaction, we will be disciplined about it, as we have been in the past. Randy, you want to add?"

Erik, in terms of capacity, as I've mentioned in the past, on the context of an acquisition, I believe, inside of our nearly $9 billion of statutory capital, we have roughly $500 million to $750 million of capacity inside there, once you get in the context of an acquisition. I also think, in the context of an acquisition, on the leverage front, there's some capacity that we would have. Once again, an acquisition that delivers cash flow to the holding company, opens up some capacity, I think probably in the $300 million to $500 million range. Separate from that, we obviously have been and will continue to generate a significant amount of free cash flow, and we've deployed well over $1 billion last couple of years into share buybacks. It represented nearly $900 million for the last couple years. Obviously, we did $200 million this quarter. So I'd point to those items when you think about potential capacity."

Ryan, the -- we've made a series of product moves that have been well received, some of them this quarter; some of them, over the past couple of quarters. Let me focus on the increase in sales of our non-guaranteed VA business, which is up pretty substantially. What we're seeing on that product -- and again, this comes back to having a lot of products available in the market and changing consumer preferences. We added a death benefit to Investor Advantage, which, again, is a nonliving benefit product, and people just seem to be wanting to lock in some of their equity gains. The benefit -- that benefit provides for sort of a mortality option for them, and so we've seen sales there increase. When I look at our adjustments on the guaranteed business, guaranteed lifetime benefits, we've made some modest increases in the benefits, maybe 25 basis points on the payout of one of our core products. But we have been able to, because of rising interest rates, increase the investment flexibility. Our value proposition for our financial adviser is to let them have as much flexibility as we can provide to choose good outcomes for their customers. And so as we provided more financial flexibility, that has helped with sales. When -- the product for introduction in the second quarter is in the category of guaranteed lifetime income. And we're just offering another solution in the marketplace that has a slightly higher guaranteed payout, but there are slightly lower guarantees in it overall. It's a product that has been successfully sold by our competitors. And again, we think, for a segment of the market, it is potentially going to be popular. So again, I come back to distribution, broad -- product breadth, trying to find additional segments of the market that would add incrementally to our sales, not subtract from sales that we're already making."

One, how can guaranteed lifetime income not be in the best interest of consumers? With the lack of defined benefit plans, more shouldering of financial responsibility on individual consumers, that has got to be a compelling long-term value proposition, so I think it will remain a good product in the marketplace. The DOL is creating confusion, more than anything else, and so you're seeing some of our distribution partners not coming forward with their specific plans because they are waiting to see what the final rule is really going to be. So I think the whole market, candidly, both qualified and nonqualified business, is being affected by the uncertainty created by this rule and the distribution partners waiting for certainty so they can formalize what their practices and policies are going to be. So I'm hopeful that we'll get to that certainty sooner rather than later, and I think that will help annuity sales overall."

And that's because -- there were 2 elements of what drives this number. One, you have stock option exercises, which would have a skew into the first quarter because that's when you cross an anniversary, and that is oftentimes a trigger for some sort of event. And separately, the first quarters would be when all of the performance shares that we grant and the restricted stock that we grant vest, and that would be the event that drives part of the results.

So inside of the annuity results, we talked about we had $41 million of what I would call normalizing items, which brought the result down to about $240 million, which is right in line with our expectations for the business. If you were to factor in equity market growth, the negative net flows, the fact that international markets underperformed the S&P, when you factor all those things, $240 million is right in line with our expectations. Inside of that result, you would have had some other pluses and minuses. One of the pluses would have been the fact that every year, in the first quarter, we have a normal truing up of our DRD as we get actual information in from the funds. That had a positive impact on the annuity business of roughly $8 million. Now that positive $8 million was -- that's a recurring item, by the way. That's going to occur on a regular basis. You never know how big it will be, but this year, it happened to be a little bit -- about $8 million. That was offset by the fact that the first quarter of this year had 1 less fee day than last year and also the fact that we had some noise in our commissions this quarter, really a swing between fourth and first quarter, which negatively impacted the quarter probably by $4 million to $5 million. So when you factor that in, that additional just normal DRD true-up that we experienced in the first quarter, if you would add that in also, and life had a couple million of this impact also, you would see that the normalized tax rate, if you want to add them back, would be in the 22% range, which I think would be in line with our expectations, all else being equal, for what that number would be as you move forward."

And if so, how much of those funds account for the net outflows in the quarter?"

That would be income tax planning. But right now -- I'll just use a simple example. Right now, if you have a $10 million estate and you're husband and wife, you could pass that on estate tax-free, and there's no step-up on basis that you're taxed on. If that estate tax goes away and you have a $9 million step-up in your $10 million estate, now all of a sudden, where you didn't have an estate tax, you now have a $9 million -- you have the tax on $9 billion -- $9 million of step-up.

As I noted in my closing comments on our year-end conference call, we entered 2017 with a lot of positive momentum.  Looking at first quarter results, this was clearly evident as we reported record operating",1773,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As I noted in my closing comments on our year-end conference call, we entered 2017 with a lot of positive momentum.  
Looking at first quarter results, this was clearly evident as we reported record operating earnings and EPS, aided by positive onetime tax adjustments; book value per share increased double digits; and our ROE exceeded 12%, excluding the noted tax items. These were high-quality results as all 4 of our businesses delivered significant year-over-year earnings growth. Looking forward, I'm confident our franchise and actions can drive both near- and long-term growth. 
In the near term, we are well positioned to drive organic growth through our multichannel distribution model, where we benefit from industry-leading shelf space and our broad set of customer solutions.
Notably, first quarter sales growth was strong in most of our businesses, including sequential growth in annuity sales for the first time in nearly 2 years. Disciplined expense management remains a core strength. And with revenues up 5% over the prior year quarter, we should continue to have positive operating leverage.
Account values continued to grow, driving earnings tailwinds to our capital market-sensitive businesses. The first quarter is also typically our lowest earnings quarter for the mortality and morbidity businesses. As a result, we are set up well for subsequent quarters. Lastly, our balance sheet remains strong, and statutory capital is at an all-time high. This, coupled with consistent capital generation, will enable capital deployment to remain robust.
Longer term, I also see significant opportunities. Demographic trends and individuals shouldering more responsibility for their financial security make our financial protection product solutions and retail-centric model more relevant and more valuable than ever. Last quarter, we announced our digital initiative, which is targeted at improving our customer experience. As we noted, we also expect significant cost savings over time as well as potential revenue enhancements.
While interest rates remain low, we have continuously repriced our products to reflect this environment, and we have no further new businesses -- new business pricing changes scheduled. However, at some point, interest rates will increase. Although we are already seeing spread compression abate, higher rates would accelerate this trend, but just as important, will provide more flexibility in terms of our ability to offer consumers an even better value proposition for our products.
Finally, we have a strategic focus to decrease the percentage of sales from products with long-term guarantees and to increase the percentage of earnings coming from mortality and morbidity businesses. Both of these strategies are seeing favorable results, which will lead to further diversification in our sources of earnings. So a lot to be excited about, much of which is within our control, and a long runway of opportunities.
Now turning to our business segments, starting with annuities. An 8% increase in average account values resulted in double-digit earnings growth for our annuity business while results were further bolstered by onetime tax adjustments. As we all know, annuity sales for Lincoln and the industry have been dampened for a variety of reasons, including confusion in the marketplace around the DOL fiduciary rule. However, even in the current environment, we are regaining sales momentum based on our historical strategy of levering distribution with product actions. Importantly, this strategy is entirely in our control, and we began to see early successes in the first quarter. 
Total annuity sales in the quarter were $2 billion, an 11% increase from the fourth quarter, with growth in both fixed and variable annuities. This quarter's progress was driven by product enhancements that have been well received in the marketplace. As a result, throughout the first quarter, we saw monthly sales increases. Looking forward, momentum should continue as leading sales indicators are strong and we will benefit from another product introduction scheduled for the second quarter.
Let me briefly touch on some specific product stories from the quarter. We saw VA sales without living benefits increase sequentially and 26% from the prior year quarter. Guaranteed VA sales saw monthly increases as we added products with more investment choice and flexibility while we further penetrated the nonqualified market, where we have a competitive advantage with i4LIFE.
Lastly, fixed annuity sales increased 37% sequentially as higher interest rates are helping our consumer-friendly, shorter surrender charge, indexed annuities sell well in the bank and financial adviser channels. It's also worth noting that in addition to higher volumes, new business returns also improved sequentially.
As we noted on last quarter's call, we are also broadening our product portfolio to capture trends towards fee-based compensation and passive investments. Near term, adoption will likely be slow, though we believe both have significant long-term growth opportunities. So strong quarter for the annuity business. We are very encouraged by our sales momentum, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate the evolving marketplace and further build sales.
In retirement plan services, we are pleased to see double-digit increases over the prior year quarter in earnings, deposits and net flows as our strategy and franchise continues to drive positive results. 
Deposits in the quarter of $2.3 billion were up 26% from a year ago. First year sales more than doubled to $800 million as we delivered strong results in both our small and mid to large markets, aided by continued success from recent product launches, combined with increased wholesaler productivity.
Recurring deposits increased 4% to a record $1.5 billion as the combination of our high-touch model and our new digital functionality, like click to contribute, encourages participants to save more in their retirement plans.
For the quarter, net flows totaled $116 million, up nearly 50% from last year's first quarter. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of positive net flows. During the quarter, we did have one large relationship terminate, though our higher sales levels were sufficient to overcome this termination. Looking forward, we expect this year's net flows to exceed 2016. Bottom line, we remain confident in growth opportunities for our RPS business, and our strategy positions us well to drive future earnings.
Turning to Life Insurance. Earnings improved significantly from the prior year as variable investment income recovered and mortality was favorable relative to the prior year and typical seasonality. Our sales were also excellent. Total individual life insurance sales in the quarter were $158 million, a 20% increase from the prior year quarter. In aggregate, expected new business returns for the quarter were at the top end of our targeted range of 12% to 15%, reflecting a series of pricing changes over the past several quarters.
We continue to benefit from our broad product portfolio and our tilt towards products without long-term guarantees. As examples, our term sales increased 8% compared to the prior year quarter while our UL sales declined 6%, driven by pricing actions we took on GUL late last year. Our VUL sales increased 24% as sales in last year's first quarter were negatively impacted by market volatility.
MoneyGuard sales followed a record 2016 with further growth in the first quarter as we are benefiting from our multichannel distribution approach and continued demand for linked benefit products, as highlighted by industry sales growth of nearly 20% in 2016. Given our leadership position in linked benefit products and reduced market availability of long-term care funding solutions, we believe we have some additional pricing power. As a result, we recently adjusted prices, which will improve returns.
Lastly, we continue to remain opportunistic with respect to Executive Benefit sales, which contributed $23 million to total life sales. So our life business got off to a great start this year. Looking forward, our sales pipeline remains strong. And given our product breadth and the strength of our distribution, we remain optimistic about our ability to further grow the business.
Turning to Group Protection. In what is typically our lowest earnings quarter due to higher seasonal DAC amortization, earnings grew over the prior year period as amortization expenses declined and loss ratios remained favorable. I have noted in recent quarters that premium growth will be important as we look to drive the next leg of margin improvement. Therefore, I am pleased that premiums grew over the prior year period for the first time since 2014, and we expect annual premium growth this year driven by improving persistency and sales growth.
In the first quarter, we continued to experience improving persistency trends. Total block  persistency rates increased over 5 percentage points from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by improved renewal persistency, which reached the top end of our 70% to 75% targeted 
[Audio Gap] 
and disability coverages.
While sales decreased 3% from the same period last year, I would note the first quarter represents the smallest contribution to full year sales, and we have a strong pipeline heading into the second quarter. Importantly, our pricing remains disciplined, and our outlook for sales growth over the remainder of the year is aligned with our long-term target of mid-single-digit increases.
So in summary, we are pleased with the positive business fundamentals and look forward to moving past this typical first quarter DAC amortization. We expect to benefit from further premium growth, favorable loss ratios and, therefore, stronger earnings over the remainder of the year.
Shifting to investment results. After an $8 million loss in the prior quarter, alternative investments had an outstanding quarter as both our private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to our 15% pretax annualized return. In terms of new money, we invested over $3 billion in the quarter at an average yield of 4.2%, 50 basis points higher than in the fourth quarter, as we benefited from higher treasury rates and asset mix. Notably, our fixed income portfolio yield was unchanged compared to year-end at 4.79%. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape, high quality and broadly diversified. Below investment-grade assets represent less than 5% of our fixed income portfolio, down 60 basis points sequentially due to maturities and prepayments.
So in closing, I am pleased with the start to our year, which includes record operating earnings and solid sales trends. As I look forward, I remain confident that our key strategic objectives, manufacture primarily retail products, target the fastest-growing segments of the broader U.S. market, maintain industry-leading risk management, utilize digital to drive a differentiated customer experience and increase efficiencies and actively direct capital to the highest and best uses, will drive long-term sustainable growth. More importantly, our simple, clear and straightforward business model has a track record of financial success and earnings stability, and we see clear near- and long-term opportunities to drive further shareholder value.
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported income from operations of $442 million or $1.92 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.19 from onetime",1291,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $442 million or $1.92 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.19 from onetime tax adjustments. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 37% year-over-year as all 4 of our businesses delivered double-digit growth.
Beyond items that caused typical variability quarter-to-quarter, I would note a couple items that impacted the current quarter. First, within other operations, the adoption of stock compensation accounting guidance will now cause some variability in our taxes, with the biggest impact likely occurring in the first quarter of each year tied to vesting schedules. In the current quarter, this increased earnings by $9 million. Next, within our group business, earnings were reduced by $13 million as DAC amortization was higher than our typical quarterly run rate.
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased 5% in the quarter, driven by a 9% increase in average account values and strong sales results over the past year from our mortality and morbidity businesses. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 10% to $58.37, an all-time high. Reported operating ROE was 13.6%. When adjusting for notable items, ROE was 12.2%, 20 basis points above our annual ROE in 2016. Finally, our balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $266 million to shareholders in the quarter. Net income results for the quarter largely mirrored operating earnings as both credit performance and hedge program results were excellent.
Now we will turn to segment results. Starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $281 million. Excluding the benefit of onetime tax adjustments, earnings totaled $240 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from an 8% increase in average account values as equity market strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. Operating revenues increased 2% even with 1 less fee day in the current quarter and the prior year benefiting from more fixed income annuity deposits. Excluding notable items, return metrics remained strong as ROE came in at 21% and our ROA was 75 basis points, up 1 basis point versus the prior year.
Our strategy of consistency and selling in our terms has produced differentiated results and a high-quality book of business. One way to highlight this is looking at net amount at risk, which sits at less than 0.8% of account value for both our living and death benefits, truly outstanding risk results on an absolute basis and relative to our peers.
So a solid quarter for the annuity business, and with end-of-period account values 1% above the quarterly average, we entered the second quarter with a tailwind.
In retirement plan services, we reported earnings of $37 million, up from $31 million in the prior year. Excluding $2 million from tax adjustments in the current quarter, the earnings increase is attributable to growth in fee income from higher account values and expense management. Positive net flows of $603 million over the trailing 12 months, combined with favorable equity markets, resulted in a 12% increase in average account values while end-of-period account values reached a record $61 billion. G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, increased just 1%, trailing revenue growth of 6%. As a result, the RPS expense ratio decreased approximately 100 basis points. 
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 16 basis points versus the prior year quarter, slightly above our expectations for spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points. Looking forward, we expect to be at the low end of that range. For the quarter, our ROA was 24 basis points, excluding notable items, consistent with recent quarters. So a good start to the year for our retirement business, highlighted by double-digit growth in deposits, net flows and assets, all of which led to excellent earnings and positions the retirement business for continued momentum.
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $130 million increased substantially from $75 million in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to a recovery in variable investment income, combined with favorable mortality relative to the prior year quarter and typical seasonality. While these 2 items always [ comes with ] variability, I would estimate that relative to our assumptions, each added about $5 million to this quarter's earnings. Earnings drivers remained solid for the quarter, with average account balances and Life Insurance in-force both up 5%. Revenues were up more than driver growth, primarily due to the recovery in variable investment income.
Shifting to spreads. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 7 basis points year-over-year, within the 5 to 10 basis point range we have discussed. Similar to RPS, we would expect to be at the low end of that range in 2017. So a great quarter as variable investment income recovered and we experienced more favorable mortality relative to last year's first quarter. Our outlook for earnings, driver growth and seasonality remain consistent with comments I made last year, all of which support long-term earnings growth for our life business.
Group Protection earned $7 million compared to $5 million in the prior year quarter, with both periods impacted by accelerated DAC amortization. As a reminder, with the first quarter representing our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period but decreases in subsequent quarters. As I noted upfront, the acceleration of amortization reduced earnings by approximately $13 million when compared to our typical quarterly run rate for amortization.
Our nonmedical loss ratio of 71% continues to be strong, but was up 140 basis points compared to very favorable results in the prior year. Recall, last year, I noted that our loss ratio had 1 to 2 points of favorable variability, primarily from our disability block. Therefore, similar to last year, loss ratios were solid across all of our businesses. As Dennis noted, we are encouraged by year-over-year increase in premiums, we expect this to advance our margins in 2017 and for future premium growth to further improve our margins.
Let me discuss our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. First, in capital, we are extremely well positioned as our statutory surplus stands at $8.9 billion. We estimate our RBC ratio ended the quarter at nearly 500%, up nicely from our year-end RBC of 489%. Our capital and liquidity profile is further bolstered by $551 million of cash to the holding company. 
This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares. And when combined with our shareholder dividend, we deployed 60% of our operating earnings, above our long-term target of 50% to 55% but consistent with our guidance for 2017. We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow and a track record of getting that cash back to shareholders. This remains an important priority. To this point, we implemented a 10b5-1 trading program, enabling us to better spread our repurchases over the course of a quarter. Through yesterday, we have repurchased $76 million in the quarter.
So wrapping things up, an excellent quarter for Lincoln. We reported record operating EPS in a quarter that is historically one of our weakest. Earnings quality was high as all 4 of our businesses delivered double-digit growth, and net income represented 98% of operating earnings. Sales were particularly strong in the life and retirement businesses, and we are seeing sales momentum in our annuity business. Operating revenue grew 5%. Book value per share increased 10%. Our ROE, excluding notable items, was strong at 12.2%. And finally, capital generation and deployment remain important parts of our shareholder value creation.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

I don't see -- we don't see any people reaching for business through pricing actions. And certainly, we're not reaching for business through pricing actions. I mentioned that our sales growth came from, for example, variable universal life, which was up 24% over the first quarter. That has to do with VUL sales being a little depressed in the first quarter of last year because of the volatility in the equity markets and people not wanting to pull the trigger on products that were equity-based. We also mentioned MoneyGuard. We're just a leader in that business. Equity-linked products are growing at 20%. We're a leader, we're growing a little bit faster than that. So it stems from having good growth in a couple products this quarter over prior quarter, but more importantly, on a long-term basis, having a pretty broad portfolio so as consumer preferences change, we can offer another solution. And I would use VUL as an example of that in the first quarter last year. It wasn't a strong preference for the reason I mentioned, but this year, it is. So I come back to distribution strength, shelf space and broad product solutions as the answer to your question."

So when I think about M&A, broadly speaking, and we've discussed this publicly a number of times, probably our first choice would be the group business, which would help with that target source of earnings from morbidity and mortality. And again -- I'm going to turn over the second half of that question to Randy. We are going to be very disciplined about any transaction we do. We're not reaching for any transactions by paying a high price. As we say -- I've said and I said again this morning, we're very careful about the return on the capital that we deploy.

I also think, in the context of an acquisition, on the leverage front, there's some capacity that we would have. Once again, an acquisition that delivers cash flow to the holding company, opens up some capacity, I think probably in the $300 million to $500 million range. Separate from that, we obviously have been and will continue to generate a significant amount of free cash flow, and we've deployed well over $1 billion last couple of years into share buybacks. It represented nearly $900 million for the last couple years. Obviously, we did $200 million this quarter. So I'd point to those items when you think about potential capacity."

Ryan, the -- we've made a series of product moves that have been well received, some of them this quarter; some of them, over the past couple of quarters. Let me focus on the increase in sales of our non-guaranteed VA business, which is up pretty substantially. What we're seeing on that product -- and again, this comes back to having a lot of products available in the market and changing consumer preferences. We added a death benefit to Investor Advantage, which, again, is a nonliving benefit product, and people just seem to be wanting to lock in some of their equity gains. The benefit -- that benefit provides for sort of a mortality option for them, and so we've seen sales there increase. When I look at our adjustments on the guaranteed business, guaranteed lifetime benefits, we've made some modest increases in the benefits, maybe 25 basis points on the payout of one of our core products. But we have been able to, because of rising interest rates, increase the investment flexibility. Our value proposition for our financial adviser is to let them have as much flexibility as we can provide to choose good outcomes for their customers. And so as we provided more financial flexibility, that has helped with sales. When -- the product for introduction in the second quarter is in the category of guaranteed lifetime income. And we're just offering another solution in the marketplace that has a slightly higher guaranteed payout, but there are slightly lower guarantees in it overall. It's a product that has been successfully sold by our competitors. And again, we think, for a segment of the market, it is potentially going to be popular. So again, I come back to distribution, broad -- product breadth, trying to find additional segments of the market that would add incrementally to our sales, not subtract from sales that we're already making."

One, how can guaranteed lifetime income not be in the best interest of consumers? With the lack of defined benefit plans, more shouldering of financial responsibility on individual consumers, that has got to be a compelling long-term value proposition, so I think it will remain a good product in the marketplace. The DOL is creating confusion, more than anything else, and so you're seeing some of our distribution partners not coming forward with their specific plans because they are waiting to see what the final rule is really going to be. So I think the whole market, candidly, both qualified and nonqualified business, is being affected by the uncertainty created by this rule and the distribution partners waiting for certainty so they can formalize what their practices and policies are going to be. So I'm hopeful that we'll get to that certainty sooner rather than later, and I think that will help annuity sales overall."

In terms of the industry, look, I think that the entire industry is pretty good at understanding mortality. And I think, over time, mortality is going to do what it's always done, which is improve gradually over time. I fully expect that my children will have a longer expectation of life than I have, for instance, and I expect that their children will have a longer expectation of life than they do.

So inside of the annuity results, we talked about we had $41 million of what I would call normalizing items, which brought the result down to about $240 million, which is right in line with our expectations for the business. If you were to factor in equity market growth, the negative net flows, the fact that international markets underperformed the S&P, when you factor all those things, $240 million is right in line with our expectations. Inside of that result, you would have had some other pluses and minuses. One of the pluses would have been the fact that every year, in the first quarter, we have a normal truing up of our DRD as we get actual information in from the funds. That had a positive impact on the annuity business of roughly $8 million. Now that positive $8 million was -- that's a recurring item, by the way. That's going to occur on a regular basis. You never know how big it will be, but this year, it happened to be a little bit -- about $8 million. That was offset by the fact that the first quarter of this year had 1 less fee day than last year and also the fact that we had some noise in our commissions this quarter, really a swing between fourth and first quarter, which negatively impacted the quarter probably by $4 million to $5 million. So when you factor that in, that additional just normal DRD true-up that we experienced in the first quarter, if you would add that in also, and life had a couple million of this impact also, you would see that the normalized tax rate, if you want to add them back, would be in the 22% range, which I think would be in line with our expectations, all else being equal, for what that number would be as you move forward."

That would be income tax planning. But right now -- I'll just use a simple example. Right now, if you have a $10 million estate and you're husband and wife, you could pass that on estate tax-free, and there's no step-up on basis that you're taxed on. If that estate tax goes away and you have a $9 million step-up in your $10 million estate, now all of a sudden, where you didn't have an estate tax, you now have a $9 million -- you have the tax on $9 billion -- $9 million of step-up.

Good morning, everyone. The positive momentum at the start of the year carried into the second quarter, delivering outstanding results, notably operating earnings per share growth of 19%. Several factors contributed to our results. Fir",1507,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. The positive momentum at the start of the year carried into the second quarter, delivering outstanding results, notably operating earnings per share growth of 19%. 
Several factors contributed to our results. First, sales remained strong as most of our businesses reported double-digit gross compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on restoring variable annuity sales and saw sequential growth accelerate during the quarter. 
Across the enterprise, new business returns are attractive. We are clearly benefiting from our multichannel distribution model, industry-leading shelf space and a broad set of customer solutions, which when combined, differentiates us from competitors and support further growth.
Next, the quarter's strength was broad-based, as all 4 businesses delivered revenue and earnings growth. Additionally, the percentage of earnings coming from mortality and morbidity businesses continue to trend higher, which lead to further diversification in our sources of earnings. 
Lastly, as we have demonstrated for years, the balance sheet is high quality and the businesses generate significant free cash flow, allowing active capital management. This continued in the second quarter with $265 million returned to our shareholders. Capital deployment will remain an important part of the Lincoln story.
Looking beyond the quarter, as you know, we have a couple of initiative in place focused on supporting long-term growth and profitability. First, an enterprise-wide digital initiative that will improve the customer experience while providing cost savings as well as the potential for revenue enhancements. Also, we have a rigorous focus on in-force, renewal and new business pricing across all the businesses. Importantly, both are progressing as planned and will support our strong track record of financial success.
Now turning to the business segments, starting with Annuities. Earnings were strong as our high-quality in-force business was further strengthened by equity market performance. We saw good sales momentum in our variable annuity business as sales grew sequentially for the second straight quarter. Importantly, growth also accelerated, increasing 11% in the second quarter compared to 4% in the first quarter. 
VA sales without living benefits increased sequentially and year-over-year as the value propositions for tax deferral and legacy planning our resonating with customers. 
VA sales with guaranteed living benefits also increased sequentially, benefiting from product enhancements made earlier in the year. Our portfolio of customer solutions, once again expanded late in the second quarter with the addition of a new living benefit rider, which offers customers a higher withdrawal rate than most guaranteed income products, but adjusts if the account value is depleted, providing attractive features for both customers and Lincoln.
So while in the early stages, sales momentum is growing in our variable annuity business, as product portfolio expansion enables us to take market share now while fee-based products, such as core income, will build over time and help support long-term growth.
Shifting to fixed annuities. Sales in the quarter were affected by the decline in interest rates because our approach to product pricing remains disciplined. However, similar to the variable annuity strategies, we are actively looking for ways to expand our customer base and distribution reach. 
We recently entered into a reinsurance agreement with that will improve our value proposition by leveraging each other's competitive advantages. We expect this transactions to affect sales immediately and grow over time driven by better penetration into the bank and broker-dealer channels. Furthermore, I see this relationship as another example to the Lincoln's distribution franchise and broad product portfolio being in demand.
Before moving into Retirement Plan Services, I want to highlight that Barons recently published its list of the 50 best Annuities and Lincoln was recognized in 6 categories, more than any other carrier. This speaks to the breadth of our commission and fee-based annuity product offerings and the valuable solutions provided to our customers. 
When combined with leading distribution capabilities, we are in a strong position in the marketplace and are optimistic that sales momentum will continue.
In Retirement Plan Services, the strategy and franchise continue to drive positive results as this quarter marked a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in deposits, net flows and earnings. 
Total deposits in the quarter of $2 billion were up 19% from a year ago, driven by first-year sales increasing 71% to $737 million as both small and mid-large markets delivered strong results while recurring deposits continue to increase. 
Net flows totaled $395 million compared to 4 [ph] in the prior year quarter. Over the past 12 months, flows have reached nearly $1 billion and have been positive for 6 straight quarters.
Our momentum is being driven by the following: sales growth is benefiting from product enhancements that focus on simple and transparent pricing. This combined with a more tenured wholesaling force is increasing productivity. 
Next, employee contributions are growing, driven by an improved customer experience that combines face-to-face service with digital and data analytics that motivate and empower them to save more for retirement. 
Lastly, retention remains strong as result of better aligning and expanding client-facing teams along with continuous improvement in our service center. Bottom line, we remained confident in growth opportunities in RPS business and our strategy positions us well to sustain earnings growth.
Turning to Life Insurance. Earnings increased double digits, helped by solid variable investment income and growth of our in-force business. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $197 million were strong, up 14% from the prior year, benefiting from a broad product portfolio and industry-leading distribution. 
MoneyGuard sales were exceptionally strong, driven by our leadership position in the fast-growing linked-benefit marketplace and a multichannel distribution approach. 
Sales did accelerate somewhat ahead of pricing adjustments made during the quarter. As a result, MoneyGuard sales in subsequent periods are likely to be more consistent with prior quarters.
VUL sales increased 22%, benefiting from a shift away from interest rate sensitive Life Insurance products, which have seen significant price increases. To this point, GUL sales were down nearly 50% in the quarter and represented just 6% of total Life sales.
Lastly, on term insurance, sales were down 7% though policy count was up 18% as we leverage digital technology to expand distribution and reach a new customer base through Term Excel, which targets a younger demographic. 
We continue to focus on sales diversification, risk management and disciplined product pricing to achieve appropriate returns on capital. This resulted in expected new business returns being near the top end of our targeted range of 12% to 15%. 
Given product breadth, strength of distribution and ability to effectively meet the needs of key consumer segments, I'm excited about future growth in the Life business.
Turning to Group Protection, earnings increased significantly over the prior year period as loss ratios were favorable. After seeing year-over-year premium growth for the first time in nearly 3 years last quarter, premiums grew 3% in the second quarter. 
During the quarter, sales increased 24%, driven by growth in all product lines. Year-to-date, sales have increased 12% and block persistency is up about 4 percentage points compared to the prior year. 
Importantly, our outlook for these key premium growth drivers remained positive as the sales pipeline and quote activity are strong in our target markets and persistency continues to improve in core life and disability products.
Bottom line, we are very pleased with this quarter's results and increases our confidence in achieving and sustaining the 5% to 7% margin target. While volatility can be expected quarter-to-quarter, underlying trends are positive and the top line is improving, all of which support solid future earnings growth.
Shifting to investment results. The alternate investment portfolio had very good quarter, as both private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to a 17% pretax annualized return. 
In terms of new money, we invested over $2.4 billion in the quarter at an average yield of 4.1%, down a little from the first quarter. Lower treasury rates and tighter spreads were largely offset by the purchases in private placement and commercial mortgage loans that provided a pickup in spread over comparable public fixed income. Overall, the investment portfolio remains very well diversified and a very high quality.
The fixed income portfolio yield declined 3 basis points to 4.76% consistent with expectations. It is also worth noting that the spread between our portfolio yield and the new money rates stands at approximately 65 basis points compared to 110 basis points in the prior year year quarter, which highlights how spread compression continues to abate.
So in closing, we're very pleased with the quarter, which included strong momentum in both top and bottom line results combined with effective capital management. We remained confident in the ability to drive earnings growth, leveraging attractive growth opportunities, in-force margin improvement and our strong balance sheet. 
I remain convinced our simple, clear and straightforward business model is underappreciated, particularly relative to the competition, given our track record of financial success and earnings stability. We, therefore, look to continuing our solid results and further closing the valuation GAAP to reward our shareholders.
With that, let me turn the call over to Randy."
867423,435193925,1264816,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2017",2017-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $419 million or $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a 19% increase from the prior year. This quarter's results were very strong, highlighted by record normalized EPS. Underlying tren",1069,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $419 million or $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a 19% increase from the prior year. This quarter's results were very strong, highlighted by record normalized EPS. Underlying trends were solid and all 4 businesses posted earnings growth.
It's also worth noting that while variable investment income was $0.08 better than long-term experience, this was largely offset by higher variable expenses, mainly driven by strong sales production and earnings during the quarter.
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased 7% in the quarter, driven by an 8% increase in average account values and the positive sales trends Dennis noted. Expense discipline continues to be a good story as net G&A expenses, excluding the variable-related expenses I just noted, were up less than 1%, providing positive operating leverage. 
Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% to nearly $60, an all-time high. Operating ROE was strong at 12.7% and year-to-date, normalized ROE is 40 basis points above 2016.
Finally, balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $265 million to shareholders or 63% of operating earnings consistent with guidance for 2017. Net income of $411 million further highlights the strength of the quarter, as both credit experience and hedge program performance were excellent with net income representing 98% of operating earnings, consistent with last quarter.
Now I will turn to segment results, starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $251 million, up 7% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from a 6% increase in average account values as equity market strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. 
Total operating revenue increased 9% as every revenue line showed growth compared to the prior year. Return metrics remained strong, as ROE came in at 21% and ROA was 77 basis points, both consistent with recent quarters.
Our high-quality book of business continues to differentiate us relative to our competitors and is further enhanced by an extremely successful hedge program, which had solid performance with a $9 million gain in the quarter. 
The quality of the variable annuity book can be seen by looking at net amount of risk, which further improved during the quarter to less than 7/10 of 1% of account value for both living and death benefits. 
So great quarter for the annuity business, which positions us well for strong earnings and returns to continue.
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings of $37 million were up 19% from the prior year quarter. The earnings increase is attributable to growth in free income and variable investment income combined with expense management. 
Positive net flows of $994 million over the trailing 12 months and favorable equity markets resulted in a 12% in average account values, while end-of-period balances reached a record $63 billion. 
Operating revenue grew 7% compared to the prior year, while G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, increased just 3%, resulting in an approximate 100 basis point decrease in the expense ratio.
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 12 basis points versus to the prior year, consistent with expectations. For the quarter, ROA remained stable at 24 basis points. 
So a strong result for the retirement business, highlighted by the highest quarter of net flows in nearly a decade and continued momentum with back-to-back quarters of double-digit growth in deposits, net flows, assets and earnings.
Turning to the Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $133 million were up 11% from the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to 8% growth in operating revenues. Earnings drivers remained solid in the quarter with Life Insurance in-force up 4% and average account values up 6%. 
Revenues were up more than driver growth, driven by the stronger variable investment income I noted upfront. Mortality experience was consistent with expectations as better-than-expected frequency was offset by slightly higher severity.
G&A expenses and commissions were somewhat elevated this quarter, primarily due to strong sales production. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 7 basis points year-over-year, consistent with expectations. So a solid quarter for the Life business. 
With mortality typically more favorable in the second half of the year and steady driver growth in the mid-single-digit range, we are well positioned for near and long-term earnings growth in the Life business.
Group Protection earned $35 million compared to $15 million in the prior year quarter, the significant increase in earnings was primarily due to favorable risk experience. The nonmedical loss ratio was 66.1% in the quarter, a 640 basis point improvement compared to the prior year as loss ratios were favorable across all product lines.
While we wouldn't regularly expect loss ratios to be this strong, this quarter's result clearly speaks to successfully repricing our book of business and continued underwriting discipline on renewals and the new business. 
DAC amortization return to more normal levels in the quarter, as expected. The reemergence of premium growth is also aiding our group business with premiums up 3% from the prior year quarter and leading indicators, such as sales and persistency, trending in the positive direction.
Bottom line, it was a very strong quarter for group with a reported margin of 7%. We remain confident that annual margin improvement will continue working towards consistently achieving a 5% to 7% margin.
Before moving to Q&A, let me briefly comment on a few other items of note. First, in capital. Both capital and capital generation remain strong, providing significant financial flexibility and an ability to commit capital to new business opportunities, which drive long-term earnings growth and also return capital to shareholders. 
As I noted upfront, this quarter, we returned $265 million, including $200 million in share repurchases, with the remainder through shareholder dividends. Statutory surplus stands at nearly $9 billion, and I estimate the RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 495%. 
Holding company cash came in above our $500 million target. 
So wrapping things up, another excellent quarter for Lincoln, strong earnings highlighted by record normalized EPS, high-quality results as all 4 businesses delivered revenue and earnings growth while net income represented 98% of operating earnings.
Other key shareholder metrics were also strong with book value per share up 9% and an ROE of 12.7%. Finally, capital generation and deployment remain important and consistent parts of our story.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

I'm not going to front run this process. I say that every year. In fact, I would imagine, if I looked out on my calendar, I would start to see the meetings associated with the deck and locking occurring a few weeks from now. So I've had 0 meetings, but there are some informational points that I'm going to bring into those meetings to really around the environment that this year's unlocking will occur in. So I think about the major assumptions that have really driven results in the past. I'd start with the interest rate environment. When we set our assumption last year, we set an assumptions that assumes that interest rates would increase overtime. And if you look at what's happened over the last year, underlying treasuries are up probably about 60 basis points from where they were at 9 30 of last year, while spreads have come in a little bit. But net-net, rates have increased, in line with our assumption we said last year. So that's not the final answer, but at least environmentally, I know things have moved somewhat how they would last year. I think about mortality, we set an assumption last year and if I think about our discussions over the past year, mortality is largely performed in line with our expectation. So once again, environmentally, there is that I'm going to go into those meetings we're worried about. And lastly, I point out that when you think about the other big drivers, especially on the VA side, you're talking about policyholder behavior. And as we've talked about, there haven't been any big changes in policyholder behavior relative to the experience we've had over many, many years. So I'm -- we'll come up to a series of meetings with an understanding that the environment that the unlocking will exist in seems to be pretty good."

But to fill that gap between there and the 30% to 33% long-term strategic target we would like to hit, it would take some level of organic activity."

Good morning, everyone. The positive momentum at the start of the year carried into the second quarter, delivering outstanding results, notably operating earnings per share growth of 19%. Several factors contributed to our results. First",1510,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. The positive momentum at the start of the year carried into the second quarter, delivering outstanding results, notably operating earnings per share growth of 19%. Several factors contributed to our results. First, sales remained strong as most of our businesses reported double-digit growth compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on restoring variable annuity sales and saw sequential growth accelerate during the quarter. Across the enterprise, new business returns are attractive. We are clearly benefiting from our multichannel distribution model, industry-leading shelf space and a broad set of customer solutions, which when combined, differentiate us from competitors and support further growth.
Next, the quarter's strength was broad-based, as all 4 businesses delivered revenue and earnings growth. Additionally, the percentage of earnings coming from mortality and morbidity businesses continue to trend higher, which leads to further diversification in our sources of earnings. Lastly, as we have demonstrated for years, our balance sheet is high quality and the businesses generate significant free cash flow, allowing active capital management. This continued in the second quarter with $265 million returned to our shareholders. Capital deployment will remain an important part of the Lincoln story.
Looking beyond the quarter, as you know, we have a couple of initiative in place focused on supporting long-term growth and profitability. First, an enterprise-wide digital initiative that will improve the customer experience while providing cost savings as well as the potential for revenue enhancements. Also, we have a rigorous focus on in-force, renewal and new business pricing across all the businesses. Importantly, both are progressing as planned and will support our strong track record of financial success.
Now turning to the business segments, starting with Annuities. Earnings were strong as our high-quality in-force business was further strengthened by equity market performance. We saw good sales momentum in our variable annuity business as sales grew sequentially for the second straight quarter. Importantly, growth also accelerated, increasing 11% in the second quarter compared to 4% in the first quarter. VA sales without living benefits increased sequentially and year-over-year as the value propositions for tax deferral and legacy planning are resonating with customers. VA sales with guaranteed living benefits also increased sequentially, benefiting from product enhancements made earlier in the year. Our portfolio of customer solutions once again expanded late in the second quarter with the addition of a new living benefit rider, which offers customers a higher withdrawal rate than most guaranteed income products, but adjusts if the account value is depleted, providing attractive features for both customers and Lincoln. So while in the early stages, sales momentum is growing in our variable annuity business as product portfolio expansion enables us to take market share now while fee-based products such as core income, will build over time and help support long-term growth.
Shifting to fixed annuities. Sales in the quarter were affected by the decline in interest rates because our approach to product pricing remains disciplined. However, similar to the variable of annuity strategies, we are actively looking for ways to expand our customer base and distribution reach. We recently entered into a reinsurance agreement with Athene that will improve our value proposition by leveraging each other's competitive advantages. We expect these transactions to affect sales immediately and grow over time driven by better penetration into the bank and broker-dealer channels. Furthermore, I see this relationship as another example of Lincoln's distribution franchise and broad product portfolio being in demand.
Before moving into Retirement Plan Services, I want to highlight that Barron's recently published its list of the 50 best annuities and Lincoln was recognized in 6 categories more than any other carrier. This speaks to the breadth of our commission and fee-based annuity product offerings and the valuable solutions provided to our customers. When combined with leading distribution capabilities, we are in a strong position in the marketplace and are optimistic that sales momentum will continue.
In Retirement Plan Services, the strategy and franchise continue to drive positive results as this quarter marked a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in deposits, net flows and earnings. Total deposits in the quarter of $2 billion were up 19% from a year ago, driven by first year sales increasing 71% to $737 million as both small and mid-large markets delivered strong results while recurring deposits continue to increase. Net flows totaled $395 million compared to [ $400 million ] in the prior year quarter. Over the past 12 months, flows have reached nearly $1 billion and have been positive for 6 straight quarters.
Our momentum is being driven by the following. Sales growth is benefiting from product enhancements that focused on simple and transparent pricing, this combined with a more tenured wholesaling force is increasing productivity. Next, employee contributions are growing, driven by an improved customer experience that combines face-to-face service with digital and data analytics that motivate and empower them to save more for retirement. 
Lastly, retention remains strong as result of better aligning and expanding client-facing teams along with continuous improvement in our service center. Bottom line, we've remained confident in growth opportunities for RPS business, and our strategy positions us well to sustain earnings growth.
Turning to Life Insurance. Earnings increased double digits, helped by solid variable investment income and growth of our in-force business. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $197 million were strong, up 14% from the prior year, benefiting from a broad product portfolio and industry-leading distribution. MoneyGuard sales were exceptionally strong, driven by our leadership position in the fast-growing linked-benefit marketplace and a multichannel distribution approach. 
Sales did accelerate somewhat ahead of pricing adjustments made during the quarter. As a result, MoneyGuard sales in subsequent periods are likely to be more consistent with prior quarters. VUL sales increased 22%, benefiting from a shift away from interest rate-sensitive Life Insurance products, which have seen significant price increases. To this point, GUL sales were down nearly 50% in the quarter and represented just 6% of total Life sales.
Lastly on term insurance. Sales were down 7%, though policy count was up 18% as we leverage digital technology to expand distribution and reach a new customer base through TermAccel, which targets a younger demographic. We continue to focus on sales diversification, risk management and disciplined product pricing to achieve appropriate returns on capital. This resulted in expected new business returns being near the top end of our targeted range of 12% to 15%. Given product breadth, strength of distribution and ability to effectively meet the needs of key consumer segments, I'm excited about future growth in the Life business.
Turning to Group Protection, earnings increased significantly over the prior year period as loss ratios were favorable. After seeing year-over-year premium growth for the first time in nearly 3 years last quarter, premiums grew 3% in the second quarter. During the quarter, sales increased 24%, driven by growth in all product lines. Year-to-date, sales have increased 12% and block persistency is up about 4 percentage points compared to the prior year. Importantly, our outlook for these key premium growth drivers remain positive as the sales pipeline and quote activity are strong in our target markets and persistency continues to improve in core life and disability products.
Bottom line, we are very pleased with this quarter's results and increases our confidence in achieving and sustaining the 5% to 7% margin target. While volatility can't be expected quarter-to-quarter, underlying trends are positive and the top line is improving, all of which support solid future earnings growth.
Shifting to investment results. The alternative investment portfolio had a very good quarter as both private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to a 17% pretax annualized return. In terms of new money, we invested over $2.4 billion in the quarter at an average yield of 4.1%, down a little from the first quarter. Lower treasury rates and tighter spreads were largely offset by the purchases in private placement and commercial mortgage loans that provided a pickup in spread over comparable public fixed income. Overall, the investment portfolio remains very well diversified and a very high quality. The fixed income portfolio yield declined 3 basis points to 4.76% consistent with expectations. It is also worth noting that the spread between our portfolio yield and the new money rates stands at approximately 65 basis points compared to 110 basis points in the prior year quarter, which highlights how spread compression continues to abate.
So in closing, we're very pleased with the quarter, which included strong momentum in both top and bottom line results combined with effective capital management. We remain confident in the ability to drive earnings growth, leveraging attractive growth opportunities, in-force margin improvement and our strong balance sheet. I remain convinced our simple, clear and straightforward business model is underappreciated, particularly relative to the competition, given our track record of financial success and earning stability. We, therefore, look forward to continuing our solid results and further closing the valuation gap to reward our shareholders.
With that, let me turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported income from operations of $419 million or $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a 19% increase from the prior year. This quarter's results were very strong, highlighted by record normalized EPS. Underlying tren",1068,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $419 million or $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a 19% increase from the prior year. This quarter's results were very strong, highlighted by record normalized EPS. Underlying trends were solid and all 4 businesses posted earnings growth. It is also worth noting that while variable investment income was $0.08 better than long-term experience, this was largely offset by higher variable expenses, mainly driven by strong sales production and earnings during the quarter.
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased 7% in the quarter, driven by an 8% increase in average account values and the positive sales trends Dennis noted. Expense discipline continues to be a good story as net G&A expenses, excluding the variable-related expenses I just noted, were up less than 1%, providing positive operating leverage. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% to nearly $60, an all-time high. Operating ROE was strong at 12.7%. And year-to-date, normalized ROE is 40 basis points above 2016.
Finally, balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $265 million to shareholders or 63% of operating earnings consistent with guidance for 2017. Net income of $411 million further highlights the strength of the quarter as both credit experience and hedge program performance were excellent with net income representing 98% of operating earnings consistent with last quarter.
Now I will turn to segment results starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $251 million, up 7% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from a 6% increase in average account values as equity market strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. Total operating revenue increased 9% as every revenue line showed growth compared to the prior year. Return metrics remained strong as ROE came in at 21% and ROA was 77 basis points, both consistent with recent quarters.
Our high-quality book of business continues to differentiate us relative to our competitors and is further enhanced by an extremely successful hedge program, which had solid performance with a $9 million gain in the quarter. The quality of the variable annuity book can be seen by looking at net amount of risk, which further improved during the quarter to less than 0.7% of account value for both living and death benefits. So great quarter for the annuity business, which positions us well for strong earnings and returns to continue.
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings of $37 million were up 19% from the prior year quarter. The earnings increase is attributable to growth in fee income and variable investment income combined with expense management. Positive net flows of $994 million over the trailing 12 months and favorable equity markets resulted in a 12% increase in average account values, while end-of-period balances reached a record $63 billion. 
Operating revenue grew 7% compared to the prior year, while G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, increased just 3%, resulting in an approximate 100 basis point decrease in the expense ratio. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 12 basis points versus the prior year, consistent with expectations. For the quarter, ROA remains stable at 24 basis points. So a strong result for the retirement business, highlighted by the highest quarter of net flows in nearly a decade and continued momentum with back-to-back quarters of double-digit growth in deposits, net flows, assets and earnings.
Turning to the Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $133 million were up 11% from the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to 8% growth in operating revenues. Earnings drivers remain solid in the quarter with Life Insurance in-force up 4% and average account values up 6%. Revenues were up more than driver growth, driven by the stronger variable investment income I noted upfront. Mortality experience was consistent with expectations as better-than-expected frequency was offset by slightly higher severity.
G&A expenses and commissions were somewhat elevated this quarter, primarily due to strong sales production. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 7 basis points year-over-year, consistent with expectations. So a solid quarter for the Life business. With mortality typically more favorable in the second half of the year and steady driver growth in the mid-single-digit range, we are well positioned for near- and long-term earnings growth in the Life business.
Group Protection earned $35 million compared to $15 million in the prior year quarter. The significant increase in earnings was primarily due to favorable risk experience. The nonmedical loss ratio was 66.1% in the quarter, a 640 basis point improvement compared to the prior year as loss ratios were favorable across all product lines. While we wouldn't regularly expect loss ratios to be this strong, this quarter's result clearly speaks to successfully repricing our book of business and continued underwriting discipline on renewals and the new business.
DAC amortization returned to more normal levels in the quarter as expected. The reemergence of premium growth is also aiding our group business with premiums up 3% from the prior year quarter and leading indicators such as sales and persistency, trending in a positive direction. Bottom line, it was a very strong quarter for group with a reported margin of 7%. We remain confident that annual margin improvement will continue working towards consistently achieving a 5% to 7% margin.
Before moving to Q&A, let me briefly comment on a few other items of note. First, in capital. Both capital and capital generation remain strong, providing significant financial flexibility and an ability to commit capital to new business opportunities, which drive long-term earnings growth and also return capital to shareholders. As I noted upfront, this quarter, we returned $265 million, including $200 million in share repurchases, with the remainder through shareholder dividends. Statutory surplus stands at nearly $9 billion, and I estimate the RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 495%. Holding company cash came in above our $500 million target. 
So wrapping things up, another excellent quarter for Lincoln, strong earnings highlighted by record normalized EPS, high-quality results as all 4 businesses delivered revenue and earnings growth while net income represented 98% of operating earnings. Other key shareholder metrics were also strong with book value per share up 9% and an ROE of 12.7%. Finally, capital generation and deployment remain important and consistent parts of our story.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

So I don't consider it to be a quarter that's outside of the potential for this business. I think as you look forward and you look at the underlying drivers of the business, we wouldn't expect that 66% or 66.1% is the long-term loss ratio for this business, so that may move up a little bit. But on the other hand, as premium search grew, we would expect that the expense ratio would come down a little bit. So all in, I think this quarter was within our normal range, and our expectations for what we would expect in the future haven't really changed.

I guess the second thing I would say is coming back to the DOL. And as we know, there has been more requests or comment. And as we've said all along, we think that the idea of, of course, doing what's in the best interest of the customer is what's kept us in business for 100 years and that's a good idea.

I'm not going to front run this process. I say that every year. In fact, I would imagine, if I looked out on my calendar, I would start to see the meetings associated with the DAC unlocking occurring a few weeks from now. So I've had 0 meetings. But there are some informational points that I'm going to bring into those meetings and really around the environment that this year's unlocking will occur in. So I think about the major assumptions that have really driven results in the past. I'd start with the interest rate environment. And when we set our assumption last year, we set an assumption that assumes that interest rates would increase over time. And if you look at what's happened over the last year, underlying treasuries are up probably about 60 basis points from where they were at 9/30 of last year, while spreads have come in a little bit. But net-net, rates have increased in line with our assumption we set last year. So that's not the final answer. But at least environmentally, I know things have moved somewhat how they thought they would last year. When I think about mortality, we set an assumption last year. And if I think about our discussions over the past year, mortality is largely performed in line with our expectations. So once again, environmentally, there isn't anything that I'm going to go into those meetings worried about. And lastly, I'd point out that when you think about the other big drivers, especially on the VA side, you're talking about policyholder behavior. And as we've talked about, there haven't been any big changes in policyholder behavior relative to the experience we've had over many, many years. So I'm -- we'll come up to a series of meetings with an understanding that the environment -- that the unlocking we'll exist in seems to be pretty good."

The positive momentum at the start of the year carried into the second quarter, delivering outstanding results, notably operating earnings per share growth of 19%.

We continue to focus on restoring variable annuity sales and saw sequential growth accelerate during the quarter. Across the enterprise, new business returns are attractive. We are clearly benefiting from our multichannel distribution model, industry-leading shelf space and a broad set of customer solutions, which, when combined, differentiate us from competitors and support further growth.
Next, the quarter's strength was broad-based, as all 4 businesses delivered revenue and earnings growth. Additionally, the percentage of earnings coming from mortality and morbidity businesses continued to trend higher, which leads to further diversification in our sources of earnings. Lastly, as we have demonstrated for years, the balance sheet is high quality and the businesses generate significant free cash flow, allowing active capital management. This continued in the second quarter with $265 million returned to our shareholders. Capital deployment will remain an important part of the Lincoln story.
Looking beyond the quarter, as you know, we have a couple of initiatives in place focused on supporting long-term growth and profitability. First, an enterprise-wide digital initiative that will improve the customer experience while providing cost savings as well as the potential for revenue enhancements. Also, we have a rigorous focus on in-force, renewal and new business pricing across all the businesses. Importantly, both are progressing as planned and will support our strong track record of financial success.
Now turning to the business segments, starting with Annuities. Earnings were strong as our high-quality in-force business was further strengthened by equity market performance. We saw good sales momentum in our variable annuity business as sales grew sequentially for the second straight quarter. Importantly, growth also accelerated, increasing 11% in the second quarter compared to 4% in the first quarter. VA sales without living benefits increased sequentially and year-over-year as the value propositions for tax deferral and legacy planning are resonating with customers. VA sales with guaranteed living benefits also increased sequentially, benefiting from product enhancements made earlier in the year. Our portfolio of customer solutions once again expanded late in the second quarter with the addition of a new living benefit rider, which offers customers a higher withdrawal rate than most guaranteed income products, but adjusts if the account value is depleted, providing attractive features for both customers and Lincoln. So while in the early stages, sales momentum is growing in our variable annuity business as product portfolio expansion enables us to take market share now while fee-based products such as core income, will build over time and help support long-term growth.
Shifting to fixed annuities. Sales in the quarter were affected by the decline in interest rates because our approach to product pricing remains disciplined. However, similar to the variable of annuity strategies, we are actively looking for ways to expand our customer base and distribution reach. We recently entered into a reinsurance agreement with Athene that will improve our value proposition by leveraging each other's competitive advantages. We expect this transaction to affect sales immediately and grow over time driven by better penetration into the bank and broker-dealer channels. Furthermore, I see this relationship as another example of Lincoln's distribution franchise and broad product portfolio being in demand.
Before moving into Retirement Plan Services, I want to highlight that Barron's recently published its list of the 50 best annuities and Lincoln was recognized in 6 categories more than any other carrier. This speaks to the breadth of our commission and fee-based annuity product offerings and the valuable solutions provided to our customers. When combined with leading distribution capabilities, we are in a strong position in the marketplace and are optimistic that sales momentum will continue.
In Retirement Plan Services, the strategy and franchise continue to drive positive results as this quarter marked a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in deposits, net flows and earnings. Total deposits in the quarter of $2 billion were up 19% from a year ago, driven by first year sales increasing 71% to $737 million as both small and mid-large markets delivered strong results, while recurring deposits continued to increase. Net flows totaled $395 million compared to $4 million in the prior year quarter. Over the past 12 months, flows have reached nearly $1 billion and have been positive for 6 straight quarters.
Our momentum is being driven by the following. Sales growth is benefiting from product enhancements that focused on simple and transparent pricing, this, combined with a more tenured wholesaling force, is increasing productivity. Next, employee contributions are growing, driven by an improved customer experience that combines face-to-face service with digital and data analytics that motivate and empower them to save more for retirement. 
Lastly, retention remains strong as a result of better aligning and expanding client-facing teams along with continuous improvement in our service center. Bottom line, we remain confident in growth opportunities for RPS business, and our strategy positions us well to sustain earnings growth.
Turning to Life Insurance. Earnings increased double digits, helped by solid variable investment income and growth of our in-force business. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $197 million were strong, up 14% from the prior year, benefiting from a broad product portfolio and industry-leading distribution. MoneyGuard sales were exceptionally strong, driven by our leadership position in the fast-growing linked-benefit marketplace and a multichannel distribution approach. 
Sales did accelerate somewhat ahead of pricing adjustments made during the quarter. As a result, MoneyGuard sales in subsequent periods are likely to be more consistent with prior quarters. VUL sales increased 22%, benefiting from a shift away from interest rate sensitive Life Insurance products, which have seen significant price increases. To this point, GUL sales were down nearly 50% in the quarter and represented just 6% of total Life sales.
Lastly on term insurance. Sales were down 7%, though policy count was up 18% as we leverage digital technology to expand distribution and reach a new customer base through TermAccel, which targets a younger demographic. We continue to focus on sales diversification, risk management and disciplined product pricing to achieve appropriate returns on capital. This resulted in expected new business returns being near the top end of our targeted range of 12% to 15%. Given product breadth, strength of distribution and ability to effectively meet the needs of key consumer segments, I'm excited about future growth in the Life business.
Turning to Group Protection, earnings increased significantly over the prior year period as loss ratios were favorable. After seeing year-over-year premium growth for the first time in nearly 3 years last quarter, premiums grew 3% in the second quarter. During the quarter, sales increased 24%, driven by growth in all product lines. Year-to-date, sales have increased 12% and block persistency is up about 4 percentage points compared to the prior year. Importantly, our outlook for these key premium growth drivers remain positive as the sales pipeline and quote activity are strong in our target markets and persistency continues to improve in core life and disability products.
Bottom line, we are very pleased with this quarter's results and increases our confidence in achieving and sustaining the 5% to 7% margin target. While volatility can be expected quarter-to-quarter, underlying trends are positive and the top line is improving, all of which support solid future earnings growth.
Shifting to investment results. The alternative investment portfolio had a very good quarter as both private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to a 17% pretax annualized return. In terms of new money, we invested over $2.4 billion in the quarter at an average yield of 4.1%, down a little from the first quarter. Lower treasury rates and tighter spreads were largely offset by the purchases in private placement and commercial mortgage loans that provided a pickup in spread over comparable public fixed income. Overall, the investment portfolio remains very well diversified and of very high quality. The fixed income portfolio yield declined 3 basis points to 4.76% consistent with expectations. It is also worth noting that the spread between our portfolio yield and the new money rate stands at approximately 65 basis points compared to 110 basis points in the prior year quarter, which highlights how spread compression continues to abate.
So in closing, we are very pleased with the quarter, which included strong momentum in both top and bottom line results combined with effective capital management. We remain confident in the ability to drive earnings growth, leveraging attractive growth opportunities, in-force margin improvement and our strong balance sheet. I remain convinced our simple, clear and straightforward business model is underappreciated, particularly relative to the competition, given our track record of financial success and earnings stability. We, therefore, look forward to continuing our solid results and further closing the valuation gap to reward our shareholders.
With that, let me turn the call over to Randy."
867423,435193925,1268808,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2017",2017-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $419 million or $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a 19% increase from the prior year. This quarter's results were very strong, highlighted by record normalized EPS. Underlying tren",1069,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $419 million or $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a 19% increase from the prior year. This quarter's results were very strong, highlighted by record normalized EPS. Underlying trends were solid and all 4 businesses posted earnings growth. It is also worth noting that while variable investment income was $0.08 better than long-term experience, this was largely offset by higher variable expenses, mainly driven by strong sales production and earnings during the quarter.
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased 7% in the quarter, driven by an 8% increase in average account values and the positive sales trends Dennis noted. Expense discipline continues to be a good story as net G&A expenses, excluding the variable-related expenses I just noted, were up less than 1%, providing positive operating leverage. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% to nearly $60, an all-time high. Operating ROE was strong at 12.7%. And year-to-date, normalized ROE is 40 basis points above 2016.
Finally, balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $265 million to shareholders or 63% of operating earnings, consistent with guidance for 2017. Net income of $411 million further highlights the strength of the quarter as both credit experience and hedge program performance were excellent, with net income representing 98% of operating earnings consistent with last quarter.
Now I will turn to segment results starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $251 million, up 7% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from a 6% increase in average account values as equity market strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. Total operating revenue increased 9% as every revenue line showed growth compared to the prior year. Return metrics remained strong as ROE came in at 21% and ROA was 77 basis points, both consistent with recent quarters.
Our high-quality book of business continues to differentiate us relative to our competitors and is further enhanced by an extremely successful hedge program, which had solid performance with a $9 million gain in the quarter. The quality of the variable annuity book can be seen by looking at net amount of risk, which further improved during the quarter to less than 0.7% of account value for both living and death benefits. So great quarter for the annuity business, which positions us well for strong earnings and returns to continue.
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings of $37 million were up 19% from the prior year quarter. The earnings increase is attributable to growth in fee income and variable investment income combined with expense management. Positive net flows of $994 million over the trailing 12 months and favorable equity markets resulted in a 12% increase in average account values, while end-of-period balances reached a record $63 billion. 
Operating revenue grew 7% compared to the prior year, while G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, increased just 3%, resulting in an approximate 100 basis point decrease in the expense ratio. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 12 basis points versus the prior year, consistent with expectations. For the quarter, ROA remains stable at 24 basis points. So a strong result for the retirement business, highlighted by the highest quarter of net flows in nearly a decade and continued momentum with back-to-back quarters of double-digit growth in deposits, net flows, assets and earnings.
Turning to the Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $133 million were up 11% from the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to 8% growth in operating revenues. Earnings drivers remain solid in the quarter with Life Insurance in-force up 4% and average account values up 6%. Revenues were up more than driver growth, driven by the stronger variable investment income I noted up front. Mortality experience was consistent with expectations as better-than-expected frequency was offset by slightly higher severity.
G&A expenses and commissions were somewhat elevated this quarter, primarily due to strong sales production. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 7 basis points year-over-year, consistent with expectations. So a solid quarter for the Life business. With mortality typically more favorable in the second half of the year and steady driver growth in the mid-single-digit range, we are well positioned for near- and long-term earnings growth in the Life business.
Group Protection earned $35 million compared to $15 million in the prior year quarter. The significant increase in earnings was primarily due to favorable risk experience. The nonmedical loss ratio was 66.1% in the quarter, a 640 basis point improvement compared to the prior year as loss ratios were favorable across all product lines. While we wouldn't regularly expect loss ratios to be this strong, this quarter's result clearly speaks to successfully repricing our book of business and continued underwriting discipline on renewals and the new business.
DAC amortization returned to more normal levels in the quarter as expected. The reemergence of premium growth is also aiding our group business with premiums up 3% from the prior year quarter and leading indicators such as sales and persistency, trending in a positive direction. Bottom line, it was a very strong quarter for group with a reported margin of 7%. We remain confident that annual margin improvement will continue working towards consistently achieving a 5% to 7% margin.
Before moving to Q&A, let me briefly comment on a few other items of note. First, on capital. Both capital and capital generation remain strong, providing significant financial flexibility and an ability to commit capital to new business opportunities, which drive long-term earnings growth and also return capital to shareholders. As I noted upfront, this quarter, we returned $265 million, including $200 million in share repurchases, with the remainder through shareholder dividends. Statutory surplus stands at nearly $9 billion, and I estimate the RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 495%. Holding company cash came in above our $500 million target. 
So wrapping things up, another excellent quarter for Lincoln, strong earnings highlighted by record normalized EPS, high-quality results as all 4 businesses delivered revenue and earnings growth while net income represented 98% of operating earnings. Other key shareholder metrics were also strong with book value per share up 9% and an ROE of 12.7%. Finally, capital generation and deployment remain important and consistent parts of our story.

I'm not going to front run this process. I say that every year. In fact, I would imagine, if I looked out on my calendar, I would start to see the meetings associated with the DAC unlocking occurring a few weeks from now. So I've had 0 meetings. But there are some informational points that I'm going to bring into those meetings really around the environment that this year's unlocking will occur in. So when I think about the major assumptions that have really driven results in the past, I'd start with the interest rate environment. And when we set our assumption last year, we set an assumption that assumed that interest rates would increase over time. And if you look at what's happened over the last year, underlying treasuries are up probably about 60 basis points from where they were at 9/30 of last year, while spreads have come in a little bit. But net-net, rates have increased in line with our assumption we set last year. So that's not the final answer. But at least environmentally, I know things have moved somewhat how we thought they would last year. When I think about mortality, we set an assumption last year. And if I think about our discussions over the past year, mortality has largely performed in line with our expectations. So once again, environmentally, there isn't anything that I'm going to go into those meetings worried about. And lastly, I'd point out that when you think about the other big drivers, especially on the VA side, you're talking about policyholder behavior.

Good morning, everyone. The positive momentum at the start of the year carried into the second quarter, delivering outstanding results, notably operating earnings per share growth of 19%. Several factors contributed to our results. First",1511,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. The positive momentum at the start of the year carried into the second quarter, delivering outstanding results, notably operating earnings per share growth of 19%. Several factors contributed to our results. First, sales remained strong as most of our businesses reported double-digit growth compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on restoring variable annuity sales and saw sequential growth accelerate during the quarter. Across the enterprise, new business returns are attractive. We are clearly benefiting from our multichannel distribution model, industry-leading shelf space and a broad set of customer solutions, which, when combined, differentiate us from competitors and support further growth.
Next, the quarter's strength was broad-based, as all 4 businesses delivered revenue and earnings growth. Additionally, the percentage of earnings coming from mortality and morbidity businesses continued to trend higher, which leads to further diversification in our sources of earnings. Lastly, as we have demonstrated for years, the balance sheet is high quality and the businesses generate significant free cash flow, allowing active capital management. This continued in the second quarter with $265 million returned to our shareholders. Capital deployment will remain an important part of the Lincoln story.
Looking beyond the quarter, as you know, we have a couple of initiatives in place focused on supporting long-term growth and profitability. First, an enterprise-wide digital initiative that will improve the customer experience while providing cost savings as well as the potential for revenue enhancements. Also, we have a rigorous focus on in-force, renewal and new business pricing across all the businesses. Importantly, both are progressing as planned and will support our strong track record of financial success.
Now turning to the business segments, starting with Annuities. Earnings were strong as our high-quality in-force business was further strengthened by equity market performance. We saw good sales momentum in our variable annuity business as sales grew sequentially for the second straight quarter. Importantly, growth also accelerated, increasing 11% in the second quarter compared to 4% in the first quarter. VA sales without living benefits increased sequentially and year-over-year as the value propositions for tax deferral and legacy planning are resonating with customers. VA sales with guaranteed living benefits also increased sequentially, benefiting from product enhancements made earlier in the year. Our portfolio of customer solutions once again expanded late in the second quarter with the addition of a new living benefit rider, which offers customers a higher withdrawal rate than most guaranteed income products, but adjusts if the account value is depleted, providing attractive features for both customers and Lincoln. So while in the early stages, sales momentum is growing in our variable annuity business as product portfolio expansion enables us to take market share now while fee-based products such as core income, will build over time and help support long-term growth.
Shifting to fixed annuities. Sales in the quarter were affected by the decline in interest rates because our approach to product pricing remains disciplined. However, similar to the variable of annuity strategies, we are actively looking for ways to expand our customer base and distribution reach. We recently entered into a reinsurance agreement with Athene that will improve our value proposition by leveraging each other's competitive advantages. We expect this transaction to affect sales immediately and grow over time driven by better penetration into the bank and broker-dealer channels. Furthermore, I see this relationship as another example of Lincoln's distribution franchise and broad product portfolio being in demand.
Before moving into Retirement Plan Services, I want to highlight that Barron's recently published its list of the 50 best annuities and Lincoln was recognized in 6 categories more than any other carrier. This speaks to the breadth of our commission and fee-based annuity product offerings and the valuable solutions provided to our customers. When combined with leading distribution capabilities, we are in a strong position in the marketplace and are optimistic that sales momentum will continue.
In Retirement Plan Services, the strategy and franchise continue to drive positive results as this quarter marked a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in deposits, net flows and earnings. Total deposits in the quarter of $2 billion were up 19% from a year ago, driven by first year sales increasing 71% to $737 million as both small and mid-large markets delivered strong results, while recurring deposits continued to increase. Net flows totaled $395 million compared to $4 million in the prior year quarter. Over the past 12 months, flows have reached nearly $1 billion and have been positive for 6 straight quarters.
Our momentum is being driven by the following. Sales growth is benefiting from product enhancements that focused on simple and transparent pricing, this, combined with a more tenured wholesaling force, is increasing productivity. Next, employee contributions are growing, driven by an improved customer experience that combines face-to-face service with digital and data analytics that motivate and empower them to save more for retirement. 
Lastly, retention remains strong as a result of better aligning and expanding client-facing teams along with continuous improvement in our service center. Bottom line, we remain confident in growth opportunities for RPS business, and our strategy positions us well to sustain earnings growth.
Turning to Life Insurance. Earnings increased double digits, helped by solid variable investment income and growth of our in-force business. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $197 million were strong, up 14% from the prior year, benefiting from a broad product portfolio and industry-leading distribution. MoneyGuard sales were exceptionally strong, driven by our leadership position in the fast-growing linked-benefit marketplace and a multichannel distribution approach. 
Sales did accelerate somewhat ahead of pricing adjustments made during the quarter. As a result, MoneyGuard sales in subsequent periods are likely to be more consistent with prior quarters. VUL sales increased 22%, benefiting from a shift away from interest rate sensitive Life Insurance products, which have seen significant price increases. To this point, GUL sales were down nearly 50% in the quarter and represented just 6% of total Life sales.
Lastly on term insurance. Sales were down 7%, though policy count was up 18% as we leverage digital technology to expand distribution and reach a new customer base through TermAccel, which targets a younger demographic. We continue to focus on sales diversification, risk management and disciplined product pricing to achieve appropriate returns on capital. This resulted in expected new business returns being near the top end of our targeted range of 12% to 15%. Given product breadth, strength of distribution and ability to effectively meet the needs of key consumer segments, I'm excited about future growth in the Life business.
Turning to Group Protection, earnings increased significantly over the prior year period as loss ratios were favorable. After seeing year-over-year premium growth for the first time in nearly 3 years last quarter, premiums grew 3% in the second quarter. During the quarter, sales increased 24%, driven by growth in all product lines. Year-to-date, sales have increased 12% and block persistency is up about 4 percentage points compared to the prior year. Importantly, our outlook for these key premium growth drivers remain positive as the sales pipeline and quote activity are strong in our target markets and persistency continues to improve in core life and disability products.
Bottom line, we are very pleased with this quarter's results and increases our confidence in achieving and sustaining the 5% to 7% margin target. While volatility can be expected quarter-to-quarter, underlying trends are positive and the top line is improving, all of which support solid future earnings growth.
Shifting to investment results. The alternative investment portfolio had a very good quarter as both private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to a 17% pretax annualized return. In terms of new money, we invested over $2.4 billion in the quarter at an average yield of 4.1%, down a little from the first quarter. Lower treasury rates and tighter spreads were largely offset by the purchases in private placement and commercial mortgage loans that provided a pickup in spread over comparable public fixed income. Overall, the investment portfolio remains very well diversified and of very high quality. The fixed income portfolio yield declined 3 basis points to 4.76% consistent with expectations. It is also worth noting that the spread between our portfolio yield and the new money rate stands at approximately 65 basis points compared to 110 basis points in the prior year quarter, which highlights how spread compression continues to abate.
So in closing, we are very pleased with the quarter, which included strong momentum in both top and bottom line results combined with effective capital management. We remain confident in the ability to drive earnings growth, leveraging attractive growth opportunities, in-force margin improvement and our strong balance sheet. I remain convinced our simple, clear and straightforward business model is underappreciated, particularly relative to the competition, given our track record of financial success and earnings stability. We, therefore, look forward to continuing our solid results and further closing the valuation gap to reward our shareholders.
With that, let me turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported income from operations of $419 million or $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a 19% increase from the prior year. This quarter's results were very strong, highlighted by record normalized EPS. Underlying tren",1069,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $419 million or $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a 19% increase from the prior year. This quarter's results were very strong, highlighted by record normalized EPS. Underlying trends were solid and all 4 businesses posted earnings growth. It is also worth noting that while variable investment income was $0.08 better than long-term experience, this was largely offset by higher variable expenses, mainly driven by strong sales production and earnings during the quarter.
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased 7% in the quarter, driven by an 8% increase in average account values and the positive sales trends Dennis noted. Expense discipline continues to be a good story as net G&A expenses, excluding the variable-related expenses I just noted, were up less than 1%, providing positive operating leverage. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% to nearly $60, an all-time high. Operating ROE was strong at 12.7%. And year-to-date, normalized ROE is 40 basis points above 2016.
Finally, balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $265 million to shareholders or 63% of operating earnings, consistent with guidance for 2017. Net income of $411 million further highlights the strength of the quarter as both credit experience and hedge program performance were excellent, with net income representing 98% of operating earnings consistent with last quarter.
Now I will turn to segment results starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $251 million, up 7% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from a 6% increase in average account values as equity market strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. Total operating revenue increased 9% as every revenue line showed growth compared to the prior year. Return metrics remained strong as ROE came in at 21% and ROA was 77 basis points, both consistent with recent quarters.
Our high-quality book of business continues to differentiate us relative to our competitors and is further enhanced by an extremely successful hedge program, which had solid performance with a $9 million gain in the quarter. The quality of the variable annuity book can be seen by looking at net amount of risk, which further improved during the quarter to less than 0.7% of account value for both living and death benefits. So great quarter for the annuity business, which positions us well for strong earnings and returns to continue.
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings of $37 million were up 19% from the prior year quarter. The earnings increase is attributable to growth in fee income and variable investment income combined with expense management. Positive net flows of $994 million over the trailing 12 months and favorable equity markets resulted in a 12% increase in average account values, while end-of-period balances reached a record $63 billion. 
Operating revenue grew 7% compared to the prior year, while G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, increased just 3%, resulting in an approximate 100 basis point decrease in the expense ratio. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 12 basis points versus the prior year, consistent with expectations. For the quarter, ROA remains stable at 24 basis points. So a strong result for the retirement business, highlighted by the highest quarter of net flows in nearly a decade and continued momentum with back-to-back quarters of double-digit growth in deposits, net flows, assets and earnings.
Turning to the Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $133 million were up 11% from the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to 8% growth in operating revenues. Earnings drivers remain solid in the quarter with Life Insurance in-force up 4% and average account values up 6%. Revenues were up more than driver growth, driven by the stronger variable investment income I noted up front. Mortality experience was consistent with expectations as better-than-expected frequency was offset by slightly higher severity.
G&A expenses and commissions were somewhat elevated this quarter, primarily due to strong sales production. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 7 basis points year-over-year, consistent with expectations. So a solid quarter for the Life business. With mortality typically more favorable in the second half of the year and steady driver growth in the mid-single-digit range, we are well positioned for near- and long-term earnings growth in the Life business.
Group Protection earned $35 million compared to $15 million in the prior year quarter. The significant increase in earnings was primarily due to favorable risk experience. The nonmedical loss ratio was 66.1% in the quarter, a 640 basis point improvement compared to the prior year as loss ratios were favorable across all product lines. While we wouldn't regularly expect loss ratios to be this strong, this quarter's result clearly speaks to successfully repricing our book of business and continued underwriting discipline on renewals and the new business.
DAC amortization returned to more normal levels in the quarter as expected. The reemergence of premium growth is also aiding our group business with premiums up 3% from the prior year quarter and leading indicators such as sales and persistency, trending in a positive direction. Bottom line, it was a very strong quarter for group with a reported margin of 7%. We remain confident that annual margin improvement will continue working towards consistently achieving a 5% to 7% margin.
Before moving to Q&A, let me briefly comment on a few other items of note. First, on capital. Both capital and capital generation remain strong, providing significant financial flexibility and an ability to commit capital to new business opportunities, which drive long-term earnings growth and also return capital to shareholders. As I noted upfront, this quarter, we returned $265 million, including $200 million in share repurchases, with the remainder through shareholder dividends. Statutory surplus stands at nearly $9 billion, and I estimate the RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 495%. Holding company cash came in above our $500 million target. 
So wrapping things up, another excellent quarter for Lincoln, strong earnings highlighted by record normalized EPS, high-quality results as all 4 businesses delivered revenue and earnings growth while net income represented 98% of operating earnings. Other key shareholder metrics were also strong with book value per share up 9% and an ROE of 12.7%. Finally, capital generation and deployment remain important and consistent parts of our story.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

I think as you look forward and you look at the underlying drivers of the business, we wouldn't expect that 66% or 66.1% is the long-term loss ratio for this business, so that may move up a little bit. But on the other hand, as premiums start to grow, we would expect that the expense ratio would come down a little bit.

I'm not going to front run this process. I say that every year. In fact, I would imagine, if I looked out on my calendar, I would start to see the meetings associated with the DAC unlocking occurring a few weeks from now. So I've had 0 meetings. But there are some informational points that I'm going to bring into those meetings really around the environment that this year's unlocking will occur in. So when I think about the major assumptions that have really driven results in the past, I'd start with the interest rate environment. And when we set our assumption last year, we set an assumption that assumed that interest rates would increase over time. And if you look at what's happened over the last year, underlying treasuries are up probably about 60 basis points from where they were at 9/30 of last year, while spreads have come in a little bit. But net-net, rates have increased in line with our assumption we set last year. So that's not the final answer. But at least environmentally, I know things have moved somewhat how we thought they would last year. When I think about mortality, we set an assumption last year. And if I think about our discussions over the past year, mortality has largely performed in line with our expectations. So once again, environmentally, there isn't anything that I'm going to go into those meetings worried about. And lastly, I'd point out that when you think about the other big drivers, especially on the VA side, you're talking about policyholder behavior. And as we've talked about, there haven't been any big changes in policyholder behavior relative to the experience we've had over many, many years. So I'm -- we'll come up to a series of meetings with an understanding that the environment that the unlocking we'll exist in seems to be pretty good."

But if we were to continue to see VA sales continue to pick up, how should we think about the pace of buyback in the balance of the year?"

Good morning, everyone. 2017 continues to be an outstanding year as third quarter operating earnings and earnings per share were a record.

Good morning, everyone. 2017 continues to be an outstanding year as third quarter operating earnings and earnings per share were a record. 
Operating EPS increased 7% compared to the prior year and marked the first time quarterly EPS has exceeded $2 per share. Book value per share increased 8% and ROE was 13.6%. 
As you know, during the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review, which had a small impact on our financials. Randy will provide you more detail in his remarks.
This quarter's strong earnings were broad-based, as all 4 businesses posted high-quality results. Group Protection and Life Insurance at strong underwriting results, while annuity and Retirement Plan Services benefited from record account values. 
Variable investment income, which has been higher than expected in recent quarters, returned to more historical levels, further highlighting the underlying strength of earnings.
These excellent results are supported by solid execution of strategies we implemented a few years back to further diversify our sales mix and source of earnings. This diversification provides stability during periods of capital market uncertainty, while still enabling us to capitalize on significant long-term growth opportunities and capital market tailwinds.
One can measure the success we're having with these strategies as the contribution for mortality and morbidity sources of earnings has increased a couple of percentage points year-to-date. The impact of low interest rates on spread-based business continues to abate, and earnings related to fees on AUM are benefiting from the strength in equity markets.
The complementary nature of our businesses and source of earnings also enable us to consistently generate a significant amount of free cash flow supporting active capital management, which includes $264 million returned to shareholders in the quarter. 
Additionally, last night, we announced a 14% increase in the common stock dividend. We will continue to look for opportunities to leverage the strength, the balance sheet and our steady capital generation.
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. Results were strong as earnings are benefiting from our high-quality and predictable in-force business, combined with equity market tailwinds. 
Let me remind you, for years, we have demonstrated our annuity book of business is one of the best in the industry, highlighted by returns in excess of 20% and extremely favorable risk metrics.
Shifting to sales. We remain encouraged about our ability to grow. Variable annuity sales increased modestly compared to the prior year and marks the first year-over-year growth in over 3 years. Compared to the second quarter, sales decreased slightly, consistent with historical seasonality.
However, sales picked up post summer and continue to be quite strong in October. Audit expansion is a key focus for the annuity business, and we now have the broadest portfolio of customer solutions we have ever had. 
This has resulted in market share gains over the course of the year, as we are benefiting from products that provide more investment choice and flexibility, along with fee-based compensation options. 
To these points, Max 6 Select, a living benefit we introduced late in the second quarter, has added nearly $50 million to sales and is continuing to gain traction. While fee-based sales totaled $79 million in the quarter, nearly matching all of 2016.
VA sales without living benefits increased 23% year-over-year as the value propositions for tax deferral and legacy planning continue to resonate with consumers. 
Fixed annuity sales increased 2% sequentially through improved competitive positioning and distribution reach due in part of the reinsurance arrangement with Athene. These benefits more than offset the effect of low interest rates throughout most of the quarter.
So a strong quarter for the annuity business, and I am encouraged by year-over-year growth in VA sales and solid momentum in the past couple months. We clearly have more work to do to get back to positive net flows, but we remain confident in our ability to further build sales in the near term.
Longer term, the value proposition of guaranteed lifetime income remains extremely important and investable retirement assets are projected to grow considerably, creating significant opportunities for the annuity marketplace.
In Retirement Plan Services, the strategy and franchise continues to drive top and bottom line growth. Total deposits in the quarter of $1.9 billion were up 6% from a year ago, driven by first year sales increasing 11% to $672 million as both small and mid- to large markets delivered strong results while recurring deposits increased 4%. 
Net flows totaled $450 million compared to $97 million in the prior year quarter. Over the past 12 months, flows have exceeded $1.3 billion, a record for the retirement business.
Positive net flows for 7 straight quarters are being driven by momentum in all 3 components of flows. First, sales are benefiting from the combination of a more productive wholesaling force and improved competitiveness in the marketplace, a result of product enhancement and digital innovations. 
Next, employee contributions have shown steady growth as our high-touch, high-tech model is providing an improved customer experience. That is resulting in more employees participating and higher contribution rates. 
Lastly, retention remains strong as our expanded client-facing teams continue to drive better participant outcomes. Bottom line, I am as optimistic as I have ever been about the RPS business because of strong execution and competitive positioning in the marketplace with product and distribution.
Turning to Life Insurance. Earnings decreased from the impact of our annual assumption review and lower variable investment income, while driver growth remained strong. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $178 million were down 8% as the prior year benefited from strong sales ahead of pricing adjustments on the interest rate-sensitive products. 
To this point, GUL sales were down 63% in the quarter. Excluding GUL, total life sales were largely unchanged.
With the pricing changes, returns on new business actually exceeded our 12% to 15% targeted returns. For the full year, sales had increased 10% with the same strong returns as we are benefiting from a broad product portfolio and industry-leading distribution. 
MoneyGuard sales were solid, up 16% this quarter and returned to levels more consistent with prior periods after sales accelerated in the second quarter ahead of pricing adjustments. 
On term insurance, sales were near last year's record quarter and policy count increased 7% as we leverage digital technology to expand distribution and reach a new customer base through TermAccel, which targets a younger demographic.
We continue to focus on sales diversification, risk management, growth and appropriate returns on capital. With new business returns above the top end of our targeted range, a well-diversified product portfolio and a more favorable macro backdrop, we see opportunities to improve our competitive position, while maintaining targeted returns. Bottom line, the life business is well positioned in the marketplace.
Turning to Group Protections. Earnings increased significantly over the prior year, driven by favorable loss ratios. Premiums grew 3% in the quarter as sales and persistency continue to improve. 
During the quarter, sales increased 21% as all product lines in both employer and employee-paid sales grew. Year-to-date, sales had increased 15%, and we have good momentum entering the fourth quarter, which is historically our largest production quarter as the pipeline and quote activity are strong in our target markets.
We are also encouraged by persistency trends, which are up 4 percentage points compared to prior year, driven by stronger renewal trends in core life and disability products. 
As you know, we established a target of achieving 5% to 7% margins in 2018. Given results year-to-date, we now expect we will reach the target this year. While volatility is expected quarter-to-quarter, the focus is now on sustaining and improving margins over time. 
The strong, positive momentum in group results over the last several quarters validates our continuing strategic investment in this business, which offers very good growth and earning diversification opportunities for Lincoln.
Shifting to investment results. The alternative investment portfolio achieved an 11% pretax annualized return with solid results from both the private equity and hedge fund portfolios. 
During the quarter, we invested new money at an average yield of 4% compared to 4.1% in the second quarter. The decline is primarily driven by tighter spreads and increased purchases of shorter duration investments, which match our liabilities and reflects Lincoln's tilt away from products with long-term guarantees.
The fixed income portfolio yield declined 3 basis points to 4.73%, consistent with expectations. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in extremely good shape, high-quality and broadly diversified. Below investment-grade assets represent only 4% of the fixed income portfolio, down 1 percentage point from the prior year quarter, largely due to maturities.
So in closing, I'm very pleased with results year-to-date, including this quarter's record earnings. As I look forward, I remain confident that our strategic objectives and initiatives will drive long-term sustainable growth.
As you know, and Chris mentioned, on November 16th, we'll be holding our Investor Day, and we look forward to providing you even more insight into our business and the key drivers that will enable us to sustain our strong track record of financial success and stability.
With that, let me turn the call over to Randy."
867423,538210948,1329571,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $454 million or $2.03 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS decreased 6% year-over-year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.09",1249,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $454 million or $2.03 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS decreased 6% year-over-year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.09 from tax adjustments. This year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions have a series of pluses and minuses that netted to a negative $0.01 impact to EPS. 
Separate from the annual review, the Group Protection business benefited $0.01 from a reinsurance recapture.
A few comments on the outcome of this year's review. annuity earnings benefited $15 million, primarily from favorable policyholder behavior assumptions. Earnings in the Life Insurance business were negatively affected by $16 million, with no one item standing out. 
It's also worth noting that we did not change our long-term road rate assumption or unlock the reversion to the mean quarter, which still provides a cushion against declines in the equity markets.
From a bottom line with the annual DAC and reserve review is that when viewed in total, the assumptions underlying our balance sheet continue to be sound.
One other item of note before shifting to key performance metrics. As Dennis noted, variable investment income return to more normal levels coming in $4 million or $0.02 per share ahead of our expectations. This compares to $18 million or $0.08 per share last year.
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 8% to over $61, an all-time high. Normalized ROE was strong at 13% and the year-to-date ROE of 12.6% is 60 basis points above 2016. 
Consolidated net flows were positive and end-of-period account values reached a record $246 billion.
Balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $264 million to shareholders in the quarter. 
Lastly, net income of $418 million further highlights the strength of the quarter. As MPR, which is noneconomic, had the largest below-the-line impact. Year-to-date net income represents 96% of operating earnings.
Now we will turn to segment results, starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $277 million, up 5% from last year when excluding notable items in both periods. 
Net favorable items this quarter included a $15 million I noted upfront. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from a 6% increase in average account values, as equity markets strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. 
The quality of our variable annuity book can be seen by looking at return metrics and net amount at risk. Normalized returns remain strong as ROE came in at 21%, while ROA was 79 basis points, both consistent with recent quarters.
Net amount at risk improve to less than 6/10 of 1% of account value for both living and death benefits. So minimal financial impacts from assumption changes, a superior risk profile of net amount at risk well below competitors and strong and consistent returns continue to differentiate us in the marketplace and highlight our prudent and disciplined approach to the annuity business.
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $35 million compared to $32 million in the prior year quarter. Both periods included modest impacts from our annual assumption review. 
Excluding these items, earnings increased 6%, primarily due to growth in fee income from higher account values and expense management.
Positive net flows of $1.3 billion over the trailing 12 months combined with favorable equity markets drove average account values to $64 billion, a 13% increase. Revenues increased 3% while SG&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, were flat year-over-year. 
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 13 basis points year-to-date compared to last year, consistent with expectations.
For the quarter, ROA was 23 basis points, excluding notable items, in line with recent quarters. The retirement business continues to deliver solid growth in deposits, net flows and assets. And combined with good expense discipline, RPS is well positioned for future earnings growth.
Turning to the Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $121 million included net unfavorable items of $16 million related to our annual review. Excluding notable items, earnings decreased 9% as the prior year quarter benefited from strong variable investment income. 
Mortality experience was favorable consistent with typical third quarter seasonality. Earnings drivers remain solid in the quarter with Life Insurance in-force up 4% and average account values up 6%.
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 8 basis points year-to-date compared to last year, in line with expectations. So a solid quarter for the Life business as mortality was right in line with expectations, and the financial impacts from the annual assumption review were modest. 
Strong sales results year-to-date and steady driver growth continue to support earnings momentum.
Group Protection reported $41 million in earnings compared to $28 million in the prior year quarter. The significant increase in earnings was primarily due to favorable risk experience. 
A $3 million benefit from the recapture of previously reinsured business was included in the quarter's results. The prior year quarter included net favorable items of $5 million, primarily from a disability reserve refinement. 
The strong risk results experienced in the second quarter carried into the third quarter. The nonmedical loss ratio was 63.7% in the quarter, a 650 basis point improvement from the prior year, excluding the disability reserve refinement.
Favorable disability and group life incidents rates combined with lower new claim severity remain the primary drivers of favorable loss ratios. While we wouldn't expect loss ratios to consistently be this strong, results clearly reflect underwriting discipline coupled with positive external economic factors. 
Premium growth is also aiding the group business as premiums increased to 3% from the prior year quarter with leading indicators, such as sales and persistency trending in a positive direction. 
Bottom line, it was another very strong quarter for group with year-to-date margins now exceeding the lower end of our 5% to 7% target range. While volatility is expected quarter-to-quarter, we now expect margins to be consistently within our target range on a year-to-year basis with gradual improvement over time.
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. First, in capital, both capital and capital generation remain strong, providing significant financial flexibility and an ability to commit capital to drive long-term earnings growth and also return capital to shareholders.
As I noted upfront, this quarter, we returned $264 million, including $200 million in share repurchases with the remainder through shareholder dividends. 
We expect to remain active allocators of capital, an example of this can be seen by the announcement of a 14% increase in our shareholder dividend, which is consistent with our strong earnings growth.
As we have noted in the past, we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend. Statutory surplus stands at over $9 billion and estimate the RBC ratio end of the quarter at approximately 495%. Holding company cash remains above our $500 million target.
So to conclude, another excellent quarter for Lincoln. We reported record operating earnings and EPS, underwriting results and Group Protection and Life Insurance were strong, while annuity and Retirement Plan Services benefited from record account values. 
This year's annual review was once again confirm the quality of the assumptions underlying our balance sheet as there was almost no impact on our operating earnings.
We grew book value per share by 8% as below-the-line impacts were modest and normalized ROE was 13%, which supports another year of ROE expansion. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

And remind all of us, I guess, blindly obvious, which is that we're in the early stages of tax reform and it is going to change as it moves forward through the legislative process. So with this in mind, I just make a couple of industry comments. The first one is that the industry already pays a little bit more than it earns as a percent of corporate profit. So roughly speaking for Life Insurance industry, share of all U.S. corporate profits is like 1.8%. Yet our share of corporate income tax is more in the neighborhood of 2.2% or 2.3%. So going into all of this legislative process, we're pretty well positioned and not being at under taxed industry. I also will say that the industry view is that if there is any reduction in expenses or tax items that sort of go along with rate reductions, our industry -- view for our industry is they should be spread across the major areas rather than a single item, so no business model is disproportionately helped or hurt. And so there's so much change that's going on -- or excuse me, so much potential for different outcomes that I think we should just wait until we have a little more confidence before commenting on any specific issue related to tax."

However, that $10 million was to go away, then you have tax step up in basis. And that could actually provide an opportunity for life sales. So a lot of moving parts, a lot of different outcomes.

I think your question was specific to Annuities and retirement and the answer is different for those. In the annuity business, we feel very comfortable in our ability to manage credit rates consistent with changes in earned rates, a significant percentage of our policy still have room to do in the current creditor rate and the guarantee. So we feel very comfortable, and you've seen that over the last few quarters. On the retirement business, and this has been the case for sometime now, our rates are pretty close to the guarantees. And so as the credit of rates movements down, you see more of a function of the fact that the new business or been bringing on comes on at a lower rate as opposed to just managing the credits rates. And that's why in that business, we expect over the near term, I know spread compression in the 10 to 15 basis point range. As I mentioned, year-to-date, we grew -- down 13 basis points in the retirement business. So the answer is different for those 2 businesses."

Good morning, everyone. 2017 continues to be an outstanding year as third quarter operating earnings and earnings per share were a record.Operating EPS increased 7% compared to the prior year and marked the first time quarterly EPS has",1524,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. 2017 continues to be an outstanding year as third quarter operating earnings and earnings per share were a record.
Operating EPS increased 7% compared to the prior year and marked the first time quarterly EPS has exceeded $2 per share. Book value per share increased 8% and ROE was 13.6%. 
As you know, during the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review, which had a small impact on our financials. Randy will provide you more detail in his remarks.
This quarter's strong earnings were broad based, as all 4 businesses posted high-quality results. Group Protection and Life Insurance had strong underwriting results, while Annuity and Retirement Plan Services benefited from record account values. 
Variable investment income, which has been higher than expected in recent quarters, returned to more historical levels, further highlighting the underlying strength of earnings.
These excellent results are supported by solid execution of strategies we implemented a few years back to further diversify our sales mix and source of earnings. This diversification provides stability during periods of capital market uncertainty, while still enabling us to capitalize on significant long-term growth opportunities and capital market tailwinds.
One can measure the success we're having with these strategies as the contribution for mortality and morbidity sources of earnings has increased a couple of percentage points year-to-date. The impact of low interest rates on spread-based business continues to abate, and earnings related to fees on AUM are benefiting from the strength in equity markets.
The complementary nature of our businesses and source of earnings also enable us to consistently generate a significant amount of free cash flow supporting active capital management, which includes $264 million returned to shareholders in the quarter. 
Additionally, last night, we announced a 14% increase in the common stock dividend. We will continue to look for opportunities to leverage the strength of the balance sheet and our steady capital generation.
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. Results were strong as earnings are benefiting from our high-quality and predictable in-force business, combined with equity market tailwinds. 
Let me remind you, for years, we have demonstrated our annuity book of business is one of the best in the industry, highlighted by returns in excess of 20% and extremely favorable risk metrics.
Shifting to sales. We remain encouraged about our ability to grow. Variable annuity sales increased modestly compared to the prior year and marks the first year-over-year growth in over 3 years. Compared to the second quarter, sales decreased slightly, consistent with historical seasonality.
However, sales picked up post summer and continued to be quite strong in October. Product expansion is a key focus for the Annuity business, and we now have the broadest portfolio of customer solutions we have ever had. This has resulted in market share gains over the course of the year, as we are benefiting from products that provide more investment choice and flexibility, along with fee-based compensation options. 
To these points, Max 6 Select, a living benefit rider we introduced late in the second quarter, has added nearly $50 million to sales and is continuing to gain traction, while fee-based sales totaled $79 million in the quarter, nearly matching all of 2016.
VA sales without living benefits increased 23% year-over-year as the value propositions for tax deferral and legacy planning continue to resonate with consumers. 
Fixed annuity sales increased 2% sequentially through improved competitive positioning and distribution reach due in part to reinsurance arrangement with Athene. These benefits more than offset the effect of low interest rates throughout most of the quarter.
So a strong quarter for the Annuity business, and I am encouraged by year-over-year growth in VA sales and solid momentum in the past couple of months. We clearly have more work to do to get back to positive net flows, but we remain confident in our ability to further build sales in the near term.
Longer term, the value proposition of guaranteed lifetime income remains extremely important and investable retirement assets are projected to grow considerably, creating significant opportunities for the annuity marketplace.
In Retirement Plan Services, the strategy and franchise continues to drive top and bottom line growth. Total deposits in the quarter of $1.9 billion were up 6% from a year ago, driven by first year sales increasing 11% to $672 million as both small and mid- to large markets delivered strong results while recurring deposits increased 4%. 
Net flows totaled $450 million compared to $97 million in the prior year quarter. Over the past 12 months, flows have exceeded $1.3 billion, a record for the retirement business.
Positive net flows for 7 straight quarters are being driven by momentum in all 3 components of flows. First, sales are benefiting from the combination of a more productive wholesaling force and improved competitiveness in the marketplace, a result of product enhancement and digital innovations. Next, employee contributions have shown steady growth as our high-touch, high-tech model is providing an improved customer experience, that is resulting in more employees participating and higher contribution rates. 
Lastly, retention remains strong as our expanded client-facing teams continue to drive better participant outcomes. Bottom line, I am as optimistic as I have ever been about the RPS business because of strong execution and competitive positioning in the marketplace with product and distribution.
Turning to Life Insurance. Earnings decreased from the impact of our annual assumption review and lower variable investment income, while driver growth remained strong. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $178 million were down 8%, as the prior year benefited from strong sales ahead of pricing adjustments on the interest rate-sensitive products. To this point, GUL sales were down 63% in the quarter. Excluding GUL, total life sales were largely unchanged.
With the pricing changes, returns on new business actually exceeded our 12% to 15% targeted returns. For the full year, sales have increased 10% with the same strong returns as we're benefiting from a broad product portfolio and industry-leading distribution. 
MoneyGuard sales were solid, up 16% this quarter and returned to levels more consistent with prior periods after sales accelerated in the second quarter ahead of pricing adjustments. 
On term insurance, sales were near last year's record quarter and policy count increased 7% as we leverage digital technology to expand distribution and reach a new customer base through TermAccel, which targets a younger demographic.
We continue to focus on sales diversification, risk management, growth and appropriate returns on capital. With new business returns above the top end of our targeted range, a well-diversified product portfolio and a more favorable macro backdrop, we see opportunities to improve our competitive position while maintaining target returns. Bottom line, the life business is well positioned in the marketplace.
Turning to Group Protections. Earnings increased significantly over the prior year, driven by favorable loss ratios. Premiums grew 3% in the quarter as sales and persistency continued to improve. 
During the quarter, sales increased 21% as all product lines in both employer and employee-paid sales grew. Year-to-date, sales had increased 15%, and we have good momentum entering the fourth quarter, which is historically our largest production quarter, as the pipeline and quote activity are strong in our target markets.
We are also encouraged by persistency trends, which are up 4 percentage points compared to prior year, driven by stronger renewal trends in core life and disability products. 
As you know, we established a target of achieving 5% to 7% margins in 2018. Given results year-to-date, we now expect we will reach the target this year. While volatility is expected quarter-to-quarter, the focus is now on sustaining and improving margins, over time. 
The strong, positive momentum in group results over the last several quarters validates our continuing strategic investment in this business, which offers very good growth and earning diversification opportunities for Lincoln.
Shifting to investment results. The alternative investment portfolio achieved an 11% pretax annualized return with solid results from both the private equity and hedge fund portfolios. 
During the quarter, we invested new money at an average yield of 4% compared to 4.1% in the second quarter. The decline is primarily driven by tighter spreads and increased purchases of shorter-duration investments, which match our liabilities and reflects Lincoln's tilt away from products with long-term guarantees.
The fixed income portfolio yield declined 3 basis points to 4.73%, consistent with expectations. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in extremely good shape, high quality and broadly diversified. Below investment-grade assets represent only 4% of the fixed income portfolio, down 1 percentage point from the prior year quarter, largely due to maturities.
So in closing, I'm very pleased with results year-to-date, including this quarter's record earnings. As I look forward, I remain confident that our strategic objectives and initiatives will drive long-term sustainable growth.
As you know, and Chris mentioned, on November 16, we'll be holding our Investment -- Investor Day, and we look forward to providing you even more insight into our business and the key drivers that will enable us to sustain our strong track record of financial success and stability.
With that, let me turn the call over to Randy."
867423,538210948,1329856,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $454 million or $2.03 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 6% year-over-year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.09",1246,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $454 million or $2.03 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 6% year-over-year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.09 from tax adjustments. This year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions had a series of pluses and minuses that netted to a negative $0.01 impact to EPS. Separate from the annual review, the Group Protection business benefited $0.01 from a reinsurance recapture.
A few comments on the outcome of this year's review. Annuity earnings benefited $15 million, primarily from favorable policyholder behavior assumptions. Earnings in the Life Insurance business were negatively affected by $16 million, with no one item standing out. 
It is also worth noting that we did not change our long-term earned rate assumption or unlock the reversion to the mean quarter, which still provides a cushion against declines in the equity markets.
So the bottom line with the annual DAC and reserve review is that when viewed in total, the assumptions underlying our balance sheet continue to be sound.
One other item of note before shifting to key performance metrics. As Dennis noted, variable investment income returned to more normal levels, coming in $4 million or $0.02 per share ahead of our expectations. This compares to $18 million or $0.08 per share last year.
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 8% to over $61, an all-time high. Normalized ROE was strong at 13% and the year-to-date ROE of 12.6% is 60 basis points above 2016. Consolidated net flows were positive and end-of-period account values reached a record $246 billion.
Balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $264 million to shareholders in the quarter. 
Lastly, net income of $418 million further highlights the strength of the quarter, as MPR, which is noneconomic, had the largest below-the-line impact. Year-to-date net income represents 96% of operating earnings.
Now we'll turn to segment results, starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $277 million, up 5% from last year when excluding notable items in both periods. 
Net favorable items this quarter included the $15 million I noted upfront. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from a 6% increase in average account values, as equity markets strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. 
The quality of our variable annuity book can be seen by looking at return metrics and net amount at risk. Normalized returns remained strong as ROE came in at 21%, while ROA was 79 basis points, both consistent with recent quarters.
Net amount at risky improved to less than 0.6% of account value for both living and death benefits. So minimal financial impacts from assumption changes, a superior risk profile of net amount at risk well below competitors and strong and consistent returns continue to differentiate us in the marketplace and highlight our prudent and disciplined approach to the annuity business.
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $35 million compared to $32 million in the prior year quarter. Both periods included modest impacts from our annual assumption review. Excluding these items, earnings increased 6%, primarily due to growth in fee income from higher account values and expense management.
Positive net flows of $1.3 billion over the trailing 12 months, combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values to $64 billion, a 13% increase. Revenues increased 3%, while G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized were flat year-over-year. 
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 13 basis points year-to-date compared to last year, consistent with expectations.
For the quarter, ROA was 23 basis points, excluding notable items, in line with recent quarters. The retirement business continues to deliver solid growth in deposits, net flows and assets. And combined with good expense discipline, RPS is well positioned for future earnings growth.
Turning to the Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $121 million included net unfavorable items of $16 million related to our annual review. Excluding notable items, earnings decreased 9% as the prior year quarter benefited from strong variable investment income. 
Mortality experience was favorable, consistent with typical third quarter seasonality. Earnings drivers remained solid in the quarter, with Life Insurance in-force up 4% and average account values up 6%.
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 8 basis points year-to-date compared to last year, in line with expectations. So a solid quarter for the Life business as mortality was right in line with expectations, and the financial impacts from the annual assumption review were modest. Strong sales results year-to-date and steady driver growth continue to support earnings momentum.
Group Protection reported $41 million in earnings compared to $28 million in the prior year quarter. The significant increase in earnings was primarily due to favorable risk experience. A $3 million benefit from the recapture of previously reinsured business was included in the quarter's results. The prior year quarter included net favorable items of $5 million, primarily from a disability reserve refinement. 
The strong risk results experienced in the second quarter carried into the third quarter. The nonmedical loss ratio was 63.7% in the quarter, a 650 basis point improvement from the prior year, excluding the disability reserve refinement.
Favorable disability and group life incidents rates, combined with lower new claim severity, remain the primary drivers of favorable loss ratios. While we wouldn't expect loss ratios to consistently be this strong, results clearly reflect underwriting discipline, coupled with positive external economic factors. 
Premium growth is also aiding the group business as premiums increased 3% from the prior year quarter, with leading indicators, such as sales and persistency, trending in a positive direction. 
Bottom line, it was another very strong quarter for group, with year-to-date margins now exceeding the lower end of our 5% to 7% target range. While volatility is expected quarter-to-quarter, we now expect margins to be consistently within our target range on a year-to-year basis, with gradual improvement over time.
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. First, on capital. Both capital and capital generation remained strong, providing significant financial flexibility and an ability to commit capital to drive long-term earnings growth and also return capital to shareholders.
As I noted upfront, this quarter, we returned $264 million, including $200 million others in share repurchases, with the remainder through shareholder dividends. 
We expect to remain active allocators of capital. An example of this can be seen by the announcement of a 14% increase in our shareholder dividend, which is consistent with our strong earnings growth.
As we have noted in the past, we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend. Statutory surplus stands at over $9 billion and estimate the RBC ratio end of the quarter at approximately 495%. Holding company cash remains above our $500 million target.
So to conclude, another excellent quarter for Lincoln. We reported record operating earnings and EPS, underwriting results in Group Protection and Life Insurance were strong, while Annuity and Retirement Plan Services benefited from record account values. 
This year's annual review once again confirmed the quality of the assumptions underlying our balance sheet as there was almost no impact on our operating earnings.
We grew book value per share by 8% as below-the-line impacts were modest and normalized ROE was 13%, which supports another year of ROE expansion. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

But clearly, additionally, the economy, we believe, is having some impact. Items like consumer confidence, which I believe is at a 17-year high, items like below unemployment rate, which is at 4.2% is clearly the lowest it's been in sometime. Those items are clearly having some favorable impact. As you can see during the quarter, we ended up a little bit about our target range.

So with this in mind, I just have made a couple of industry comments. The first one is that the industry already pays a little bit more than it earns as a percent of corporate profit. So roughly speaking, for Life Insurance industry, share of all U.S. corporate profits is like 1.8%, yet our share of corporate income tax is more in the neighborhood of 2.2% or 2.3%. So going into all of this legislative process, we're pretty well positioned in not being at an undertaxed industry. I'll also say that the industry view is that if there is any reduction in expenses or tax items that sort of go along with rate reductions, our industry view for our industry is they should be spread across the major areas rather than a single item, so no business model is disproportionately helped or hurt. And so there's so much change that's going on -- or excuse me, so much potential for different outcomes that I think we should just wait until we have a little more confidence before commenting on any specific issue related to tax."

I think that in general, as I've said before, the approach the NAIC is taking, which is to make statutory reserves more economic in nature is a good thing. It reflects how we reserve for these products and capitalize these products on a GAAP basis. So I think that's a good thing. That doesn't mean there aren't some bad parts about where they end up, but in total, it's a good thing for the industry, it's a good thing for Lincoln. We're participating and we're very happy with the way it's moving along."

I'll look at it. But let me answer the question to the extent that I think about the state tax and Lincoln. Only about 10% to 12% of our sales are estate tax-driven at this point. And so any changes in the estate tax that require more planning or less planning is not, on the negative side, going to hurt us too much and if it requires more planning, that would help. And I'd also point out from life sales, the most important issue, I think -- maybe not most important, but an important issue is this $10 million individual joint exclusion really eliminates estate taxes on a large amount of the American families. However, if that $10 million was to go away, then you have taxes on the step-up in basis. And that could actually provide an opportunity for life sales. So a lot of moving parts, a lot of different outcomes. So let's just see where it goes. But again, I'll come back to, at this moment in time, we don't have significant sales related to estate tax planning. Well, [ $10 million ]..."

In the Annuity business, we feel very comfortable in our ability to manage credit rates consistent with changes in earned rates. A significant percentage of our policy still have room between current credit and rate in the guarantee. So we feel very comfortable, and you've seen that over the last few quarters. On the retirement business, and this has been the case for sometime now, our rates are pretty close to the guarantees. And so as the credit of rate movement's down, you've seen more of a function of the fact that the new business we've been bringing on comes on at a lower rate as opposed to us managing in-force credits rates. And that's why in that business, we expect over the near term, annual spread compression in the 10 to 15 basis point range.

Good morning, everyone. 2017 continues to be an outstanding year as third quarter operating earnings and earnings per share were a record.Operating EPS increased 7% compared to the prior year and marked the first time quarterly EPS has",1524,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. 2017 continues to be an outstanding year as third quarter operating earnings and earnings per share were a record.
Operating EPS increased 7% compared to the prior year and marked the first time quarterly EPS has exceeded $2 per share. Book value per share increased 8% and ROE was 13.6%. 
As you know, during the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review, which had a small impact on our financials. Randy will provide you more detail in his remarks.
This quarter's strong earnings were broad based, as all 4 businesses posted high-quality results. Group Protection and Life Insurance had strong underwriting results, while Annuity and Retirement Plan Services benefited from record account values. 
Variable investment income, which has been higher than expected in recent quarters, returned to more historical levels, further highlighting the underlying strength of earnings.
These excellent results are supported by solid execution of strategies we implemented a few years back to further diversify our sales mix and source of earnings. This diversification provides stability during periods of capital market uncertainty, while still enabling us to capitalize on significant long-term growth opportunities and capital market tailwinds.
One can measure the success we're having with these strategies as the contribution for mortality and morbidity sources of earnings has increased a couple of percentage points year-to-date. The impact of low interest rates on spread-based business continues to abate, and earnings related to fees on AUM are benefiting from the strength in equity markets.
The complementary nature of our businesses and source of earnings also enable us to consistently generate a significant amount of free cash flow supporting active capital management, which includes $264 million returned to shareholders in the quarter. 
Additionally, last night, we announced a 14% increase in the common stock dividend. We will continue to look for opportunities to leverage the strength of the balance sheet and our steady capital generation.
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. Results were strong as earnings are benefiting from our high-quality and predictable in-force business, combined with equity market tailwinds. 
Let me remind you, for years, we have demonstrated our annuity book of business is one of the best in the industry, highlighted by returns in excess of 20% and extremely favorable risk metrics.
Shifting to sales. We remain encouraged about our ability to grow. Variable annuity sales increased modestly compared to the prior year and marks the first year-over-year growth in over 3 years. Compared to the second quarter, sales decreased slightly, consistent with historical seasonality.
However, sales picked up post summer and continued to be quite strong in October. Product expansion is a key focus for the Annuity business, and we now have the broadest portfolio of customer solutions we have ever had. This has resulted in market share gains over the course of the year, as we are benefiting from products that provide more investment choice and flexibility, along with fee-based compensation options. 
To these points, Max 6 Select, a living benefit rider we introduced late in the second quarter, has added nearly $50 million to sales and is continuing to gain traction, while fee-based sales totaled $79 million in the quarter, nearly matching all of 2016.
VA sales without living benefits increased 23% year-over-year as the value propositions for tax deferral and legacy planning continue to resonate with consumers. 
Fixed annuity sales increased 2% sequentially through improved competitive positioning and distribution reach due in part to reinsurance arrangement with Athene. These benefits more than offset the effect of low interest rates throughout most of the quarter.
So a strong quarter for the Annuity business, and I am encouraged by year-over-year growth in VA sales and solid momentum in the past couple of months. We clearly have more work to do to get back to positive net flows, but we remain confident in our ability to further build sales in the near term.
Longer term, the value proposition of guaranteed lifetime income remains extremely important and investable retirement assets are projected to grow considerably, creating significant opportunities for the annuity marketplace.
In Retirement Plan Services, the strategy and franchise continues to drive top and bottom line growth. Total deposits in the quarter of $1.9 billion were up 6% from a year ago, driven by first year sales increasing 11% to $672 million as both small and mid- to large markets delivered strong results while recurring deposits increased 4%. 
Net flows totaled $450 million compared to $97 million in the prior year quarter. Over the past 12 months, flows have exceeded $1.3 billion, a record for the retirement business.
Positive net flows for 7 straight quarters are being driven by momentum in all 3 components of flows. First, sales are benefiting from the combination of a more productive wholesaling force and improved competitiveness in the marketplace, a result of product enhancement and digital innovations. Next, employee contributions have shown steady growth as our high-touch, high-tech model is providing an improved customer experience, that is resulting in more employees participating and higher contribution rates. 
Lastly, retention remains strong as our expanded client-facing teams continue to drive better participant outcomes. Bottom line, I am as optimistic as I have ever been about the RPS business because of strong execution and competitive positioning in the marketplace with product and distribution.
Turning to Life Insurance. Earnings decreased from the impact of our annual assumption review and lower variable investment income, while driver growth remained strong. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $178 million were down 8%, as the prior year benefited from strong sales ahead of pricing adjustments on the interest rate-sensitive products. To this point, GUL sales were down 63% in the quarter. Excluding GUL, total life sales were largely unchanged.
With the pricing changes, returns on new business actually exceeded our 12% to 15% targeted returns. For the full year, sales have increased 10% with the same strong returns as we're benefiting from a broad product portfolio and industry-leading distribution. 
MoneyGuard sales were solid, up 16% this quarter and returned to levels more consistent with prior periods after sales accelerated in the second quarter ahead of pricing adjustments. 
On term insurance, sales were near last year's record quarter and policy count increased 7% as we leverage digital technology to expand distribution and reach a new customer base through TermAccel, which targets a younger demographic.
We continue to focus on sales diversification, risk management, growth and appropriate returns on capital. With new business returns above the top end of our targeted range, a well-diversified product portfolio and a more favorable macro backdrop, we see opportunities to improve our competitive position while maintaining target returns. Bottom line, the life business is well positioned in the marketplace.
Turning to Group Protections. Earnings increased significantly over the prior year, driven by favorable loss ratios. Premiums grew 3% in the quarter as sales and persistency continued to improve. 
During the quarter, sales increased 21% as all product lines in both employer and employee-paid sales grew. Year-to-date, sales had increased 15%, and we have good momentum entering the fourth quarter, which is historically our largest production quarter, as the pipeline and quote activity are strong in our target markets.
We are also encouraged by persistency trends, which are up 4 percentage points compared to prior year, driven by stronger renewal trends in core life and disability products. 
As you know, we established a target of achieving 5% to 7% margins in 2018. Given results year-to-date, we now expect we will reach the target this year. While volatility is expected quarter-to-quarter, the focus is now on sustaining and improving margins, over time. 
The strong, positive momentum in group results over the last several quarters validates our continuing strategic investment in this business, which offers very good growth and earning diversification opportunities for Lincoln.
Shifting to investment results. The alternative investment portfolio achieved an 11% pretax annualized return with solid results from both the private equity and hedge fund portfolios. 
During the quarter, we invested new money at an average yield of 4% compared to 4.1% in the second quarter. The decline is primarily driven by tighter spreads and increased purchases of shorter-duration investments, which match our liabilities and reflects Lincoln's tilt away from products with long-term guarantees.
The fixed income portfolio yield declined 3 basis points to 4.73%, consistent with expectations. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in extremely good shape, high quality and broadly diversified. Below investment-grade assets represent only 4% of the fixed income portfolio, down 1 percentage point from the prior year quarter, largely due to maturities.
So in closing, I'm very pleased with results year-to-date, including this quarter's record earnings. As I look forward, I remain confident that our strategic objectives and initiatives will drive long-term sustainable growth.
As you know, and Chris mentioned, on November 16, we'll be holding our Investment -- Investor Day, and we look forward to providing you even more insight into our business and the key drivers that will enable us to sustain our strong track record of financial success and stability.
With that, let me turn the call over to Randy."
867423,538210948,1330407,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $454 million or $2.03 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 6% year-over-year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.09",1244,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $454 million or $2.03 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 6% year-over-year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.09 from tax adjustments. This year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions had a series of pluses and minuses that netted to a negative $0.01 impact to EPS. Separate from the annual review, the Group Protection business benefited $0.01 from a reinsurance recapture.
A few comments on the outcome of this year's review. Annuity earnings benefited $15 million, primarily from favorable policyholder behavior assumptions. Earnings in the Life Insurance business were negatively affected by $16 million, with no one item standing out. 
It is also worth noting that we did not change our long-term earned rate assumption or unlock the reversion to the mean quarter, which still provides a cushion against declines in the equity markets.
So the bottom line with the annual DAC and reserve review is that when viewed in total, the assumptions underlying our balance sheet continue to be sound.
One other item of note before shifting to key performance metrics. As Dennis noted, variable investment income returned to more normal levels, coming in $4 million or $0.02 per share ahead of our expectations. This compares to $18 million or $0.08 per share last year.
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 8% to over $61, an all-time high. Normalized ROE was strong at 13% and the year-to-date ROE of 12.6% is 60 basis points above 2016. Consolidated net flows were positive and end-of-period account values reached a record $246 billion.
Balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $264 million to shareholders in the quarter. 
Lastly, net income of $418 million further highlights the strength of the quarter, as MPR, which is noneconomic, had the largest below-the-line impact. Year-to-date net income represents 96% of operating earnings.
Now we'll turn to segment results, starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $277 million, up 5% from last year when excluding notable items in both periods. 
Net favorable items this quarter included the $15 million I noted upfront. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from a 6% increase in average account values, as equity markets strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. 
The quality of our variable annuity book can be seen by looking at return metrics and net amount at risk. Normalized returns remained strong as ROE came in at 21%, while ROA was 79 basis points, both consistent with recent quarters.
Net amount at risk improved to less than 0.6% of account value for both living and death benefits. So minimal financial impacts from assumption changes, a superior risk profile of net amount at risk well below competitors and strong and consistent returns continue to differentiate us in the marketplace and highlight our prudent and disciplined approach to the annuity business.
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $35 million compared to $32 million in the prior year quarter. Both periods included modest impacts from our annual assumption review. Excluding these items, earnings increased 6%, primarily due to growth in fee income from higher account values and expense management.
Positive net flows of $1.3 billion over the trailing 12 months, combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values to $64 billion, a 13% increase. Revenues increased 3%, while G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized were flat year-over-year. 
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 13 basis points year-to-date compared to last year, consistent with expectations.
For the quarter, ROA was 23 basis points, excluding notable items, in line with recent quarters. The retirement business continues to deliver solid growth in deposits, net flows and assets. And combined with good expense discipline, RPS is well positioned for future earnings growth.
Turning to the Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $121 million included net unfavorable items of $16 million related to our annual review. Excluding notable items, earnings decreased 9% as the prior year quarter benefited from strong variable investment income. 
Mortality experience was favorable, consistent with typical third quarter seasonality. Earnings drivers remained solid in the quarter, with Life Insurance in-force up 4% and average account values up 6%.
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 8 basis points year-to-date compared to last year, in line with expectations. So a solid quarter for the Life business as mortality was right in line with expectations, and the financial impacts from the annual assumption review were modest. Strong sales results year-to-date and steady driver growth continue to support earnings momentum.
Group Protection reported $41 million in earnings compared to $28 million in the prior year quarter. The significant increase in earnings was primarily due to favorable risk experience. A $3 million benefit from the recapture of previously reinsured business was included in the quarter's results. The prior year quarter included net favorable items of $5 million, primarily from a disability reserve refinement. 
The strong risk results experienced in the second quarter carried into the third quarter. The nonmedical loss ratio was 63.7% in the quarter, a 650 basis point improvement from the prior year, excluding the disability reserve refinement.
Favorable disability and group life incidents rates, combined with lower new claim severity, remain the primary drivers of favorable loss ratios. While we wouldn't expect loss ratios to consistently be this strong, results clearly reflect underwriting discipline, coupled with positive external economic factors. 
Premium growth is also aiding the group business as premiums increased 3% from the prior year quarter, with leading indicators, such as sales and persistency, trending in a positive direction. 
Bottom line, it was another very strong quarter for group, with year-to-date margins now exceeding the lower end of our 5% to 7% target range. While volatility is expected quarter-to-quarter, we now expect margins to be consistently within our target range on a year-to-year basis, with gradual improvement over time.
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. First, on capital. Both capital and capital generation remained strong, providing significant financial flexibility and an ability to commit capital to drive long-term earnings growth and also return capital to shareholders.
As I noted upfront, this quarter, we returned $264 million, including $200 million in share repurchases, with the remainder through shareholder dividends. 
We expect to remain active allocators of capital. An example of this can be seen by the announcement of a 14% increase in our shareholder dividend, which is consistent with our strong earnings growth.
As we have noted in the past, we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend. Statutory surplus stands at over $9 billion and estimate the RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 495%. Holding company cash remains above our $500 million target.
So to conclude, another excellent quarter for Lincoln. We reported record operating earnings and EPS, underwriting results in Group Protection and Life Insurance were strong, while Annuity and Retirement Plan Services benefited from record account values. 
This year's annual review once again confirmed the quality of the assumptions underlying our balance sheet as there was almost no impact on our operating earnings.
We grew book value per share by 8% as below-the-line impacts were modest and normalized ROE was 13%, which supports another year of ROE expansion. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

What's driven that growth up to those targets has been driven primarily by the price increases, claims management improvements that was made over the year. But clearly, additionally, the economy, we believe, is having some impact. Items like consumer confidence, which I believe is at a 17-year high, items like the low unemployment rate, which is at 4.2% is clearly as low as it's been in sometime. Those items are clearly having some favorable impact. As you can see during the quarter, we ended up a little bit above our target range. So while we wouldn't expect to travel above our target range forever, I think those items could be in place for a little bit. But who knows? I think it's a solid quarter.

In the case of Lincoln, outcomes of those discussions have ranged from a bigger capture, like we did at the end of 2014 for a payment, to sometimes modest increases in rates we're paying for reinsurance. All those discussions that we've had over the past 4 to 5 years are embedded in our balance sheets and our income statements. And our expectations for any future discussions that we may have are also embedded in our assumptions, so they're in our balance sheet and our income statements.

So with this in mind, I'll just make a couple of industry comments. The first one is that the industry already pays a little bit more than it earns as a percentage of corporate profit. So roughly speaking, the Life Insurance industry, share of all U.S. corporate profits is like 1.8%, yet our share of corporate income tax is more in the neighborhood of 2.2% or 2.3%. So going into all of this legislative process, we're pretty well positioned in not being an undertaxed industry. I'll also say that the industry view is that if there is any reduction in expenses or tax items that sort of go along with rate reductions, our industry view for our industry is they should be spread across the major areas rather than a single item, so no business model is disproportionately helped or hurt. And so there's so much change that's going on -- or excuse me, so much potential for different outcomes that I think we should just wait until we have a little more confidence before commenting on any specific issue related to tax."

And I'd also point out from life sales, the most important issue, I think -- maybe not most important, but an important issue is this $10 million individual joint exclusion really eliminates estate taxes on a large amount of the American families. However, if that $10 million was to go away, then you have taxes on the step-up in basis. And that could actually provide an opportunity for life sales.

I think your question was specific to Annuities and Retirement, and the answer is different for those. In the Annuity business, we feel very comfortable in our ability to manage credit rates consistent with changes in earned rates. A significant percentage of our policies still have room between the current creditor rate and the guarantee. So we feel very comfortable, and you've seen that over the last few quarters. On the retirement business, and this has been the case for some time now, our rates are pretty close to the guarantees. And so the credited rate movements down you've seen have been more of a function of the fact that the new business we've been bringing on comes on at a lower rate as opposed to us managing in-force credits rates. And that's why in that business, we expect over the near term, annual spread compression in the 10 to 15 basis point range.

Good morning, everyone. 2017 continues to be an outstanding year as third quarter operating earnings and earnings per share were a record.Operating EPS increased 7% compared to the prior year and marked the first time quarterly EPS has",1524,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. 2017 continues to be an outstanding year as third quarter operating earnings and earnings per share were a record.
Operating EPS increased 7% compared to the prior year and marked the first time quarterly EPS has exceeded $2 per share. Book value per share increased 8% and ROE was 13.6%. 
As you know, during the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review, which had a small impact on our financials. Randy will provide you more detail in his remarks.
This quarter's strong earnings were broad based, as all 4 businesses posted high-quality results. Group Protection and Life Insurance had strong underwriting results, while Annuity and Retirement Plan Services benefited from record account values. 
Variable investment income, which has been higher than expected in recent quarters, returned to more historical levels, further highlighting the underlying strength of earnings.
These excellent results are supported by solid execution of strategies we implemented a few years back to further diversify our sales mix and source of earnings. This diversification provides stability during periods of capital market uncertainty, while still enabling us to capitalize on significant long-term growth opportunities and capital market tailwinds.
One can measure the success we're having with these strategies as the contribution for mortality and morbidity sources of earnings has increased a couple of percentage points year-to-date. The impact of low interest rates on spread-based business continues to abate, and earnings related to fees on AUM are benefiting from the strength in equity markets.
The complementary nature of our businesses and source of earnings also enable us to consistently generate a significant amount of free cash flow supporting active capital management, which includes $264 million returned to shareholders in the quarter. 
Additionally, last night, we announced a 14% increase in the common stock dividend. We will continue to look for opportunities to leverage the strength of the balance sheet and our steady capital generation.
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. Results were strong as earnings are benefiting from our high-quality and predictable in-force business, combined with equity market tailwinds. 
Let me remind you, for years, we have demonstrated our annuity book of business is one of the best in the industry, highlighted by returns in excess of 20% and extremely favorable risk metrics.
Shifting to sales. We remain encouraged about our ability to grow. Variable annuity sales increased modestly compared to the prior year and marks the first year-over-year growth in over 3 years. Compared to the second quarter, sales decreased slightly, consistent with historical seasonality.
However, sales picked up post summer and continued to be quite strong in October. Product expansion is a key focus for the Annuity business, and we now have the broadest portfolio of customer solutions we have ever had. This has resulted in market share gains over the course of the year, as we are benefiting from products that provide more investment choice and flexibility, along with fee-based compensation options. 
To these points, Max 6 Select, a living benefit rider we introduced late in the second quarter, has added nearly $50 million to sales and is continuing to gain traction, while fee-based sales totaled $79 million in the quarter, nearly matching all of 2016.
VA sales without living benefits increased 23% year-over-year as the value propositions for tax deferral and legacy planning continue to resonate with consumers. 
Fixed annuity sales increased 2% sequentially through improved competitive positioning and distribution reach due in part to reinsurance arrangement with Athene. These benefits more than offset the effect of low interest rates throughout most of the quarter.
So a strong quarter for the Annuity business, and I am encouraged by year-over-year growth in VA sales and solid momentum in the past couple of months. We clearly have more work to do to get back to positive net flows, but we remain confident in our ability to further build sales in the near term.
Longer term, the value proposition of guaranteed lifetime income remains extremely important and investable retirement assets are projected to grow considerably, creating significant opportunities for the annuity marketplace.
In Retirement Plan Services, the strategy and franchise continues to drive top and bottom line growth. Total deposits in the quarter of $1.9 billion were up 6% from a year ago, driven by first year sales increasing 11% to $672 million as both small and mid- to large markets delivered strong results while recurring deposits increased 4%. 
Net flows totaled $450 million compared to $97 million in the prior year quarter. Over the past 12 months, flows have exceeded $1.3 billion, a record for the retirement business.
Positive net flows for 7 straight quarters are being driven by momentum in all 3 components of flows. First, sales are benefiting from the combination of a more productive wholesaling force and improved competitiveness in the marketplace, a result of product enhancement and digital innovations. Next, employee contributions have shown steady growth as our high-touch, high-tech model is providing an improved customer experience, that is resulting in more employees participating and higher contribution rates. 
Lastly, retention remains strong as our expanded client-facing teams continue to drive better participant outcomes. Bottom line, I am as optimistic as I have ever been about the RPS business because of strong execution and competitive positioning in the marketplace with product and distribution.
Turning to Life Insurance. Earnings decreased from the impact of our annual assumption review and lower variable investment income, while driver growth remained strong. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $178 million were down 8%, as the prior year benefited from strong sales ahead of pricing adjustments on the interest rate-sensitive products. To this point, GUL sales were down 63% in the quarter. Excluding GUL, total life sales were largely unchanged.
With the pricing changes, returns on new business actually exceeded our 12% to 15% targeted returns. For the full year, sales have increased 10% with the same strong returns as we're benefiting from a broad product portfolio and industry-leading distribution. 
MoneyGuard sales were solid, up 16% this quarter and returned to levels more consistent with prior periods after sales accelerated in the second quarter ahead of pricing adjustments. 
On term insurance, sales were near last year's record quarter and policy count increased 7% as we leverage digital technology to expand distribution and reach a new customer base through TermAccel, which targets a younger demographic.
We continue to focus on sales diversification, risk management, growth and appropriate returns on capital. With new business returns above the top end of our targeted range, a well-diversified product portfolio and a more favorable macro backdrop, we see opportunities to improve our competitive position while maintaining target returns. Bottom line, the life business is well positioned in the marketplace.
Turning to Group Protections. Earnings increased significantly over the prior year, driven by favorable loss ratios. Premiums grew 3% in the quarter as sales and persistency continued to improve. 
During the quarter, sales increased 21% as all product lines in both employer and employee-paid sales grew. Year-to-date, sales had increased 15%, and we have good momentum entering the fourth quarter, which is historically our largest production quarter, as the pipeline and quote activity are strong in our target markets.
We are also encouraged by persistency trends, which are up 4 percentage points compared to prior year, driven by stronger renewal trends in core life and disability products. 
As you know, we established a target of achieving 5% to 7% margins in 2018. Given results year-to-date, we now expect we will reach the target this year. While volatility is expected quarter-to-quarter, the focus is now on sustaining and improving margins, over time. 
The strong, positive momentum in group results over the last several quarters validates our continuing strategic investment in this business, which offers very good growth and earning diversification opportunities for Lincoln.
Shifting to investment results. The alternative investment portfolio achieved an 11% pretax annualized return with solid results from both the private equity and hedge fund portfolios. 
During the quarter, we invested new money at an average yield of 4% compared to 4.1% in the second quarter. The decline is primarily driven by tighter spreads and increased purchases of shorter-duration investments, which match our liabilities and reflects Lincoln's tilt away from products with long-term guarantees.
The fixed income portfolio yield declined 3 basis points to 4.73%, consistent with expectations. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in extremely good shape, high quality and broadly diversified. Below investment-grade assets represent only 4% of the fixed income portfolio, down 1 percentage point from the prior year quarter, largely due to maturities.
So in closing, I'm very pleased with results year-to-date, including this quarter's record earnings. As I look forward, I remain confident that our strategic objectives and initiatives will drive long-term sustainable growth.
As you know, and Chris mentioned, on November 16, we'll be holding our Investment -- Investor Day, and we look forward to providing you even more insight into our business and the key drivers that will enable us to sustain our strong track record of financial success and stability.
With that, let me turn the call over to Randy."
867423,538210948,1332280,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $454 million or $2.03 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 6% year-over-year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.09",1244,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $454 million or $2.03 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 6% year-over-year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.09 from tax adjustments. This year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions had a series of pluses and minuses that netted to a negative $0.01 impact to EPS. Separate from the annual review, the Group Protection business benefited $0.01 from a reinsurance recapture.
A few comments on the outcome of this year's review. Annuity earnings benefited $15 million, primarily from favorable policyholder behavior assumptions. Earnings in the Life Insurance business were negatively affected by $16 million, with no one item standing out. 
It is also worth noting that we did not change our long-term earned rate assumption or unlock the reversion to the mean quarter, which still provides a cushion against declines in the equity markets.
So the bottom line with the annual DAC and reserve review is that when viewed in total, the assumptions underlying our balance sheet continue to be sound.
One other item of note before shifting to key performance metrics. As Dennis noted, variable investment income returned to more normal levels, coming in $4 million or $0.02 per share ahead of our expectations. This compares to $18 million or $0.08 per share last year.
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 8% to over $61, an all-time high. Normalized ROE was strong at 13% and the year-to-date ROE of 12.6% is 60 basis points above 2016. Consolidated net flows were positive and end-of-period account values reached a record $246 billion.
Balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $264 million to shareholders in the quarter. 
Lastly, net income of $418 million further highlights the strength of the quarter, as MPR, which is noneconomic, had the largest below-the-line impact. Year-to-date net income represents 96% of operating earnings.
Now we'll turn to segment results, starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $277 million, up 5% from last year when excluding notable items in both periods. 
Net favorable items this quarter included the $15 million I noted upfront. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from a 6% increase in average account values, as equity markets strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. 
The quality of our variable annuity book can be seen by looking at return metrics and net amount at risk. Normalized returns remained strong as ROE came in at 21%, while ROA was 79 basis points, both consistent with recent quarters.
Net amount at risk improved to less than 0.6% of account value for both living and death benefits. So minimal financial impacts from assumption changes, a superior risk profile of net amount at risk well below competitors and strong and consistent returns continue to differentiate us in the marketplace and highlight our prudent and disciplined approach to the annuity business.
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $35 million compared to $32 million in the prior year quarter. Both periods included modest impacts from our annual assumption review. Excluding these items, earnings increased 6%, primarily due to growth in fee income from higher account values and expense management.
Positive net flows of $1.3 billion over the trailing 12 months, combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values to $64 billion, a 13% increase. Revenues increased 3%, while G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized were flat year-over-year. 
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 13 basis points year-to-date compared to last year, consistent with expectations.
For the quarter, ROA was 23 basis points, excluding notable items, in line with recent quarters. The retirement business continues to deliver solid growth in deposits, net flows and assets. And combined with good expense discipline, RPS is well positioned for future earnings growth.
Turning to the Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $121 million included net unfavorable items of $16 million related to our annual review. Excluding notable items, earnings decreased 9% as the prior year quarter benefited from strong variable investment income. 
Mortality experience was favorable, consistent with typical third quarter seasonality. Earnings drivers remained solid in the quarter, with Life Insurance in-force up 4% and average account values up 6%.
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 8 basis points year-to-date compared to last year, in line with expectations. So a solid quarter for the Life business as mortality was right in line with expectations, and the financial impacts from the annual assumption review were modest. Strong sales results year-to-date and steady driver growth continue to support earnings momentum.
Group Protection reported $41 million in earnings compared to $28 million in the prior year quarter. The significant increase in earnings was primarily due to favorable risk experience. A $3 million benefit from the recapture of previously reinsured business was included in the quarter's results. The prior year quarter included net favorable items of $5 million, primarily from a disability reserve refinement. 
The strong risk results experienced in the second quarter carried into the third quarter. The nonmedical loss ratio was 63.7% in the quarter, a 650 basis point improvement from the prior year, excluding the disability reserve refinement.
Favorable disability and group life incidents rates, combined with lower new claim severity, remain the primary drivers of favorable loss ratios. While we wouldn't expect loss ratios to consistently be this strong, results clearly reflect underwriting discipline, coupled with positive external economic factors. 
Premium growth is also aiding the group business as premiums increased 3% from the prior year quarter, with leading indicators, such as sales and persistency, trending in a positive direction. 
Bottom line, it was another very strong quarter for group, with year-to-date margins now exceeding the lower end of our 5% to 7% target range. While volatility is expected quarter-to-quarter, we now expect margins to be consistently within our target range on a year-to-year basis, with gradual improvement over time.
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. First, on capital. Both capital and capital generation remained strong, providing significant financial flexibility and an ability to commit capital to drive long-term earnings growth and also return capital to shareholders.
As I noted upfront, this quarter, we returned $264 million, including $200 million in share repurchases, with the remainder through shareholder dividends. 
We expect to remain active allocators of capital. An example of this can be seen by the announcement of a 14% increase in our shareholder dividend, which is consistent with our strong earnings growth.
As we have noted in the past, we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend. Statutory surplus stands at over $9 billion and estimate the RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 495%. Holding company cash remains above our $500 million target.
So to conclude, another excellent quarter for Lincoln. We reported record operating earnings and EPS, underwriting results in Group Protection and Life Insurance were strong, while Annuity and Retirement Plan Services benefited from record account values. 
This year's annual review once again confirmed the quality of the assumptions underlying our balance sheet as there was almost no impact on our operating earnings.
We grew book value per share by 8% as below-the-line impacts were modest and normalized ROE was 13%, which supports another year of ROE expansion. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

But clearly, additionally, the economy, we believe, is having some impact. Items like consumer confidence, which I believe is at a 17-year high, items like the low unemployment rate, which is at 4.2% is clearly as low as it's been in sometime. Those items are clearly having some favorable impact. As you can see during the quarter, we ended up a little bit above our target range.

As we sit here today, what underlies our assumption is a 10-year treasury rate of about 3.75%, a little below 3.75%, but right about 3.75%. So that underlies the ultimate earned rate, new money [ indiscernible ] that we're moving towards. In terms of the separate account, I believe we are at about 7.3% these days from a separate account return standpoint."

So with this in mind, I'll just make a couple of industry comments. The first one is that the industry already pays a little bit more than it earns as a percentage of corporate profit. So roughly speaking, the Life Insurance industry, share of all U.S. corporate profits is like 1.8%, yet our share of corporate income tax is more in the neighborhood of 2.2% or 2.3%. So going into all of this legislative process, we're pretty well positioned in not being an undertaxed industry. I'll also say that the industry view is that if there is any reduction in expenses or tax items that sort of go along with rate reductions, our industry view for our industry is they should be spread across the major areas rather than a single item, so no business model is disproportionately helped or hurt. And so there's so much change that's going on -- or excuse me, so much potential for different outcomes that I think we should just wait until we have a little more confidence before commenting on any specific issue related to tax."

So I don't know what to tell you beyond that. We've had good experience on SGUL in terms of the assumptions playing out like we thought they would. The outside of the interest rates, obviously, we've talked about that, but in terms of policyholder behavior and things like lapse rates, how people pay premiums, I think we've had really good experience, any changes we've reflected in the model. So we have a very sophisticated valuation system that projects these policies on a policy basis, and we feel good about where we are."

I don't see us, the industry, getting back into an arms race. That doesn't mean that any particular competitor might not be emphasizing a product for a particular reason and intentionally make it more competitive than maybe the industry. But I just think it's a reasonably logical market from a pricing standpoint right now. And most of our share increase, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, is not just better results or our historical products, but the addition of new products that have more investment flexibility. So we have an opportunity to improve sales across a broader portfolio than we have had ever in the past. And so that's how we're trying to increase sales as opposed to increasing sales on the basis of price."

I think your question was specific to Annuities and Retirement, and the answer is different for those. In the Annuity business, we feel very comfortable in our ability to manage credit rates consistent with changes in earned rates. A significant percentage of our policies still have room between the current creditor rate and the guarantee. So we feel very comfortable, and you've seen that over the last few quarters. On the retirement business, and this has been the case for some time now, our rates are pretty close to the guarantees. And so the credited rate movements down you've seen have been more of a function of the fact that the new business we've been bringing on comes on at a lower rate as opposed to us managing in-force credits rates. And that's why in that business, we expect over the near term, annual spread compression in the 10 to 15 basis point range. As I mentioned, year-to-date, we've worked down 13 basis points in the Retirement business. So the answer is different for those 2 businesses."
