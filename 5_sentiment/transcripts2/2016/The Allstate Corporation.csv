So let's begin on Slide 2. We finished 2015 with a strong fourth quarter that was driven by our reposition to homeowners business, continued progress in executing our auto insurance profit improvement plan and reducing expenses. The underlying Property-Liability combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 87.4, which brought our full year results to 88.7, which was within the original annual outlook range we gave last year at this time. The reported combined ratio in the fourth quarter was 92.0, which generated $611 million of underwriting income. The comprehensive program we implemented shortly after a significant increase in auto accident frequency and claim severity includes seeking higher approval for auto insurance prices making changes to our underwriting standards to slow new business growth and addressing underperforming segments both of those and reducing expenses. This proactive approach, however, did not offset the impact to the external trends, and underwriting profits from our auto insurance declined significantly in 2015. 
Continued strong results from homeowners insurance and moderate catastrophe losses resulted in operating from $1.60 per diluted common share for the quarter and $5.19 for the full year.
The return on equity on an operating income basis was 11.6% in 2015, down 1% on the prior year. Common shareholders received $691 million in cash during the fourth quarter and $3.3 billion for the full year to a combination of common share dividends and share repurchases.
We move to the chart on the slide. Revenues were up 1.2% for 2015, and profit liability premiums grew by 4.8%. Net investment income declined 8.8% compared to the prior year that reflects a smaller which is due to the sale of benefit in April 2014 and the continued downsizing of our annuity business. Lower interest income, which resulted from shortening the duration of our fixed income portfolio and a slight decline in income for performance-based investment. Net income for the year was $2.055 billion, which was $5.05 per diluted common share. 
Go to Slide 3. It shows our full year operating results for our 4 Property-Liability customers segments. So total policy imposed growth across all brands as 1.3% in 2015, as you can see at the top, and the recorded combined ratio was 94.9. The Allstate brand, which is in the lower left is our largest segment and comprises 90% of premiums written, and it serves customers who prefer branded product and value local advice and assitance. Allstate brand total policies in force in 2015 were 1.7% higher than 2014. Auto insurance, which is on that left-hand side of that box, new business and retention were both impacted by profit improvement actions. The policy still increased by 2.1% for the year. Homeowner policies grew over the prior year at a rate of 1.1%, and other personal lines grew by 2.7% compared to 2014. Underlying combined ratio was a strong 87.4 for this segment at year-end 2015, as you can see in the red box at bottom. 
Issuance in the lower right serves customers that preferred branded product for their comfortable handling their own insurance needs. Growth was slowed throughout 2015 in this segment as our focus shifted to profit improvement. Policies imposed were 1.4% higher at the end of 2015 in the prior year, and net written premium grew by 6.6%. The underlying loss ratio and issuance improved by 1.2 points in 2015 and in the year 75.4. As a result, the underlying combined ratio declined to 108.4, which includes about 4 points due to a number of expansion initiatives. Encompassing the upper left, competes for customers that want local advice, but are less concerned about their choice of insurance company. This business decreased in size in 2015, as policies imposed declined by 8.2% from a year over due to lower new business and retention, which is largely result of price increases and underwriting changes.
The net written premium declined of 2.8% for 2015. That reflects higher average premiums from increasing rate to improved returns. The underlying combined ratio was 92.6 for 2015, which was 1 point, 1 point better than the prior year. 
And the financial in the right upper right, that serves brand-new self-service customers, and potentially, an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risks. Total nonproprietary written premiums are $581 million in 2015 were 10% higher than the prior year. 
So let's go to page, Slide 4. Looking forward to 2016, we expect our annual underlying combined ratio to be in the range of 88 to 90. It ranges comprised a number of key assumptions. First, we assume that we continue the improvement in auto insurance profitability across all 3 brands given the profit improvement actions we undertook in 2015 and that will continue in 2016. We do expect moderate increases in both auto accident frequency and claim severity, which reflects the broad-based trends we experienced in 2015. Third, we assume the homeowners underlying combined ratio will increase slightly from last year's level. And as our profit improvement -- improvements are realized the benefit of a lower combined ratio, we will continue to invest to generate long-term value, which will likely increase our expense ratio.
As you know, of course, predicting frequency and loss trends in a rapidly changing external environment difficult, as a result we put a range on our outlook every year. Now what you also know with that we react quickly to trends whether they are positive or negative to adapt our business priorities. So we're building long-term shareholder value. So our operating priorities for 2016 are designed to build long-term value. And as you can see, they're generally the same as 2015.
Serving our customers and generating returns and shareholder capital are 2 top priorities and they're central to our time. When we do these well, we grow insurance policies in force. We intentionally slowed auto insurance growth in 2015 to improve auto margins that new business typically has a higher loss ratio than more tenured business. New auto insurance buyings in Allstate Brand been declined by 24% in the fourth quarter as a result of higher underwriting, lower advertising and increased prices.
While these actions are necessary, they're also flexible. So our appetite for new business will increase as the auto profit improvement efforts translates into a lower commendation ratio. The largest factor in overall growth, however, is a rate of how which we retain customers. The auto retention rate declined in the fourth quarter in reflecting higher auto insurance prices. We're implementing actions to reduce the impact that will have on growth, but what competitors do in their pricing is also major driver and that's not controllable. So our 2016 growth plan in prospects vary by customer segments. Growth in the Allstate brand auto insurance will depend on the timing of the success with implementation of auto profitability actions and competitor's pricing actions.
The sooner we see a lower combined ratio, the sooner we will increase new business. We do have growth plans in place for homeowners and other personal lines policies given the attractive returns on those products. We expect Esurance and Allstate Benefits to continue to grow in 2016. Encompass had a decline in policies in 2015 and is not yet in a position to grow. So we're still committed to growing policies in force across the company, but it will be more difficult in 2016 and has been in the past.
Pat will now go through the Property-Liability results in more detail."

I'll start with a review of our Property-Liability results on Slide 5. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability net written premium of $30.9 billion in 2015 grew $1.3 billion or 4.2% over 2014. Recorded combined ra",1602,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a review of our Property-Liability results on Slide 5. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability net written premium of $30.9 billion in 2015 grew $1.3 billion or 4.2% over 2014. Recorded combined ratio for the year of 94.9 increased 1 point versus 2014, driven by an increase in auto losses, which was partially offset by lower expenses, strong homeowner underlying margins and catastrophe losses of $1.7 billion, which were 13.7% lower than 2014.
As Tom mentioned earlier, the year-end 2015 underlying combined ratio of 88.7, while 1.5 points higher than 2014, finished within our original annual guidance range given the strong results in the fourth quarter. Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment decreased 4.9% from the prior year due primarily to lower performance-based investment income. Property-Liability operating income in 2015 was $1.9 billion, which was 8.2% lower than 2014. Chart on the lower left-hand side of this page shows Property-Liability net written premium and policy in force growth rates. Red line representing policy in force growth versus prior year shows a slowing growth rate of 1.3% given actions in place across all 3 underwriting brands to improve auto margins. Even with these headwinds with grew policy accounts by 449,000 to 34.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The Allstate brand accounted for almost all policy growth in 2015, as Esurance policy growth showed and Encompass policies were lower in 2014. This policy growth results exclude 5.6 million Allstate Financial policies, which grew by 6.1% in 2015, driven by 11.1% policy growth in Allstate benefits. Average premium increases to reflect higher costs resulted in the net written premium shown by the blue line. 
Bottom right-hand side of this page shows Property-Liability recorded and underwriting -- underlying combined ratio results. Recorded in underlying combined ratios, both finished the year strong compared to results earlier in the year given our actions to improve auto returns. The underlying Property-Liability combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 87.4 and was 2.1 points lower in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Slide 6 highlights the margin trends for Allstate brand auto and Allstate brand homeowners. Chart on the top left of this page provides a view of quarterly recorded and underlying margin performance for Allstate brand auto. As Tom mentioned earlier, our fourth quarter results continued to be impacted by elevated frequency and severity, as they have been since fourth quarter of 2014.
Our efforts to respond to higher cost trends to price underwriting and expense management resulted in an underlying combined ratio of 97.6 in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was 6/10 of a point improvement from the fourth quarter a year ago.
On a sequential basis, the underlying combined ratio improved by 0.5 a point compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Chart on the top right highlights trends driving the change in the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average written premium per policy shown by the blue line continued to show upward momentum as rate increases implemented throughout 2015 resulted in the 3.9% increase in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the quarter a year ago.
Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 3.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 given the influence of higher frequency and severity, but lower expenses per policy.
The gap between these 2 points remains positive, but it's smaller than what it's been historically. Similar information is shown for Allstate band homeowners on the bottom of this page. On the bottom left, you can see the favorable impact from low catastrophies that we experienced for most of 2015 continued in the fourth quarter resulting in the 71 Allstate brand homeowners recorded combined ratio.
Lower frequency of fire claims in the fourth quarter benefited the underlying homeowners combined ratio, which at 56 was 5 points below the results in the fourth quarter of 2014. Components of the fourth quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio were in the chart on the bottom right. Average earned premium per policy increased to $1,085 or 1.9% over the prior year quarter.
Underlying losses per policy decreased 6.6% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in continued favorable underlying gap between the 2 trends. 
Slide 7 provides some context on combined ratio and top line trends for both Esurance and Encompass. Chart on the top of this page includes fourth quarter and annual combined ratio of results for both companies. Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 107 in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 8.5 points lower than the same period a year ago, given decreased investment in marketing along with a 5-point in the loss ratio, which is reflective of ongoing actions taken in the business to improve auto returns. Esurance's combined ratio of 110.3 in 2015 improved by 7.4 points compared to 2014. Encompass's recorded combined ratio of 95.5 in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 2.4 points worse than the prior year quarter was adversely impacted by 2.9 points of higher catastrophe losses compared to the prior year quarter. Encompass's combined ratio of 102 in 2015 was 4.1 points better than the full year results in 2014. 
2 charts on the bottom of this page show how growth is being impacted by profit improvement actions in both of the brands. In Esurance, policy in force growth slowed to 1.4% over the prior year and continued to decline sequentially from net written premium grew by 5.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same quarter a year ago.
In Encompass, net written premium declined by 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, as the 8.2% decline in policies in force more than offset higher average premiums from increased rates and underwriting actions. As with the Allstate brand, we continue to evaluate our results and we'll adjust profit improvement actions to insure returns in both of these brands are appropriate.
Slide 8 provides an update on our ongoing plan to improve auto returns. As we discussed throughout 2015, our auto profit improvement plan is comprised of 4 parts, which should design to work together to address the higher loss trends we're experiencing. First, we've sort accrual for higher auto rate across the country. Second, we've implemented underwriting changes, slowed new business and addressed specific underperforming segments business. Along with underwriting changes, we've also increased our ongoing credit classification programs. Third, we focused on claims operational excellence precision. And fourth, we've reduced expenses across the organizations to quickly impact the combined ratio, while the other components took hold. These actions in total helped us to finish 2015 within our underlying combined ratio guidance range. 
Details for the fourth quarter of 2015 are shown on the bottom of this slide. Approved auto rate increases for all 3 underwriting brands in the fourth quarter 2015 were worth $401 million in net written premium, while the total amount of improved rate increases for 2015 in total were worth $1.1 billion in net written premium, the highest amount of improved auto rate increases in over 10 years. We also continue to intentionally slow new business and make underwriting changes on isolated underperforming segments of business and geographies across the country to improve auto returns. These underwriting actions in connection with our credit classification programs and price increases slowed new business and impacted retention. As Tom mentioned earlier, all of these actions are flexible and they're all driven by local market conditions. We'll continue to adjust them selectively from market to market as auto returns improved. Maintaining claims operational excellence and precision also continue to be priorities given cost trends that we and others in the industry are experiencing. Property-Liability expense ratio decreased by 2.8 points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 was 1.2 points lower than 2014 year-end reflecting expenses actions taken across the company.
You can see the impact by underwriting brand in the chart on the lower left. These actions included reductions in advertising in Allstate Esurance brands as well as professional services costs and lower compensation incentives across the company. Bottom right-hand chart shows the net written premium amounts generated by the rates we've received approval for over the past 3 years across all 3 underwriting brands.
The Allstate brand represents the largest component of these rate increases accounting for 942 million of the 1.1 billion for the full year of 2015 and 342 million of 401 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Rating and underwriting changes will drive customers to shop their customers to shop their insurance with our carriers, nonrenew their policies or change their level of coverage, which will result in lower levels of premium in aggregate that was shown on this chart. Allstate Agency owners and their staff collectively consult with their customers during insurance review -- during insurance review process to write at the best coverage and deductible options for their specific situations and needs. We feel that having a trusted advisor to help guide customers understanding protection needs during a period of rising auto prices across the industry is a key competitive advantage for us. 
This analysis only includes rates proved through December 31. We continue to evaluate and run our business on a local, market-by-market basis and continue to adjust our actions going forward whether it be through price, underwriting, claims excellence our expense management to ensure appropriate auto returns. And now I'll turn it over to Steve who will cover Allstate Financial investment and capital management."

Slide 9 provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, as highlighted on the top of the slide. Overall, we've made good progress in Allstate Financial's focus and positioned the business to support long-term value creation. In 2015, we continued our efforts to fully integrate the life and retirement business into the Allstate brand customer value proposition and repositioned the investment portfolio supporting our immediate annuities. Premiums and contracts charges in 2015 increased 4.2% when excluding the impact of the 2014 results company, given by 5.7% growth in Allstate Benefits accident health insurance business as well as a 7.3% increase in additional life insurance premiums. 
Operating income for 2015 up $509 million was 16.1% lower than 2014 given primarily by higher life insurance claims, the disposition of LDL and lower investment income. In the fourth quarter, operating income of $98 million was $30 million below the prior year quarter driven by a lower fixed-income yield and decrease in performance-based long-term investment income.
The bottom of the slide, the liabilities and investments of our immediate annuity business. The approximately $12 billion of liabilities pay out over the next 40-plus years. Our Investment Strategy is to match near-term cash flows with fixed income and commercial mortgages. However, for longer-term liabilities, we believe equity investments provide the best risk adjusted returns. 
As such, in the third quarter, we sold approximately $2 billion of long duration, fixed-income securities to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates. proceeds were invested in shorter duration, fixed income and public equity securities, which will lower net investment income in the near term.
Over time, we will shift the majority of the proceeds to performance-based investments that we expect to deliver attractive, long-term economic returns. Other income will be volatile from the quarter to quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 10 and investments. I'll start with our portfolio of composition at the top of the slide. We've a diverse $77.8 billion portfolio. Fixed income represents 74% of portfolio of value with $8.6 billion or 15% below the investment grade. As we have discussed previously, we are increasing and shifting the risk posture of our portfolio to deliver more attractive long-term returns. We created capacity for this incremental list by strengthening our capital position to issuing preferred securities, reducing debt, exported reduction to catastrophe prone regions and shrinking our annuity business over the past 2 or 3 years. We are utilizing a portion of that capacity in our investment portfolio to increase risk to performance-based investing and selectively increasing our high yield holdings. Our high yield portfolio is conservatively positioned relative to broader markets. We did meaningfully towards double B and to a lesser extent single B issuers. We have also managed with underway the certain sectors, including metals and mining and energy. Our portfolio breakdown by investment approach is at the bottom left. Within the context of these 4 approaches, we target asset mix that reflects our risk tolerance and liability profile. 
Our market-based core by far the largest part of the portfolio delivers predictable earnings aligned to our business needs. We seek to outperform the public markets and take advantage of volatility through our market-based active strategy. We've a growing allocation to performance-based investments, also return long-term and opportunistic, including private equity and real estate partnership and direct investments. The majority of our energy holding shown in the middle table are investment grade corporate bonds. We are conservatively positioned versus the broader energy market referring midstream and higher-quality exploration and production players, which we believe are better equipped to standard the dislocation energy prices. With that said, this is a dynamic environment. Any implications for the falling energy prices are being built across the market. 
During the fourth quarter, $47 million of the trading losses, $82 million of the recognized impairment related to energy holdings. Losses were split between public and private securities. Detailed and limited partnership holdings in our performance-based long-term strategy are shown in the table on the right. Approximately 3 quarters of the investments are in private equity including timber and agriculture and 1 quarter in real estate. Likewise, approximately 3 quarters are accounted for equity method of accounting over the of EMA. Our performance-based long-term strategy had strong results despite a lower fourth quarter with 2015 being our second highest income year. 
We have received significant cash distributions from realizations in this portfolio, which have reduced the amount on distributed income related to our EMA investments. 
Moving on to Slide 11. Net investment income was $710 million in total for the quarter and $3.2 billion for the full year of 2015. Investment income and yield by business segment is provided at the top of the slide. In addition to a multiyear shift in the long-term mix, we continue to proactively manage the portfolio in economic and market conditions. This includes reducing the duration of our fixed income holdings in both the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios with the belief that the markets were not providing sufficient compensation for taking interest rate risks in the low yield environment. 
To the left is Property-Liability. We reduced our interest rate risk in this portfolio in 2013, which resulted in a lower yield in The Allstate Financial portfolio. The yield is now increasing, reflecting our increased allocation for high-yield bonds as well as reinvest in the higher interest rates and our continued shift of the portfolios to performance-based long-term investments. To the right is Allstate Financial. We took actions in 2015 to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates, as I covered a bit earlier in talking about the business, which reflected in the lower interest-bearing yield in 2015.
Moving to the bottom half of the slide, at the left is our GAAP total return. The investment income component of return has been fairly consistent, while the valuation contribution was negative in 2015 on wider spreads across the market with the majority attributed in our returns to investment grade securities given our weight in our portfolio. In the middle is our realized capital gains and losses. 
In 2015, we had a net capital gain of $30 million, which included $470 million of net gains on sales, including the gains on long duration, fixed-income securities we sold in the Allstate Financial portfolio, largely offset by impairments and write downs. The impact of lower valuations can be seen in the decrease in our fixed-income unrealized gains in the chart to the right. 
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capital position and highlights the cash returns shareholders received throughout 2015. Allstate remains in a position of financial strength and strategic flexibility. Our deployable holding company assets totaled $2.6 billion at December 31, 2015. Book value per common share was $47.34 as of year-end 2015, down 1.9% from 2014, reflecting lower unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed-income securities. Excluding this impact, book value per common share was 4.2% in 2015 versus 2014. 
We returned $3.3 billion cash to shareholders in 2015 to the combination of common dividends and common share repurchases. We repurchased 9.3 million common shares for $573 million during the fourth quarter of 2015, which brought the annual total to 42.8 million shares, 10.2% of our beginning of the year common shares outstanding. As of December 31, we have $532 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by July 2016.

And so it's flexible, it will go up, the degree it goes up will depend upon thoughtful analysis of whether or not we had appropriate profitability, appropriate margin and whether or not we're going to earn an appropriate return on the investment."

Seasonality and weather is specially is one of those completely unpredictable pieces of this puzzle. And so when we look at year-over-year, you can look back, we have some charts that show fourth quarter seasonality that tend to spike up and then you have last year where we had almost no catastrophes and benign weather, and this year, much more normal less catastrophe year, but I would say, also more normalized weather environment. Seasonality is one of those high level generalities that tends to pan out over multiple years, but you can have dislocations and aberrations in that on a year-by-year and quarter-by-quarter basis.

What was Slide 15 does, it show what we believe is one of the primary drivers of frequency, as we talked about on almost every call, frequency is driven by primarily miles driven, but also weather, distracted driving, new business volume, new business quality and underwriting and miles driven itself is driven by employment rate and gas price. We know what's happened to both of those over this last year. One of the confusing things is that I have referred in the past to the fact that the frequency trend is widespread, but I think, some of you have taken that to me that it is consistent across the country. It is widespread, but it does not consistent across country. In fact, it's geographically varied. And Slide 15 has just some data from the several highway administration that shows how miles driven as of November versus prior year has gone up in each of the different regions. And you'll notice that in the northeast, it only went up 2.9, while in the west it went up 5.5 and South Atlantic 5.1, et cetera. So this is 1 driver, but it's a major driver.

And when we acquired it, what we said, we're going to do it was run it for economics as supposed to GAAP accounting. So as you know the direct model you've expensed all your marketing expenses upfront, and as a result, the first year or the first quarter looks particularly bad when you're growing, but then in later years, you tend to make money as the business retains and you don't have to spend the marketing again. As Tom said, the business in now twice as large as it was when we acquired it little over 4 years ago. It does have meaningful impact on Allstate reports. And with twice as much growth, we were having some pressure on the loss ratio. And so what we decided to do this year was slow the growth down, really focus on getting more efficiency out of our model, that meant both on the marketing side and on the operations side. And I will tell you, I'm absolutely delighted with how they responded and how the business is doing. I mean, you talked about slowing down dramatically. It's still growing about 5% in the fourth quarter and more than that for the year, not as high as it had been, but given the reduction in marketing still a good growth rate. And underlying combined ratio is down over 8 points from last year in the quarter. So feel really good about where they are. Having said that, I would echo what Tom said, the business is at scale. It could run at the size with meaningful growth rates, I think, and certainly, do it in economic way. But we want to grow the business in the future as aggressively as we can. We just want to do it with a balance of profitability and growth. We felt that was getting a little out of filter a year or 18 months ago. We're getting it back in line now, feel good about what they're doing. And the one of the thing that amplifies is, I think, Tom mentioned in his comments, we had 4 points of investment in 2015 that shows up in the combined ratio, but you don't get the benefit of those investments in the current year. Things like expanding homeowners, which is now in 25 states, which is in 20 states, motorcycle in 11, auto continues to expand to 43 states and 1 Ontario in Canada as well. And so we are investing heavily in building our capabilities for the future, billing out features and expanding our footprint. So we have -- I think, the answer to your question is we have a very aggressive growth plans for the future. We're investing heavily in that, but we want to make sure that we balance that with the economics and the reported results on a current basis."

So they're not like we don't point of which order they're in. And so Matt will talk about the customer, which is obviously very important to us, but that's important to all the other one. We did add, good catch in your profile. We added the acquire to build long-term growth platforms. Long-term growth platforms are the ones we're building for the things like telematics and what we're doing in road side and Allstate Benefits and those things. We think if we need to acquire something to help accelerate those efforts where we would do that. Secondly, we believe that there is additional capacity in particularly the Allstate agency channel, but also some in Esurance to pick up adjacent products and services, which are consistent with protecting and preparing people, particularly, as Matt makes progress on the trusted advisor model and the channel, we think there are other things we could sell. We could either decide we wanted to get into the business, do filings, spread and that kind of stuff if its unique or if somebody has a platform that we can buy and we can ours, we would do that. So that's the concept behind acquisitions. We did put it into it, because we have some specific target or anything we want to talk about. Matt, do you want to go through the customer piece?"

So you correctly pointed out, it's customer base. So it's all about customer centricity and using innovation effectiveness and efficiency, not just to manage financials and manage margins, but to better serve our customers, and there's 3 primary tracks of work going on under that category. The first is Tom just mentioned is trusted advisor, and trusted advisor is all the work we have underway to help our agency owners and their staff and our exclusive financial specialist to better serve our customers through personalized, customized, tailored solutions, geographically based that are based, not product push, that are solutions as supposed to transactions and based on long-term value relationships. And so we have a lot of work underway there. And that goes to both the effectiveness of our agency system as a distribution model and the efficiency with which we put through product. The second major line of work that we have underway is, we refer to it as our continuous improvement, others refer to it as lean engineering. And we've installed continuous improvement in a good portion of the company already. It's a set of management principles and practices that empower front-line employees, get them involved in root cause problem solving, create flow of information, create an environment where they're engaged in their work, and we have seen dramatic increases in productivity and efficiency of those operations that we've installed continuous improvement. We've also seen greater customer -- I'm sorry, customer satisfaction and employee engagement in those areas. The third and this is on really the innovation inside, the track of work we have underway, we refer to it as Integrated Digital Enterprise. You've also heard we refer to it as a set of projects that take data, predictive analytics and emerging technologies and combine those capabilities to better serve customers and that includes a range of things that both use internal sources of data as well as external sources of data to provide more predictive guidance to our agency owners in serving their customers to help them better serve those customers, tell them what the next logical product for them might be and to use those emerging technologies to deliver that in a way that's more accepted by the customer, more intuitive to the customer and is more respectful of the customers time and energy. And so you will continue to see a lot of focus there. As Tom referred to in his opening remarks, as he explained why the expense ratio may slowed up a little bit, we will continue to invest in all these core initiatives, because they're all about long-term value creation. If we're able to better serve our customers through innovation, effectiveness and efficiency, we will create a more valuable organization and we're all about that. And so, I thank you for asking the question."

Two questions, one is, you're obviously taking action as you've talked at length about to improve the auto profitability. And you suggested that, certainly, the effect will depend partly on what your competitors do. Question is what are your competitors doing, what are you seeing out there. And then, secondly, relative to miles driven arguably one of the reasons is lower fuel prices, would you suspect that oil going from 100 down to 40 has a bigger effect than oil going from 40 to 30. In other words, the effect one might suggest would be declining over time."

First of all, what we are seeing in part of our competitors, some of our competitors is a significant rate action in filings that we're reviewing as we make our filings, we see competitor rate filings as w",445,"Jay, it's Matt. Those are 2 really big questions. First of all, what we are seeing in part of our competitors, some of our competitors is a significant rate action in filings that we're reviewing as we make our filings, we see competitor rate filings as well. Some of them are quite significant, some of them are more moderate, most of it depends on if you look back 3 or 4 years the level rates, they started this period and so those who had a greater gap to cover in order to deal with the frequency and severity pressure are taking greater rate. So we expect that to generate some increased turmoil in the environment, and it will certainly generate shocking behavior in the industry and shocking behavior can be a positive or negative depending upon how you approach it, where you positioned, it's all part of competition. So we believe we're well positioned, we believe we're prepared for it, we believe we're monitoring their actions, but we're mostly focused on what we need to earn appropriate returns and serve our customers. And so I would say, our primary focus is on managing our own business with an eye towards what the competitors are doing as opposed to trying to react to competitors all the time, which I find can just drive you crazy. On your second question, it's a great point. There is a point of diminishing impact with gas prices on miles driven. We've always said that we thought the unemployment rate and economic activity had even a greater impact than the gas prices, because economic activity impacts employment driving and gas prices typically impact only discretionary driving activities. Because if you have to go to work, you have to go to work and you're going to pay $3 a gallon or you're going to pay about 90 a gallon. If you're thinking about vacation this summer and you're deciding whether to stay home or drive down to quarter if gas was at above 50, it's probably going to influence you differently than if gas was at 3 50 a gallon. There is a point at which though it's just playing cheap, and it's no longer a question. And I think, we're probably at that point. So I think, you are correct in that. For what we look at, we think the biggest influence of the drop in gas prices has already occurred and it's unlikely that, that will drive much further increase in miles driven. But that being said, we also don't know what economic activity is going to look like and want all the other influences on frequency will look like."

Also in the room today to answer any questions on any and all topics are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, who leads our Emerging Businesses; Judith Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. 
So let's begin on Slide 2. We finished 2015 with a strong fourth quarter that was driven by our reposition to homeowners business, continued progress in executing our auto insurance profit improvement plan and reducing expenses. The underlying Property-Liability combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 87.4, which brought our full year results to 88.7, which was within the original annual outlook range we gave last year at this time. The reported combined ratio in the fourth quarter was 92.0, which generated $611 million of underwriting income. 
The comprehensive program we implemented shortly after a significant increase in auto accident frequency and claim severity includes seeking higher approval for auto insurance prices, making changes to our underwriting standards to slow new business growth and addressing underperforming segments, which is both of those, and reducing expenses. This proactive approach, however, did not offset the impact to the external trends, and underwriting profits from our auto insurance declined significantly in 2015. 
Continued strong results from homeowners insurance and moderate catastrophe losses resulted in operating from $1.60 per diluted common share for the quarter and $5.19 for the full year.
The return on equity on an operating income basis was 11.6% in 2015, down 1% on the prior year. Common shareholders received $691 million in cash during the fourth quarter and $3.3 billion for the full year through a combination of common share dividends and share repurchases.
So we move to the chart on the bottom of the slide. Revenues were up 1.2% for 2015, and profit liability premiums grew by 4.8%. Net investment income declined 8.8% compared to the prior, and that reflects a smaller balance, which is due to the sale of Lincoln Benefit in April 2014 and the continued downsizing of our annuity business. Lower interest income, which resulted from shortening the duration of our fixed income portfolio and a slight decline in income for performance-based investment. Net income for the year was $2.055 billion, which was $5.05 per diluted common share. 
Let's go to Slide 3. It shows our full year operating results for our 4 Property-Liability customer segments. So our total policy in force growth across all brands was 1.3% in 2015, as you can see at the top, and the recorded combined ratio was 94.9. 
The Allstate brand, which is in the lower left, is our largest segment and comprises 90% of premiums written, and it serves customers who prefer branded product and value local advice and assistance. Allstate brand total policies in force in 2015 were 1.7% higher than 2014. Auto insurance, which is on that left-hand side of that box, new business and retention were both impacted by profit improvement actions. But policy still increased by 2.1% for the year. Homeowner policies grew over the prior year at a rate of 1.1%, and other personal lines grew by 2.7% compared to 2014. The underlying combined ratio was a strong 87.4 for this segment at year-end 2015, as you can see in the red box at bottom. 
Esurance, in the lower right, serves customers that prefer branded product for their comfortable handling of their own insurance needs. Growth was slowed throughout 2015 in this segment as our focus shifted to profit improvement. Policies in force were 1.4% higher at the end of 2015 in the prior year, and net written premium grew by 6.6%. The underlying loss ratio in Esurance improved by 1.2 points in 2015, ending the year at 75.4. As a result, the underlying combined ratio declined to 108.4, which includes about 4 points due to a number of expansion initiatives. 
Encompass, in the upper left, competes for customers that want local advice but are less concerned about their choice of insurance company. This business decreased in size in 2015 as policies in force declined by 8.2% from a year over due to lower new business and retention, which is largely a result of price increases and underwriting changes. The net written premium declined of 2.8% for 2015. That reflects higher average premiums from increasing rates to improved returns. The underlying combined ratio was 92.6 for 2015, which was 1 point, 1 point better than the prior year. 
Answer Financial in the right upper right, that serves brand-neutral self-service customers and, essentially, an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risks. Total nonproprietary written premiums are $581 million in 2015, were 10% higher than the prior year. 
So let's go to Page -- Slide 4. Looking forward to 2016, we expect our annual underlying combined ratio to be in the range of 88 to 90. That range is comprised of a number of key assumptions. First, we assume that we continue the improvement in auto insurance profitability across all 3 brands given the profit improvement actions we undertook in 2015 and that will continue in 2016. We do expect modest increases in both auto accident frequency and claim severity, which reflects the broad-based trends we experienced in 2015. Third, we assume the homeowners underlying combined ratio will increase slightly from last year's level. And as our profit improvements are realized, as we said to realize the benefit of a lower combined ratio, we will continue to invest to generate long-term value, which will likely increase our expense ratio.
As you know, of course, predicting frequency and loss trends in a rapidly-changing external environment difficult. As a result, we've put a range on our outlook every year. Now what you also know is that we react quickly to trends whether they are positive or negative to adapt our business priorities, so we're building long-term shareholder value. So our operating priorities for 2016 are designed to build long-term value, and as you can see, they're generally the same as 2015.
Serving our customers and generating returns and shareholder capital are our 2 top priorities, and they're central to our plan. When we do these well, we grow insurance policies in force. We intentionally slowed auto insurance growth in 2015 to improve auto margins. The new business typically has a higher loss ratio than more tenured business. New auto insurance volumes in the Allstate Brand been declined by 24% in the fourth quarter as a result of higher underwriting, lower advertising and increased prices. While these actions are necessary, they're also flexible. So our appetite for new business will increase as the auto profit improvement efforts translate into a lower combined ratio. 
The largest factor in overall growth, however, is a rate at which we retain customers. The auto retention rate declined in the fourth quarter in part reflecting higher auto insurance prices. We're implementing actions to reduce the impact that will have on growth. But what competitors do in their pricing is also a major driver, and that's not controllable. So our 2016 growth plan and prospects vary by customer segments. Growth in the Allstate brand auto insurance will depend on the timing of the success on implementation of auto profitability actions and competitors' pricing actions. The sooner we see a lower combined ratio, the sooner we will increase new business. 
We do have growth plans in place for homeowners and other personal lines policies given the attractive returns on those products. We expect Esurance and Allstate Benefit to continue to grow in 2016. Encompass had a decline in policies in force in 2015 and is not yet in a position to grow. So we're still committed to growing policies in force across the company, but it will be more difficult in 2016, and it has been in the past.
Pat will now go through the Property-Liability results in more detail."

I'll start with a review of our Property-Liability results on Slide 5. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability net written premium of $30.9 billion in 2015 grew $1.3 billion or 4.2% over 2014. The recorded combined ratio for the year of 94.9 increased 1 point versus 2014 driven by an increase in auto losses, which was partially offset by lower expenses, strong homeowner underlying margins and catastrophe losses of $1.7 billion, which were 13.7% lower than 2014.
As Tom mentioned earlier, the year-end 2015 underlying combined ratio of 88.7, while 1.5 points higher than 2014, finished within our original annual guidance range given the strong results in the fourth quarter. 
Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment decreased 4.9% from the prior year due primarily to lower performance-based investment income. Property-Liability operating income in 2015 was $1.9 billion, which was 8.2% lower than 2014. 
Chart on the lower left-hand side of this page shows Property-Liability net written premium and policy in force growth rates. Red line representing policy in force growth versus prior year shows a slowing growth rate of 1.3% given actions in place across all 3 underwriting brands to improve auto margins. Even with these headwinds, we grew policy accounts by 449,000 to 34.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The Allstate brand accounted for almost all policy growth in 2015 as Esurance policy growth slowed, and Encompass policies were lower than 2014. This policy growth results exclude 5.6 million Allstate Financial policies, which grew by 6.1% in 2015, driven by 11.1% policy growth in Allstate benefits. Average premium increases to reflect higher costs resulted in the net written premium trends you see shown by the blue line. 
Bottom right-hand side of this page shows Property-Liability recorded and underwriting -- underlying combined ratio results. The recorded and underlying combined ratios both finished the year strong compared to results earlier in the year given our actions to improve auto returns. The underlying Property-Liability combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 87.4, and that was 2.1 points lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Slide 6 highlights the margin trends for Allstate brand auto and Allstate brand homeowners. Chart on the top left of this page provides a view of quarterly recorded and underlying margin performance for Allstate brand auto. As Tom mentioned earlier, our fourth quarter results continued to be impacted by elevated frequency and severity as they have been since the fourth quarter of 2014.
Our efforts to respond to higher cost trends to price underwriting and expense management resulted in an underlying combined ratio of 97.6 in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was 6/10 of a point improvement from the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, the underlying combined ratio improved by 0.5 a point compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Chart on the top right highlights trends driving the change in the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average written premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continued to show upward momentum as rate increases implemented throughout 2015 resulted in a 3.9% increase in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the quarter a year ago.
Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 3.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, given the influence of higher frequency and severity but lower expenses per policy. The gap between these 2 points remains positive, but it's smaller than where it's been historically. 
Similar information is shown for Allstate brand homeowners on the bottom of this page. On the bottom left, you can see that the favorable impact from low catastrophies that we experienced for most of 2015 continued in the fourth quarter, resulting in 71 Allstate brand homeowners recorded combined ratio.
Lower frequency of fire claims in the fourth quarter benefited the underlying homeowners combined ratio, which at 56 was 5 points below the results in the fourth quarter of 2014. Components of the fourth quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio were in the chart on the bottom right. Average earned premium per policy increased to $1,085 or 1.9% over the prior year quarter. Underlying losses per policy decreased 6.6% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in continued favorable underlying gap between the 2 trends. 
Slide 7 provides some context on combined ratio and top line trends for both Esurance and Encompass. Chart on the top of this page includes fourth quarter and annual combined ratio of results for both companies. 
Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 107 in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 8.5 points lower than the same period a year ago, given decreased investment in marketing along with a 5-point improvement at the loss ratio, which is reflective of ongoing actions taken in the business to improve auto returns. Esurance's combined ratio of 110.3 in 2015 improved by 7.4 points compared to 2014. 
Encompass's recorded combined ratio of 95.5 in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 2.4 points worse than the prior year quarter and was adversely impacted by 2.9 points of higher catastrophe losses compared to the prior year quarter. Encompass's combined ratio of 102 in 2015 was 4.1 points better than the full year results in 2014. 
Two charts on the bottom of this page show how growth is being impacted by profit improvement actions in both of the brands. In Esurance, policy in force growth slowed to 1.4% over the prior year and continued to decline sequentially while net written premium grew by 5.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same quarter a year ago. In Encompass, net written premium declined by 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as the 8.2% decline in policies in force more than offset higher average premiums from increased rates and underwriting actions. As with the Allstate brand, we continue to evaluate our results, and we'll adjust profit improvement actions to ensure returns in both of these brands are appropriate.
Slide 8 provides an update on our ongoing plan to improve auto returns. As we discussed throughout 2015, our auto profit improvement plan is comprised of 4 parts, which should design to work together to address the higher loss trends we're experiencing. First, we have sought approval for higher auto rate across the country. Second, we've implemented underwriting changes to slow new business and address specific underperforming segments business. Along with underwriting changes, we've also increased our ongoing correct classification programs. Third, we focused on claims operational excellence and precision. And fourth, we've reduced expenses across the organization to quickly impact the combined ratio while the other components took hold. These actions in total helped us to finish 2015 within our underlying combined ratio guidance range. 
Details for the fourth quarter of 2015 are shown on the bottom of this slide. Approved auto rate increases for all 3 underwriting brands in the fourth quarter of 2015 were worth $401 million in net written premium while the total amount of approved rate increases for 2015 in total were worth $1.1 billion in net written premium, the highest amount of approved auto rate increases in over 10 years. We also continue to intentionally slow new business and make underwriting changes on isolated underperforming segments of business and geographies across the country to improve auto returns. These underwriting actions, in conjunction with our correct classification programs and price increases, have slowed new business and impacted retention. As Tom mentioned earlier, all of these actions are flexible, and they're all driven by local market conditions. We'll continue to adjust them selectively from market to market as auto returns improve. 
Maintaining claims operational excellence and precision also continue to be priorities given cost trends that we and others in the industry are experiencing. 
Property-Liability expense ratio decreased by 2.8 points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. It was 1.2 points lower than 2014 year-end, reflecting expense actions taken across the company. You can see the impact by underwriting brand in the chart on the lower left. These actions included reductions in advertising in the Allstate and Esurance brands as well as professional services costs and lower compensation incentives across the company. 
Bottom right-hand chart shows the net written premium amounts generated by the rates we've received approval for over the past 3 years across all 3 underwriting brands. The Allstate brand represents the largest component of these rate increases accounting for 942 million of the 1.1 billion for the full year of 2015 and 342 million of the 401 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Rate and underwriting changes will drive customers to shop their insurance with other carriers, nonrenew their policies or change their level of coverage, which will result in lower levels of premium in aggregate than what's shown on this chart. Allstate agency owners and their staff proactively consult with their customers during insurance review -- during the insurance review process to write at the best coverage and deductible options for their specific situations and needs. We feel that having a trusted adviser to help guide customers understanding a protection need during a period of rising auto prices across the industry is a key competitive advantage for us. 
This analysis only includes rates approved through December 31. We continue to evaluate and run our business on a local, market-by-market basis and continue to adjust our actions going forward whether it be through price, underwriting, claims excellence or expense management to ensure appropriate auto returns.

Slide 9 provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 as highlighted on the top of the slide. Overall, we've made good progress in our Allstate Financial's focus and positioned the business to support long-term value creation. In 2015, we continued our efforts to fully integrate the life and retirement business into the Allstate brand customer value proposition and repositioned the investment portfolio supporting our immediate annuities. 
Premiums and contracts charges in 2015 increased 4.2% when excluding the impact of the 2014 results of Lincoln Benefit Life company, driven by 5.7% growth in Allstate Benefits accident health insurance business as well as a 7.3% increase in traditional life insurance premiums. 
Operating income for 2015, up $509 million, was 16.1% lower than 2014, driven primarily by higher life insurance claims, the disposition of LBL and lower investment income. In the fourth quarter, operating income of $98 million was $30 million below the prior year quarter, driven by a lower fixed-income yield and a decrease in performance-based long-term investment income.
The bottom half of the slide depicts the liabilities and investments of our immediate annuity business. The approximately $12 billion of liabilities pay out over the next 40-plus years. Our Investment strategy is to match near-term cash flows with fixed income and commercial mortgages. However, for longer-term liabilities, we believe equity investments provide the best risk adjusted returns. As such, in the third quarter, we sold approximately $2 billion of long-duration, fixed-income securities to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates. Sale proceeds were invested in shorter duration, fixed income and public equity securities, which will lower net investment income in the near term. Over time, we will shift the majority of the proceeds to performance-based investments that we expect to deliver attractive, long-term economic returns. Other income will be volatile from the quarter-to-quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 10 and investments. I'll start with our portfolio of composition at the top of the slide. We have a diverse $77.8 billion portfolio. Fixed income represents 74% of the portfolio value with $8.6 billion or 15% and below the investment grade. 
As we have discussed previously, we are increasing and shifting the risk posture of our portfolio to deliver more attractive long-term returns. We created capacity for this incremental risk by strengthening our capital position to issuing preferred securities, reducing debt, exporting reduction to catastrophe prone regions and shrinking our annuity business over the past 2 or 3 years. We are utilizing a portion of that capacity in our investment portfolio to increase idiosyncratic risk to performance-based investing and selectively increasing our high-yield holdings. 
Our high-yield portfolio is conservatively positioned relative to the broader market. We did meaningfully towards a BB, and to a lesser extent, B issuers. We have also managed with underway some certain sectors, including metals and mining and energy. 
Our portfolio breakdown by investment approach is at the bottom left. Within the context of these 4 approaches, we target asset mix that reflects our risk tolerance and liability profile. Our market-based core, by far, the largest part of the portfolio, delivers predictable earnings aligned to our business needs. We seek to outperform the public markets and take advantage of volatility through our market-based active strategy. We have a growing allocation to performance-based investments, also long-term and opportunistic including private equity and real estate partnership and direct investments. 
The majority of our energy holding shown in the middle table are investment grade corporate bonds. We are conservatively positioned versus the broader energy market, referring midstream and higher-quality exploration and production players, which we believe are better equipped to withstand it, the dislocation to energy prices. With that said, this is a dynamic environment. Any implications of the falling energy prices are being felt across the market. 
During the fourth quarter, $47 million of the trading losses at $82 million of the recognized impairment related to energy holdings. Losses were split between public and private securities. 
Detailed and limited partnership holdings in our performance-based, long-term strategy are shown in the table on the right. Approximately 3 quarters of the investments are in private equity, including timber and agriculture, and 1 quarter in real estate. Likewise, approximately 3 quarters are accounted for on the equity method of accounting, or the term EMA. Our performance-based, long-term strategy had strong results despite a lower fourth quarter, with 2015 being our second highest income year. We received significant cash distributions from realizations in this portfolio, which have reduced the amount on distributed income related to our EMA investments. 
Moving on to Slide 11. Net investment income was $710 million in total for the quarter and $3.2 billion for the full year of 2015. Investment income and yield by business segment is provided at the top of the slide. In addition to a multiyear shift in the long-term mix, we continue to proactively manage the portfolio in light of current economic and market conditions. This includes reducing the duration of our fixed income holdings in both the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios, with the belief that the markets were not providing sufficient compensation for taking interest rate risk in the low yield environment. 
To the left is Property-Liability. We reduced our interest rate risk in this portfolio in 2013, which resulted in a lower yield in The Allstate Financial portfolio. The yield is now increasing, reflecting our increased allocation to high-yield bonds as well as reinvestment in the higher interest rates and our continued shift of the portfolio to performance-based, long-term investments. 
To the right is Allstate Financial. We took actions in 2015 to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates, as I covered a bit earlier in talking about the immediate annuity business, which reflected in a lower interest-bearing yield in 2015.
Moving to the bottom half of the slide, at the left is our GAAP total return. The investment income component of return has been fairly consistent while the valuation contribution was negative in 2015 on wider curve spreads across the market, with the majority attributed in our returns to investment grade securities given their weight in our portfolio. 
In the middle is our realized capital gains and losses. In 2015, we had a net capital gain of $30 million, which included $470 million of net gains on sales, including the gains on long-duration, fixed-income securities we sold in the Allstate Financial portfolio, largely offset by impairments and intent write downs. The impact of lower valuations can be seen in the decrease on our fixed-income unrealized gains in the chart to the right. 
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capital position and highlights the cash returns common shareholders received throughout 2015. Allstate remains in a position of financial strength and strategic flexibility. Our deployable holding company assets totaled $2.6 billion at December 31, 2015. Book value per common share was $47.34 as of year-end 2015, down 1.9% from 2014, reflecting lower unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed-income securities. Excluding this impact, book value per common share was 4.2% in 2015 versus 2014. 
We returned $3.3 billion cash to common shareholders in 2015 to the combination of common dividends and common share repurchases. We repurchased 9.3 million common shares for $573 million during the fourth quarter of 2015, which brought the annual total to 42.8 million shares, 10.2% of our beginning of the year common shares outstanding. As at December 31, we have $532 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by July 2016.

And if you look at it over the quarters, you can see we increasingly reduced our expenses throughout the year, which was a focus. That said, there were a number of things we're investing heavily and then more invested in terms of either long-term growth or short-term growth, everything from technology, I mentioned to things like telematics.

And so part of the expense ratio next year will -- this year, I'm sorry, will be influenced by our growth plan and when we're able to turn on growth in certain areas and when we want to invest. We're focused on long-term value creation, and long-term value creation does require some investment. But it requires investment with appropriate levels of profitability, and so it's flexible. It will go up. The degree it goes up will depend upon thoughtful analysis of whether or not we had appropriate profitability, appropriate margin and whether or not we're going to earn an appropriate return on the investment."

And then, obviously, we think that we have to factor in future upward development of that, so we look at that as well. So we look at paid, incurred but not reported, and we come up with a number. Obviously, for things like physical damage claims, where they're really settled out in about 90 days. That tends to run through pretty quickly. The buy of the injury, where it takes about 4 years before you get 80% paid, has a little bit longer trend line on it. And as a result of that longer trend line, you tend to have more process changes along the way because you do think differently every year, and so that number tends to bounce around a little more.

Some of them are uncontrollable. Some of them, we can manage. And some, we can't. Even within the ones that are somewhat manageable, like new business quality and volume of new business and geographic mix, there's also some things that you just can't predict. Seasonality and weather, especially, is one of those completely unpredictable pieces of this puzzle. And so when we look at year-over-year, you can look back, we have some charts that show fourth quarter seasonality that tend to spike up. And then you have last year, where we had almost no catastrophes and benign weather. And this year, much more normalized catastrophe year, but I'd say also a more normalized weather environment. Seasonality is one of those high-level generalities that tends to pan out over multiple years, but you can have dislocations and aberrations in that on a year-by-year and quarter-by-quarter basis. So I would not draw a trend line conclusions based upon 1 or 2 quarters and how they appear versus previous quarters."

You get a point swing either away from frequency and severity. I mean, you can get -- as Matt mentioned, you can't predict frequency. And to be honest, it's really difficult to predict severity within a point. So that alone gives you a 2-point spread. There have been some years, Josh, where we've had a 3-point spread, but that was when we weren't sure how quickly the homeowners business is going to take hold. And we did quite well. We got ahead of that, and it was faster than we had done in our modeling. But we do a lot of statistical modeling around this. We think it's about right. I mean, if you're right, we will see a lot of rate come to. That's a $1.1 billion. And if loss costs and -- which is a result of frequency and severity, keep going up, which is what we have in our projections, we'll put more in rate increases. So no, we think it's the right number. I'm not -- we set it up to get there. And if you want to assume your case, then that would be in the middle range. We don't get so precise, so we do it at 1/10 of a point.

What Slide 15 does is show what we believe is one of the primary drivers of frequency as we talked about on almost every call. Frequency is driven by primarily miles-driven but also weather, distracted driving, new business volume, new business quality and underwriting. And miles-driven itself is driven by employment rate and gas prices, and we know what's happened to both of those over this last year. One of the confusing things is that I have referred in the past to the fact that the frequency trend is widespread, but I think some of you have taken that to me that it is consistent across the country. It is widespread, but it is not consistent across country. In fact, it's geographically varied. And Slide 15 has just some data from the Federal Highway Administration that shows how miles driven as of November versus prior year has gone up in each of the different regions. And you'll notice that in the northeast, it only went up 2.9; while in the west, it went up 5.5; and South Atlantic, 5.1; et cetera. So this is one driver, but it's a major driver. And it does help to explain some of the other questions that you've been raising about why different companies have different experiences. They have different geographic concentrations of their business, their bouts of business, and the miles driven in those areas is different. It will clearly impact results."

If you would ask me last year when we gave our range of 87 to 89, did I think frequency and severity when it cliffed up above 5 points, I would have said, no. So -- but the point is you really can't forecast frequency in that. What I -- we can do is tell you, given the strength of our system and the transparency we have, our management process is in place, we think we can manage to 88 to 90 next year. And so that's what we've set up to do. If we do better than that, then that will be because we reacted well and did well. But we don't set it up so we can be below it, like that's not the goal here. Because, obviously, as you would expect, you want to be balanced, thoughtful and transparent with your shareholders. You don't want to under promise and over deliver because then everybody will think all of the whole world has fallen apart nor do you want to over promise and under deliver. So we try to do it on what we think the system can deliver, and we think 88 to 90. We did not set it up to be too optimistic or set out to be too conservative. It's right down the middle."

On Esurance, trying to slow the growth dramatically certainly fits within your profit objective and seems like a zone way to go to achieve your short-term plan.

And at $160 million, that's enough media weight to make sure people hear you. If you're half that size, you don't -- you just don't throw -- have enough throwaway in the marketing world. That -- so I think it's upscale. That said, we have good growth plans, and I don't want you to think that this is a backing off of Esurance growth. Don can talk about the things we're doing to get into homeowners and motorcycle in Canada, new market. So there's plenty of growth up there.

Bob, first, remember, when we acquired Esurance, we did it for the strategic reason of going into the lower right-hand corner with the self-serve, brand-sensitive customer and really focusing the customer value proposition against the GEICO and progressive direct models. And when we acquired it, what we said we were going to do was run it for economics as opposed to GAAP accounting. So as you know in the direct model, you've expensed all your marketing expenses upfront. And as a result, the first year or the first quarter looks particularly bad when you're growing. But then in later years, you tend to make money as the business retains, and you don't have to spend the marketing again. As Tom said, the business in now twice as large as it was when we acquired it little over 4 years ago. It does have a meaningful impact on your Allstate reports. And with twice as much growth, we were having some pressure on the loss ratio. And so what we decided to do this year was slow the growth down, really focus on getting more efficiency out of our model. That meant both on the marketing side and on the operations side. And I would tell you I'm absolutely delighted with how they responded and how the business is doing. I mean, you talked about slowing down dramatically. It's still growing about 5% in the fourth quarter and more than that for the year. Not as high as it had been, but given the reduction in marketing, still a good growth rate. And the underlying combined ratio is down over 8 points from last year in the quarter, so feel really good about where they are. Having said that, I would echo what Tom said. The business is at scale. It could run at this size with meaningful growth rates, I think, and certainly, do it in economic way. But we do want to grow the business in the future as aggressively as we can. We just want to do it with a balance of profitability and growth. We felt that was getting a little out of kilter a year or 18 months ago. We're getting it back in line now, feel good about what they're doing. And the -- one of the thing that amplifies is, I think Tom mentioned it in his comments, we had 4 points of investment in 2015 that shows up in the combined ratio, but you don't get the benefit of those investments in the current year. Things like expanding homeowners, which is now in 25 states; renters, which is in 20 states; motorcycle in 11; auto continues to expand to 43 states and 1 Ontario in Canada as well. And so we are investing heavily in building our capabilities for the future, building out features and expanding our footprint. So we have -- I think the answer to your question is we have very aggressive growth plans for the future. We're investing heavily in that, but we want to make sure that we balance that with the economics and the reported results on a current basis."

So in 2015, we used a fair amount of that, increased that buyback program for what may normally have been to $3 billion level we've talking about. In addition, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done a fair amount of work at kind of bringing our risk profile down in the corporation, which once again has freed up some capital. We do need to grow the business. So if you look in the future, unless we can continue to change our risk profile, which we would say at the moment, as you said and as I said, we're going to put a little more money into our investment portfolio to back that into the equity-type investments, we will need some to put some money aside each year to grow the business.

So they're not -- like we don't fight over which order they're in. The -- and so Matt will talk about the customer, which is obviously very important to us but as important as all the other ones. We did add -- it was a good catch in your part, Kai. We added the acquire to the build long-term growth platforms. Long-term growth platforms are the ones we're building for the things like telematics and what we're doing in roadside and Allstate Benefits, those things. We think if we need to acquire something to help accelerate those efforts, well, we would do that. Secondly, we believe that there is additional capacity in, particularly the Allstate agency channel, but also some in Esurance to pick up adjacent products and services, which are consistent with protecting and preparing people, particularly as Matt makes progress on the trusted adviser model in the Allstate agency channel. We think there are other things we could sell, and we could either decide who we wanted to get into the business, do filings, spread the product, and that kind of stuff if it's unique. Or if somebody has a platform that we can buy and we can bolt that onto ours, we would do that. So that's the concept behind acquisitions.

Kai, so you correctly pointed out that it's customer-based, so it's all about customer centricity and using innovation effectiveness and efficiency, not just to manage financials and manage margins, but to better serve our customers. And there's 3 p",473,"Sure. Kai, so you correctly pointed out that it's customer-based, so it's all about customer centricity and using innovation effectiveness and efficiency, not just to manage financials and manage margins, but to better serve our customers. And there's 3 primary tracks of work going on under that category. The first, as Tom just mentioned, is trusted adviser. And trusted adviser is all the work we have underway to help our agency owners and their staff and our exclusive financial specialist better serve our customers through personalized, customized, tailored solutions, geographically-based that are advised-based, not product push, that are solutions as opposed to transactions and based on long-term value relationships. And so we have a lot of work underway there, and that goes to both the effectiveness of our agency system as a distribution model and the efficiency with which we put through product. The second major line of work that we have underway is we refer to it as our continuous improvement, others refer to it as lean engineering. And we've installed continuous improvement in a good portion of the company already. It's a set of management principles and practices that empower frontline employees, get them involved in root cause problem solving, create flow of information, create an environment where they're engaged in their work. And we have seen dramatic increases in productivity and efficiency of those operations that we've installed continuous improvement. We've also seen a greater customer -- I'm sorry, customer satisfaction and employee engagement in those areas. The third, and this is on really the innovation inside, the track of work we have underway. We refer to it as Integrated Digital Enterprise, but you've also heard we refer to it as a set of projects that take data, predictive analytics and emerging technologies and combine those capabilities to better serve customers. And that includes a range of things that both use internal sources of data as well as external sources of data to provide more predictive guidance to our agency owners in serving their customers, to help them better serve those customers, tell them what the next logical product for them might be and to use those emerging technologies to deliver that in a way that's more accepted by the customer, more intuitive to the customer and is more respectful of the customer's time and energy. And so you will continue to see a lot of focus there. As Tom referred to in his opening remarks, as he explained why the expense ratio may flowed up a little bit, we will continue to invest in all these core initiatives because they're all about long-term value creation. If we're able to better serve our customers through innovation, effectiveness and efficiency, we will create a more valuable organization. And we're all about that, and so I thank you for asking the question."

And you suggested that, certainly, the effect will depend partly on what your competitors do. Question is what are your competitors doing? What are you seeing out there? And then, secondly, relative to miles driven. Arguably, one of the reasons is lower fuel prices. Would you suspect that oil going from $100 down to $40 has a bigger effect than oil going from $40 to $30? In other words, the effect one might suggest would be declining over time."

Those are 2 really good questions. First of all, what we are seeing part of our competitors, some of our competitors is -- a significant rate action in the filings that we're reviewing as we make our filings, we see competitor rate filings",451,"Jay, it's Matt. Those are 2 really good questions. First of all, what we are seeing part of our competitors, some of our competitors is -- a significant rate action in the filings that we're reviewing as we make our filings, we see competitor rate filings as well. Some of them are quite significant. Some of them are more moderate. Most of it depends upon -- if you look back 3 or 4 years the level of rates, they started this period. And so those who had a greater gap to cover in order to deal with the frequency and severity pressure are taking greater rate. So we expect that to generate some increased turmoil in the environment, and it will certainly generate shopping behavior in the industry. And shopping behavior can be a positive or negative depending upon how you approach it, where you're positioned. It's all part of competition. So we're -- we believe we're well positioned. We believe we're prepared for it. We believe we're monitoring their actions, but we're mostly focused on what we need to do to earn appropriate returns and serve our customers. And so I would say our primary focus is always managing our own business with an eye towards what the competitors are doing as opposed to trying to react to competitors all the time, which I find can just drive you crazy. On your second question, it's a great point. There is a point of diminishing impact with gas prices on miles driven. We've always said that we thought the unemployment rate and economic activity had even a greater impact than the gas prices. Because economic activity impacts employment driving, and gas prices typically impact only discretionary driving activities. Because if you have to go to work, you have to go to work, and you're going to pay $3 a gallon or you're going to pay about $90 a gallon. If you're thinking about vacation this summer and you're deciding whether to stay home or drive down to Florida and gas is at a about $60, it's probably going to influence you differently than if gas was at $3.50 a gallon. There is a point at which though it's just plain cheap, and it's no longer a question. And I think we're probably at that point, so I think you're correct in that. From what we look at, we think the biggest influence of the drop in gas prices has already occurred. And it's unlikely that, that will drive much further increase in miles driven. But that being said, we also don't know what economic activity is going to look like and what all the other influences on frequency will look like."

I'll cover an overview of the results, and then Pat and Steve will take you through the details. Our comments today are more detailed on 4 topics to make sure we provide you with good transparency.

This -- that will include both the investments we're in, including limited partnerships and energy. 
Also in the room today to answer any questions on any and all topics are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, who leads our Emerging Businesses; Judith Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. 
So let's begin on Slide 2. We finished 2015 with a strong fourth quarter that was driven by our repositioned homeowners business, the continued progress in executing our auto insurance profit improvement plan and reducing expenses. The underlying Property-Liability combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 87.4, which brought our full year results to 88.7, which was within the original annual outlook range we gave last year at this time. The recorded combined ratio in the fourth quarter was 92.0, which generated $611 million of underwriting income. 
The comprehensive program we implemented shortly after a significant increase in auto accident frequency and claim severity includes seeking higher approval for auto insurance prices, making changes to our underwriting standards to slow new business growth and addressing underperforming segments, which is both of those, and reducing expenses. This proactive approach, however, did not offset the impact to the external trends, and underwriting profits from our auto insurance declined significantly in 2015. 
Continued strong results from homeowners insurance and moderate catastrophe losses resulted in operating from $1.60 per diluted common share for the quarter and $5.19 for the full year.
The return on equity on an operating income basis was 11.6% in 2015, down 1% from the prior year. Common shareholders received $691 million in cash during the fourth quarter and $3.3 billion for the full year through a combination of common share dividends and share repurchases.
So if we move to the chart on the bottom of the slide. Revenues were up 1.2% for 2015, and profit liability premiums grew by 4.8%. Net investment income declined 8.8% compared to the prior, and that reflects a smaller balance, which is due to the sale of Lincoln Benefit in April 2014 and the continued downsizing of our annuity business; lower interest income, which resulted from shortening the duration of our fixed income portfolio; and a slight decline in income for performance-based investment. Net income for the year was $2.055 billion, which was $5.05 per diluted common share. 
Let's go to Slide 3. It shows our full year operating results for our 4 Property-Liability customer segments. So our total policy in force growth across all brands was 1.3% in 2015, as you can see at the top, and the recorded combined ratio was 94.9. 
The Allstate brand, which is in the lower left, is our largest segment and comprises 90% of premiums written, and it serves customers who prefer branded product and value local advice and assistance. Allstate brand total policies in force in 2015 were 1.7% higher than 2014. Auto insurance, which is on that left-hand side of that box, new business and retention were both impacted by profit improvement actions. But policies still increased by 2.1% for the year. Homeowner policies grew over the prior year at a rate of 1.1%, and other personal lines grew by 2.7% compared to 2014. The underlying combined ratio was a strong 87.4 for this segment at year-end 2015, as you can see in the red box at the bottom. 
Esurance, in the lower right, serves customers that prefer branded product but are comfortable handling of their own insurance needs. Growth was slowed throughout 2015 in this segment as our focus shifted to profit improvement. Policies in force were 1.4% higher at the end of 2015 than the prior year, and net written premium grew by 6.6%. The underlying loss ratio in Esurance improved by 1.2 points in 2015, ending the year at 75.4. As a result, the underlying combined ratio declined to 108.4, which includes about 4 points due to a number of expansion initiatives. 
Encompass, in the upper left, competes for customers that want local advice but are less concerned about their choice of insurance company. This business decreased in size in 2015 as policies in force declined by 8.2% from a year over due to lower new business and retention, which is largely a result of price increases and underwriting changes. The net written premium decline of 2.8% for 2015, that reflects higher average premiums from increasing rates to improved returns. The underlying combined ratio was 92.6 for 2015, which was 1.1 points better than the prior year. 
Answer Financial in the right upper right, that serves brand-neutral self-service customers and it's, essentially, an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risks. Total nonproprietary written premiums are $581 million in 2015, were 10% higher than the prior year. 
So let's go to Page -- Slide 4. Looking forward to 2016, we expect our annual underlying combined ratio to be in the range of 88 to 90. That range is comprised of a number of key assumptions. First, we assume that we continue the improvement in auto insurance profitability across all 3 brands, given the profit improvement actions we undertook in 2015 and that will continue in 2016. We do expect modest increases in both auto accident frequency and claim severity, which reflects the broad-based trends we experienced in 2015. Third, we assume the homeowners underlying combined ratio will increase slightly from last year's level. And as our profit improvements are realized, as we said, to realize the benefit of a lower combined ratio, we will continue to invest to generate long-term value, which will likely increase our expense ratio.
As you know, of course, predicting frequency and loss trends in a rapidly-changing external environment is difficult. As a result, we've put a range on our outlook every year. Now what you also know is that we react quickly to trends whether they are positive or negative to adapt our business priorities, so we're building long-term shareholder value. So our operating priorities for 2016 are designed to build long-term value, and as you can see, they're generally the same as 2015.
Serving our customers and generating returns and shareholder capital are our 2 top priorities, and they're central to our plan. When we do these well, we grow insurance policies in force. We intentionally slowed auto insurance growth in 2015 to improve auto margins. The new business typically has a higher loss ratio than more tenured business. New auto insurance volumes in the Allstate Brand declined by 24% in the fourth quarter as a result of higher underwriting, lower advertising and increased prices. While these actions are necessary, they're also flexible. So our appetite for new business will increase as the auto profit improvement efforts translate into a lower combined ratio. 
The largest factor in overall growth, however, is a rate at which we retain customers. The auto retention rate declined in the fourth quarter in part reflecting higher auto insurance prices. We're implementing actions to reduce the impact that will have on growth. But what competitors do in their pricing is also a major driver, and that's not controllable. So our 2016 growth plans and prospects vary by customer segments. Growth in the Allstate brand auto insurance will depend on the timing of the success on implementation of auto profitability actions and competitors' pricing actions. The sooner we see a lower combined ratio, the sooner we will increase new business. 
We do have growth plans in place for homeowners and other personal lines policies given the attractive returns on those products. We expect Esurance and Allstate benefits to continue to grow in 2016. Encompass had a decline in policies in force in 2015 and is not yet in a position to grow. So we're still committed to growing policies in force across the company, but it will be more difficult in 2016, and it has been in the past.
Pat will now go through the Property-Liability results in more detail."

I'll start with a review of our Property-Liability results on Slide 5. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability net written premium of $30.9 billion in 2015 grew $1.3 billion or 4.2% over 2014. The recorded combine",1615,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a review of our Property-Liability results on Slide 5. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability net written premium of $30.9 billion in 2015 grew $1.3 billion or 4.2% over 2014. The recorded combined ratio for the year of 94.9 increased 1 point versus 2014 driven by an increase in auto losses, which was partially offset by lower expenses, strong homeowner underlying margins and catastrophe losses of $1.7 billion, which were 13.7% lower than 2014.
As Tom mentioned earlier, the year-end 2015 underlying combined ratio of 88.7, while 1.5 points higher than 2014, finished within our original annual guidance range given the strong results in the fourth quarter. 
Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment decreased 4.9% from the prior year due primarily to lower performance-based investment income. Property-Liability operating income in 2015 was $1.9 billion, which was 8.2% lower than 2014. 
The chart on the lower left-hand side of this page shows Property-Liability net written premium and policy in force growth rates. Red line representing policy in force growth versus prior year shows a slowing growth rate of 1.3%, given actions in place across all 3 underwriting brands to improve auto margins. Even with these headwinds, we grew policy accounts by 449,000 to 34.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The Allstate brand accounted for almost all policy growth in 2015 as Esurance policy growth slowed, and Encompass policies were lower than 2014. These policy growth results exclude 5.6 million Allstate Financial policies, which grew by 6.1% in 2015, driven by 11.1% policy growth in Allstate benefits. Average premium increases to reflect higher costs resulted in the net written premium trends you see shown by the blue line. 
Bottom right-hand side of this page shows Property-Liability recorded and underwriting -- underlying combined ratio results. The recorded and underlying combined ratios both finished the year strong compared to results earlier in the year, given our actions to improve auto returns. The underlying Property-Liability combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 87.4, and it was 2.1 points lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Slide 6 highlights the margin trends for Allstate brand auto and Allstate brand homeowners. Chart on the top left of this page provides a view of quarterly recorded and underlying margin performance for Allstate brand auto. As Tom mentioned earlier, our fourth quarter results continued to be impacted by elevated frequency and severity as they have been since the fourth quarter of 2014.
Our efforts to respond to higher cost trends through price underwriting and expense management resulted in an underlying combined ratio of 97.6 in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was 0.6 points improvement from the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, the underlying combined ratio improved by 0.5 points compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Chart on the top right highlights trends driving the change in the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continued to show upward momentum as rate increases implemented throughout 2015 resulted in a 3.9% increase in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the quarter a year ago.
Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 3.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, given the influence of higher frequency and severity but lower expenses per policy. The gap between these 2 points remains positive, but it's smaller than where it's been historically. 
Similar information is shown for Allstate brand homeowners on the bottom of this page. On the bottom left, you can see that the favorable impact from low catastrophes that we experienced for most of 2015 continued in the fourth quarter, resulting in a 71 Allstate brand homeowners recorded combined ratio.
Lower frequency of fire claims in the fourth quarter benefited the underlying homeowners combined ratio, which at 56 was 5 points below the results in the fourth quarter of 2014. Components of the fourth quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio were in the chart on the bottom right. Average earned premium per policy increased to $1,085 or 1.9% over the prior year quarter. Underlying losses per policy decreased 6.6% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a continued favorable underlying gap between the 2 trends. 
Slide 7 provides some context on combined ratio and top line trends for both Esurance and Encompass. Chart on the top of this page includes fourth quarter and annual combined ratio of results for both companies. 
Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 107 in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 8.5 points lower than the same period a year ago, given decreased investment in marketing along with a 5-point improvement in the loss ratio, which is reflective of ongoing actions taken in the business to improve auto returns. Esurance's combined ratio of 110.3 in 2015 improved by 7.4 points compared to 2014. 
Encompass's recorded combined ratio of 95.5 in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 2.4 points worse than the prior year quarter and was adversely impacted by 2.9 points of higher catastrophe losses compared to the prior year quarter. Encompass's combined ratio of 102 in 2015 was 4.1 points better than the full year result in 2014. 
Two charts on the bottom of this page show how growth is being impacted by profit improvement actions in both of the brands. In Esurance, policy in force growth slowed to 1.4% over the prior year and continued to decline sequentially while net written premium grew by 5.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same quarter a year ago. In Encompass, net written premium declined by 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as the 8.2% decline in policies in force more than offset higher average premiums from increased rates and underwriting actions. As with the Allstate brand, we continue to evaluate our results, and we'll adjust profit improvement actions to ensure returns in both of these brands are appropriate.
Slide 8 provides an update on our ongoing plan to improve auto returns. As we discussed throughout 2015, our auto profit improvement plan is comprised of 4 parts, which are designed to work together to address the higher loss trends we're experiencing. First, we have sought approval for higher auto rate across the country. Second, we've implemented underwriting changes to slow new business and address specific underperforming segments business. Along with underwriting changes, we've also increased our ongoing correct classification programs. Third, we focused on claims operational excellence and precision. And fourth, we've reduced expenses across the organization to quickly impact the combined ratio while the other components took hold. These actions in total helped us to finish 2015 within our underlying combined ratio guidance range. 
Details for the fourth quarter of 2015 are shown on the bottom of this slide. Approved auto rate increases for all 3 underwriting brands in the fourth quarter of 2015 were worth $401 million in net written premium while the total amount of approved rate increases for 2015 in total were worth $1.1 billion in net written premium, the highest amount of approved auto rate increases in over 10 years. We also continued to intentionally slow new business and make underwriting changes on isolated underperforming segments of business and geographies across the country to improve auto returns. These underwriting actions, in conjunction with our correct classification programs and price increases, have slowed new business and impacted retention. As Tom mentioned earlier, all of these actions are flexible, and they're all driven by local market conditions. We'll continue to adjust them selectively from market to market as auto returns improve. 
Maintaining claims operational excellence and precision also continue to be priorities, given cost trends that we and others in the industry are experiencing. 
Property-Liability expense ratio decreased by 2.8 points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. It was 1.2 points lower than 2014 at year-end, reflecting expense actions taken across the company. You can see the impact by underwriting brand in the chart on the lower left. These actions included reductions in advertising in the Allstate and Esurance brands as well as professional services costs and lower compensation incentives across the company. 
Bottom right-hand chart shows the net written premium amounts generated by the rates we've received approval for over the past 3 years across all 3 underwriting brands. The Allstate brand represents the largest component of these rate increases, accounting for 942 million of the 1.1 billion for the full year of 2015 and 342 million of the 401 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Rate and underwriting changes will drive customers to shop their insurance with other carriers, non-renew their policies or change their level of coverage, which will result in lower levels of premium in aggregate than what's shown on this chart. Allstate agency owners and their staff proactively consult with their customers during the insurance review process to write at the best coverage and deductible options for their specific situations and needs. We feel that having a trusted adviser to help guide customers' understanding a protection need during a period of rising auto prices across the industry is a key competitive advantage for us. 
This analysis only includes rates approved through December 31. We continue to evaluate and run our business on a local, market-by-market basis and continue to adjust our actions going forward, whether it be through price, underwriting, claims excellence or expense management to ensure appropriate auto returns. 
And now I'll turn it over to Steve, who will cover Allstate Financial investments and capital management."

Slide 9 provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 as highlighted on the top of the slide. Overall, we've made good progress in our Allstate Financial's focus and positioned the business to support long-term value creation. In 2015, we continued our efforts to fully integrate the life and retirement business into the Allstate brand customer value proposition and repositioned the investment portfolio supporting our immediate annuities. 
Premiums and contracts charges in 2015 increased 4.2% when excluding the impact of the 2014 results of Lincoln Benefit Life company, driven by 5.7% growth in Allstate Benefits accident health insurance business as well as a 7.3% increase in traditional life insurance premiums. 
Operating income for 2015 of $509 million was 16.1% lower than 2014, driven primarily by higher life insurance claims, the disposition of LBL and lower investment income. In the fourth quarter, operating income of $98 million was $30 million below the prior year quarter, driven by a lower fixed-income yield and a decrease in performance-based long-term investment income.
The bottom half of the slide depicts the liabilities and investments of our immediate annuity business. The approximately $12 billion of liabilities pay out over the next 40-plus years. Our Investment strategy is to match near-term cash flows with fixed income and commercial mortgages. However, for longer-term liabilities, we believe equity investments provide the best risk adjusted returns. As such, in the third quarter, we sold approximately $2 billion of long-duration, fixed-income securities to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates. Sale proceeds were invested in shorter duration, fixed income and public equity securities, which will lower net investment income in the near term. Over time, we will shift the majority of the proceeds to performance-based investments that we expect to deliver attractive, long-term economic returns, although income will be volatile from the quarter-to-quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 10 and investments. I'll start with our portfolio of composition, at the top of the slide. We have a diverse $77.8 billion portfolio. Fixed income represents 74% of the portfolio value, with $8.6 billion or 15% at below investment grade. 
As we have discussed previously, we are increasing and shifting the risk posture of our portfolio to deliver more attractive long-term returns. We created capacity for this incremental risk by strengthening our capital position to issuing preferred securities, reducing debt, exposure reduction to catastrophe-prone regions and shrinking our annuity business over the past 2 or 3 years. We are utilizing a portion of that capacity in our investment portfolio to increase idiosyncratic risk to performance-based investing and selectively increasing our high-yield holdings. 
Our high-yield portfolio is conservatively positioned relative to the broader market, weighted meaningfully towards a BB, and to a lesser extent, B issuers. We have also managed with underweights at certain sectors, including metals and mining and energy. 
Our portfolio breakdown by investment approach is at the bottom left. Within the context of these 4 approaches, we target asset mix that reflects our risk tolerance and liability profile. Our market-based core, by far the largest part of the portfolio, delivers predictable earnings aligned to our business needs. We seek to outperform the public markets and take advantage of volatility through our market-based active strategy. We have a growing allocation to performance-based investments, those that we term long-term and opportunistic, including private equity and real estate partnership and direct investments. 
The majority of our energy holdings shown in the middle table are investment grade corporate bonds. We are conservatively positioned versus the broader energy market, preferring midstream and higher-quality exploration and production players, which we believe are better equipped to withstand the dislocation in energy prices. With that said, this is a dynamic environment and the implications of the falling energy prices are being felt across the market. 
During the fourth quarter, $47 million of the trading losses of $82 million are the recognized impairments related to energy holdings. Losses were split between public and private securities. 
Detailed and limited partnership holdings in our performance-based, long-term strategy are shown in the table on the right. Approximately 3/4 of the investments are in private equity, including timber and agriculture, and 1/4 in real estate. Likewise, approximately 3/4 are accounted for on the equity method of accounting, or the term EMA. Our performance-based, long-term strategy had strong results despite a lower fourth quarter, with 2015 being our second highest income year. We received significant cash distributions from realizations in this portfolio, which have reduced the amount on distributed income related to our EMA investments. 
Moving on to Slide 11. Net investment income was $710 million in total for the quarter and $3.2 billion for the full year of 2015. Investment income and yield by business segment is provided at the top of the slide. In addition to a multiyear shift in the long-term mix, we continue to proactively manage the portfolio in light of current economic and market conditions. This includes reducing the duration of our fixed income holdings in both the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios, with the belief that the markets were not providing sufficient compensation for taking interest rate risk in the low yield environment. 
To the left is Property-Liability. We reduced our interest rate risk in this portfolio in 2013, which resulted in a lower yield in The Allstate Financial portfolio. The yield is now increasing, reflecting our increased allocation to high-yield bonds as well as reinvestment into higher interest rates and our continued shift of the portfolio to performance-based, long-term investments. 
To the right is Allstate Financial. We took actions in 2015 to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates, as I covered a bit earlier in talking about the immediate annuity business, which reflected in a lower interest-bearing yield in 2015.
Moving to the bottom half of the slide, at the left is our GAAP total return. The investment income component of the return has been fairly consistent while the valuation contribution was negative in 2015 on wider credit spreads across the market, with the majority attributed in our returns to investment grade securities given the weight in our portfolio. 
In the middle is our realized capital gains and losses. In 2015, we had a net capital gain of $30 million, which included $470 million of net gains on sales, including the gains on long-duration, fixed-income securities we sold in the Allstate Financial portfolio, largely offset by impairments and intent write downs. The impact of lower valuations can be seen in the decrease on our fixed-income unrealized gains in the chart to the right. 
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capital position and highlights the cash returns common shareholders received throughout 2015. Allstate remains in a position of financial strength and strategic flexibility. Our deployable holding company assets totaled $2.6 billion at December 31, 2015. Book value per common share was $47.34 as of year-end 2015, down 1.9% from 2014, reflecting lower unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed-income securities. Excluding this impact, book value per common share was 4.2% in 2015 versus 2014. 
We returned $3.3 billion in cash to common shareholders in 2015 through the combination of common dividends and common share repurchases. We repurchased 9.3 million common shares for $573 million during the fourth quarter of 2015, which brought the annual total to 42.8 million shares, 10.2% of our beginning-of-year common shares outstanding. As at December 31, we have $532 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by July 2016.

And if you look at it over the quarters, you can see we increasingly reduced our expenses throughout the year, which was a focus. That said, there are a number of things we're investing heavily in and want to invest in terms of either long-term growth or short-term growth, everything from technology, I mentioned, to things like telematics.

So we look at paid, incurred, incurred but not reported, and we come up with a number. Obviously, for things like physical damage claims, where they're really settled out in about 90 days, that tends to run through pretty quickly. The bodily injury, where it takes about 4 years before you get 80% paid out, has a little bit longer trend line on it. And as a result of that longer trend line, you tend to have more process changes along the way because you do things differently every year, and so that number tends to bounce around a little more.

Even within the ones that are somewhat manageable, like new business quality and volume of new business and geographic mix, there's also some things that you just can't predict. Seasonality and weather, especially, is one of those completely unpredictable pieces of this puzzle. And so when we look at year-over-year, you can look back, we have some charts that show fourth quarter seasonality that tend to spike up. And then you have last year, where we had almost no catastrophes and benign weather. And this year, a much more normalized catastrophe year, but, I'd say, also a more normalized weather environment. Seasonality is one of those high-level generalities that tends to pan out over multiple years, but you can have dislocations and aberrations in that on a year-by-year and quarter-by-quarter basis.

My other question -- look, I listened to your prepared remarks and I know you're going to invest in the future, and homeowners can change a little bit, but you did an 88.7% underlying combined ratio firm wide for 2015, and you have 5.5% rate increases coming through on the auto side. And you have guided to 88% to 90% underlying for 2016. It seems to me a very hard thing to believe that there's a world where the underlying combined ratio is going to be worse in 2016 than it was in 2015. Are you just being conservative? Or I mean, do you really think that, that's the right range in -- at 89% with a plus or minus 1 around it?"

You get a 1-point swing either away from frequency and severity. I mean, you can get -- as Matt mentioned, you can't predict frequency. And to be honest, it's really difficult to predict severity within 1 point. So that alone gives you a 2-point spread. There have been some years, Josh, where we've had a 3-point spread, but that was when we weren't sure how quickly the homeowners business was going to take hold. And we did quite well. We got ahead of that, and it was faster than we had done in our modeling. But we do a lot of statistical modeling around this. We think it's about right. I mean, if you -- you're right, we -- you will see a lot of rate come through that, so $1.1 billion. And if loss costs and -- which is a result of frequency and severity, keep going up, which is what we have in our projections, we'll put more in rate increases. So no, we think it's the right number. I'm not -- we set it up to get there. And if you want to assume your case, then that would be in the middle range. We don't get so precise that we do it to 0.1 points.

What Slide 15 does is show what we believe is one of the primary drivers of frequency. As we've talked about on almost every call, frequency is driven by primarily miles driven but also weather, distracted driving, new business volume, new business quality and underwriting. And miles driven itself is driven by employment rate and gas prices, and we know what's happened to both of those over this last year. One of the confusing things is that I have referred in the past to the fact that the frequency trend is widespread, but I think some of you have taken that to mean that it is consistent across the country. It is widespread, but it is not consistent across the country. In fact, it's geographically varied. And Slide 15 is just some data from the Federal Highway Administration that shows how miles driven as of November versus prior year has gone up in each of the different regions. And you'll notice that in the Northeast, it only went up 2.9; while in the west, it went up 5.5; and South Atlantic, 5.1, et cetera. So this is one driver, but it's a major driver. And it does help to explain some of the other questions that you've been raising about why different companies have different experiences. They have different geographic concentrations of their business, their books of business, and the miles driven in those areas is different. It will clearly impact results."

Bob, first, remember, when we acquired Esurance, we did it for the strategic reason of going into the lower right-hand corner with the self-serve, brand-sensitive customer and really focusing the customer value proposition against the GEICO and Progressive direct models. And when we acquired it, what we said we were going to do was run it for economics as opposed to GAAP accounting. So as you know, in the direct model, you expense all your marketing expenses upfront. And as a result, the first year or the first quarter looks particularly bad when you're growing. But then in later years, you tend to make money as the business retains, and you don't have to spend the marketing again. As Tom said, the business in now twice as large as it was when we acquired it a little over 4 years ago. It does have a meaningful impact on where Allstate reports. And with twice as much growth, we were having some pressure on the loss ratio. And so what we decided to do this year was slow the growth down, really focus on getting more efficiency out of our model. That meant both on the marketing side and on the operations side. And I would tell you I'm absolutely delighted with how they responded and how the business is doing. I mean, you talk about slowing down dramatically, it's still growing about 5% in the fourth quarter and more than that for the year. Not as high as it had been, but given the reduction in marketing, still a good growth rate. And the underlying combined ratio is down over 8 points from last year in the quarter, so feel really good about where they are. Having said that, I would echo what Tom said. The business is at scale. It could run at this size with meaningful growth rates, I think, and certainly do it in an economic way. But we do want to grow the business in the future as aggressively as we can. We just want to do it with a balance of profitability and growth. We felt that was getting a little out of kilter a year or 18 months ago. We're getting it back in line now, feel good about what they're doing. And the one other thing that amplifies is, I think Tom mentioned it in his comments, we had 4 points of investment in 2015 that shows up in the combined ratio, but you don't get the benefit of those investments in the current year. Things like expanding homeowners, which is now in 25 states; renters, which is in 20 states; motorcycle in 11; auto continues to expand to 43 states and 1, Ontario, in Canada as well. And so we are investing heavily in building our capabilities for the future, building out features and expanding our footprint. So we have -- I think the answer to your question is we have very aggressive growth plans for the future. We're investing heavily in that, but we want to make sure that we balance that with the economics and the reported results on a current basis."

We did add -- it was a good catch on your part, Kai. We added the acquire to the build long-term growth platforms. Long-term growth platforms are the ones we're building to include things like telematics and what we're doing in roadside and Allstate Benefits and those things. We think if we need to acquire something to help accelerate those efforts, well, we would do that. Secondly, we believe that there is additional capacity in, particularly the Allstate agency channel, but also some in Esurance to pick up adjacent products and services, which are consistent with protecting and preparing people, particularly as Matt makes progress on the trusted adviser model in the Allstate agency channel. We think there are other things we could sell in. We could even decide we wanted to get into the business, do filings, create the product and that kind of stuff if it's unique enough. Or if somebody has a platform that we can buy and we can bolt it onto ours, we would do that. So that's the concept behind acquisitions.

Kai, so you correctly pointed out that it's customer-based, so it's all about customer centricity and using innovation effectiveness and efficiency, not just to manage financials and manage margins, but to better serve our customers. And there's 3 primary tracks of work going on under that category. The first, as Tom just mentioned, is trusted adviser. And trusted adviser is all the work we have under way to help our agency owners and their staff and our exclusive financial specialists better serve our customers through personalized, customized, tailored solutions, geographically based that are advice based, not product pushed, that are solutions as opposed to transactions and based on long-term value relationships. And so we have a lot of work under way there, and that goes to both the effectiveness of our agency system as a distribution model and the efficiency with which we put through product. The second major line of work that we have under way is we refer to it as our continuous improvement; others refer to it as lean engineering. And we've installed continuous improvement in a good portion of the company already. It's a set of management principles and practices that empower frontline employees, get them involved in root-cause problem solving, create flow of information, create an environment where they're engaged in their work. And we have seen dramatic increases in productivity and efficiency of those operations that we've installed continuous improvement. We've also seen a greater customer -- I'm sorry, customer satisfaction and employee engagement in those areas. The third, and this is on really the innovation inside, the track of work we have under way, we refer to it as Integrated Digital Enterprise, but you've also heard we refer to it as a set of projects that take data, predictive analytics and emerging technologies and combine those capabilities to better serve customers. And that includes a range of things that both use internal sources of data as well as external sources of data to provide more predictive guidance to our agency owners in serving their customers, to help them better serve those customers, tell them what the next logical product for them might be and to use those emerging technologies to deliver that in a way that's more accepted by the customer, more intuitive to the customer and is more respectful of the customer's time and energy. And so you will continue to see a lot of focus there. As Tom referred to in his opening remarks, as he explained why the expense ratio may float up a little bit, we will continue to invest in all these core initiatives because they're all about long-term value creation. If we're able to better serve our customers through innovation, effectiveness and efficiency, we will create a more valuable organization.

Two questions, one is, you're obviously taking action as you've talked at length about to improve the auto profitability. And you suggested that, certainly, the effect will depend partly on what your competitors do. Question is, what are your competitors doing? What are you seeing out there? And then, secondly, relative to miles driven. Arguably, one of the reasons is lower fuel prices. Would you suspect that oil going from $100 down to $40 has a bigger effect than oil going from $40 to $30? In other words, the effect one might suggest would be declining over time."

Those are 2 really good questions. First of all, what we are seeing by part of our competitors, some of our competitors is -- a significant rate action in the filings that we're reviewing as we make our filings, we see competitor rate filings as well. Some of them are quite significant. Some of them are more moderate. Most of it depends upon -- if you look back 3 or 4 years, the level of rates, they started this period. And so those who had a greater gap to cover in order to deal with the frequency and severity pressure are taking greater rate. So we expect that to generate some increased turmoil in the environment, and it will certainly generate shopping behavior in the industry. And shopping behavior can be a positive or a negative depending upon how you approach it, where you're positioned. It's all part of competition. So we're -- we believe we're well positioned. We believe we're prepared for it. We believe we're monitoring their actions, but we're mostly focused on what we need to do to earn appropriate returns and serve our customers. And so I would say our primary focus is always managing our own business with an eye towards what the competitors are doing as opposed to trying to react to competitors all the time, which I find can just drive you crazy. On your second question, it's a great point. There is a point of diminishing impact with gas prices on miles driven. We've always said that we thought the unemployment rate and economic activity had even a greater impact than the gas prices, because economic activity impacts employment driving, and gas prices typically impact only discretionary driving activities. Because if you have to go to work, you have to go to work, and you're going to pay $3 a gallon or you're going to pay $1.90 a gallon. If you're thinking about a vacation this summer and you're deciding whether to stay home or drive down to Florida, if gas is at $1.60, it's probably going to influence you differently than if gas was at $3.50 a gallon. Now there is a point at which though it's just plain cheap, and it's no longer a question. And I think we're probably at that point, so I think you're correct in that. From what we look at, we think the biggest influence of the drop in gas prices has already occurred. And it's unlikely that, that will drive much further increase in miles driven. But that being said, we also don't know what economic activity is going to look like and what all the other influences on frequency will look like."

This quarter shows, really why we're in business, which is to protect people when disaster strikes. Overall, operating profit is down largely because of 2 significant hailstorms in Texas in March. At the same time, good progress is made in improving the underlying combined ratio for auto insurance, and the homeowners business continue to generate margins that enable us to handle large catastrophe losses like we saw in March, and still generated good return for shareholders. 
So as you know, a severe weather creates a need for our customers to be protected, the increasing market these days, and Allstate does an excellent job of helping customers when these events happen. 
In Texas, we have over 1,100 local agencies, many of whom are close to our customers that are impacted by these hailstorms, so that they can help provide initial claim response. We also have about 1,200 specially trained catastrophe adjusters on the ground in Texas with the expertise, technology and relationships that enable our customers to rebuild after these storms. 
If you go to Slide 2, I'll begin by reviewing the overall results in prior and Steve will discuss the results in greater detail. As always, Matt Winter, our President is here; as is Don Civgin, who leads the Emerging Businesses; and Samuel Pilch, our Corporate Controller. 
Net income for the quarter was $217 million and operating commission was $322 million or $0.84 per share. The largest driver of the variance in last year's first quarter was catastrophe losses, which increased from by $533 million to $827 million. The underlying combined ratio was 87.2 as the auto profitability actions we put in place were Allstate Esurance and Encompass, all made progress in the first quarter, where we ended 2015. 
Allstate brand homeowners insurance had a recorded combined ratio of 93.4 for the quarter, despite the significant catastrophe losses. The recorded combined ratio was 82.3 for the last 12 months. 
From an investment perspective, we had what felt like a whole year of volatility in the first 3 months of the year, and ended up with a 2% total return on the portfolio, reflecting 3 components. Interest income for the fixed income portfolio, good returns from performance-based investments and a decline in interest rates over the 3-month period. Total return over the last 12 months was only 1.3%, which reflected the lower returns in the fixed income investment in the last 3 quarters of 2015, given the general uptrend in interest rates. 
But net investment income declined 14%, as a result of our strategy to create additional shareholder value by increasing performance-based investments. where risk-adjusted returns are higher, or reported accounting can fluctuate in the short-term. 2/3 of the decline in investment income reflects the performance-based annualized yield of 9.4% in the first quarter of 2016 versus an outstanding 17.5% in the first quarter of 2015. 
As a result of the underlying strength of Allstate businesses, the board authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which is in addition to the 10% dividend increase that was approved in February. We also made progress on the 5 operating priorities established in 2016. Customers of course were at the strategy and better serving them will create additional growth and profit. Our internal measures of overall customers had did deteriorated slightly, as we raised auto insurance prices to reflect the increasing number in costs of auto accidents. That said, we made progress in some of the underlying drivers through expansion of continous improvement program and good expense control. 
Overall, economic returns on capital improved, as the auto profitability plan progresses. Homeowners stay strong and we position the investment portfolio to align with our liability structure. Well, not the same, as economic capital, the operating return on book activity was 10% for the last 12 months, and it was 8% on net income basis. 
Growing the number of customer relationships also faced headwinds, as we adopted the increasing costs of providing auto insurance. Profit liability items of course were comparable to a year-ago, but were down from where we ended 2015. We did have great growth through Allstate benefits. Work side business, which added over 0.5 million policy over the last 12 months. Steve will discuss how we proactively manage the investment portfolio. The progress was also made and expanded in managed insurance offerings both in terms of customer offering and the number of customers. At over 1 million active connections leaders, we're amongst the leaders in the connected car space. 
Let's go to Slide 3, which provides an overview of the first quarter operating results for our 4 Property-Liability customer segments. Starting at the top, overall Property-Liability policies of course were comparable to a year ago, as a result of implementing auto profit improvement plans in all 3 underwritten brands. Net written premiums still increased, however, as we raised average prices. The quarter combined ratio was 98.4 and underlying combined ratio was 87.2. We've not changed our full year guidance for the underlying combined ratio from 88 to 90. 
Moving to the lower left with the Allstate brand. This is our largest segment comprising 90% of premiums written and it service customers, who prefer branded products and value local advice and assistance. Allstate brand total policies growth slowed in the first quarter to 0.4% that's from the prior year's quarter. As a result our targeted actions to improve underlying auto profitability. Auto policies grew by 0.5% from the prior-year quarter, impacted by the slowdown in new business and a decline in retention. Auto written premium growth was 4.7% for the quarter, driven by the positive average premium growth of 4.8%, and that the impact of the rate increases continue to flow into the results. 
Homeowner policies grow the prior-year by 0.6%, now the personal lines by 1.8%, both slowing sequentially, given the impact of auto actions that had on customers, who prefer to bundle their insurance products. 
The Allstate brand underlying combined ratio was a strong 86.1 for the fourth quarter, as shown in the highlighted red box at the bottom. Esurance on lower right, serves customers that prefer branded product, they're comfortable handling their own insurance needs. A 1% decline in policies was more than offset by 5.2% increase in average auto premium, so the net written premium increased by 2.5%,  As you know, we intentionally slowed the growth of Esurance last year to better position this business for long-term growth, since it was normalized when we acquired in 2011. 
The underlying loss ratio has come down to 73.1 in the first quarter of 2016, which is improved by 5.1 points compared to the first quarter of 2015. As a result, the underlying combined ratio declined to 105, which includes of about 3.4 points related to a number of expansion efforts. We do expect to launch new advertising campaign for Esurance this year to accelerate growth. 
Encompass in upper left, competes for customers that want local advice, but are less concerned about the choice in insurance company. And they mostly purchased through independent agencies. We took aggressive action to improve profitability in both auto and homeowners insurance in 2015, and consequently policies declined by 9.6% from a year-ago. The underlying combined ratio was 88.3 for the first quarter, 2.3 points better than the prior year, but as you can see, the recorded combined ratio was 105.8 and, that's because Encompasses performance was also significantly impacted by catastrophe losses in the quarter. 
And financial on the upper right. Serves brand-new to the customers, who are comfortable doing serving themselves, and that increased nonproprietary written premiums by 1.3% in the first quarter of 2016 to $151 million. 
I'll will now go through the Property-Liability results in more details.."

I'll begin with a review of our Property-Liability results on Slide 4. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability earned premium of $7.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016, was 4% higher than same period last year. Recorded combined ratio of 98.4, increased 4.7 points versus the first quarter of 2015, driven by the $827 million catastrophe losses, Tom mentioned earlier, while the underlying combined ratio of 87.2 improved by 1.8 points. 
Net investment income of $302 million for the Property-Lability segment decreased 15.6% from the prior-year quarter, driven by a decline in performance-based investment income, which had strong results in 2015. As a result, Property-Liability operating income in the first quarter was $291 million, which was $264 million lower than the first quarter of last year. 
Chart on the lower left-hand side of this page shows Property-Lability net written premium and policy enforced growth rates. The red line represents policy in force growth versus the prior year, and shows the policy growth was comparable to the prior-year quarter, given actions in place across all 3 underwritten brands to improve auto returns. Blue line on this chart shows net written premium grew by 2.9% in the first quarter of 2016, as average premium continued to increase. Bottom right-hand side of this page shows the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio results. 
Let's go first to the red line, which shows the recorded Property-Liability combined ratio in the first quarter of 2016 was 98.4. Which was 4.7 points higher than the first quarter of 2015 result of 93.7, but included 6.7 more points in catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio was 87.2 shown by the blue bar was 1.8 points below the first quarter of 2015. 
Slide 5 provides an update on our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan, which is comprised of 4 parts. First, we're seeking approval for higher auto prices. In the first quarter, we received approval to increase rates by $335 million annually, which is on top of the $1.1 billion of increases approved last year, as you can see, from the bar chart on the lower left. The impact of these approvals on average premium for Allstate brand auto is shown on the lower right. Average gross premium for policy increased by 4.8% in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium per policy, which lags increased by 3.8%. Keep in mind, Allstate brand auto rechanges takes 6 months to be fully recognized and average gross written premium, while it takes 12 months to full year net. Secondly, we underwriting guidance in 2015 to reduce new businesses and underperforming segments. As we achieved target underwriting results, these guidelines are being modified. Focus on claims operational excellence and precision is always a priority for Allstate brand auto, property damage severity increased 7.5% in the first quarter of 2016, which is a rate of increase, we believe to be higher than what could be explained by inflationary increases. Continued stress on the auto repair industry from higher industry frequency, cost of repairing newer, more complex vehicles, the higher total loss volumes caused steadily increasing claim severity. Our team is working to address these industry challenges and create a competitive advantage for Allstate. 
Property lability expensed by 1.7 points in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter of 2015, reflecting lower marketing cost and expense reductions. Marketing was purposely reduced given the rate and underlying actions we were implementing providing the opportunity to enhance our marketing programs. New campaigns for both Allstate and Esurance will be launching this year. 
Slide 6 highlights the benefits of these profit improvement actions for Allstate brand auto and the continued of Allstate brand homeowners. 
Chart on the top left of this page provides a view of the quarterly recorded and underlying combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9 in the first quarter of 2016 was 3/10 of a point higher than the first quarter a year ago, reflecting continued higher levels of frequency and higher severity. While property damaged frequency in the first 3 months of 2016 moderated somewhat from prior quarters, still increased on a fee-based by over 2%. As we've discussed, frequency is evaluated on a gross and paid basis for a variety of reasons such as managing claims staffing, validating cost trends and estimating ultimate losses. To provide additional transparency into how these measures relate, we added a footnote to the investors supplement that isolates the impact that, including fixed objects hit by a vehicle headon frequency, which is likely larger than on the paid frequency basis. These types of changes are accounted for and our process had no impact on pricing or our financial results. Chart on the top right highlights drivers of Allstate brand auto combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy shown by the blue line continue to increase, as crude rates result in the 4.7% increase in the premiums written in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter a year ago.  Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the first quarter of 2016 increased by 0.1%, compared with the first quarter of 2015, due to high frequency and severity and was partially offset by lower expenses per policy. The positive gap between these 2 strands widened in the first quarter earned premium growth outpaced the increased lost cost in the quarter. On a sequential basis, the underlying combined ratio improved by 1.7 points compared to fourth quarter of 2015, due mainly to improve loss ratio. Allstate brand homeowners results are shown on the bottom of this page. On the bottom left you can see the significant impact in the first quarter of 2016 given the gap between blue column and the red line. On an underlying basis continued favorable non-catastrophe frequency and severity and lower expenses resulted in a 59.4 underlying combined ratio in the quarter, which is 5.1 points lower than the prior-year quarter. The components of the first quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are in the chart on the bottom right. Average earned premium per policy increased to $1,091 or 2.2% over the prior-year quarter, while underlying loss and expense per policy decreased by 5.8%. On a sequential basis, the underling combined ratio rose by 3.4 points from a very favorable 56 in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Slide 7 provides a view of the financial trends for both Esurance and Encompass. The charts on top of this page show the component parts of the combined ratio for both brands. Esurance's combined ratio of 106.2 in the first quarter of 2016 was 11.6 points lower than the same period a year ago, reflecting decreased marketing investment, along with a 4.4 point improvement in the loss ratio, due to ongoing actions from improved auto returns. Encompasses recorded combined ratio of 105.8 in the first quarter of 2016, was adversely affected by catastrophe losses that were 7 points higher than the prior-year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of Encompass of 88.3 was 2.3 points lower than the first quarter year ago, result of ongoing underwriting and pricing changes to achieve target margins. 
Charts on the bottom of this page show how growth is being impacted by cost improvement actions in both brands. In Esurance, policies declined by 1% compared to the first quarter of 2015, while net written premium grew by 2.5% compared to the same quarter a year ago, and Encompass net written premium declined by 6.7% in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter of 2015, as the 9.6% decline in policies in force more than offset  higher average premium from increased rates. 
Now, I'll turn it over to Steve."

Slide 8 provides overview of Allstate Financial's results for the first quarter of 2016. There are 3 main businesses of Allstate Financial with a total of 600 policies outstanding.

There are 3 main businesses of Allstate Financial with a total of 600 policies outstanding. The life insurance business that provides product sold to agencies, Allstate Benefits, which provide life, disability and health products and an annuity business, which is largely business. We began to reposition Allstate Financial in 2006, when we exited the variable annuity business then accelerate the repositioning post the financial crisis in a low interest rate environment. 
The bar chart on the upper left show how this has impacted the balance sheet over the last 4 years with total reserves declining by $21 million, due to exiting the broker-dealer and bank channels and the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Notice that the gray bar representing immediate and resreves to constant. While these annuity begin paying out benefits immediately upon issuance, they have extremely long lives. The current financial results are shown in the upper right. Premiums and contract charges increased 5.4% in the quarter versus the prior year driven by 9.6% growth of Allstate Benefits and increase in traditional life insurance products. Net investment income declined to $419 million 13.4%, as we saw long-duration fixed-income bond annuity portfolio in the third quarter of 2015. These sales harvested the gain on these funds in declining interest rates. The proceeds will be shifted over time to performance-based investments, which are expected to generate higher long-term returns. I will discuss this in more detail on the next slide. 
Operating income was $104 million for the first quarter, reflecting the decline in investment income. As you can see from the chart on the bottom, the decline was concentrated in the annuity business. 
Moving on to Slide 9. You can see the shift in investing allocation for the Allstate Financial portfolio. We have reduced investment rates fixed income security shown in blue from 68% to 60%. Increased our holdings in investments for asset-specific performance drive more return such as limited partnerships and equity. The shift to public equity and performance-based investments is expected to deliver increased long-term returns over time. The chart on the bottom left is based on historical return data from 1,800 to 2015. On average, regardless of the time equities have historically outperformed fixed income, as you can see, from the gray On the right table is measured by the 99% loss levels for fixed income is lower than up and equities over a 1-year time period. By 10 years, the risk of loss is the same, but returns more than double. As we can hold the investment back in annuity resreves for a long period of time, performance-based assets are expected to generally shareholder value. However, the challenge from a financial reporting perspective is these returns fluctuate quarterly impacting recorded operating income. The chart at the bottom right show that our performance-based long-term earned yield and returns fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the 10-year internal rate of written has traded consistently in the range of long-term return target above 10%. 
On Slide 10, our GAAP total return on investment portfolio shown at the upper left was 2% for the first quarter. The investment income component of written has been fairly consistent and valuations were positive in 2016, as fixed income market increased on lower interest rates. The unrealized gain on the portfolio increased to about $2 billion, as you can see, on the upper right. Overall, investment income of $731 million was 14% lower in the first quarter of 2015, up 2/3 of this decline reflects a good return from performance-based investments, 9.4% on an annualized basis versus what was a great quarter a year ago. Investment income and yield by business segment are provided at the bottom of the slide, to left is Property-Liability. We reduced our interest rate risk in this portfolio in 2013, and yield is now increasing reflecting our increased allocation by higher bond and performance-based long-term investment. 
As I noted earlier, we took actions last year to reduce interest rate risk in the Allstate Financial portfolio and began to increase performance-based investments backing the immediate annuity portfolio. When we realized capital gains shorter duration lowered the interest-bearing yield to 4.5% as shown in the black line chart to the right. We are currently well positioned to shift to performance-based investment as well as to extend the duration of our fixed income portfolio at the appropriate time. 
Slide 11 provides overview of our capital strength and cash returns in the first quarter of 2016. Also remains in a position of financial strength and flexibility. We finished the first quarter of 2016 with $20.3 billion of shareholders equity and deployable holding company assets of $2.9 billion. During April 2016, we completed the $3 billion share repurchase authorization that was last year. And, as Tom mentioned, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1.5 billion program yesterday to be completed no later than November 2017. 
Generally, we fund our annual share repurchase activity with net income with any capital need to retain to grow the business and pay our common dividend. Our repurchase activity has been enhanced over the past few years by a number of proactive capital and mismanagement actions. For example, the actions we undertook to strengthen the balance sheet by issuing hybrid security, deferred stock, able to return capital in excess of net income over the past 3 years. The sale of looking benefit like 2014 been an additional $1.2 billion of capital, which also used to repurchase common shares. 
In the last 12 months, we repurchased 9% of outstanding shares increasing pro rata ownership and earnings per share leverage. Since the beginning of 2010, we repurchased 36% of year-end 2009 outstanding common shares, and have paid $2.8 billion in common dividends, representing a total of $12.2 billion return of capital to common shareholders.

Everything that Tom just said is true and that would be true, if we were in a completely static environment, but we're not. So we're in still moving environment. So we did see auto frequency moderate in the first quarter compared to the last half of 2015. And as a result, you said because of the rate taken average aunts has begin outpacing loss cost trends in the quarter, that's a really good thing. But we are questioning whether some of the moderation of frequency may have been due to weather in the first quarter, we don't know. But we're not sure exactly, whether or not we've seen the rise, the end of the rise in auto frequency and stabilization or just normal fluctuation. So from that perspective, we continue to execute on our profit improvement plan. And we we refine that profit improvement plan, as time goes on, and we get more information, greater clarity on the trend line and that's true not only on frequency, but it's true on severity, as well. As you've seen, I'm sure you've seen fourth quarter cash back, it showed a clear acceleration across the industry in PD and collision severity that's due to total loss is up higher cost to repair more complex cars number parts replaced of different factors. Allstate has historically outperformed and industry in managing those cost. It looks like in first Quarter, we may have given up some of that advantage due to responding to high catastrophe load and increased frequency, but our goal is to get back to our competitive position there and lead the industry. But the end result of all of that is that we'll continue to execute all 4 components of the profit improvement plan, we'll continue to monitor the emergency of frequencies and severity trends, and we'll ensure that we are keeping pace with loss cost trends, because we know that once you fall behind those, it's really hard due to the time and time we refer to really have to catch up quickly."

First, if you recall, we acquired Esurance for strategic reasons. So that we could grow in the segment, where customers wanted soft service and We have from the very beginning been running Esurance from an economic value basis as oppose to GAAP. So with the difference in accounting the advertising being you spend it. If you run it through GAAP combined ratio, it is quality driver. So we've been looking at economic value. The businesses is twice the size of of roughly when we bought it. The GAAP numbers do matter, because it's going to be an increasing size of the Allstate portfolio. So they have spent the last roughly 2 years working to improve the performance of the business on a profitability basis. They've improved the loss ratio -- they've also had some operational catch up, because, while it's a direct business it isn't all done online we still have, we still have customers take, we still have call centers. I'm really happy with the progress they've made. The combined ratio is in much better shape than it was a year ago. The number you're looking at the underlying 105 includes, as Tom mentioned, 3.4 points of investment in product expansion and geographic expansion does not currently paying up from the current period. Underneath that, the loss ratio improved by over 4 points over last year. So very happy with where it is. You're right, it's still over 100, but out of that 105, I think you can take a look at investment of 3.4 points out. And then there is still some room on the expenses for them to bring both advertising and on advertising expenses down. So I feel good about where they are. As far as the growth, he is that in grow this year, but in the first quarter, but they also spent 36% in the market, that started direct correlation, but they are running a better more effective business and, as Tom said, we're feeling good about that it is.

As far as the DI severity and why it's down. Yes, you are correct. We did have talked to you about our enhancement handling program. It's a part of that is an attempt to get through the quickly especially that have enhanced injuries. And so a lot of the decrease in DI severity that you saw last quarter was a mix issue, because we are paying a lot more current claims, the more current claims tend to be lower severity claims that's one of the reason we're seeing DI frequency up a little this quarter because we handle a bunch of the work claims and we went through them. And so, you only have that volatility and results and longtail coverages and there is a lot of complexity in DI. So it's hard to look at DI paid severity on quarter-by-quarter basis and make any sense out of the to look at on the longer term basis and you have to look at it in conjunction with the frequency to see how much is of that volatility is influenced by mix.

So with this time to make sure we are competitive and marked by give our customers would return handle the volatility. Part because we had that volatility our shareholders getting would return, which based on required capital levels we had initially in the lower part of the 80s. That said, because we've improved the profitability we now need to keep less capital and so we manage stuff dynamically and we're always looking at that one of the life of return on capital by state, by territory and we are just. So I think you should expect just to continue to deliver good risk-adjusted returns are our shareholder is given what we're willing to take on the volatility of quarters like this quarter."

And now we're going to put it in the longer term investment that obviously, takes a, while to get invested, so you earn as Steve point out, we like to try to get about 10% on that. It takes a, while to get that invested and actually get a 10%, because it doesn't have on day 1. Secondly, it also mix us put up more capital because the regular tree schemes that when you're investing up performance-based investments you put more capital then he would put us here?

So we continue to work hard on, we've been taking capital of Allstate Financial for 3 years or something. So make sense, we can do that, next time we can use financing techniques and a variety way to do it, we continue to work on how do we raise the return on capital particularly as it relates to annuity businesses.

This quarter shows, really why we're in business, which is to protect people when disaster strikes. Overall, operating profit is down largely because of 2 significant hailstorms in Texas in March. At the same time, good progress is made in improving the underlying combined ratio for auto insurance. And the homeowners business continued to generate margins that enable us to handle large catastrophe losses like we saw in March and still generated good return for shareholders.  
So as you know, a severe weather creates a need for our customers to be protected, so increasing market these days, and Allstate does an excellent job of help the customers when these events happen. 
In Texas, we have over 1,100 local agencies, many of whom are close to our customers that are impacted by these hailstorms so that they can help provide initial claim response. We also have about 1,200 specially trained catastrophe adjusters on the ground in Texas with the expertise, technology and relationships that enable our customers to rebuild after these storms. 
If we go to Slide 2, I'll begin by reviewing the overall results and priorities and the Pat and Steve will discuss the results in greater detail. As always, Matt Winter, our President is here; as is Don Civgin, who leads the Emerging Businesses; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. 
Net income for the quarter was $217 million and operating income was $322 million or $0.84 per share. The largest driver of the variance from last year's first quarter was catastrophe losses, which increased from -- by $533 million to $827 million. The underlying combined ratio was 87.2 as the auto profitability actions we've put in place for Allstate, Esurance and Encompass, all made progress in the first quarter from where we ended 2015. 
Allstate brand homeowners insurance had a recorded combined ratio of 93.4 for the quarter, despite the significant catastrophe losses. The recorded combined ratio was 82.3 for the last 12 months. 
From an investment perspective, we had what felt like a whole year of volatility in the first 3 months of the year and ended up with a 2% total return on the portfolio, reflecting 3 components. Interest income for the fixed income portfolio, good returns from performance-based investments and a decline in interest rates over the 3-month period.  Total return over the last 12 months was only 1.3%, which reflected the low returns in the fixed income investments in the last 3 quarters of 2015, given the general uptrend in interest rates. 
But net investment income declined 14%, as a result of our strategy to create additional shareholder value, by increasing performance-based investments, where risk-adjusted returns are higher or reported accounting income fluctuated in the short-term. 2/3 of the decline in investment income reflects the performance-based annualized yield of 9.4% in the first quarter of 2016 versus an outstanding 17.5% in the first quarter of 2015. 
As a result of the underlying strength of Allstate businesses, the board authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which is an addition to the 10% dividend increase that was approved in February. 
We also made progress on the 5 operating priorities established for 2016. Customers, of course, were at the heart of our strategy and better serving them will create additional growth and profit. Our internal measures of overall customer satisfaction had did deteriorated slightly as we raised auto insurance prices to reflect the increasing number in costs of auto accidents. That said, we made progress in some of the underlying drivers through expansion of continuous improvement programs and good expense control. 
Overall, economic returns on capital improved as the auto profitability plan progresses, homeowners stay strong and we position the investment portfolio to align with our liability structure. While not the same as economic capital, the operating return on book activity was 10% for the last 12 months and it was 8% on a net income basis. 
Growing the number of customer relationships also faced headwinds as we adapted to increasing costs of providing auto insurance. Profit liability items, of course, were comparable to a year-ago, but were down from where we ended 2015. We did have great growth through Allstate benefits worksite business, which added over 0.5 million policies over the last 12 months. Steve will discuss how we proactively manage the investment portfolio. But progress was also made and expanded in telematics insurance offering both in terms of customer offerings and the number of customers. And over 1 million active connections were amongst the leaders in the connected car space. 
Let's go to Slide 3, which provide an overview of the first quarter operating results for our 4 Property-Liability customer segments. Starting at the top, overall Property-Liability policies, of course, were comparable to a year ago as a result of implementing auto profit improvement plans in all 3 underwritten brands. Net written premium still increased, however, as we raised average prices. The reported combined ratio was 98.4 and underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 87.2. We have not changed our full year guidance for the underlying combined ratio from 88 to 90. 
Moving to the lower left for the Allstate brand. This is our largest segment comprising 90% of premiums written, and it serves customers who prefer branded product and value local advice and assistance. Allstate brand total policies in forth growth slowed in the first quarter to 0.4%, that's from the prior year's quarter, as a result our targeted actions to improve underlying auto profitability. Auto policies in force grew by 0.5% from the prior-year quarter, impacted by the slowdown in new business and a decline in retention. Auto written premium growth was 4.7% for the quarter, driven by the positive average premium growth of 4.8%, and that says the impact of the rate increases continues to flow into results. 
Homeowner policies grew over the prior year by 0.6%, the personal lines grew by 1.8%, both slowing sequentially, given the impact of auto actions that had on customers who prefer to bundle their insurance products. 
The Allstate brand underlying combined ratio was a strong 86.1 for the fourth quarter, as shown in the highlighted red box at the bottom. 
Esurance, in lower right, serves customers that prefer a branded product for the comfortable handling their own insurance needs. A 1% decline in policies in force was more than offset by a 5.2% increase in average auto premium, so the net written premium increased by 2.5%. As you know, we intentionally slowed the growth of Esurance last year to better position this business for long-term growth, since it was [indiscernible] when we acquired it in 2011. 
The underlying loss ratio has come down to 73.1 in the first quarter of 2016, which is improved by 5.1 points compared to the first quarter of 2015. As a result, the underlying combined ratio declined to 105, which includes about 3.4 points [indiscernible] related to a number of expansion efforts. We do expect to launch new advertising campaign for Esurance this year to accelerate growth. 
Encompass, in upper left, competes for customers that want local advice but are less concerned about the choice of insurance company. And they mostly purchase through independent agencies. We took aggressive action to improve profitability in both auto and homeowners insurance in 2015, and consequently, policies in force declined by 9.6% from a year ago. The underlying combined ratio was 88.3 for the first quarter, 2.3 points better than the prior year, but as you can see, the recorded combined ratio was 105.8, and that's because the Encompass' performance was also significantly impacted by catastrophe losses in the quarter. 
Answer Financial, in the upper right, serves brand new to customers who are comfortable doing -- serving themselves, and that increased nonproprietary written premiums by 1.3% in the first quarter of 2016 to $151 million.

I'll begin with a review of our Property-Liability results on Slide 4. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability earned premium of $7.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016 was 4% higher than same period of last year. Recorded combined ratio of 98.4 increased 4.7 points versus the first quarter of 2015, driven by the $827 million catastrophe losses Tom mentioned earlier, while the underlying combined ratio of 87.2 improved by 1.8 points. 
Net investment income of $302 million for the Property-Lability segment decreased 15.6% from the prior-year quarter, driven by a decline in performance-based investment income, which had strong results in 2015. As a result, Property-Liability operating income in the first quarter was $291 million, which was $264 million lower than the first quarter of last year. 
Chart on the lower left-hand side of this page shows Property-Lability net written premium and policy enforced growth rates. Red line represents policy in force growth versus the prior year and shows the policy growth was comparable to the prior-year quarter, given the actions in place across all 3 underwritten brands to improve auto returns. Blue line on this chart shows net written premium grew by 2.9% in the first quarter of 2016, as average premium continued to increase. Bottom right-hand side of this page shows the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio results. 
Let's go first to the red line, which shows the recorded Property-Liability combined ratio in the first quarter of 2016 was 98.4. This was 4.7 points higher than the first quarter of 2015's result of 93.7 but included 6.7 more points in catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio was 87.2, shown by the blue bar, was 1.8 points below the first quarter of 2015. 
Slide 5 provides an update on our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan, which is comprised of 4 parts. First, we're seeking approval for higher auto prices. In the first quarter, we received approval to increase rates by $335 million annually, which is on top of the $1.1 billion of increases approved last year, as you can see from the bar chart the lower left. The impact of these approvals on average premium for Allstate brand auto is shown on the lower right. Average gross premium per policy increased by 4.8% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium per policy, which lags written, increased by 3.8%. Keep in mind, Allstate brand auto rate changes takes 6 months to be fully recognized in average gross written premium, while they take 12 months to full year net. 
Secondly, we have tightened the underwriting guidelines in 2015 to reduce new business and underperforming segments. As we achieved target underwriting results, these guidelines were being modified. 
Focus on claims operational excellence and precision is always a priority, but Allstate brand auto property damage severity increased 7.5% in the first quarter of 2016, which is the rate of increase we believe to be higher than what can be explained by inflationary increases. Continued stress on the auto repair industry from higher industry frequency, cost of repairing newer, more complex vehicles and higher total loss volume has caused steadily increasing claim severity. Our team is working to address these industry challenges and create a competitive advantage for Allstate. 
Property lability expense [ph] by 1.7 points in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, reflecting lower marketing costs and expense reductions. Marketing was purposely reduced, given the rate and underlying actions we were implementing, providing the opportunity to enhance our marketing programs. New campaigns for both Allstate and Esurance will be launching later this year. 
Slide 6 highlights the benefits of these profit improvement actions for Allstate brand auto and the continued of Allstate brand homeowners. 
Chart on the top left of this page provides a view of the quarterly recorded and underlying combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9 in the first quarter of 2016 was 0.3 point higher than the first quarter a year ago, reflecting continued higher levels of accident frequency and higher severity. While property damage frequency in the first 3 months of 2016 moderated somewhat from prior quarters, still increased on a paid basis by over 2%. 
As we've discussed, frequency is evaluated on a gross and paid basis for a variety of reasons, such as managing claims staffing, evaluating cost trends and estimating ultimate losses. To provide additional transparency into how these measures relate, we added a footnote to the investors supplement that isolates the impact that including fixed objects hit by a vehicle head-on gross frequency, which is likely larger than on a paid frequency basis. These types of changes were accounted for in our processes and had no impact on pricing or financial results. 
Chart on the top right highlights drivers of Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy shown by the blue line continued to increase as crude rates result in a 4.7% increase in premiums written in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter a year ago.  Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the first quarter of 2016 increased by 0.1% compared with the first quarter of 2015, due to high frequency and severity and was partially offset by lower expenses per policy. 
The positive gap between these 2 trends widened in the firs quarter's earned premium growth outpace the increase in loss costs in the quarter. On a sequential basis, the underlying combined ratio improved by 1.7 points compared to fourth quarter of 2015, due mainly to improve loss ratio. 
Allstate brand homeowners results are shown on the bottom of this page. On the bottom left, you can see the significant impact catastrophes had in the first quarter of 2016, given the gap between blue column and the red line. On an underlying basis, continued favorable noncatastrophe frequency and severity and lower expenses resulted in a 59.4 underlying combined ratio in the quarter, which was 5.1 points lower than the prior year quarter. The components for the first quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are in the chart on the bottom right. Average earned premium per policy increased to $1,091 or 2.2% over the prior year quarter, while underlying loss and expense per policy decreased by 5.8%. On a sequential basis, the underling combined ratio rose by 3.4 points from a very favorable 56 in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Slide 7 provides a view of the financial trends for both Esurance and Encompass. These charts on the top of this page show the component parts of the combined ratios for both brands. Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 106.2 in the first quarter of 2016 was 11.6 points lower than the same period a year ago, reflecting decreased marketing investment, along with a 4.4 point improvement in the loss ratio due to ongoing actions from improved auto returns. Encompass' recorded combined ratio of 105.8 in the first quarter of 2016 was adversely affected by catastrophe losses that were 7 points higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio on Encompass of 88.3 was 2.3 points lower than the first quarter a year ago, result of ongoing underwriting and pricing changes to achieve target margins. 
Charts on the bottom of this page show how growth is being impacted by profit improvement actions in both brands. In Esurance, policies declined by 1% compared to the first quarter of 2015, while net written premium grew by 2.5% compared to the same quarter a year ago. And Encompass net written premium declined by 6.7% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, as the 9.6% decline in policies in force more than offset  higher average premium from increased rates. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve."

Slide 8 provides overview of Allstate Financial's results for the first quarter of 2016.

Slide 8 provides overview of Allstate Financial's results for the first quarter of 2016. There are 3 main businesses in Allstate Financial with a total of 6 million policies outstanding: a life insurance business that provides products sold to Allstate Agency; Allstate Benefits, which provides life, disability and select health products of worksite; and an annuity business, which is largely close for new business. We began to reposition Allstate Financial in 2006, when we exited the variable annuity business, then accelerated the repositioning post the financial crisis in a low interest rate environment. 
The bar chart on the upper left show how this has impacted the balance sheet over the last 4 years, with total reserves declining by $21 million due to exiting the broker-dealer and bank channels for deferred annuities and the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. 
Notice that the gray bar representing immediate annuity reserves has been relatively constant. While these annuities begin paying out benefits immediately upon issuance, they have extremely long lives. 
The current financial results are shown in the upper right. Premiums and contract charges increased 5.4% in the quarter versus the prior year, driven by 9.6% growth of Allstate Benefits and increase in traditional life insurance products. Net investment income declined to $419 million or a 13.4%, as we saw long-duration fixed-income bond annuity portfolio in the third quarter of 2015. These sales harvested the gain on these funds, given the decline in interest rates. The proceeds will be shifted over time to performance-based investments, which are expected to generate higher long-term returns. I will discuss this in more detail on the next slide. 
Operating income was $104 million for the first quarter, reflecting the decline in investment income. As you can see from the chart on the bottom, the decline was concentrated in the annuity business. 
Moving on to Slide 9, you can see the shift in investing allocation for the Allstate Financial portfolio. We have reduced investment-grade fixed income securities, shown in blue, from 68% to 60%. The increased [indiscernible] holdings of investments for asset-specific performance drives more return, such as limited partnerships and equities. 
The shift to public equity and performance-based investments is expected to deliver increased long-term returns over time. The chart on the bottom left is based on historical return data from 1,800 to 2015. On average, regardless of the time horizon, equities have historically outperformed fixed income, as you can see from the gray columns. On the right 2 columns in table, the risk, is measured by the 99% loss levels, but fixed income is lower than [indiscernible] equities over a 1-year time period. By 10 years, the risk of loss is the same, but the returns are more than double. 
As we can hold the investment back in the immediate annuity reserves for a long period of time, performance-based assets are expected to generate additional shareholder value. However, the challenge from a financial reporting perspective is that these returns fluctuate quarterly, impacting reported operating income. 
The chart at the bottom right shows that while our performance-based long-term earned yield and returns fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the 10-year internal rate of written has traded consistently in a range of our long-term return target of above 10%. 
On Slide 10, our GAAP total return on investment portfolio, shown at the upper left, was 2% for the first quarter. The investment income component of return has been fairly consistent, and valuations were positive in 2016, as fixed income marks increased on lower interest rates. The unrealized gain on the portfolio increased to about $2 billion, as you can see on the upper right. Overall, investment income of $731 million was 14% lower than the first quarter of 2015, but 2/3 of this decline reflects a good return from performance-based investments, 9.4% on annualized basis versus what was a great quarter a year ago. Investment income and yield by business segment are provided at the bottom of the slide. To the left is Property-Liability. We reduced our interest rate risk in this portfolio in 2013, and yield is now increasing, reflecting our increased allocation by high-yield bonds and performance-based long-term investment. 
As I noted earlier, we took actions last year to reduce interest rate risk in the Allstate Financial portfolio and began to increase performance-based investments backing the immediate annuity portfolio. While we realized capital gains, the shorter duration lowered the interest-bearing yield to 4.5% as shown by the black lines in the chart to the right. We are currently well positioned to shift to performance-based investment as well as to extend the duration of our fixed income portfolio at the appropriate time. 
Slide 11 provides overview of our capital strength and cash returns for the first quarter of 2016, also remains in a position of financial strength and flexibility. We finished the first quarter of 2016 with $20.3 billion of shareholders equity and deployable holding company assets of $2.9 billion. During April 2016, we completed the $3 billion share repurchase authorization that wasn't [ph] out last year, and as Tom mentioned, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1.5 billion program yesterday to be completed no later than November 2017. 
Generally, we fund our annual share repurchase activity with net income with any capital we need to retain to grow the business and pay our common dividend. Our repurchase activity has been enhanced over the past few years by a number of proactive capital and mismanagement actions. For example, the actions we undertook to strengthen the balance sheet by issuing hybrid security, deferred stock, able us to return capital in excess of net income over the past 3 years. 
The sale of Lincoln Benefit Life in 2014 freed up [ph] an additional $1.2 billion of capital, which was also used to repurchase common shares.  In the last 12 months, we repurchased 9% of outstanding shares, increasing pro rata ownership and earnings per share leverage. Since the beginning of 2010, we repurchased 36% of year-end 2009 outstanding common shares and have paid $2.8 billion in common dividends, representing a total $12.2 billion return of capital to common shareholders. 
With that, I'll ask Jonathan to open up the line for your questions."

Everything that Tom just said is true, and that would be true if we were in a completely static environment, but we're not. So we're in a still-moving environment. So we did see auto frequency moderate in the first quarter compared to the last half of 2015. And as a result, as you said, because of the rate taken, average earned have begun outpacing loss cost trends in the quarter. That's a really good thing. But we are questioning whether some of the moderation of frequency may have been due to weather in the first quarter. We don't know. But we're not sure exactly whether or not we've seen the rise -- the end of the rise in auto frequency as stabilization or just normal fluctuation. So from that perspective, we continue to execute on our profit improvement plan. And we refine that profit improvement plan as time goes on and we get more information, greater clarity on the trend line, and that's true not only on frequency but it's true on severity as well. As you've seen, I'm sure you've looked at fourth quarter cash track, it showed a clear acceleration across the industry in PD and collision severity. That's due to total loss was up, higher cost to repair more complex cars, greater of number parts replaced, a whole host of different factors. Allstate has historically outperformed and industry in managing those cost. It looks like in first Quarter, we may have given up some of that advantage due to responding to high catastrophe load and increased frequency, but our goal is to get back to our competitive position there and lead the industry. But the end result of all of that is that we'll continue to execute all 4 components of the profit improvement plan, we'll continue to monitor the emergency of both frequencies and severity trends, and we will ensure that we are keeping pace with loss cost trends because we know that once you fall behind those, it's really hard due to the timing Tom to really have to catch up quickly."

First, if you recall, we acquired Esurance for strategic reasons so that we could grow in the segment where customers wanted soft service and a branded experience. We have from the very beginning been running Esurance from an economic value basis as opposed to GAAP. So with the difference in accounting between the advertising being expense to quarter you spend it, if you run it through GAAP combined ratio, it is power to driver it. So we've been looking at economic value. The businesses is twice the size it was roughly that we bought it. The GAAP numbers do matter because it's going to be an increasing size of the Allstate portfolio. So they have spent the last, roughly, 2 years working to improve the performance of the business on a profitability basis. They've improved the loss ratio, but they've also had some operational catch-up because, while it's a direct business, it isn't all done online. We still have claims adjusters. We still have customers to take care of. We still have call centers. I'm really happy with the progress they have made. The combined ratio is in much better shape than it was a year ago. The number you're looking at the underlying of 105 includes, as Tom mentioned, 3.4 points of investment in product expansion and geographic expansion that's not currently paying off in the current period. Underneath that, the loss ratio improved by over 4 points over last year, so very happy with where it is. You're right, it's still over 100, but out of that 105, I think you have to look and take that investment of 3.4 points out. And then there is still some room on the expenses for them to bring both advertising and nonadvertising expenses down. So I feel good about where they are. As far as the growth, yeah, they didn't grow this year -- in the first quarter, but they also spent 36% less in the marketing. Now it's not a direct correlation, but they are running a better more effective business. And as Tom said, we're feeling good about where it is, and it is still our growth vehicle in that segment, but we needed to get some operational things sorted out first."

It's Matt. First, I think your question is really about -- I think you referred to as actuarial, but I think you were referring to whether or not if we have some uncertainty about some of the causal factors of gross frequency, whether that impacts our ability to price and take grade. Rate indications are out of paid, not out of growth, so -- and they're based upon your net trends and your indication. And we go to the regulators and the insurance departments with a robust actuarial package that shows net trends, current indications. And so most of that uncertainty about tell you what we think weather did to gross frequency trends, last quarter, it is irrelevant to the pricing packages that we put together, which are based upon much more precise information. As far as the DI severity and why it's down, yes, you are correct. We did -- we have talked to you about our enhanced medical injury handling program. It's -- a part of that is an attempt to get through the high cases quickly, especially those that have enhanced injuries. And so a lot of the decrease in DI severity that you saw last quarter was a mix issue, because we're paying a lot more current claims. The more current claims tend to be lower severity claims. That's one of the reason you'll see DI frequency up a little this quarter, because we handled a bunch more claims and we went through them. And so you always have that volatility and results in long-tail coverages and there's a lot of complexity in DI. So it's hard to look at DI paid severity on a quarter-by-quarter basis and make any sense out that you have to look at it on the longer term basis and you have to look at it in conjunction with the frequency to see how much is a debt. Volatility is influenced by mix. And in this last quarter, we think a fair amount was influenced by mix. That being said, we think we're making good progress in managing the high severity appropriately."

But the other thing I would say is, we look at ROE, but we really manage for shareholder value. So that items -- when you look at that lower right-hand inside and see what happened to annuities in terms of operating income, that hurt the current ROE. But we're okay with that. It hurt it for 2 reasons. One is, obviously we harvested, I think it was over $0.25 billion of gains and basically front-end loaded. What would have come through was operating income into the book value when we sold a bond, and now we're going to put it in longer-term investment. That obviously takes a while to get invested so you earn the, as Steve pointed out, we like to try to get about 10% on that. So it takes a while to get that invested. And to actually get to 10% because it doesn't have them on day 1. Secondly, it also makes us put up more capital because, under the regulatory schemes, that -- when you're investing in performance-based investments, you put more capital than you would put that in fixed income. We believe that's a good trading in our shareholders' best interest. So we're willing to take an ROE hit if we believe that it generates long-term shareholder value, which in the end is it turns out to be total return-based [indiscernible] immediate annuity portfolio. So we continue to work hard and we've been taking capital out of Allstate Financial for, I don't know, Steve -- 3 years or something. So to the extent we can do that, to the extent we could use financing techniques in a variety of ways to do it, we continue to work on how do we raise the return on capital particularly as it relates to those annuity businesses. That said, we haven't come up with any, what I would call, synthetic approaches to do it. It's just been we got a work to my heart."

We pull different kinds of information from them. That enables us to do a couple of things. Your expert ride enables us to price more accurately because when we are determining what would you charge somebody, we have put them into groups and ask really sort that out. In this case, we can basically put them into different groups because we know how you brake, what primary drive and these variety of things that enable us to give customers more accurate price, and often times that's a lower price, more attractive price. With that we can also provide them the connectivity in the 1-hour a day they spend in their car is where we can add additional value for them. For example, today we have the safer you drive, the more awards you get. If you can get safe-drive awards, it gives you discounts and things. Our customers like that, It improves our value proposition from. And so that will develop over time. We have a slightly different model than some of the other people in the business who are doing it mostly for more accurate pricing. So they can do a onetime shot of people and get a sense that ours is a different model. I am not declaring ours is the right one. I'm just saying we're taking a slightly longer-term customer value look at that. We still have a lot of work to do to develop that, to build those relationships and figure out how to interact with our customers. So this will be a lot of workforce that has the potential to generate additional value for our shareholders, but we're investing heavily in doing that. Okay, well, first, this is maybe a summary here. This is a kind [indiscernible] business  and so forth. We have to protect people from uncertain things like hail storms that happened to them. At the same time. our shareholders can handle the quarterly earnings volatility, and as a result of that get attractive returns. Secondly, we know how to run a property-casualty business, and that shows up the way we executed this year. Our investment portfolio is thought about on a risk-adjusted return basis. So we try to be thoughtful on both a short-term and long-term basis, and again, factoring in how we want to drive long-term value creation. And then the weather has got more volatile, which obviously is a growth opportunity for us, because to the extent people have more disasters, they need more coverage. And we need to get back to growth in our auto and other businesses, but we're having would growth particularly in our benefits business this quarter.

This quarter shows, really why we're in business, which is to protect people when disaster strikes. Overall, operating profit is down largely because of 2 significant hailstorms in Texas in March. At the same time, good progress was made in improving the underlying combined ratio for auto insurance. And the homeowners business continued to generate margins that enable us to handle large catastrophe losses like we saw in March and still generated good return for shareholders.  
So as you know, a severe weather creates a need for our customers to be protected, so increasing market these days, and Allstate does an excellent job of helping customers when these events happen. 
In Texas, we have over 1,100 local agencies, many of whom are close to our customers that are impacted by these hailstorms so that they can help provide initial claim response. We also have about 1,200 specially trained catastrophe adjusters on the ground in Texas with the expertise, technology and relationships that enable our customers to rebuild after these storms. 
If we go to Slide 2, I'll begin by reviewing the overall results and priorities and the Pat and Steve will discuss the results in greater detail. As always, Matt Winter, our President is here; as is Don Civgin, who leads the Emerging Businesses; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. 
Net income for the quarter was $217 million and operating income was $322 million or $0.84 per share. The largest driver of the variance from last year's first quarter was catastrophe losses, which increased from -- by $533 million to $827 million. The underlying combined ratio was 87.2 as the auto profitability actions we've put in place for Allstate, Esurance and Encompass, all made progress in the first quarter from where we ended 2015. 
Allstate brand homeowners insurance had a recorded combined ratio of 93.4 for the quarter, despite the significant catastrophe losses. The recorded combined ratio was 82.3 for the last 12 months. 
From an investment perspective, we had what felt like a whole year of volatility in the first 3 months of the year and ended up with a 2% total return on the portfolio, reflecting 3 components: interest income for the fixed income portfolio; good returns from performance-based investments; and a decline in interest rates over the 3-month period.  Total return over the last 12 months was only 1.3%, which reflected the low returns in the fixed income investments in the last 3 quarters of 2015, given the general uptrend in interest rates. 
But net investment income declined 14%, as a result of our strategy to create additional shareholder value, by increasing performance-based investments, where risk-adjusted returns are higher or reported accounting income fluctuates in the short-term. 2/3 of the decline in investment income reflects the performance-based annualized yield of 9.4% in the first quarter of 2016 versus an outstanding 17.5% in the first quarter of 2015. 
As a result of the underlying strength of Allstate's businesses, the board authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which is an addition to the 10% dividend increase that was approved in February. 
We also made progress on the 5 operating priorities established for 2016. Customers, of course, were at the heart of our strategy, and better serving them will create additional growth and profit. Our internal measures of overall customer satisfaction did deteriorated slightly as we raised auto insurance prices to reflect the increasing number in costs of auto accidents. That said, we made progress in some of the underlying drivers through expansion of continuous improvement programs and good expense control. 
Overall, economic returns on capital improved as the auto profitability plan progresses, homeowners stay strong and we position the investment portfolio to align with our liability structure. While not the same as economic capital, the operating return on book equity was 10% for the last 12 months and it was 8% on a net income basis. 
Growing the number of customer relationships also faced headwinds as we adapted to increasing costs of providing auto insurance. Profit liability items, of course, were comparable to a year ago, but were down from where we ended 2015. We did have great growth through Allstate benefits worksite business, which added over 0.5 million policies over the last 12 months. Steve will discuss how we proactively manage the investment portfolio. But progress was also made and expanded in telematics insurance offering, both in terms of customer offerings and the number of customers, and over 1 million active connections were amongst the leaders in the connected car space. 
Let's go to Slide 3, which provide an overview of the first quarter operating results for our 4 Property-Liability customer segments. Starting at the top, overall Property-Liability policies, of course, were comparable to a year ago as a result of implementing auto profit improvement plans into all 3 underwritten brands. Net written premium still increased, however, as we raised average prices. The reported combined ratio was 98.4 and underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 87.2. We have not changed our full year guidance for the underlying combined ratio from 88 to 90. 
Moving to the lower left for the Allstate brand. This is our largest segment comprising 90% of premiums written, and it serves customers who prefer branded product and value local advice and assistance. Allstate brand total policies in forth growth slowed in the first quarter to 0.4% -- that's from the prior year's quarter -- as a result our targeted actions to improve underlying auto profitability. Auto policies in force grew by 0.5% from the prior-year quarter, impacted by the slowdown in new business and a decline in retention. Auto written premium growth was 4.7% for the quarter, driven by the positive average premium growth of 4.8%, and as said, the impact of the rate increases continues to flow into results. 
Homeowner policies grew over the prior year by 0.6%, the personal lines grew by 1.8%.  Both slowing sequentially, given the impact of auto actions that had on customers who prefer to bundle their insurance products. 
The Allstate brand underlying combined ratio was a strong 86.1 for the fourth quarter, as shown in the highlighted red box at the bottom. 
Esurance, in lower right, serves customers that prefer a branded product for the comfortable handling their own insurance needs. A 1% decline in policies in force was more than offset by a 5.2% increase in average auto premium, so that the net written premium increased by 2.5%. As you know, we intentionally slowed the growth of Esurance last year to better position this business for long-term growth, since it was almost double the size it was when we acquired it in 2011. 
The underlying loss ratio has come down to 73.1 in the first quarter of 2016, which is improved by 5.1 points compared to the first quarter of 2015. As a result, the underlying combined ratio declined to 105, which includes about 3.4 points of expenses related to a number of expansion efforts. We do expect to launch new advertising campaign for Esurance this year to accelerate growth. 
Encompass, in the upper left, competes for customers that want local advice but are less concerned about the choice of insurance company. And they mostly purchase through independent agencies. We took aggressive action to improve profitability in both auto and homeowners insurance in 2015, and consequently, policies in force declined by 9.6% from a year ago. The underlying combined ratio was 88.3 for the first quarter, 2.3 points better than the prior year, but as you can see, the recorded combined ratio was 105.8, and that's because the Encompass' performance was also significantly impacted by catastrophe losses in the quarter. 
Answer Financial, in the upper right, serves brand new to customers who are comfortable doing -- serving themselves, and that increased nonproprietary written premiums by 1.3% in the first quarter of 2016 to $151 million. 
Pat will now go through the Property-Liability results in more detail."

I'll begin with a review of our Property-Liability results on Slide 4. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability earned premium of $7.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016 was 4% higher than same period of last year. Recorded combined ratio of 98.4 increased 4.7 points versus the first quarter of 2015, driven by the $827 million catastrophe losses Tom mentioned earlier, while the underlying combined ratio of 87.2 improved by 1.8 points. 
Net investment income of $302 million for the Property-Lability segment decreased 15.6% from the prior-year quarter, driven by a decline in performance-based investment income, which had strong results in 2015. As a result, Property-Liability operating income in the first quarter was $291 million, which was $264 million lower than the first quarter of last year. 
Chart on the lower left-hand side of this page shows Property-Lability net written premium and policy enforced growth rates. The red line represents policy in force growth versus the prior year and shows the policy growth was comparable to the prior-year quarter, given the actions in place across all 3 underwritten brands to improve auto returns. Blue line on this chart shows net written premium grew by 2.9% in the first quarter of 2016, as average premium continued to increase. Bottom right-hand side of this page shows the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio results. 
Let's go first to the red line, which shows the recorded Property-Liability combined ratio in the first quarter of 2016 was 98.4. This was 4.7 points higher than the first quarter of 2015's result of 93.7 but included 6.7 more points in catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio was 87.2, shown by the blue bar, was 1.8 points below the first quarter of 2015. 
Slide 5 provides an update on our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan, which is comprised of 4 parts. First, we're seeking approval for higher auto prices. In the first quarter, we received approval to increase rates by $335 million annually, which is on top of the $1.1 billion of increases approved last year, as you can see from the bar chart the lower left. The impact of these approvals on average premium for Allstate brand auto is shown on the lower right. Average gross premium per policy increased by 4.8% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium per policy, which lags written, increased by 3.8%. Keep in mind, Allstate brand auto rate changes takes 6 months to be fully recognized in average gross written premium, while they take 12 months to full year net. 
Secondly, we have tightened the underwriting guidelines in 2015 to reduce new business in underperforming segments. As we achieved target underwriting results, these guidelines were being modified. 
Focus on claims operational excellence and precision is always a priority, but Allstate brand auto property damage severity increased 7.5% in the first quarter of 2016, which is the rate of increase we believe to be higher than what can be explained by inflationary increases. Continued stress on the auto repair industry from higher industry frequency, cost of repairing newer, more complex vehicles and higher total loss volume has caused steadily increasing claim severity. Our team is working to address these industry challenges and create a competitive advantage for Allstate. 
Property liability expense ratio by 1.7 points in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, reflecting lower marketing costs and expense reductions. Marketing was purposely reduced, given the rate and underlying actions we were implementing, providing the opportunity to enhance our marketing programs. New campaigns for both Allstate and Esurance will be launching later this year. 
Slide 6 highlights the benefits of these profit improvement actions for Allstate brand auto and the continued strength of Allstate brand homeowners. 
Chart on the top left of this page provides a view of the quarterly recorded and underlying combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9 in the first quarter of 2016 was 0.3 point higher than the first quarter a year ago, reflecting continued higher levels of accident frequency and higher severity. While property damage frequency in the first 3 months of 2016 moderated somewhat from prior quarters, still increased on a paid basis by over 2%. 
As we've discussed, frequency is evaluated on a gross and paid basis for a variety of reasons, such as managing claims staffing, evaluating cost trends and estimating ultimate losses. To provide additional transparency into how these measures relate, we added a footnote to the investor supplement that isolates the impact that including fixed objects hit by a vehicle head-on gross frequency, which is likely larger than on a paid frequency basis. These types of changes were accounted for in our processes and had no impact on pricing or financial results. 
Chart on the top right highlights drivers of Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continued to increase as crude rates result in a 4.7% increase in premiums written in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter a year ago.  Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the first quarter of 2016 increased by 0.1% compared with the first quarter of 2015, due to high frequency and severity, and was partially offset by lower expenses per policy. 
The positive gap between these 2 trends widened in the first quarter, as earned premium growth outpace the increase in loss costs in the quarter. On a sequential basis, the underlying combined ratio improved by 1.7 points compared to fourth quarter of 2015, due mainly to improve loss ratio. 
Allstate brand homeowners results are shown on the bottom of this page. On the bottom left, you can see the significant impact catastrophes had in the first quarter of 2016, given the gap between the blue column and the red line. On an underlying basis, continued favorable noncatastrophe frequency and severity and lower expenses resulted in a 59.4 underlying combined ratio in the quarter, which was 5.1 points lower than the prior year quarter. The components of the first quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are in the chart on the bottom right. Average earned premium per policy increased to $1,091 or 2.2% over the prior year quarter, while underlying loss and expense per policy decreased by 5.8%. On a sequential basis, the underling combined ratio rose by 3.4 points from a very favorable 56 in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Slide 7 provides a view of the financial trends for both Esurance and Encompass. These charts on the top of this page show the component parts of the combined ratios for both brands. Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 106.2 in the first quarter of 2016 was 11.6 points lower than the same period a year ago, reflecting decreased marketing investment, along with a 4.4 point improvement in the loss ratio due to ongoing actions from improved auto returns. Encompass' recorded combined ratio of 105.8 in the first quarter of 2016 was adversely affected by catastrophe losses that were 7 points higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio on Encompass of 88.3 was 2.3 points lower than the first quarter a year ago, result of ongoing underwriting and pricing changes to achieve target margins. 
Charts on the bottom of this page show how growth is being impacted by profit improvement actions in both brands. In Esurance, policies declined by 1% compared to the first quarter of 2015, while net written premium grew by 2.5% compared to the same quarter a year ago. And Encompass net written premium declined by 6.7% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, as the 9.6% decline in policies in force more than offset  higher average premium from increased rates. 
Now I'll turn it over to Steve."

There are 3 main businesses in Allstate Financial with a total of 6 million policies outstanding: a life insurance business that provides products sold to Allstate Agency; Allstate Benefits, which provides life, disability and select health products of worksite; and an annuity business, which is largely close for new business. We began to reposition Allstate Financial in 2006, when we exited the variable annuity business, then accelerated the repositioning post the financial crisis in a low interest rate environment. 
The bar chart on the upper left show how this has impacted the balance sheet over the last 4 years, with total reserves declining by $21 million due to exiting the broker-dealer and bank channels for deferred annuities and the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. 
Notice that the gray bar representing immediate annuity reserves has been relatively constant. Although these annuities begin paying out benefits immediately upon issuance, they have extremely long lives. 
The current financial results are shown in the upper right. Premiums and contract charges increased 5.4% in the quarter versus the prior year, driven by 9.6% growth of Allstate Benefits and increase in traditional life insurance products. Net investment income declined to $419 million or 13.4%, as we saw long-duration fixed-income bond annuity portfolio in the third quarter of 2015. These sales harvested the gain on these bonds, given the decline in interest rates. The proceeds will be shifted over time to performance-based investments, which are expected to generate higher long-term returns. I will discuss this in more detail on the next slide. 
Operating income was $104 million for the first quarter, reflecting the decline in investment income. As you can see from the chart on the bottom, the decline was concentrated in the annuity business. 
Moving on to Slide 9, you can see the shift in investing allocation for the Allstate Financial portfolio. We have reduced investment-grade fixed income securities, shown in blue, from 68% to 60%. This increased on holdings of investments for asset-specific performance drives more return, such as limited partnerships and equities. 
The shift to public equity and performance-based investments is expected to deliver increased long-term returns over time. The chart on the bottom left is based on historical return data from 1800 to 2015. On average, regardless of the time horizon, equities have historically outperformed fixed income, as you can see from the gray columns. On the right 2 columns in table, the risk is measured by the 99% loss levels, but fixed income is lower than net rate [ph] equities over a 1-year time period. By 10 years, the risk of loss is the same, but the returns are more than double. 
As we can hold the investment back in the immediate annuity reserves for a long period of time, performance-based assets are expected to generate additional shareholder value. However, the challenge from a financial reporting perspective is that these returns fluctuate quarterly, impacting reported operating earnings.
The chart at the bottom right shows that while our performance-based long-term earned yield and returns fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the 10-year internal rate of written has traded consistently in a range of our long-term return target of above 10%. 
On Slide 10, our GAAP total return on investment portfolio, shown at the upper left, was 2% for the first quarter. The investment income component of return has been fairly consistent, and valuations were positive in 2016, as fixed income marks increased on lower interest rates. The unrealized gain on the portfolio increased to about $2 billion, as you can see on the upper right. Overall, investment income of $731 million was 14% lower than the first quarter of 2015, but 2/3 of this decline reflects a good return from performance-based investments; 9.4% on annualized basis versus what was a great quarter a year ago. Investment income and yield by business segment are provided at the bottom of the slide. To the left is Property-Liability. We reduced our interest rate risk in this portfolio in 2013, and yield is now increasing, reflecting our increased allocation by high-yield bonds and performance-based, long-term investment. 
As I noted earlier, we took actions last year to reduce interest rate risk in the Allstate Financial portfolio and began to increase performance-based investments backing the immediate annuity portfolio. While we realized capital gains, the shorter duration lowered the interest-bearing yield to 4.5% as shown by the black lines in the chart to the right. We are currently well-positioned to shift to performance-based investment as well as to extend the duration of our fixed income portfolio at the appropriate time. 
Slide 11 provides overview of our capital strength and cash returns for the first quarter of 2016.  Allstate remains in a position of financial strength and flexibility. We finished the first quarter of 2016 with $20.3 billion of shareholders equity and deployable holding company assets of $2.9 billion. During April 2016, we completed the $3 billion share repurchase authorization that was announced last year, and as Tom mentioned, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1.5 billion program yesterday to be completed no later than November 2017. 
Generally, we fund our annual share repurchase activity with net income with any capital we need to retain to grow the business and pay our common dividend. Our repurchase activity has been enhanced over the past few years by a number of proactive capital and mismanagement actions. For example, the actions we undertook to strengthen the balance sheet by issuing hybrid security, deferred stock, enabled us to return capital in excess of net income over the past 3 years. 
The sale of Lincoln Benefit Life in 2014 freed up an additional $1.2 billion of capital, which was also used to repurchase common shares.  In the last 12 months, we repurchased 9% of outstanding shares, increasing pro rata ownership and earnings per share leverage. Since the beginning of 2010, we repurchased 36% of year-end 2009 outstanding common shares and have paid $2.8 billion in common dividends, representing a total $12.2 billion return of capital to common shareholders. 
With that, I'll ask Jonathan to open up the line for your questions."

Everything that Tom just said is true, and that would be true if we were in a completely static environment, but we're not. So we're in a still-moving environment. So, we did see auto frequency moderate in the first quarter compared to the last half of 2015. And as a result, as you said, because of the rate taken, average earned have begun outpacing loss cost trends in the quarter. That's a really good thing. But we are questioning whether some of the moderation of frequency may have been due to weather in the first quarter. We don't know. But we're not sure exactly whether or not we've seen the rise -- the end of the rise in auto frequency, a stabilization or just normal fluctuation. So from that perspective, we continue to execute on our profit improvement plan. And we refine that profit improvement plan as time goes on and we get more information, greater clarity on the trend line, and that's true not only on frequency but it's true on severity as well. As you've seen, I'm sure you've looked at fourth quarter Fast Track, it showed a clear acceleration across the industry in PD and collision severity. That's due to total loss was up, higher cost to repair more complex cars, greater of number parts replaced, a whole host of different factors. Allstate has historically outperformed and industry in managing those cost. It looks like in first Quarter, we may have given up some of that advantage due to responding to high catastrophe load and increased frequency, but our goal is to get back to our competitive position there and lead the industry. But the end result of all of that is that we'll continue to execute all 4 components of the profit improvement plan, we'll continue to monitor the emergency of both frequencies and severity trends, and we will ensure that we are keeping pace with loss cost trends because we know that once you fall behind those, it's really hard due to the timing Tom to really have to catch up quickly."

First, if you recall, we acquired Esurance for strategic reasons so that we could grow in the segment where customers wanted self-service and a branded experience. We have from the very beginning been running Esurance from an economic value basis as opposed to GAAP. So with the difference in accounting between the advertising being expensed to quarter you spend it, if you run it through GAAP combined ratio, it is power to drive it. So we've been looking at economic value. The businesses is twice the size it was roughly that we bought it. The GAAP numbers do matter, because it's going to be an increasing size of the Allstate portfolio. So they have spent the last, roughly, 2 years working to improve the performance of the business on a profitability basis. They've improved the loss ratio, but they've also had some operational catch-up because, while it's a direct business, it isn't all done online. We still have claims adjusters. We still have customers to take care of. We still have call centers. I'm really happy with the progress they have made. The combined ratio is in much better shape than it was a year ago. The number you're looking at, the underlying of 105, includes, as Tom mentioned, 3.4 points of investment in product expansion and geographic expansion that's not currently paying off in the current period. Underneath that, the loss ratio improved by over 4 points over last year, so very happy with where it is. You're right, it's still over 100, but out of that 105, I think you have to look and take that investment of 3.4 points out. And then there is still some room on the expenses for them to bring both advertising and nonadvertising expenses down. So I feel good about where they are. As far as the growth, yeah, they didn't grow this year but -- in the first quarter, but they also spent 36% less in the marketing. Now it's not a direct correlation, but they are running a better more effective business. And as Tom said, we're feeling good about where it is, and it is still our growth vehicle in that segment, but we needed to get some operational things sorted out first."

First, I think your question is really about -- I think you referred to it as actuarial, but I think you were referring to whether or not if we have some uncertainty about some of the causal factors in gross frequency, whether that impacts our ability to price and take grade. Rate indications are out of paid, not out of gross, so -- and they're based upon your net trends and your indication. And we go to the regulators and the insurance departments with a robust actuarial package that shows net trends, current indications. And so most of that ""uncertainty"" about telling you what we think weather did to gross frequency trends last quarter, it is irrelevant to the pricing packages that we put together, which are based upon much more precise information. As far as the DI severity and why it's down, yes, you are correct. We did -- we have talked to you about our enhanced medical injury handling program. It's -- a part of that is an attempt to get through the DI cases quickly, especially those that have enhanced injuries. And so a lot of the decrease in DI severity that you saw last quarter was a mix issue, because we're paying a lot more current claims. The more current claims tend to be lower severity claims. That's one of the reason you'll see DI frequency up a little this quarter, because we handled a bunch more claims and we went through them. And so you always have that volatility and results in long-tail coverages and there's a lot of complexity in DI. So it's hard to look at DI paid severity on a quarter-by-quarter basis and make any sense out it. You have to look at it on the longer term basis and you have to look at it in conjunction with the frequency to see how much is in debt. Volatility is influenced by mix, and in this last quarter, we think a fair amount was influenced by mix. That being said, we think we're making good progress in managing DI severity appropriately."

We did note in the fourth quarter that we thought that was a pretty low level, 56-and-change, because cap loads are typically not that high so that you need to be below 60%. So we're just trying to make sure we're competitive in the marketplace, give our customers a good return, handle the volatility. But because we handle that volatility, our shareholders get a good return, which based on required capital levels, we had initially meant in the lower part of the 80s. That said, because we've improved the profitability, we now need to keep less capital, and so we manage it as -- we manage this stuff dynamically and we're always looking at, what's the right return on capital by state, by territory and we adjust for it.

And as I said when I answered Greg's, I think our level of detailed study as we determine where to take rate, how much rate to take, what the net trends are, what the indications are: number one, the level of thoroughness is shown up in our effectiveness in getting rate improved in each of the states; but two, it allows us to react to our information as opposed to others. Everybody is in a different place. Everybody is in a different place in terms of what their rate is, where their rate is, how much rate they need to take to respond to current trends.

And we look at that with great precision, whether that comes through online stuff or whether it's through TV ads or radio ads. So what we're just trying to say is, as it relates to expenses, the marketing expenses are down. They were down intentionally, because we didn't really want to grow.

So as you pointed out, we've been working on improving the returns in that business for some time. We feel like we've made good progress. But the other thing I would say is, we look at ROE, but we really manage for shareholder value. So the items -- when you look at that lower right-hand inside to see what happened to annuities in terms of operating income, that hurt the current ROE. But we're okay with that. It hurt it for 2 reasons. One is, obviously, we harvested -- I think it was over $0.25 billion of gains and basically front-end loaded. What would have come through was operating income into the book value when we sold a bond, and now we're going to put it in longer-term investment, that obviously takes a while to get invested so you earn the -- as Steve pointed out, we like to try to get about 10% on that. So it takes a while to get that invested. And to actually get to 10% because it doesn't have them on day 1. Secondly, it also makes us put up more capital because, under the regulatory schemes, that -- when you're investing in performance-based investments, you put up more capital than you would put that in fixed income. We believe that's a good trade-in in our shareholders' best interest. So we're willing to take an ROE hit if we believe that it generates long-term shareholder value, which in the end is it turns out to be total return-based for that immediate annuity portfolio. So we continue to work hard and we've been taking capital out of Allstate Financial for, I don't know, Steve -- 3 years or something. So to the extent we can do that, to the extent we could use financing techniques in a variety of ways to do it, we continue to work on how do we raise the return on capital particularly as it relates to those annuity businesses. That said, we haven't come up with any, what I would call, synthetic approaches to do it. It's just been, we have got to work the money hard."

Your expert ride enables us to price more accurately because when we are determining what would you charge somebody, we have put them into groups and ask really sort that out. In this case, we can basically put them into different groups because we know how you brake, what time you drive, and these variety of things that enable us to give customers more accurate price, and often times that's a lower price, more attractive price. With that we can also provide them the connectivity in the 1-hour a day they spend in their car is where we can add additional value for them. For example, today we have the safer you drive, the more rewards you get. If you can get safe-drive rewards, it gives you discounts and things.

We still have a lot of work to do to develop that, to build those relationships and figure out how to interact with our customers. So this will be a lot of workforce that has the potential to generate additional value for our shareholders, but we're investing heavily in doing that.

At the same time. our shareholders can handle the quarterly earnings volatility, and as a result of that get attractive returns. Secondly, we know how to run a property-casualty business, and that shows up the way we executed this year. Our investment portfolio is thought about on a risk-adjusted return basis. So we try to be thoughtful on both a short-term and long-term basis, and again, factoring in how we want to drive long-term value creation. And then the weather has gotten more volatile, which obviously is a growth opportunity for us, because to the extent people have more disasters, they need more coverage. And we need to get back to growth in our auto and other businesses, but we're having good growth, particularly in our benefits business this quarter. 
So thank you for taking the time, and we'll talk to you next quarter."

We also have Matt Winter, our president, here with us; and Don Civgin, our President of Emerging Business, who's President of Allstate Life and Retirement; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. 
Let's begin on Slide 2, the second quarter results. I'll highlight really how our proactive approach to external conditions helped us achieve our objectives and create long-term shareholder value. We earned $242 million despite seasonally high second quarter catastrophe losses, a record hailstorm in Texas, continued increases in the frequency of auto accidents and the impacts of Brexit on the investment market. And while we did not predict all of these would happen, we considered the possibilities when we executed our business plan. 
Operating income was $0.62 per share for the quarter, reflecting a reported combined ratio of 100.8  and then underlying combined ratio of 88.6  for the quarter and 87.9  for the first 6 months, which is in comparison to our full-year forecast of 88  to 90 . Allstate Financial strategic repositioning is working with operating income up slightly to $120 million and investment returns were strong at 1.9% for the quarter, about half of which is from current income and the other half is from appreciation of the bond portfolio.
Let's go to Slide 3, which provides an overview of the second quarter operating results for our 4 Property-Liability customer segment. As you know, we have consumer focused strategy and have over 40 million policies outstanding, of which 34 million are for Property-Liability protection. The results of each of the 4 segments for the Property-Liability market are shown at the diagram on the bottom of the page. Allstate's agencies provide local advice in a broad range of branded products, represents about 90% of total Property-Liability premiums. Total Allstate brand policies decline from the second quarter of last year by 1% as we intentionally reduced new business levels until we improve returns on capital for auto insurance and the impact of these programs and customer retention.
While [indiscernible] declined, net written premiums increased by 3.9%, which essentially offset the impact of continued increases in frequency and severity. The reported combined ratio was 101.2. We recorded combined ratio for homeowners with 97, despite $645 million of catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 87.5 for the Allstate branded business for the quarter. 
Moving across to the lower right is the insurance policies in force decline as we reduced new auto business in this segment, but net written premium increased by 5.7% over the prior year quarter. The reported and underlying combined ratio is 108.9 and 104.8, which were 1.3 and 1.9. points better than last year's second quarter results. The underlying loss ratio was consistent with the prior-year quarter. 
In the upper right is Answer Financial, that's our self-serve aggregator that sells products for more than 20 different companies. Premiums grew by 3.4% in the second quarter, lower than the prior years, which reflects fewer leads from the insurances as we've reduced growth and interest. 
And Independent agencies serve customer who wants local address, but do not have a high affinity for branded products. Encompass in the upper left services segment is taken significant actions in reducing the size of the business while simultaneously improving the returns. 
Policies enforced were down 11.4%,  you can see it in the lower box there at the top. Net written primus declined by 6.8% as higher prices partially offset the decline in policies. The reported and underlying combined ratios both improved in the quarter from the prior year quarter. As you know, we established and communicate our operating priorities each year and they range from doing a better job for customers driving long-term growth which is shown on Slide 4. 
The first 3 priorities are all interrelated. We, of course, always working to provide customers even better value and service. This ranges from the rapid response catastrophe that we've become known for as well as our agency owners bring trusted advisors and helping customers prepare and protect themselves from life's uncertainties. 
We've had over 250,000 catastrophe claims at the end of June and closed approximately 95% of those. We'll continually focus on improving service from Allstate agencies and have made great progress in initiating relationships with customers. Achieving target returns as recorded on us to raise prices in auto insurance, given the greater frequency of accidents and increased severity of claim cost. So we responded with the progressive improvement program which prioritizes existing customers ahead of new customers, leading to a significant reduction in new business. It has also had a negative impact on our customer retention levels. This has resulted in a 4.4% decline in the number of Property-Liability policies in force. 
Allstate Benefits, on the other hand, added almost 0.5 million new customers over the last year, offsetting the Property-Liability decline, but all of our businesses have the potential for growth over the long term.
As you know well, the investment markets this year have been highly volatile from the early decline in energy prices to rebound and then down again, Brexit, we have record low interest rates and global equity markets that have been moving up, down and sideways. Our investment strategy and execution of service well in this environment for a total return of 3.9% for the first 6 months of the year. We continue to build on our performance based asset team as we made progress in increasing the amount of these assets back in the $12 billion payoff annuity block. 
As we discussed on last quarter's call, this is economically the right risk and return trade-off for shareholders given the long duration of these liabilities. We've also made progress on building long-term growth platforms in a number of areas, from Allstate Benefits to Roadside Services to telematics. For the second quarter, we want the highlight where we stand on telematics, which is shown on Slide 5. 
Allstate begin investing in time and space over 6 years ago as a way to improve our business model by serving customers in new and different ways, and we made a tremendous amount of progress over this time. First, telematics is a very powerful pricing tool that enables the customers the most accurate price. Secondly, we found ways to use the continuous connection to broadly value and get from Allstate and provide additional services for them. And for example, we provide customers with tips on how to better protect themselves by changing their driving habits. We've also expanded the value they get from being with Allstate such as merchandise discounts based on how safe they drive. The Safe Driver rewards are very popular in expander customer about proposition. We've built up a wide range of capabilities, have made significant investments and today we have over 1 million connected customers. 
We've also concluded that this could be a strategic platform for Allstate, the concepts of which are laid out in the annual reports of our shareholders.
As a result, we established a connected car entity, Arity, outside of the insurance company which you can see in the graphic of the lower left of this slide. This provides us with a strategic and operating flexibility to capture additional value from our growing connected customer base by providing other companies the ability to offer services to our customers. It also enables other companies to connect with their customers by using this platform and Arity's capabilities. We believe that the transformation of the personal transportation system will be one of the largest economic benefits for individual households in the future and this structure enables us to participate in its value creation. 
Now let me turn it over to Pat."

Property-Liability earned premium of $7.8 billion in the second quarter of 2016, was 3.5% higher than the same period last year. For the first 6 months of 2016, earne",1821,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start by reviewing the Property-Liability, P&L, at the top of Slide 6. Property-Liability earned premium of $7.8 billion in the second quarter of 2016, was 3.5% higher than the same period last year. For the first 6 months of 2016, earned premium grew by 3.8%. Catastrophe losses through the first 6 months of 2016 meaningfully impacted underwriting. Second quarter catastrophe losses of $961 million were 20.6% higher than the prior year quarter, while catastrophe losses of $1.8 billion for the first half of 2016 were almost $700 million higher than the first 6 months of last year. These higher catastrophe losses drove recorded combined ratios of 100.8 in the second quarter of 2016 and 99.6 in the first half of 2015. 
When we exclude catastrophes in prior year's reserve reestimates, the underlined combined ratio of 88.6 in the second quarter, nearly 7.9 in the first 6 months of 2015 were both below their respective levels in 2015. June year-to-date results is slightly below our annual outlook range of 88 to 90. 
Property-Liability net investment income increased 8.2% to $316 million for the second quarter of 2016, driven primarily by higher performance-based investment income. As a result, Property-Liability operating income of $186 million in the second quarter of 2016 was 6.1% below the prior year results, while the $477 million of operating income through the first 6 months of 2016 was 36.7% below the first 6 months of 2015. 
The bottom of the slide contains growth trends information as well as a view of Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. The chart at the bottom left, the blue line, represents net written premium growth while the red line shows our policy in force trend. Property-Liability policies enforced declined by 1.4% or 471,000 in the second quarter of the existing compared to the second quarter of 2015, while net written premium increased by 2.2% in the same time period. These trends have been a heavily influenced by auto property improvement actions across underwriting brands. The widening gap between these 2 trends reflect increases in average per premium per policy given ongoing rate increases. The exhibit on the bottom right shows the property liability recorded and underlying combined ratio along with some history. As you can see in the red line, recorded results in the first 2 quarters of 2016 have been impacted by higher level of catastrophe losses. Taking a longer period of time into account, the recorded combined ratio on a 12-month moving basis is 96.2. 
Slide 7 provides a more detailed view of our Allstate brand auto margin results. Chart on the top left of this page provides a view of the quarterly recorded and underlying combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 97.8 in the second quarter of 2016 was unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2015. The lower expense ratio offset an increase in the underlying loss ratio in the quarter. Our early recognition of increased frequency and severity, along with the aggressive actions we continue to take, have enabled us to keep all the margins stable despite a continued challenging auto loss cost environment. 
Chart on the top right highlights drives of the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy, shown in the blue line, continue to increase as improved rates have resulted in a 5.9% increase in second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter a year ago. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the second quarter of 2016 increased 5.8% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Positive gap between these 2 trends narrowed in the second quarter based on ongoing higher frequency, but was consistent with the level we saw during the second quarter of 2015. 
Bottom 2 charts on this page provide 20 years of history for Allstate brand auto gross and paid property damage frequency. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we evaluate frequency on a gross and paid basis for a variety of reasons, such as managing claims staffing, evaluating costs trends, estimating our ultimate losses. We watch both metrics to ensure we can evaluate and react to changes in our results as quickly as possible. Gross frequency is a lead indicator of future loss trends, while paid frequency helps us understand changes in the proportionate claims we close with the payment. Relationship between these 2 measures will fluctuate over time given environmental impacts and claims department process changes. 
As you can see on the charts on this page, both measures are up substantially from where they have been performing in recent history. For the first 12 of the past 20 years, you can see a fairly steady decline in frequency as the safety of cars as is enhanced. As the impact from safety improvements fully work their way into the fleet, we saw flattening trends for approximately 5 years. Now, the results we've seen in the past 18 months have taken us back to levels not experienced since 2003 for gross frequency and 2004 and 2010 for paid frequency. 
The most recent period reflects just how challenging in auto loss cost environment we continue to operate in. We first identify the uptick in gross frequency during the fourth quarter of 2014 and our analysis indicated it was being driven mainly by environmental factors unrelated to our pricing and underwriting. We continue to believe that our early identification of the issue, along with our proactive and aggressive response will position us well to accelerate profitable growth as lost trends stabilize. 
We continue to implement our profit improvement plan, which is summarized on Slide 8. Given ongoing auto lost pressure, we continue to seek approval for higher auto prices. In the second quarter, we received approval for increased rates by $628 million annually, bringing the total for the first 6 months of 2016 to $963 million, as you can see from the bar chart on the lower left. Rate increases in the second quarter of 2016 were improved in 35 states and Canadian provinces and were on average 6.2%. The amount of rates approved for the second quarter of 2016 includes a significant amount of rate increases in large states, which drove the total to be much higher than our previous run rate. 
The impact of this rate approvals on average premium for Allstate brand auto other shown on the lower right. Average gross written premium per policy increased by 5.7% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium per policy, which lags written, increased by 4.7%. Allstate brand auto rate changes 6 months to be fully recognized in average gross written premium, while it takes at least 12 months to be fully in the P&L. 
Significant amount of premium we generated by seeking approval for auto price increases has served us well so far, so if we've not moved early, our auto returns would be significantly lower and we would be playing catch up until well after the loss pressure we and others are experiencing subsides. We tightened underwriting guidelines in 2015 to reduce new business and underperforming segments and reduced the new business penalty. These guidelines are being modified for specific segments of business within each state and local markets where we feel comfortable that we achieved rate adequacy. 
Our claims team continues to address physical damage severity trends, which are being unfavorably impacted by stress to the auto repair industry from rising industry auto frequency, higher costs associated with preparing newer, more sophisticated vehicles and greater total loss volume on older model year cars. Property damage paid severity in the second quarter of 2016 remained elevated at 5.3%, but the trend improved relative to the first quarter of this year.
Property-Liability expense ratio decreased by 8/10 of a point in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting reductions in professional services and advertising costs as well as lower accruals for compensation incentives. We continue to evaluate investments in growth and would expect accelerate these investments as loss trends stabilize. 
Allstate brand homeowner results are shown on Slide 9. On the chart on the left, you can see the impact catastrophes have had in the first 2 quarters of 2016, given the gap between the blue columns and the red line. The recorded combined ratio on the 12-month moving basis was 83.5 as of the second quarter of 2016. On an underlying basis, continued favorable non-catastrophe losses and lower expenses resulted in a 58.6 underlying combined ratio in the quarter, which was 2.1 points lower than the prior year quarter. The components of the second quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio were in the chart on the right. Average earned income per policy increased by 2.5% over the prior year quarter, while underlying loss and expense per policy declined by 1.1%. 
Slide 10 provides a view of top and bottom line for insurance. We begin on the left with a summary of the combined ratio. Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 108.9 in the second quarter of 2016 was 1.3 points better than the same period in 2015, reflecting lower operating expenses, which more than offset higher catastrophes and unfavorable auto claim frequency. As Tom mentioned earlier, the underlying loss ratio of 74.5 remains higher than we would like it to perform in the long term. 
On the right, you can see Esurance's premium and policy in force trends. Both Esurance has been impacted by ongoing profit improvement actions including rate increases, underwriting guideline adjustments and decreased marketing in select geographies. Given these actions, policies which are represented by the gray line declined by 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2015, while net written premium second quarter of 2016 grew by 5.7% compared to same quarter a year ago, driven by higher average premiums per policy. 
Encompass' results are highlighted on Page 11. The left-hand chart summarizes combined ratio trends. Encompass' combined ratio of 104.9 in the second quarter of 2016 was 10.8 points below the prior year quarter driven by lower level of catastrophes, reduced expense ratio and a 2.4 point improvement in the loss ratio excluding catastrophe. The underlying combined ratio of Encompass of 92.8 was 3.7 points better than the second quarter a year ago, the result of undergoing pricing and underwriting actions to achieve target markets. 
The chart on the right of this page shows how the size of the business has been impacted by profit improvement actions. Net written premium is shown by the blue line, declined by 6.8% in the second quarter of 2016, compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by an 11.4% decline in policies in force, which more than offset higher average premiums from increased rates. Encompass' continue to take action to achieve targeted returns by enhancing its pricing, contract cover -- now I'll turn it over to Steve."

Slide 12 provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the second quarter of 2016. We refocused Allstate in the past several years, primarily on business written to the Allstate agency that are voluntary workplace products for customers for Allstate Benefits. The product line is closer to business and effectively run off. Premium contract charges totaled $564 million in second quarter 2016, an increase of 5.2% in the quarter versus the prior year. The solid growth in premium and contract charges is driven by Allstate Benefits, which grew 9.6% in the second quarter with an increase of 468,000 policies over the prior 12 months. 
Allstate Financial operating income decreased to $120 million in the quarter from $139 million in the prior year. Across the top of the slide, we show net and operating income for each business. Net business operating income of $64 million in the second quarter increased $9 million compared to last year, driven by favorable mortality experience and premium growth. Allstate Benefits operating income of $29 million for the second quarter was consistent with the second quarter of last year. The annuity business generated operating income of $27 million, down $29 million from the second quarter of 2015 due to 2015's portfolio repositioning and risk mortality. 
The chart on the bottom right shows liquidity need by product. For immediate annuities in the gray bar, benefits will be paid to annuities over many years, lowering required liquidity. As a result, we repositioned this portfolio for longer duration fixed income securities and are shifting to performance-based investments, which offer higher risk-adjusted returns. 
Now let's go on to Slide 13. We've been proactively managing the investment portfolio in response to changes in our liability profile in the low interest rate environment, while reducing the portfolio's sensitivity towards eventual rise in interest rates. As we discussed in prior quarters, we have been shifting the risk posture of our portfolio overtime, which is shown in the chart on the upper left. Several years ago, we began to reposition our portfolio by moving away from lending and toward ownership. This is reflected in the decreased allocation to investment grade, fixed income and increasing performance-based investments such as private equity, real estate and agriculture. 
Our performance-based strategy is expected to generate higher somewhat variable returns over time. We traded capacity for the incremental risk by strengthening our capital position to issuing preferred securities, reducing debt, decrease exposure to natural catastrophes and shrinking our annuity business. 
Total returns for the quarter in the upper right remained strong at 1.9% with valuations continue to be positive reflecting lower market yields. The unrealized gain in the portfolio increased $2.7 billion. Gross investment income is provided at the bottom left of the slide. Variability income largely results from our performance-based investments shown in gray. Investment yields business segment are provided in the bottom right. We shortened the duration of the property liability portfolio in 2012 and 2013, resulting in an interest-bearing portfolio yield closer to current market yields, which will be more responsive to rising interest rates as you saw in the maturity profile. 
The Allstate Financial your can reflect the impact of last year's portfolio repositioning and we saw longer duration, fixed income security in the immediate annuity portfolio. Except to the impact of these sales, the interest-bearing portfolio yield in Allstate Financial has been relatively stable despite the rate environment, as investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability outflows. The yields of both segments continue to be pressured to the extent rates remain below the portfolio averages.
Slide 14 provides an overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. We finished the second quarter of 2016 with $20.6 billion of shareholders equity debt to capital ratio of 19.9% and deployable owning company assets of $2.5 billion. Book value per common share for the second quarter of 2016 was $50.05, up 4.4% from 2015, reflecting higher unrealized net capital gains.
We returned over $1 billion in cash to common shareholder through the first 6 months of the year. We paid $240 million in common share dividend and we purchased $829 million of common shares. On June 1st, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase $350 million of our outstanding common stock. The completion of the ASR agreement will be on or before September 23rd of this year. As of June 30th, $1.2 billion remained at a $1.5 billion common share repurchase authorization. 
With that, let me ask Jonathan to open the line for questions."

I think as Pat said during his opening remarks, some of the quarterly rate change was driven by the fact that we took rate this past quarter in some extremely large states.

And I certainly want to extrapolate out that number for the rest of the quarter -- for the rest of the year. However, I would were remiss if I didn't say, we're going to continue to monitor rate need and rate indication and take appropriate levels as we have. When it is primarily in smaller states, it has a smaller impact on the countrywide average, but when it's in larger states, it will have a larger impact.

It's hard to bring on new agency owners in this environment when you're taking a lot of rate, when there's a great deal of activity going on that is requiring them to respond and do things other than merely attempt to get new customers. Our termination rate and turn over rate has not changed. We have added fewer in the recent past, but we expect as this activity dissipates and lessens, we'll be able to add additional agency owners, additional LSPs and additional financial specialist, because we think the fact that we entered this space early, took action quickly and aggressively, will allow us to emerge quickly and position us for growth and continued growth in points of presence as well. I hope that answers your question."

I think there's the graph, the side-by-side of gross and paid, is informed because of -- we've tracked both and reported on both. They served different purposes, as Pat described, and they show up differently. Clearly, in gross, it's a leading indicator. So you're reporting on and showing that everything that's coming in that might be a claim. And in fact, this is subject to every single change in potential opening practice in claims, how we think about it, how we capture information. And clearly, there's some segment of this that's closed without payment. But for these and especially in the most recent difficult frequency environment, we're trying to capture as much information as possible with as much granularity as possible and predict claims need, claims staffing needs, so that we can provide our customers with the absolute best service in the time that they need it. So it tends to lead and it tends to overcapture, obviously, what is going to be on the paid side. And you have this gap, it's especially true on BI because of the long tail and that's a timing issue. But you have a natural gap in just claims closure. You also see some small areas where it seems out of pattern, at least, but it's really a question of catching up, is a question of closing out and paying a bunch of claims. It's a question of figuring out where demand is. We see this not just here, but you see it on several as well, sometimes we'll get hit with big lump of several claims from third-party carriers because they just backed up and all of a sudden they come in. And so that kind of -- I refer to it as peristalsis in our claims system. Sometimes there's a catch up as you have a backlog, things slowed down and then it's pushed through. You managed to clear a lot of claims. And so it will never mirror exactly, but it's eerily similar if pushed over little by time and dampened a little in terms of its volatility and variability."

So we made a decision during the second half of 2015 to try to capture additional information on every claim. And as we did that, we did that for the purposes of really beginning at a very granular level into what was happening in our claims pattern, make sure that we were ahead of the game in both the ability to staff it and an ability to predict, to the extent we can, emerging trends. And so as we began capturing additional information, we began capturing additional information on what we call [indiscernible] nonvehicle accident. And the fixed object that you hit can vary depending upon the season. In the January and February, that fixed object could be a snow bank. It's less like it to be a snowbank in July and August. But sometimes it's something that can result in a claim like a mailbox or somebody's tree or a garage door or something like that. And sometimes it's something that would not result in a claim. So we wanted to capture additional information. We did and as a result, we would probably capture and continue to capture some incidents that when you look at it, you're less likely to think it's going to result in a claim. But to be complete, we wanted to capture everything. It allowed us to make a more informed assessment of liability earlier in the process. As we disclosed in the supplement, as a result of that change, there's been a gross frequency for PD increase. And we quantify that. It's about 1.5 points in the third quarter of 2015, it's about 2 points in the fourth quarter and it's about 3 points  in the second quarter of 2016. And so you'll see adjusted numbers in the supplement as well as the gross numbers on adjusted numbers. Most of those additional claims that we're capturing are closed without a payment, so they have no impact to the income statement and they are not impacting our paid. But we wanted to capture to see trends. And when you're as large as we are, every little change in what you capture and in claims opening practices can influence the gross number."

Let me talk a bit about our investment portfolio, which I think is what you're referring to. I made a comment in the prepared remarks about the difference between the portfolio yield and the current yield you might be able to reinvest in. And for Property-Liability, it's really close. For life, there's a difference. Obviously, we have longer duration assets. We're getting good, good yields on those today, but they slowly run off overtime. The good news is, for us, unlike many other companies, is we've been paying out annuity liabilities coming from the cash flows coming from the portfolio. So we had to reinvest in the lower interest rate environment. Today, that's slowing down a little bit. So we have some cash flow beyond that, which we're investing primarily in performance-based investments, as we said, which really is designed to match up to our liability profile, which is longer duration in many of our competitors in terms of -- because we're running it off. So if you look at that and performance-based investments, we believe we're earning substantially higher, albeit variable returns, over a period of time then we would have fixed income. So we feel like our income for Allstate Financial still holds on investments reasonably well, a bit slow downturn as you can imagine given the some cash flow and some of the market environments and what we do with managing the portfolio on a routine basis. In terms of charges, probably I think it's picking up, maybe deficiency charter. We aggregate all our of life and annuity businesses and we disclosed this in the footnotes in the financial statements. Right now, we have sufficiency in that. We continue to look at that and once again there have been performance base investing could help us significantly in terms of increasing its holding the returns we have in those long dated annuities.

So we start there. And that's true with all of our businesses today. What we do is adjusted for what our strategies and volatility. So when you look at the underlying combined ratio for homeowners, for example, it's lower than you would see for the other businesses because it utilizes more capital as it's more volatile. We have a very sophisticated process of allocating economic capital, not just to those lines of business but then Matt and his team push it down by state. So we always talk about the system we have. This system includes taking in our capital for homeowners down to places like Mississippi and the Coast is going to be different than Wisconsin in the woods. And so by homeowners, we always have a lower underlying combined ratio and lower underlying loss ratio than you would see from the auto business. The auto business, we don't give a target like some of our competitors do, but if you look at the sort of where we operated, it's kind of been where and Progressive in the mid-90s that the place where our customers have been willing to give us a good return for providing the services we do. That's kind of where we look to the end in that. But we don't have a specific number that we give out either by quarter or year. If you look at the other Property-Liability businesses, based on more like auto insurance than they do homeowners insurance. If you go over to Esurance, we look at it on a longer-term basis than just the underlying combined ratio because of the way the accounting works on getting new customers. So you spend all your money upfront, getting new customers and they get to expense right away as opposed to in the Allstate channel. We're providing service all along so the commission would bear our customers, provide that service for the amortize. So you should expect to see a higher recorded combined ratio for Esurance than you would for Allstate because of that accounting, but also because of the size and the growth potential we have in that segment. We've been them as long as Don said team is creating economic value, we will continue to invest because we believe we're creating long-term shareholder value, even if it hurts current value. So if you look at the underwriting loss, we've been on the underwriting loss since we bought Esurance, but it's doubled its size. And double its size and we believe we create a lot of economic value. Encompass looks more like the Allstate channel and customer segment than the other 1. So that's how we -- obviously, we have several conversations for the light business and Allstate Benefits.

Just a few sta",589,"Let me answer it first with 2 components. 1 is the overall environment and second is Allstate if you look at the personal transportation system, we think it offers one of the biggest economic opportunities facing America, the restructuring. Just a few statistics, there's 240 million cars in the United States and worth about $4 trillion. Direct cost to maintain and run those cars is about $2 trillion. You can add another $1 trillion of indirect cost. And it's very inefficient, past utilization is about 4% in total. It's about 33% at peak hours. And then you see 1 person in the car most of the time rather than multiple people. So everywhere I look, I see idle cars moving in or have more passenger. At the same time there's about 30,000 people killed in that system and there's billions of hours spent years in either sitting in traffic or waiting for, looking for parking spot. So we can do better. And if it was your system, you'd shut it down and rebuild it. That will be done over time. We believe it has the opportunity to increase personal household consumption by up to 5% on an annual basis. So there's big money here. The trains down the track, it's moving and it's picking up speed. So what's Allstate's going to do about that? First, we can use the telematics data to improve the accuracy of our prices. But today, most companies estimate the chances of people having an accident by their history and where they live. With DriveWise, we can look contextually at everything you do about driving and the price with real driving behavior that gives us more accurate price.
We're also testing pricing plans, so you can continue to pay us like they did today, over 6 months, as Matt talked about, or you can pass per mile if you want personal there's a lot of things that will happen in this personal transportation industry that we believe creates great opportunity for Allstate. At same time were regarding that value proposition to customers, beyond just pricing so they get more than from Allstate than just advice on how to protect themselves or more than help them fixing their car when they get into an accident. So today for example, we give them safe driving tips as to how to do better driving, we connect them with roadside so they can be they can get there faster. We're also doing a number of things in terms of giving them rights. So we're both doing a better job than what we currently offer. And we're expanding the offer and we give them. Now there's many companies want to get into this space to it and we think we have a natural way in because it's direct and it's over to the terms of giving customers direct benefits and the connection. So it's our belief that we can use that connection for multiple purposes such as road usage, providing real-time safety advice, consumer benefits that are determined by our customer's interest and the time and place specific location they're at. So as a result of that we've created Arity as a way of bundling those services together on 1 platform. So the strategies strengthened our existing businesses and find new revenue sources by leveraging those connections with customers. We don't disclose the amount of money. We spent -- we don't get to 1 million customers and not spending some money out of it. We don't break that number out."

The other component that is a little bit more difficult to quantify, but we know is out there is the level of distracted driving that's taking place today. And that distracted driving that uses cell phones while driving, the texting, Facebook surfing, we've all watched it, some of us have been victims of it on the road. We all watch people sliding around in the lanes and the combination of increased number of cars on the road due to the first thing, due to the miles driven, means you have a greater density of cars on the road with less margin of error. So there's less space in between those cars. When you add distracted driving to that and you have people swerving and not paying attention and go into hard stops, it's an increased likelihood that they're going to hit somebody else. So it's a perfect storm to have greater number of cars on the road driving faster and we have lots of evidence that speed has increased as well. Our DriveWise data is showing us greater number of trips, greater length of those trips and greater speed during those trips. So it's a bad combination when you add, too.

Now we also have Matt Winter, our president, here with us; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses, Mary Jane Fortin, who's President of our Allstate Life and Retirement; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. 
Let's begin on Slide 2. The second quarter results now highlight really how our proactive approach to external conditions helps us achieve our objectives and create long-term shareholder value. We earned $242 million despite seasonally high second quarter catastrophe losses, a record hailstorm in Texas, continued increases in the frequency of auto accidents and the impact of Brexit on the investment market. And while we did not predict all of these would happen, we considered the possibilities when we executed our business plan. 
Operating income was $0.62 per share for the quarter, reflecting a recorded combined ratio of 100.8, and then underlying combined ratio of 88.6 for the quarter and 87.9 for the first 6 months, which is in comparison to our full year forecast of 88 to 90. Our Allstate financial strategic repositioning is working with operating income up slightly to $120 million, and investment returns were strong at 1.9% for the quarter, about half of which is from current income and the other half is from appreciation of the bond portfolio.
Let's go to Slide 3, which provides an overview of the second quarter operating results for our 4 Property-Liability customer segments. As you know, we have a consumer-focused strategy and have over 40 million policies outstanding, of which 34 million are for property-liability protection. The results of each of the 4 segments of the Property-Liability market are shown at the diagram on the bottom of the page. 
Allstate agencies provide local advice in a broad range of branded products, represents about 90% of total property-liability premiums. Total Allstate-brand policies in force declined from the second quarter of last year by 1% as we intentionally reduced new business levels until we improve returns on capital for auto insurance and the impact of these programs on customer retention.
While auto policies declined, net written premium increased by 3.9%, which would essentially offset the impact of continued increases in frequency and severity. The recorded combined ratio was 101.2. The recorded combined ratio for homeowners was 97, despite $645 million of catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 87.5 for the Allstate-branded business for the quarter. 
Moving across to the lower right, is Esurance policies in force declined as we reduced new auto business in this segment, but net written premium increased by 5.7% over the prior year quarter. The recorded and underlying combined ratio was 108.9 and 104.8, which were 1.3 and 1.9. points better than last year's second quarter results. Their underlying loss ratio was consistent with the prior year quarter. 
In the upper right is Answer Financial. That's our self-serve aggregator that sells products for more than 20 different companies. Premiums grew by 3.4% in the second quarter, lower than the prior year's, which reflects fewer leads from Esurance, as we reduced growth at Esurance. 
Independent agencies serve customers who want local advice, but do not have a high affinity for branded products. Encompass, in the upper left, serves this segment and has taken significant actions and reduced the size of the business while simultaneously improving returns. 
Policies enforced were down 11.4%. You can see it in the little red box there at the top. Net written premiums declined by 6.8% as higher prices partially offset the decline in policies. The recorded and underlying combined ratios both improved in the quarter from the prior year quarter. 
As you know, we established and communicate our operating priorities each year. And they range from doing a better job for customers to driving long-term growth, which are shown on Slide 4. The first 3 priorities are all interrelated. We're, of course, always working to provide customers even better value and service. This ranges from the rapid response to catastrophe that we've become known for as well as our agency owners being trusted advisers and helping customers prepare and protect themselves from life's uncertainties. 
We've had over 215,000 catastrophe claims through the end of June and have closed approximately 95% of those. We're continually focused on improving service from Allstate agencies and have made great progress in initiating relationships with customers. 
Achieving target returns on capital [indiscernible] has required on us to raise prices on auto insurance, given the greater frequency of accidents and increased severity of claim costs. So we responded with a comprehensive property improvement program, which prioritizes existing customers ahead of new customers, leading to a significant reduction in new business lines. It has also had a negative impact on customer retention levels. This has resulted in a 1.4% decline in the number of Property-Liability policies in force. Allstate Benefits, on the other hand, added almost 0.5 million new customers over the last year, offsetting the Property-Liability decline. But all of our businesses have the potential for growth over the long term.
As you know well, the investment markets this year have been highly volatile, from the early decline in energy prices to a rebound and then down again; Brexit; you have record low interest rates; and global equity markets that have been moving up, down and sideways. Our investment strategy and execution have served us well in this environment for the total return of 3.9% for the first 6 months of the year. We continue to build on our performance-based asset team and have made progress in increasing the amount of these assets back in the $12 billion payout annuity block. As we discussed on last quarter's call, this is economically the right risk-and-return trade-off for shareholders given the long duration of these liabilities. 
We've also made progress on building long-term growth platforms in a number of areas, from Allstate Benefits to Roadside Services to telematics. For the second quarter, we want to highlight where we stand on telematics, which is shown on Slide 5. 
Allstate began investing in telematic space over 6 years ago as a way to improve our business model by serving customers in new and different ways. And we've made a tremendous amount of progress over this time period. First, telematics is a very powerful pricing tool that enables us to give customers the most accurate price. Secondly, we found ways to use the continuous connection to broaden the value they get from Allstate and provide additional services to them. And for example, we provide customers with tips on how to better protect themselves by changing their driving habits. We've also expanded the value they get from being with Allstate, such as merchandise discounts based on how safe they drive. The Safe Driver Rewards are very popular and expand that customer value proposition. We've built up a wide range of capabilities, have made significant investments and today, we have over 1 million connected customers. 
We've also concluded that this could be a strategic platform for Allstate, the concepts of which are laid out in the annual reports to the shareholders. As a result, we established a connected car entity, Arity, outside of the insurance company, which you can see in the graphic on the lower left of this slide. This provides us with the strategic and operating flexibility to capture additional value from our growing connected customer base by providing other companies the ability to offer services to our customers. It also enables other companies to connect with their customers by using this platform and Arity's capabilities. We believe that the transformation of the personal transportation system will be one of the largest economic benefits for individual households in the future. And this structure enables us to participate in that value creation. 
Now let me turn it over to Pat."

Property-Liability earned premium of $7.8 billion in the second quarter of 2016, was 3.5% higher than the same period last year. For the first 6 months of 2016, earned premium grew by 3.8%. Catastrophe losses through the first 6 months of 2016 meaningfully impacted underwriting income. Second quarter catastrophe losses of $961 million were 20.6% higher than the prior year quarter, while catastrophe losses of $1.8 billion for the first half of 2016 were almost $700 million higher than the first 6 months of last year. These higher catastrophe losses drove recorded combined ratios of 100.8 in the second quarter of 2016 and 99.6 in the first half of 2015. 
When we exclude catastrophes in prior year reserve reestimates, the underlined combined ratio of 88.6 in the second quarter, 87.9 in the first 6 months of 2016, were both below their respective levels in 2015. June year-to-date results is slightly below our annual outlook range of 88 to 90. 
Property-Liability net investment income increased 8.2% to $316 million for the second quarter of 2016, driven primarily by higher performance-based investment income. As a result, Property-Liability operating income of $186 million in the second quarter of 2016 was 6.1% below the prior year result, while the $477 million of operating income through the first 6 months of 2016 was 36.7% below the first 6 months of 2015. 
The bottom of this slide contains growth trends information as well as a view of Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. In the chart on the bottom left, the blue line represents net written premium growth while the red line shows our policy in force trend. Property-Liability policies in force declined by 1.4% or 471,000 in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, while net written premium increased by 2.2% in the same time period. 
These trends have been heavily influenced by auto profit improvement actions across underwriting brands. The widening gap between these 2 trends reflect increases in average per premium per policy given ongoing rate increases. The exhibit on the bottom right shows the property liability recorded and underlying combined ratio along with some history. As you can see in the red line, recorded results in the first 2 quarters of 2016 have been impacted by higher levels of catastrophe losses. Taking a longer period of time into account, the recorded combined ratio on a 12-month moving basis is 96.2. 
Slide 7 provides a more detailed view of our Allstate brand auto margin results. Chart on the top left of this page provides a view of the quarterly recorded and underlying combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 97.8 in the second quarter of 2016 was unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2015. The lower expense ratio offset an increase in the underlying loss ratio in the quarter. Our early recognition of increased frequency and severity, along with the aggressive actions we continue to take, have enabled us to keep auto margins stable despite a continued challenging auto loss cost environment. 
Chart on the top right highlights drivers of the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continue to increase as approve rates have resulted in a 5.9% increase in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter a year ago. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the second quarter of 2016 increased to 5.8% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Positive gap between these 2 trends narrowed in the second quarter based on ongoing higher frequency, but was consistent with the level we saw during the second quarter of 2015. 
The bottom 2 charts on this page provide 20 years of history for Allstate brand auto gross and paid property damage frequency. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we evaluate frequency on a gross and paid basis for a variety of reasons, such as managing claims staffing, evaluating cost trends, estimating our ultimate losses. We watch both metrics to ensure we can evaluate and react to changes in our results as quickly as possible. Gross frequency is a lead indicator of future loss trends, while paid frequency helps us understand changes in the proportion of claims we close with a payment. Relationship between these 2 measures will fluctuate over time given environmental impacts and claim department process changes. 
As you can see on the charts on this page, both measures are up substantially from where they've been performing in recent history. For the first 12 of the past 20 years, you can see a fairly steady decline in frequency as the safety of cars is enhanced. As the impacts from safety improvements fully work their way into the fleet, we saw a flattening trend for approximately 5 years. Now the results we've seen in the past 18 months have taken us back to levels not experienced since 2003 for gross frequency and 2004 and 2010 for paid frequency. 
The most recent period reflects just how challenging an auto loss cost environment we continue to operate in. We first identified the uptick in gross frequency during the fourth quarter of 2014, and our analysis indicated it was being driven mainly by environmental factors unrelated to our pricing and underwriting. We continue to believe that our early identification of the issue, along with our proactive and aggressive response, will position us well to accelerate profitable growth as loss trends stabilize. 
We continue to implement our profit improvement plan, which is summarized on Slide 8. Given ongoing auto loss pressure, we continue to seek approval for higher auto prices. In the second quarter, we received approval to increased rates by $628 million annually, bringing the total for the first 6 months of 2016 to $963 million, as you can see from the bar chart in the lower left. Rate increases in the second quarter of 2016 were approved in 35 states and Canadian provinces and were, on average, 6.2%. The amount of rates approved for the second quarter of 2016 includes a significant amount of rate increases in large states, which drove the total to be much higher than our previous run rate. 
The impact of this rate approvals on average premium for Allstate brand auto is shown on the lower right. Average gross written premium per policy increased by 5.7% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium per policy, which lags written, increased by 4.7%. Allstate brand auto rate changes take 6 months to be fully recognized in average gross written premium, while it take at least 12 months to be fully earned into the P&L. 
Significant amount of premium we generated by seeking approval for auto price increases has served us well so far. So if we'd not moved early, our auto returns would be significantly lower, and we'd be playing catch up until well after the loss pressure we and others are experiencing subsides. We tightened underwriting guidelines in 2015 to reduce new business in underperforming segments and reduced the new business penalty. These guidelines are being modified for specific segments of business within each state and local market, where we feel comfortable that we've achieved rate adequacy. 
Our claims team continues to address physical damage severity trends, which are being unfavorably impacted by stress to the auto repair industry from rising industry auto frequency, higher costs associated with repairing newer, more sophisticated vehicles and greater total loss volume on older model year cars. Property damage paid severity in the second quarter of 2016 remained elevated at 5.3%, but the trend improved relative to the first quarter of this year.
Property-Liability expense ratio decreased by 0.8 point in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting reductions in professional services and advertising costs as well as lower accruals for compensation incentives. We continue to evaluate investments in growth and would expect to accelerate these investments as loss trends stabilize. 
Allstate brand homeowners results are shown on Slide 9. In the chart on the left, you can see the impact catastrophes have had in the first 2 quarters of 2016, given the gap between the blue columns and the red line. The recorded combined ratio on a 12-month moving basis was 83.5 as of the second quarter of 2016. On an underlying basis, continued favorable non-catastrophe losses and lower expenses resulted in a 58.6 underlying combined ratio in the quarter, which was 2.1 points lower than the prior year quarter. The components of the second quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are in the chart on the right. Average earned premium per policy increased by 2.5% over the prior year quarter, while underlying loss and expense per policy declined by 1.1%. 
Slide 10 provides a view of top and bottom line trends for Esurance. We begin with -- I'll begin on the left with a summary of the combined ratio. Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 108.9 in the second quarter of 2016 was 1.3 points better than the same period in 2015, reflecting lower operating expenses, which more than offset higher catastrophes and unfavorable auto claim frequency. As Tom mentioned earlier, the underlying loss ratio of 74.5 remains higher than we would've like it to perform in the long term. 
On the right, you can see Esurance's premium and policy in force trends. Both in Esurance has been impacted by ongoing profit improvement actions, including rate increases, underwriting guideline adjustments and decreased marketing in select geographies. Given these actions, policies, which are represented by the gray line, declined by 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2015, while net written premium in the second quarter of 2016 grew by 5.7% compared to the same quarter a year ago, driven by higher average premiums per policy. 
Encompass' results are highlighted on Page 11. The left-hand chart summarizes the combined ratio trends. Encompass' recorded combined ratio of 104.9 in the second quarter of 2016 was 10.8 points below the prior year quarter, driven by a lower level of catastrophes, a reduced expense ratio and a 2.4 point improvement in the loss ratio, excluding catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio of Encompass of 92.8 was 3.7 points better than the second quarter a year ago, the result of undergoing pricing and underwriting actions to achieve target margins. 
The chart on the right of this page shows how the size of the business has been impacted by profit improvement actions. Net written premium, as shown by the blue line, declined by 6.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by an 11.4% decline in policies in force, which more than offset higher average premiums from increased rates. Encompass has continued to take actions to achieve targeted returns by enhancing its pricing, contract coverage and underwriting sophistication.

Slide 12 provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the second quarter of 2016. We refocused Allstate Financial over the past several years, primarily on business written to the Allstate agencies and on voluntary workplace products for customers of Allstate Benefits. The annuity product lines closer to business has effectively been run off. Premium and contract charges totaled $564 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.2% in the quarter versus the prior year. The solid growth in premium and contract charges was driven by Allstate Benefits, which grew 9.6% in the second quarter, with an increase of 468,000 policies over the prior 12 months. Allstate Financial operating income decreased to $120 million in the quarter from $139 million in the prior year. 
Across the top of this slide, we show net and operating income for each business. Life business operating income of $64 million in the second quarter increased $9 million compared to last year, driven by favorable mortality experience and premium growth. Allstate Benefits operating income of $29 million for the second quarter was consistent with the second quarter of last year. The annuity business generated operating income of $27 million, down $29 million from the second quarter of 2015 due to 2015's portfolio repositioning and worse mortality. 
The chart on the bottom right shows liquidity need by product. For immediate annuities in the gray bar, benefits will be paid to annuities over many years, lowering required liquidity. As a result, we repositioned this portfolio from longer-duration fixed income securities and are shifting to performance-based investments, which offer higher risk-adjusted returns. 
Now let's go on to Slide 13. We've been proactively managing the investment portfolio in response to changes in our liability profile in the low-interest-rate environment, while reducing the portfolio's sensitivity toward an eventual rise in interest rates. As we discussed in prior quarters, we have been shifting the risk posture of our portfolio over time, which is shown in the chart on the upper left. Several years ago, we began to reposition the portfolio by moving away from lending and toward ownership. This is reflected in the decreased allocation to investment-grade fixed income and increasing performance-based investments, such as private equity, real estate, timber and agriculture. 
Our performance-based strategy is expected to generate higher somewhat variable returns over time. We traded capacity for the incremental risk by strengthening our capital position through issuing preferred securities, reducing debt, decreasing exposure to natural catastrophes and shrinking our annuity business. 
Total returns for the quarter in the upper right remains strong at 1.9%, with valuations continuing to be positive reflecting lower market yields. The unrealized gain in the portfolio increased to $2.7 billion. 
Gross investment income is provided at the bottom left of the slide. Variability in income largely results from our performance-based investments, shown in gray. Investment yield by business segment are provided in the bottom right. We shortened the duration of the Property-Liability portfolio in 2012 and 2013, resulting in an interest-bearing portfolio yield closer to current market yields, which will be more responsive to rising interest rates, as you saw with it's shorter maturity profile. 
The Allstate Financial yield trend reflects the impact of last year's portfolio repositioning when we sold longer-duration fixed income security in the immediate annuity portfolio. Except to the impact of these sales, the interest-bearing portfolio yield at Allstate Financial has been relatively stable despite the rate environment, as investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability outflows. The yield for both segments continue to be pressured to the extent rate remain below the portfolio averages.
Slide 14 provides overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. We finished the second quarter of 2016 with $20.6 billion of shareholders equity, a debt to capital ratio of 19.9% and deployable holding company assets of $2.5 billion. Book value per common share for the second quarter of 2016 was $50.05, up 4.4% from 2015, reflecting higher unrealized net capital gains.
We returned over $1 billion in cash to common shareholder through the first 6 months of the year. We paid $240 million in common share dividends, and we purchased $829 million of common shares. On June 1, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase $350 million of our outstanding common stock. The completion of the ASR agreement will be on or before September 23 of this year. As of June 30, $1.2 billion remained of the $1.5 billion common share repurchase authorization.

I think as Pat said during his opening remarks, some of the quarterly rate change was driven by the fact that we took rate this past quarter in some extremely large states. And that impacted it disproportionately when you look at it on the countrywide impact. So it is -- you are correct. It is disproportionately high to what you have been seeing. And I certainly won't extrapolate out that number for the rest of the quarter -- for the rest of the year. However, I would be remiss if I didn't say, we're going to continue to monitor rate need and rate indication and take appropriate levels as we have. When it is primarily in smaller states, it has a smaller impact on the countrywide average, but when it's in larger states, it will have a larger impact. And so it will fluctuate because it's based upon need and indication in particular geographic areas, as opposed -- which has a countrywide impact. But it's -- you can't think of it as a countrywide rate increase. The second question on distribution. It's been a tough period, yet we've been able to hold fast and slightly grow some of our distribution points of presence. It's hard to bring on new agency owners in this environment when you're taking a lot of rate, when there's a great deal of activity going on that is requiring them to respond and do things other than merely attempt to get new customers. Our termination rate and turn over rate has not changed. We have added fewer in the recent past. But we expect as this activity dissipates and lessens, we'll be able to add additional agency owners, additional LSPs and I would add, additional financial specialists, because we think the fact that we entered this space early, took action quickly and aggressively, will allow us to emerge quickly and position us for growth and continued growth in points of presence as well. I hope that answers your question."

We did launch our new advertising program already, and so you started to see that uptick in that portion of expenses. So the expense reductions were not as great as they were in prior quarters in the year-over-year comparison. So we manage it both on a short-term and long-term basis. We try to control our expenses in total to make sure we're achieving our target returns. On the other hand, we're not willing to give up our long-term growth.

Yes, I think there's the graph, the side-by-side of gross and paid is informative because we've tracked both and reported on both. They serve different purposes, as Pat described, and they show up differently. Clearly, in gross, it's a leading indicator. So you're reporting on and showing that everything that's coming in that might be a claim. And in fact, this is subject to every single change in potential opening practice in claims, how we think about it, how we capture information. And clearly, there's some segment to this that is closed without payment. But for these, and especially in the most recent difficult frequency environment, we're trying to capture as much information as possible with as much granularity as possible and predict claims need, claims staffing need, so that we can provide our customers with the absolute best service in the time that they need it. So it tends to lead and it tends to over-capture, obviously, what is going to be on the paid side. And you have this gap. It's especially true on BI because of the long tail, and that's a timing issue. But you have a natural gap in just claims closure. You also see -- have some small areas where it seems out of pattern, Elyse, but it's really a question of catching up. It's a question of closing out and paying a bunch of claims. It's a question of figuring out where demand is. We see this not just here, but you see it on subro as well. Sometimes we'll get hit with a big lump of subro claims from third-party carriers because they just backed up and all of a sudden, they come in. And so that kind of -- I refer to it as peristalsis in our claims system. Sometimes there's a catch up. As you had a backlog, things slow down, and then it's pushed through. You manage to clear a lot of claims. And so it'll never mirror exactly, but it's eerily similar if pushed over little by time and dampened a little in terms of its volatility and variability."

So I just want to point out and restate what I said in answering Elyse's question. So we made a decision during the second half of 2015 to try to capture additional information on every claim. And as we did that, we did that for the purposes of really digging at a very granular level into what was happening in our claims pattern and make sure that we were ahead of the game in both an ability to staff it and an ability to predict, to the extent we can, emerging trends. And so as we began capturing additional information, we began capturing additional information on what we call hit fixed object or non-vehicle accident. And the fixed object that you hit can vary depending upon the season. In the January and February, that fixed object could be a snow bank. It's less likely to be a snowbank in July and August. But sometimes it's something that can result in a claim, like a mailbox or somebody's tree or a garage door or something like that. And sometimes it's something that would not result in a claim. So we wanted to capture additional information. We did, and as a result, we were probably capturing, and continue to capture, some incidents that when you look at it, you're less likely to think it's going to result in a claim. But to be complete, we wanted to capture everything. It allowed us to make a more informed assessment of liability earlier in the process. As we disclosed in the supplement, as a result of that change, there's been a gross frequency for PD increase. And we quantify that. It's about 1.5 points in the third quarter of 2015, it's about 2 points in the fourth quarter, and it's about 3 points in the second quarter of 2016. And so you'll see adjusted numbers in the supplement as well as the ""gross numbers"" on adjusted numbers. Most of those additional claims that we're capturing are closed without a payment, so they have no impact to the income statement, and they're not impacting our paid.

Let me talk a little bit about our investment portfolio, which I think is what you're referring to. I made a comment in the prepared remarks about the difference between the portfolio yield and the current yield you might be able to reinvest in. And for Property-Liability, it's really close. For life, there's a difference. Obviously, we have longer-duration assets. We're getting good yields on those today, but they slowly run off over time. The good news is, for us, unlike many other companies, is we've been paying out our run-off annuity liabilities, and a lot of that cash flow's coming from the portfolio. So we haven't had to reinvest in the lower interest rate environment. Today, that's slowing down a little bit. So we have some cash flow beyond that, which we're investing primarily in performance-based investments, as we said, which really is designed to match up to our liability profile, which is longer duration than many of our competitors in terms of -- because we're running it off. So if you look at that, and performance-based investments, we believe, would earn substantially higher, albeit variable returns over a period of time than you would in fixed income. So we feel our income for Allstate Financial should hold on investments, should hold reasonably well. Probably a slow downturn, as you can imagine, given some cash flow and some of the market environments and what we do managing the portfolio on a routine basis. In terms of charges, probably, I think you're thinking of maybe a premium deficiency charge. We aggregate our -- all of our life and annuity businesses and we disclosed this in the footnotes in the financial statements. Right now, we have to have sufficiency in that. We continue to look at that. And once again, there have -- being a performance-based investing could -- will help us significantly in terms of increasing and holding the returns we have in those long-dated annuities. I hope that helps and answers your question."

Because we can sort of do our own math about judging how long you'll get there. But I think it's been a while since we've had that conversation.

The -- but then w",519,"Josh, let me go way up for a minute and I'll come down. So we expect all of our businesses to earn a current return on the business they write over our cost of capital. So we start there. And that's true with all of our businesses today. The -- but then what we do is we adjust it for what our strategies and the volatilities [indiscernible]. So when you look at the underlying combined ratio for homeowners, for example, we -- it's lower than you would see for the other businesses because it utilizes more capital because it's more volatile. We have a very sophisticated process of allocating economic capital, not just to those lines of business. But then, Matt and his team push it down by state. So we've always talked about the system we have. That system includes taking amount of capital for homeowners down to places like Mississippi on the coast is going to be different than Wisconsin in the woods. And so by homeowners, we'll always have a lower underlying combined ratio and lower underlying loss ratio than you would see from the auto business. The auto business, we don't give a target like some of our competitors do, but if you look at the sort of where we've operated, it's kind of been where GEICO and Progressive is, which, call it, the mid-90s. That's the place where our customers have been willing to give us a good return for providing the services we do. That's kind of where we look to be at, in that zone. But we don't have a specific number that we give out either by quarter or year. If you look at the other Property-Liability businesses, they look more like auto insurance than they do homeowner insurance. If you go over to Esurance, we look at it on a longer-term basis than just the underlying combined ratio because of the way the accounting works on getting new customers. So you spend all your money upfront getting new customers and they get expensed right away, as opposed to in the Allstate channel, we're providing service all along, so the commissions we pay to our customers provide that service, so we could amortize long. So you would -- you should expect to see a higher recorded combined ratio for Esurance than you would for Allstate because of that accounting, but also because of it's size and the growth potential we have in that segment, so we've been -- as long as Don's team is creating economic value. So we will continue to invest because we believe we're creating long-term shareholder value, even if it hurts current earnings. So as we look at the underwriting loss, we've been on a underwriting loss since we bought Esurance, but it's doubled its size. And if you double its size, we believe we'd create a lot of economic value. Encompass looks more like the Allstate channel and customer segment than the other one. So that's how we think -- but obviously, we have similar conversations for the life business and Allstate Benefits. Is that helpful?"

So if you look at the personal transportation system, we think it offers one of the biggest economic opportunities facing Ame",607,"Okay, Kai, let me answer it first with a 2-component answer: One is the overall environment, and second is Allstate specifically. So if you look at the personal transportation system, we think it offers one of the biggest economic opportunities facing America, the restructuring of it. Just a few statistics: There's 240 million cars in the United States. They're worth about $4 trillion. Direct cost to maintain and run those cars is about $2 trillion. You can add another $1 trillion of indirect cost, and it's very inefficient. Capacity utilization is about 4% in total. It's about 33% at peak hours. And then you see one person in a car most of the time rather than multiple pieces. So everywhere I look, I see idle cars and if they're moving, they only have one passenger. At the same time there's about 30,000 people killed in that system, and there's billions of hours spent either sitting in traffic or waiting for -- looking for a parking spot. So we can do better. And if it was your system, you'd shut it down and rebuild it. That will be done over time. We believe it has the opportunity to increase personal household consumption by up to 5% on an annual basis. So there's big money here. The trains on the track, it's moving and it's picking up speed. So what's Allstate going to do about that? It's first, we can use the telematics data to improve the accuracy of our pricing. So today, most companies estimate the chances of people having an accident by their history and where they live. With DriveWise, we can look contextually at everything you do about driving and price it with a real driving behavior that gives us more accurate price. We're also testing pricing plans, so that you can continue to pay us like we do today, over 6 months, as Matt talked about, or you can pass per mile if you want to. So there's lots of things that will happen in this personal transportation industry that we believe creates great opportunity for Allstate. At same the time we're broadening that value proposition to customers beyond just pricing, so they get more than -- from Allstate, than just advice on how to protect themselves or in more than helping fixing their car when they get in an accident. So today for example, we give them safe driving tips as to how to be -- do better driving. We connect them with Roadside so they can be -- contextually, we can get there faster. We're also doing a number of things in terms of giving them rewards. So we're both doing a better job than what we currently offer, and we're expanding the offering we give them. Now there's many companies that want to get in this space, and we think we have a natural way in because it's direct and it's low friction in terms of giving customers direct benefit from the connection. So it's our belief that we can use that connection then for multiple purposes, such as road usage, providing real-time safety advice, consumer benefits that are determined by a customer's interest and the time and place, specific location they're at. So as a result of that, we've created Arity as a way of bundling those services together on one platform. So the strategy is strengthen our existing businesses and find new revenue sources by leveraging those connections with customers. We don't disclose the amount of money. We spent -- we don't get to 1 million customers without spending some money on it. But we don't break that number out."

The trips tend -- the errands tend not to move around that much. And then, they have trips. And so lower gas prices help. Matt, anything you want..."

The other component that is a little more difficult to quantify, but we know is out there, is the level of distracted driving that's taking place today. And that distracted driving, the use of cell phones while driving, the texting, Facebook surfing, we've all watched it, we've all -- some of us have been victims of it on the road. We all watch people sliding around in the lanes. And the combination of increased number of cars on the road due to the first thing, due to the miles driven, means you have a greater density of cars on the road with less margin of error. So there's less space in between those cars. When you add distracted driving to that and you have people swerving and not paying attention and go into hard stops, it's an increased likelihood that they're going to hit somebody else. So it's a perfect storm to have greater number of cars on the road, driving faster. And we've lots of evidence that speed has increased as well. Our DriveWise data is showing us greater number of trips, greater length of those trips and greater speed during those trips. So it's a bad combination when you add to it people looking at their cell phone instead of being focused on their driving."

So we're adapting to the higher costs associated with auto insurance, as most of you have asked us about. But I want to be clear, it's comprehensive in a multifaceted approach. It's not just about raising price. We're taking a more segmented approach to that. We are managing risk-adjusted returns to create shareholder value. That's like what we did in homeowners, where the gap is smaller to get better, or as we're doing today in paying out annuities. We are focused on growth, whether that's Allstate Benefits, Allstate agencies and their relationships with the 60 million households; Esurance or our telematics offering. We are investing for long-term growth, and we'll continue to do so. So we have a strategy, resources and a team to continue to create value for our shareholder.

Now we also have Matt Winter, our president, here with us; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses, Mary Jane Fortin, who's President of our Allstate Life and Retirement; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. 
Let's begin on Slide 2. The second quarter results now highlight really how our proactive approach to external conditions helps us achieve our objectives and create long-term shareholder value. We earned $242 million despite seasonally high second quarter catastrophe losses, a record hailstorm in Texas, continued increases in the frequency of auto accidents and the impact of Brexit on the investment market. And while we did not predict all of these would happen, we considered the possibilities when we executed our business plan. 
Operating income was $0.62 per share for the quarter, reflecting a recorded combined ratio of 100.8, and then underlying combined ratio of 88.6 for the quarter and 87.9 for the first 6 months, which is in comparison to our full year forecast of 88 to 90. Our Allstate financial strategic repositioning is working with operating income up slightly to $120 million, and investment returns were strong at 1.9% for the quarter, about half of which is from current income and the other half is from appreciation of the bond portfolio.
Let's go to Slide 3, which provides an overview of the second quarter operating results for our 4 Property-Liability customer segments. As you know, we have a consumer-focused strategy and have over 40 million policies outstanding, of which 34 million are for property-liability protection. The results of each of the 4 segments of the Property-Liability market are shown at the diagram on the bottom of the page. 
Allstate agencies provide local advice in a broad range of branded products, represents about 90% of total property-liability premiums. Total Allstate-brand policies in force declined from the second quarter of last year by 1% as we intentionally reduced new business levels until we improve returns on capital for auto insurance and the impact of these programs on customer retention.
While auto policies declined, net written premium increased by 3.9%, which would essentially offset the impact of continued increases in frequency and severity. The recorded combined ratio was 101.2. The recorded combined ratio for homeowners was 97, despite $645 million of catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 87.5 for the Allstate-branded business for the quarter. 
Moving across to the lower right, is Esurance policies in force declined as we reduced new auto business in this segment, but net written premium increased by 5.7% over the prior year quarter. The recorded and underlying combined ratio was 108.9 and 104.8, which were 1.3 and 1.9. points better than last year's second quarter results. Their underlying loss ratio was consistent with the prior year quarter. 
In the upper right is Answer Financial. That's our self-serve aggregator that sells products for more than 20 different companies. Premiums grew by 3.4% in the second quarter, lower than the prior year's, which reflects fewer leads from Esurance, as we reduced growth at Esurance. 
Independent agencies serve customers who want local advice, but do not have a high affinity for branded products. Encompass, in the upper left, serves this segment and has taken significant actions that have reduced the size of the business while simultaneously improving returns. 
Policies in force were down 11.4%. You can see it in the little red box there at the top. Net written premiums declined by 6.8% as higher prices partially offset the decline in policies. The recorded and underlying combined ratios both improved in the quarter from the prior year quarter. 
As you know, we established and communicate our operating priorities each year. And they range from doing a better job for customers to driving long-term growth, which are shown on Slide 4. The first 3 priorities are all interrelated. We're, of course, always working to provide customers even better value and service. This ranges from the rapid response to catastrophe that we've become known for as well as our agency owners being trusted advisers and helping customers prepare and protect themselves from life's uncertainties. 
We've had over 215,000 catastrophe claims through the end of June and have closed approximately 95% of those. We're continually focused on improving service from Allstate agencies and have made great progress in initiating relationships with customers. 
Achieving target returns on capital, however, has required on us to raise prices on auto insurance, given the greater frequency of accidents and increased severity of claim costs. So we responded with a comprehensive property improvement program, which prioritizes existing customers ahead of new customers, leading to a significant reduction in new business lines. It has also had a negative impact on customer retention levels. This has resulted in a 1.4% decline in the number of Property-Liability policies in force. Allstate Benefits, on the other hand, added almost 0.5 million new customers over the last year, offsetting the Property-Liability decline. But all of our businesses have the potential for growth over the long term.
As you know well, the investment markets this year have been highly volatile, from the early decline in energy prices to a rebound and then down again; Brexit; you have record low interest rates; and global equity markets that have been moving up, down and sideways. Our investment strategy and execution have served us well in this environment for the total return of 3.9% for the first 6 months of the year. We continue to build out our performance-based asset team and have made progress in increasing the amount of these assets back in the $12 billion payout annuity block. As we discussed on last quarter's call, this is economically the right risk-and-return trade-off for shareholders given the long duration of these liabilities. 
We've also made progress on building long-term growth platforms in a number of areas, from Allstate Benefits to Roadside Services to telematics. For the second quarter, we want to highlight where we stand on telematics, which is shown on Slide 5. 
Allstate began investing in telematic space over 6 years ago as a way to improve our business model by serving customers in new and different ways. And we've made a tremendous amount of progress over this time period. First, telematics is a very powerful pricing tool that enables us to give customers the most accurate price. Secondly, we found ways to use the continuous connection to broaden the value they get from Allstate and provide additional services to them. And for example, we provide customers with tips on how to better protect themselves by changing their driving habits. We've also expanded the value they get from being with Allstate, such as merchandise discounts based on how safe they drive. The Safe Driver Rewards are very popular and expand that customer value proposition. We've built up a wide range of capabilities, have made significant investments and today, we have over 1 million connected customers. 
We've also concluded that this could be a strategic platform for Allstate, the concepts of which are laid out in the annual report to the shareholders. As a result, we established a connected car entity, Arity, outside of the insurance company, which you can see in the graphic on the lower left of this slide. This provides us with the strategic and operating flexibility to capture additional value from our growing connected customer base by providing other companies the ability to offer services to our customers. It also enables other companies to connect with their customers by using this platform and Arity's capabilities. We believe that the transformation of the personal transportation system will be one of the largest economic benefits for individual households in the future. And this structure enables us to participate in that value creation. 
Now let me turn it over to Pat."

Start by reviewing the Property-Liability P&L at the top of Slide 6. Property-Liability earned premium of $7.8 billion in the second quarter of 2016, was 3.5% higher than the same period last year. For the first 6 months of 2016, earned premi",1839,"Thanks, Tom. Start by reviewing the Property-Liability P&L at the top of Slide 6. Property-Liability earned premium of $7.8 billion in the second quarter of 2016, was 3.5% higher than the same period last year. For the first 6 months of 2016, earned premium grew by 3.8%. Catastrophe losses through the first 6 months of 2016 meaningfully impacted underwriting income. Second quarter catastrophe losses of $961 million were 20.6% higher than the prior year quarter, while catastrophe losses of $1.8 billion for the first half of 2016 were almost $700 million higher than the first 6 months of last year. These higher catastrophe losses drove recorded combined ratios of 100.8 in the second quarter of 2016 and 99.6 in the first half of 2016. 
When we exclude catastrophes in prior year reserve reestimates, the underlying combined ratio of 88.6 in the second quarter, 87.9 in the first 6 months of 2016, were both below their respective levels in 2015. June year-to-date results is slightly below our annual outlook range of 88 to 90. 
Property-Liability net investment income increased 8.2% to $316 million for the second quarter of 2016, driven primarily by higher performance-based investment income. As a result, Property-Liability operating income of $186 million in the second quarter of 2016 was 6.1% below the prior year result, while the $477 million of operating income through the first 6 months of 2016 was 36.7% below the first 6 months of 2015. 
The bottom of this slide contains growth trends information as well as a view of Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. In the chart on the bottom left, the blue line represents net written premium growth while the red line shows our policy in force trend. Property-Liability policies in force declined by 1.4% or 471,000 in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, while net written premium increased by 2.2% in the same time period. 
These trends have been heavily influenced by auto profit improvement actions across underwriting brands. The widening gap between these 2 trends reflect increases in average per premium per policy given ongoing rate increases. The exhibit on the bottom right shows the property liability recorded and underlying combined ratio along with some history. As you can see in the red line, recorded results in the first 2 quarters of 2016 have been impacted by higher levels of catastrophe losses. Taking a longer period of time into account, the recorded combined ratio on a 12-month moving basis is 96.2. 
Slide 7 provides a more detailed view of our Allstate brand auto margin results. Chart on the top left of this page provides a view of the quarterly recorded and underlying combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 97.8 in the second quarter of 2016 was unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2015. The lower expense ratio offset an increase in the underlying loss ratio in the quarter. Our early recognition of increased frequency and severity, along with the aggressive actions we continue to take, have enabled us to keep auto margins stable despite a continued challenging auto loss cost environment. 
Chart on the top right highlights drivers of the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continue to increase as approve rates have resulted in a 5.9% increase in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter a year ago. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the second quarter of 2016 increased to 5.8% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Positive gap between these 2 trends narrowed in the second quarter based on ongoing higher frequency, but was consistent with the level we saw during the second quarter of 2015. 
The bottom 2 charts on this page provide 20 years of history for Allstate brand auto gross and paid property damage frequency. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we evaluate frequency on a gross and paid basis for a variety of reasons, such as managing claims staffing, evaluating cost trends, estimating our ultimate losses. We watch both metrics to ensure we can evaluate and react to changes in our results as quickly as possible. Gross frequency is a lead indicator of future loss trends, while paid frequency helps us understand changes in the proportion of claims we close with a payment. Relationship between these 2 measures will fluctuate over time given environmental impacts and claim department process changes. 
As you can see on the charts on this page, both measures are up substantially from where they've been performing in recent history. For the first 12 of the past 20 years, you can see a fairly steady decline in frequency as the safety of cars is enhanced. As the impacts from safety improvements fully work their way into the fleet, we saw a flattening trend for approximately 5 years. Now the results we've seen in the past 18 months have taken us back to levels not experienced since 2003 for gross frequency and 2004 and 2010 for paid frequency. 
The most recent period reflects just how challenging an auto loss cost environment we continue to operate in. We first identified the uptick in gross frequency during the fourth quarter of 2014, and our analysis indicated it was being driven mainly by environmental factors unrelated to our pricing and underwriting. We continue to believe that our early identification of the issue, along with our proactive and aggressive response, will position us well to accelerate profitable growth as loss trends stabilize. 
We continue to implement our profit improvement plan, which is summarized on Slide 8. Given ongoing auto loss pressure, we continue to seek approval for higher auto prices. In the second quarter, we received approval to increased rates by $628 million annually, bringing the total for the first 6 months of 2016 to $963 million, as you can see from the bar chart in the lower left. Rate increases in the second quarter of 2016 were approved in 35 states and Canadian provinces and were, on average, 6.2%. The amount of rates approved for the second quarter of 2016 includes a significant amount of rate increases in large states, which drove the total to be much higher than our previous run rate. 
The impact of these rate approvals on average premium for Allstate brand auto is shown on the lower right. Average gross written premium per policy increased by 5.7% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium per policy, which lags written, increased by 4.7%. Allstate brand auto rate changes take 6 months to be fully recognized in average gross written premium, while it take at least 12 months to be fully earned into the P&L. 
Significant amount of premium we generated by seeking approval for auto price increases has served us well so far. So if we'd not moved early, our auto returns would be significantly lower, and we'd be playing catch up until well after the loss pressure we and others are experiencing subsides. We tightened underwriting guidelines in 2015 to reduce new business in underperforming segments and reduced the new business penalty. These guidelines are being modified for specific segments of business within each state and local market, where we feel comfortable that we've achieved rate adequacy. 
Our claims team continues to address physical damage severity trends, which are being unfavorably impacted by stress to the auto repair industry from rising industry auto frequency, higher costs associated with repairing newer, more sophisticated vehicles and greater total loss volume on older model year cars. Property damage paid severity in the second quarter of 2016 remained elevated at 5.3%, but the trend improved relative to the first quarter of this year.
Property-Liability expense ratio decreased by 0.8 point in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting reductions in professional services and advertising costs as well as lower accruals for compensation incentives. We continue to evaluate investments in growth and would expect to accelerate these investments as loss trends stabilize. 
Allstate brand homeowners results are shown on Slide 9. In the chart on the left, you can see the impact catastrophes have had in the first 2 quarters of 2016, given the gap between the blue columns and the red line. The recorded combined ratio on a 12-month moving basis was 83.5 as of the second quarter of 2016. On an underlying basis, continued favorable non-catastrophe losses and lower expenses resulted in a 58.6 underlying combined ratio in the quarter, which was 2.1 points lower than the prior year quarter. The components of the second quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are in the chart on the right. Average earned premium per policy increased by 2.5% over the prior year quarter, while underlying loss and expense per policy declined by 1.1%. 
Slide 10 provides a view of top and bottom line trends for Esurance. We begin with -- I'll begin on the left with a summary of the combined ratio. Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 108.9 in the second quarter of 2016 was 1.3 points better than the same period in 2015, reflecting lower operating expenses, which more than offset higher catastrophes and unfavorable auto claim frequency. As Tom mentioned earlier, the underlying loss ratio of 74.5 remains higher than where we would like it to perform in the long term. 
On the right, you can see Esurance's premium and policy in force trends. Both in Esurance has been impacted by ongoing profit improvement actions, including rate increases, underwriting guideline adjustments and decreased marketing in select geographies. Given these actions, policies, which are represented by the gray line, declined by 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2015, while net written premium in the second quarter of 2016 grew by 5.7% compared to the same quarter a year ago, driven by higher average premiums per policy. 
Encompass' results are highlighted on Page 11. The left-hand chart summarizes the combined ratio trends. Encompass' recorded combined ratio of 104.9 in the second quarter of 2016 was 10.8 points below the prior year quarter, driven by a lower level of catastrophes, a reduced expense ratio and a 2.4 point improvement in the loss ratio, excluding catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio of Encompass of 92.8 was 3.7 points better than the second quarter a year ago, the result of undergoing pricing and underwriting actions to achieve target margins. 
The chart on the right of this page shows how the size of the business has been impacted by profit improvement actions. Net written premium, as shown by the blue line, declined by 6.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by an 11.4% decline in policies in force, which more than offset higher average premiums from increased rates. Encompass has continued to take actions to achieve targeted returns by enhancing its pricing, contract coverage and underwriting sophistication.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve."

Slide 12 provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the second quarter of 2016. We refocused Allstate Financial over the past several years, primarily on business written to the Allstate agencies and on voluntary workplace products for customers of Allstate Benefits. The annuity product lines closer to business has effectively been run off. Premium and contract charges totaled $564 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.2% in the quarter versus the prior year. The solid growth in premium and contract charges was driven by Allstate Benefits, which grew 9.6% in the second quarter, with an increase of 468,000 policies over the prior 12 months. Allstate Financial operating income decreased to $120 million in the quarter from $139 million in the prior year. 
Across the top of this slide, we show net and operating income for each business. Life business operating income of $64 million in the second quarter increased $9 million compared to last year, driven by favorable mortality experience and premium growth. Allstate Benefits operating income of $29 million for the second quarter was consistent with the second quarter of last year. The annuity business generated operating income of $27 million, down $29 million from the second quarter of 2015 due to 2015's portfolio repositioning and worse mortality. 
The chart on the bottom right shows liquidity need by product. For immediate annuities in the gray bar, benefits will be paid to annuities over many years, lowering required liquidity. As a result, we repositioned this portfolio from longer-duration fixed income securities and are shifting to performance-based investments, which offer higher risk-adjusted returns. 
Now let's go on to Slide 13. We've been proactively managing the investment portfolio in response to changes in our liability profile in the low-interest-rate environment, while reducing the portfolio's sensitivity toward an eventual rise in interest rates. As we discussed in prior quarters, we have been shifting the risk posture of our portfolio over time, which is shown in the chart on the upper left. Several years ago, we began to reposition the portfolio by moving away from lending and toward ownership. This is reflected in the decreased allocation to investment-grade fixed income and increasing performance-based investments, such as private equity, real estate, timber and agriculture. 
Our performance-based strategy is expected to generate higher somewhat variable returns over time. We traded capacity for the incremental risk by strengthening our capital position through issuing preferred securities, reducing debt, decreasing exposure to natural catastrophes and shrinking our annuity business. 
Total returns for the quarter in the upper right remains strong at 1.9%, with valuations continuing to be positive reflecting lower market yields. The unrealized gain in the portfolio increased to $2.7 billion. 
Gross investment income is provided at the bottom left of the slide. Variability in income largely results from our performance-based investments, shown in gray. Investment yield by business segment are provided in the bottom right. We shortened the duration of the Property-Liability portfolio in 2012 and 2013, resulting in an interest-bearing portfolio yield closer to current market yields, which will be more responsive to rising interest rates, as you saw with it's shorter maturity profile. 
The Allstate Financial yield trend reflects the impact of last year's portfolio repositioning when we sold longer-duration fixed income security in the immediate annuity portfolio. Except to the impact of these sales, the interest-bearing portfolio yield at Allstate Financial has been relatively stable despite the rate environment, as investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability outflows. The yield for both segments continue to be pressured to the extent rates remain below the portfolio averages.
Slide 14 provides overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. We finished the second quarter of 2016 with $20.6 billion of shareholders equity, a debt to capital ratio of 19.9% and deployable holding company assets of $2.5 billion. Book value per common share for the second quarter of 2016 was $50.05, up 4.4% from 2015, reflecting higher unrealized net capital gains.
We returned over $1 billion in cash to common shareholders through the first 6 months of the year. We paid $240 million in common share dividends, and we purchased $829 million of common shares. On June 1, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase $350 million of our outstanding common stock. The completion of the ASR agreement will be on or before September 23 of this year. As of June 30, $1.2 billion remained of the $1.5 billion common share repurchase authorization.

I think as Pat said during his opening remarks, some of the quarterly rate change was driven by the fact that we took rate this past quarter in some extremely large states. And that impacted it disproportionately when you look at it on the countrywide impact. So it is -- you are correct. It is disproportionately high to what you have been seeing. And I certainly won't extrapolate out that number for the rest of the quarter -- for the rest of the year. However, I would be remiss if I didn't say, we're going to continue to monitor rate need and rate indication and take appropriate levels as we have. When it is primarily in smaller states, it has a smaller impact on the countrywide average, but when it's in larger states, it will have a larger impact. And so it will fluctuate because it's based upon need and indication in particular geographic areas, as opposed -- which has a countrywide impact. But it's -- you can't think of it as a countrywide rate increase. The second question on distribution. It's been a tough period, yet we've been able to hold fast and slightly grow some of our distribution points of presence. It's hard to bring on new agency owners in this environment when you're taking a lot of rate, when there's a great deal of activity going on that is requiring them to respond and do things other than merely attempt to get new customers. Our termination rate and turn over rate has not changed. We have added fewer in the recent past. But we expect as this activity dissipates and lessens, we'll be able to add additional agency owners, additional LSPs and I would add, additional financial specialists, because we think the fact that we entered this phase early, took action quickly and aggressively, will allow us to emerge quickly and position us for growth and continued growth in points of presence as well. I hope that answers your question."

Yes, I think there's the graph, the side-by-side of gross and paid is informative because we've tracked both and reported on both. They serve different purposes, as Pat described, and they show up differently. Clearly, in gross, it's a leading indicator. So you're reporting on and showing that everything that's coming in that might be a claim. And in fact, this is subject to every single change in potential opening practice in claims, how we think about it, how we capture information. And clearly, there's some segment to this that is closed without payment. But for these, and especially in the most recent difficult frequency environment, we're trying to capture as much information as possible with as much granularity as possible and predict claims need, claims staffing need, so that we can provide our customers with the absolute best service in the time that they need it. So it tends to lead and it tends to over-capture, obviously, what is going to be on the paid side. And you have this gap. It's especially true on BI because of the long tail, and that's a timing issue. But you have a natural gap in just claims closure. You also see -- have some small areas where it seems out of pattern, Elyse, but it's really a question of catching up. It's a question of closing out and paying a bunch of claims. It's a question of figuring out where demand is. We see this not just here, but you see it on subro as well. Sometimes we'll get hit with a big lump of subro claims from third-party carriers because they just backed up and all of a sudden, they come in. And so that kind of -- I refer to it as peristalsis in our claims system. Sometimes there's a catch up. As you had a backlog, things slow down, and then it's pushed through. You manage to clear a lot of claims. And so it'll never mirror exactly, but it's eerily similar if pushed over little by time and dampened a little in terms of its volatility and variability."

So I just want to point out and restate what I said in answering Elyse's question. So we made a decision during the second half of 2015 to try to capture additional information on every claim. And as we did that, we did that for the purposes of really digging at a very granular level into what was happening in our claims pattern and make sure that we were ahead of the game in both an ability to staff it and an ability to predict, to the extent we can, emerging trends. And so as we began capturing additional information, we began capturing additional information on what we call hit fixed object or non-vehicle accident. And the fixed object that you hit can vary depending upon the season. In the January and February, that fixed object could be a snow bank. It's less likely to be a snowbank in July and August. But sometimes it's something that can result in a claim, like a mailbox or somebody's tree or a garage door or something like that. And sometimes it's something that would not result in a claim. So we wanted to capture additional information. We did, and as a result, we were probably capturing, and continue to capture, some incidents that when you look at it, you're less likely to think it's going to result in a claim. But to be complete, we wanted to capture everything. It allowed us to make a more informed assessment of liability earlier in the process. As we disclosed in the supplement, as a result of that change, there's been a gross frequency for PD increase. And we quantify that. It's about 1.5 points in the third quarter of 2015, it's about 2 points in the fourth quarter, and it's about 3 points in the second quarter of 2016. And so you'll see adjusted numbers in the supplement as well as the ""gross numbers"" on adjusted numbers. Most of those additional claims that we're capturing are closed without a payment, so they have no impact to the income statement, and they're not impacting our paid. But we wanted to capture it to see trends. And when you're as large as we are, every little change in what you capture and in claims opening practices can influence the gross number."

Let me talk a little bit about our investment portfolio, which I think is what you're referring to. I made a comment in the prepared remarks about the difference between the portfolio yield and the current yield you might be able to reinvest in. And for Property-Liability, it's really close. For life, there's a difference. Obviously, we have longer-duration assets. We're getting good yields on those today, but they slowly run off over time. The good news is, for us, unlike many other companies, is we've been paying out our run-off annuity liabilities, and a lot of that cash flow's coming from the portfolio. So we haven't had to reinvest in the lower interest rate environment. Today, that's slowing down a little bit. So we have some cash flow beyond that, which we're investing primarily in performance-based investments, as we said, which really is designed to match up to our liability profile, which is longer duration than many of our competitors in terms of -- because we're running it off. So if you look at that, and performance-based investments, we believe, would earn substantially higher, albeit variable returns over a period of time than you would in fixed income. So we feel our income for Allstate Financial should hold on investments, should hold reasonably well. Probably a slow downturn, as you can imagine, given some cash flow and some of the market environments and what we do managing the portfolio on a routine basis. In terms of charges, probably, I think you're thinking of maybe a premium deficiency charge. We aggregate our -- all of our life and annuity businesses and we disclosed this in the footnotes in the financial statements. Right now, we have to have sufficiency in that. We continue to look at that. And once again, there have -- being a performance-based investing could -- will help us significantly in terms of increasing and holding the returns we have in those long-dated annuities. I hope that helps and answers your question."

So we start there. And that's true with all of our businesses today. The -- but then what we do is we adjust it for what our strategies and the volatilities [indiscernible]. So when you look at the underlying combined ratio for homeowners, for example, we -- it's lower than you would see for the other businesses because it utilizes more capital because it's more volatile. We have a very sophisticated process of allocating economic capital, not just to those lines of business. But then, Matt and his team push it down by state. So we've always talked about the system we have. That system includes taking economic capital for homeowners down to places like Mississippi on the coast is going to be different than Wisconsin in the woods. And so by homeowners, we'll always have a lower underlying combined ratio and lower underlying loss ratio than you would see from the auto business. The auto business, we don't give a target like some of our competitors do, but if you look at the sort of where we've operated, it's kind of been where GEICO and Progressive is, which, call it, the mid-90s. That's the place where our customers have been willing to give us a good return for providing the services we do. That's kind of where we look to be at, in that zone. But we don't have a specific number that we give out either by quarter or year. If you look at the other Property-Liability businesses, they look more like auto insurance than they do homeowner insurance. If you go over to Esurance, we look at it on a longer-term basis than just the underlying combined ratio because of the way the accounting works on getting new customers. So you spend all your money upfront getting new customers and it gets expensed right away, as opposed to in the Allstate channel, we're providing service all along, so the commissions we pay to our customers provide that service, so we could amortize long. So you would -- you should expect to see a higher recorded combined ratio for Esurance than you would for Allstate because of that accounting, but also because of it's size and the growth potential we have in that segment, so we've been -- as long as Don's team is creating economic value, we will continue to invest because we believe we're creating long-term shareholder value, even if it hurts current earnings. So if you look at the underwriting loss, we've been running underwriting loss since we bought Esurance, but it's doubled its size. And if you double its size, we believe we'd create a lot of economic value. Encompass looks more like the Allstate channel and customer segment than the other one. So that's how we think -- but obviously, we have similar conversations for the life business and Allstate Benefits. Is that helpful?"

If we assume that you could fix those over the next couple of years, that would be fantastic for margins. Can we -- one, is that sort of the right way to think about it, if you guys can get ahead with pricing and/or you get a tailwind because frequency trends stabilize or even reverse. And then I guess, the other thing that's sort of implicit in that assumption is that you'll be able to maintain margins you're currently been getting in homeowners. And we haven't been talking of that quite as much just because auto's been a focus. But is does that -- if you're sort of thinking about this big picture and staying at that level, are those sort of the right way we should be thinking about this?"

So if you look at the personal transportation system, we think it offers one of the biggest economic opportunities facing Ame",608,"Okay, Kai, let me answer it first with a 2-component answer: One is the overall environment, and second is Allstate specifically. So if you look at the personal transportation system, we think it offers one of the biggest economic opportunities facing America, the restructuring of it. Just a few statistics: There's 240 million cars in the United States. They're worth about $4 trillion. Direct cost to maintain and run those cars is about $2 trillion. You can add another $1 trillion of indirect cost, and it's very inefficient. Capacity utilization is about 4% in total. It's about 33% at peak hours. And then you see one person in a car most of the time rather than multiple people. So everywhere I look, I see idle cars and if they're moving, they only have one passenger. At the same time there's about 30,000 people killed in that system, and there's billions of hours spent either sitting in traffic or waiting for -- looking for a parking spot. So we can do better. And if it was your system, you'd shut it down and rebuild it. That will be done over time. We believe it has the opportunity to increase personal household consumption by up to 5% on an annual basis. So there's big money here. The trains on the track, it's moving and it's picking up speed. So what's Allstate going to do about that? It's first, we can use the telematics data to improve the accuracy of our pricing. So today, most companies estimate the chances of people having an accident by their history and where they live. With DriveWise, we can look contextually at everything you do about driving and price it with a real driving behavior that gives us more accurate price. We're also testing pricing plans, so that you can continue to pay us like we do today, over 6 months, as Matt talked about, or you can pay us per mile if you want to. So there's lots of things that will happen in this personal transportation industry that we believe creates great opportunity for Allstate. At same the time we're broadening that value proposition to customers beyond just pricing, so they get more than -- from Allstate, than just advice on how to protect themselves or in more than helping fixing their car when they get in an accident. So today for example, we give them safe driving tips as to how to be -- do better driving. We connect them with Roadside so they can be -- contextually, we can get there faster. We're also doing a number of things in terms of giving them rewards. So we're both doing a better job than what we currently offer, and we're expanding the offering we give them. Now there's many companies that want to get in this space, and we think we have a natural way in because it's direct and it's low friction in terms of giving customers direct benefit from the connection. So it's our belief that we can use that connection then for multiple purposes, such as road usage, providing real-time safety advice, consumer benefits that are determined by a customer's interest and the time and place, specific location they're at. So as a result of that, we've created Arity as a way of bundling those services together on one platform. So the strategy is strengthen our existing businesses and find new revenue sources by leveraging those connections with customers. We don't disclose the amount of money. We spent -- we don't get to 1 million customers without spending some money on it. But we don't break that number out."

The other component that is a little more difficult to quantify, but we know is out there, is the level of distracted driving that's taking place today. And that distracted driving, the use of cell phones while driving, the texting, Facebook surfing, we've all watched it, we've all -- some of us have been victims of it on the road. We all watch people sliding around in the lanes. And the combination of increased number of cars on the road due to the first thing, due to the miles driven, means you have a greater density of cars on the road with less margin of error. So there's less space in between those cars. When you add distracted driving to that and you have people swerving and not paying attention and go into hard stops, it's an increased likelihood that they're going to hit somebody else. So it's a perfect storm to have greater number of cars on the road, driving faster. And we've lots of evidence that speed has increased as well. Our DriveWise data is showing us greater number of trips, greater length of those trips and greater speed during those trips. So it's a bad combination when you add to it people looking at their cell phone instead of being focused on their driving."

So we're adapting to the higher costs associated with auto insurance, as most of you have asked us about. But I want to be clear, it's comprehensive in a multifaceted approach. It's not just about raising price. We're taking a more segmented approach to that. We are managing risk-adjusted returns to create shareholder value.

Now we also have Matt Winter, our president, here with us; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses, Mary Jane Fortin, who's President of our Allstate Life and Retirement; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. 
Let's begin on Slide 2. The second quarter results now highlight really how our proactive approach to external conditions helps us achieve our objectives and create long-term shareholder value. We earned $242 million despite seasonally high second quarter catastrophe losses, a record hailstorm in Texas, continued increases in the frequency of auto accidents and the impact of Brexit on the investment market. And while we did not predict all of these would happen, we considered the possibilities when we executed our business plan. 
Operating income was $0.62 per share for the quarter, reflecting a recorded combined ratio of 100.8, and then underlying combined ratio of 88.6 for the quarter and 87.9 for the first 6 months, which is in comparison to our full year forecast of 88 to 90. Our Allstate financial strategic repositioning is working with operating income up slightly to $120 million, and investment returns were strong at 1.9% for the quarter, about half of which is from current income and the other half is from appreciation of the bond portfolio.
Let's go to Slide 3, which provides an overview of the second quarter operating results for our 4 Property-Liability customer segments. As you know, we have a consumer-focused strategy and have over 40 million policies outstanding, of which 34 million are for property-liability protection. The results of each of the 4 segments of the Property-Liability market are shown at the diagram on the bottom of the page. 
Allstate agencies provide local advice in a broad range of branded products, represents about 90% of total property-liability premiums. Total Allstate-brand policies in force declined from the second quarter of last year by 1% as we intentionally reduced new business levels until we improve returns on capital for auto insurance and the impact of these programs on customer retention.
While auto policies declined, net written premium increased by 3.9%, which would essentially offset the impact of continued increases in frequency and severity. The recorded combined ratio was 101.2. The recorded combined ratio for homeowners was 97, despite $645 million of catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 87.5 for the Allstate-branded business for the quarter. 
Moving across to the lower right, is Esurance policies in force declined as we reduced new auto business in this segment, but net written premium increased by 5.7% over the prior year quarter. The recorded and underlying combined ratio was 108.9 and 104.8, which were 1.3 and 1.9. points better than last year's second quarter results. Their underlying loss ratio was consistent with the prior year quarter. 
In the upper right is Answer Financial. That's our self-serve aggregator that sells products for more than 20 different companies. Premiums grew by 3.4% in the second quarter, lower than the prior year's, which reflects fewer leads from Esurance, as we reduced growth at Esurance. 
Independent agencies serve customers who want local advice, but do not have a high affinity for branded products. Encompass, in the upper left, serves this segment and has taken significant actions that have reduced the size of the business while simultaneously improving returns. 
Policies in force were down 11.4%. You can see it in the little red box there at the top. Net written premiums declined by 6.8% as higher prices partially offset the decline in policies. The recorded and underlying combined ratios both improved in the quarter from the prior year quarter. 
As you know, we established and communicate our operating priorities each year. And they range from doing a better job for customers to driving long-term growth, which are shown on Slide 4. The first 3 priorities are all interrelated. We're, of course, always working to provide customers even better value and service. This ranges from the rapid response to catastrophe that we've become known for as well as our agency owners being trusted advisers and helping customers prepare and protect themselves from life's uncertainties. 
We've had over 215,000 catastrophe claims through the end of June and have closed approximately 95% of those. We're continually focused on improving service from Allstate agencies and have made great progress in initiating relationships with customers. 
Achieving target returns on capital, however, has required on us to raise prices on auto insurance, given the greater frequency of accidents and increased severity of claim costs. So we responded with a comprehensive property improvement program, which prioritizes existing customers ahead of new customers, leading to a significant reduction in new business lines. It has also had a negative impact on customer retention levels. This has resulted in a 1.4% decline in the number of Property-Liability policies in force. Allstate Benefits, on the other hand, added almost 0.5 million new customers over the last year, offsetting the Property-Liability decline. But all of our businesses have the potential for growth over the long term.
As you know well, the investment markets this year have been highly volatile, from the early decline in energy prices to a rebound and then down again; Brexit; you have record low interest rates; and global equity markets that have been moving up, down and sideways. Our investment strategy and execution have served us well in this environment for the total return of 3.9% for the first 6 months of the year. We continue to build out our performance-based asset team and have made progress in increasing the amount of these assets back in the $12 billion payout annuity block. As we discussed on last quarter's call, this is economically the right risk-and-return trade-off for shareholders given the long duration of these liabilities. 
We've also made progress on building long-term growth platforms in a number of areas, from Allstate Benefits to Roadside Services to telematics. For the second quarter, we want to highlight where we stand on telematics, which is shown on Slide 5. 
Allstate began investing in telematic space over 6 years ago as a way to improve our business model by serving customers in new and different ways. And we've made a tremendous amount of progress over this time period. First, telematics is a very powerful pricing tool that enables us to give customers the most accurate price. Secondly, we found ways to use the continuous connection to broaden the value they get from Allstate and provide additional services to them. And for example, we provide customers with tips on how to better protect themselves by changing their driving habits. We've also expanded the value they get from being with Allstate, such as merchandise discounts based on how safe they drive. The Safe Driver Rewards are very popular and expand that customer value proposition. We've built up a wide range of capabilities, have made significant investments and today, we have over 1 million connected customers. 
We've also concluded that this could be a strategic platform for Allstate, the concepts of which are laid out in the annual report to the shareholders. As a result, we established a connected car entity, Arity, outside of the insurance company, which you can see in the graphic on the lower left of this slide. This provides us with the strategic and operating flexibility to capture additional value from our growing connected customer base by providing other companies the ability to offer services to our customers. It also enables other companies to connect with their customers by using this platform and Arity's capabilities. We believe that the transformation of the personal transportation system will be one of the largest economic benefits for individual households in the future. And this structure enables us to participate in that value creation. 
Now let me turn it over to Pat."

Start by reviewing the Property-Liability P&L at the top of Slide 6. Property-Liability earned premium of $7.8 billion in the second quarter of 2016, was 3.5% higher than the same period last year. For the first 6 months of 2016, earned premi",1839,"Thanks, Tom. Start by reviewing the Property-Liability P&L at the top of Slide 6. Property-Liability earned premium of $7.8 billion in the second quarter of 2016, was 3.5% higher than the same period last year. For the first 6 months of 2016, earned premium grew by 3.8%. Catastrophe losses through the first 6 months of 2016 meaningfully impacted underwriting income. Second quarter catastrophe losses of $961 million were 20.6% higher than the prior year quarter, while catastrophe losses of $1.8 billion for the first half of 2016 were almost $700 million higher than the first 6 months of last year. These higher catastrophe losses drove recorded combined ratios of 100.8 in the second quarter of 2016 and 99.6 in the first half of 2016. 
When we exclude catastrophes in prior year reserve reestimates, the underlying combined ratio of 88.6 in the second quarter, 87.9 in the first 6 months of 2016, were both below their respective levels in 2015. June year-to-date results is slightly below our annual outlook range of 88 to 90. 
Property-Liability net investment income increased 8.2% to $316 million for the second quarter of 2016, driven primarily by higher performance-based investment income. As a result, Property-Liability operating income of $186 million in the second quarter of 2016 was 6.1% below the prior year result, while the $477 million of operating income through the first 6 months of 2016 was 36.7% below the first 6 months of 2015. 
The bottom of this slide contains growth trends information as well as a view of Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. In the chart on the bottom left, the blue line represents net written premium growth while the red line shows our policy in force trend. Property-Liability policies in force declined by 1.4% or 471,000 in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, while net written premium increased by 2.2% in the same time period. 
These trends have been heavily influenced by auto profit improvement actions across underwriting brands. The widening gap between these 2 trends reflect increases in average per premium per policy given ongoing rate increases. The exhibit on the bottom right shows the property liability recorded and underlying combined ratio along with some history. As you can see in the red line, recorded results in the first 2 quarters of 2016 have been impacted by higher levels of catastrophe losses. Taking a longer period of time into account, the recorded combined ratio on a 12-month moving basis is 96.2. 
Slide 7 provides a more detailed view of our Allstate brand auto margin results. Chart on the top left of this page provides a view of the quarterly recorded and underlying combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 97.8 in the second quarter of 2016 was unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2015. The lower expense ratio offset an increase in the underlying loss ratio in the quarter. Our early recognition of increased frequency and severity, along with the aggressive actions we continue to take, have enabled us to keep auto margins stable despite a continued challenging auto loss cost environment. 
Chart on the top right highlights drivers of the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continue to increase as approve rates have resulted in a 5.9% increase in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter a year ago. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the second quarter of 2016 increased to 5.8% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Positive gap between these 2 trends narrowed in the second quarter based on ongoing higher frequency, but was consistent with the level we saw during the second quarter of 2015. 
The bottom 2 charts on this page provide 20 years of history for Allstate brand auto gross and paid property damage frequency. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we evaluate frequency on a gross and paid basis for a variety of reasons, such as managing claims staffing, evaluating cost trends, estimating our ultimate losses. We watch both metrics to ensure we can evaluate and react to changes in our results as quickly as possible. Gross frequency is a lead indicator of future loss trends, while paid frequency helps us understand changes in the proportion of claims we close with a payment. Relationship between these 2 measures will fluctuate over time given environmental impacts and claim department process changes. 
As you can see on the charts on this page, both measures are up substantially from where they've been performing in recent history. For the first 12 of the past 20 years, you can see a fairly steady decline in frequency as the safety of cars is enhanced. As the impacts from safety improvements fully work their way into the fleet, we saw a flattening trend for approximately 5 years. Now the results we've seen in the past 18 months have taken us back to levels not experienced since 2003 for gross frequency and 2004 and 2010 for paid frequency. 
The most recent period reflects just how challenging an auto loss cost environment we continue to operate in. We first identified the uptick in gross frequency during the fourth quarter of 2014, and our analysis indicated it was being driven mainly by environmental factors unrelated to our pricing and underwriting. We continue to believe that our early identification of the issue, along with our proactive and aggressive response, will position us well to accelerate profitable growth as loss trends stabilize. 
We continue to implement our profit improvement plan, which is summarized on Slide 8. Given ongoing auto loss pressure, we continue to seek approval for higher auto prices. In the second quarter, we received approval to increased rates by $628 million annually, bringing the total for the first 6 months of 2016 to $963 million, as you can see from the bar chart in the lower left. Rate increases in the second quarter of 2016 were approved in 35 states and Canadian provinces and were, on average, 6.2%. The amount of rates approved for the second quarter of 2016 includes a significant amount of rate increases in large states, which drove the total to be much higher than our previous run rate. 
The impact of these rate approvals on average premium for Allstate brand auto is shown on the lower right. Average gross written premium per policy increased by 5.7% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium per policy, which lags written, increased by 4.7%. Allstate brand auto rate changes take 6 months to be fully recognized in average gross written premium, while it take at least 12 months to be fully earned into the P&L. 
Significant amount of premium we generated by seeking approval for auto price increases has served us well so far. So if we'd not moved early, our auto returns would be significantly lower, and we'd be playing catch up until well after the loss pressure we and others are experiencing subsides. We tightened underwriting guidelines in 2015 to reduce new business in underperforming segments and reduced the new business penalty. These guidelines are being modified for specific segments of business within each state and local market, where we feel comfortable that we've achieved rate adequacy. 
Our claims team continues to address physical damage severity trends, which are being unfavorably impacted by stress to the auto repair industry from rising industry auto frequency, higher costs associated with repairing newer, more sophisticated vehicles and greater total loss volume on older model year cars. Property damage paid severity in the second quarter of 2016 remained elevated at 5.3%, but the trend improved relative to the first quarter of this year.
Property-Liability expense ratio decreased by 0.8 point in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting reductions in professional services and advertising costs as well as lower accruals for compensation incentives. We continue to evaluate investments in growth and would expect to accelerate these investments as loss trends stabilize. 
Allstate brand homeowners results are shown on Slide 9. In the chart on the left, you can see the impact catastrophes have had in the first 2 quarters of 2016, given the gap between the blue columns and the red line. The recorded combined ratio on a 12-month moving basis was 83.5 as of the second quarter of 2016. On an underlying basis, continued favorable non-catastrophe losses and lower expenses resulted in a 58.6 underlying combined ratio in the quarter, which was 2.1 points lower than the prior year quarter. The components of the second quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are in the chart on the right. Average earned premium per policy increased by 2.5% over the prior year quarter, while underlying loss and expense per policy declined by 1.1%. 
Slide 10 provides a view of top and bottom line trends for Esurance. We begin with -- I'll begin on the left with a summary of the combined ratio. Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 108.9 in the second quarter of 2016 was 1.3 points better than the same period in 2015, reflecting lower operating expenses, which more than offset higher catastrophes and unfavorable auto claim frequency. As Tom mentioned earlier, the underlying loss ratio of 74.5 remains higher than where we would like it to perform in the long term. 
On the right, you can see Esurance's premium and policy in force trends. Both in Esurance has been impacted by ongoing profit improvement actions, including rate increases, underwriting guideline adjustments and decreased marketing in select geographies. Given these actions, policies, which are represented by the gray line, declined by 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2015, while net written premium in the second quarter of 2016 grew by 5.7% compared to the same quarter a year ago, driven by higher average premiums per policy. 
Encompass' results are highlighted on Page 11. The left-hand chart summarizes the combined ratio trends. Encompass' recorded combined ratio of 104.9 in the second quarter of 2016 was 10.8 points below the prior year quarter, driven by a lower level of catastrophes, a reduced expense ratio and a 2.4 point improvement in the loss ratio, excluding catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio of Encompass of 92.8 was 3.7 points better than the second quarter a year ago, the result of undergoing pricing and underwriting actions to achieve target margins. 
The chart on the right of this page shows how the size of the business has been impacted by profit improvement actions. Net written premium, as shown by the blue line, declined by 6.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by an 11.4% decline in policies in force, which more than offset higher average premiums from increased rates. Encompass has continued to take actions to achieve targeted returns by enhancing its pricing, contract coverage and underwriting sophistication.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve."

Slide 12 provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the second quarter of 2016. We refocused Allstate Financial over the past several years, primarily on business written to the Allstate agencies and on voluntary workplace products for customers of Allstate Benefits. The annuity product lines closer to business has effectively been run off. Premium and contract charges totaled $564 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.2% in the quarter versus the prior year. The solid growth in premium and contract charges was driven by Allstate Benefits, which grew 9.6% in the second quarter, with an increase of 468,000 policies over the prior 12 months. Allstate Financial operating income decreased to $120 million in the quarter from $139 million in the prior year. 
Across the top of this slide, we show net and operating income for each business. Life business operating income of $64 million in the second quarter increased $9 million compared to last year, driven by favorable mortality experience and premium growth. Allstate Benefits operating income of $29 million for the second quarter was consistent with the second quarter of last year. The annuity business generated operating income of $27 million, down $29 million from the second quarter of 2015 due to 2015's portfolio repositioning and worse mortality. 
The chart on the bottom right shows liquidity need by product. For immediate annuities in the gray bar, benefits will be paid to annuities over many years, lowering required liquidity. As a result, we repositioned this portfolio from longer-duration fixed income securities and are shifting to performance-based investments, which offer higher risk-adjusted returns. 
Now let's go on to Slide 13. We've been proactively managing the investment portfolio in response to changes in our liability profile in the low-interest-rate environment, while reducing the portfolio's sensitivity toward an eventual rise in interest rates. As we discussed in prior quarters, we have been shifting the risk posture of our portfolio over time, which is shown in the chart on the upper left. Several years ago, we began to reposition the portfolio by moving away from lending and toward ownership. This is reflected in the decreased allocation to investment-grade fixed income and increasing performance-based investments, such as private equity, real estate, timber and agriculture. 
Our performance-based strategy is expected to generate higher somewhat variable returns over time. We traded capacity for the incremental risk by strengthening our capital position through issuing preferred securities, reducing debt, decreasing exposure to natural catastrophes and shrinking our annuity business. 
Total returns for the quarter in the upper right remains strong at 1.9%, with valuations continuing to be positive reflecting lower market yields. The unrealized gain in the portfolio increased to $2.7 billion. 
Gross investment income is provided at the bottom left of the slide. Variability in income largely results from our performance-based investments, shown in gray. Investment yield by business segment are provided in the bottom right. We shortened the duration of the Property-Liability portfolio in 2012 and 2013, resulting in an interest-bearing portfolio yield closer to current market yields, which will be more responsive to rising interest rates, as you saw with its shorter maturity profile. 
The Allstate Financial yield trend reflects the impact of last year's portfolio repositioning when we sold longer-duration fixed income security in the immediate annuity portfolio. Except to the impact of these sales, the interest-bearing portfolio yield at Allstate Financial has been relatively stable despite the rate environment, as investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability outflows. The yield for both segments continue to be pressured to the extent rates remain below the portfolio averages.
Slide 14 provides overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. We finished the second quarter of 2016 with $20.6 billion of shareholders equity, a debt to capital ratio of 19.9% and deployable holding company assets of $2.5 billion. Book value per common share for the second quarter of 2016 was $50.05, up 4.4% from 2015, reflecting higher unrealized net capital gains.
We returned over $1 billion in cash to common shareholders through the first 6 months of the year. We paid $240 million in common share dividends, and we purchased $829 million of common shares. On June 1, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase $350 million of our outstanding common stock. The completion of the ASR agreement will be on or before September 23 of this year. As of June 30, $1.2 billion remained of the $1.5 billion common share repurchase authorization.

I think as Pat said during his opening remarks, some of the quarterly rate change was driven by the fact that we took rate this past quarter in some extremely large states. And that impacted it disproportionately when you look at it on the countrywide impact. So it is -- you are correct. It is disproportionately high to what you have been seeing. And I certainly won't extrapolate out that number for the rest of the quarter -- for the rest of the year. However, I would be remiss if I didn't say, we're going to continue to monitor rate need and rate indication and take appropriate levels as we have. When it is primarily in smaller states, it has a smaller impact on the countrywide average, but when it's in larger states, it will have a larger impact. And so it will fluctuate because it's based upon need and indication in particular geographic areas, as opposed -- which has a countrywide impact. But it's -- you can't think of it as a countrywide rate increase. The second question on distribution. It's been a tough period, yet we've been able to hold fast and slightly grow some of our distribution points of presence. It's hard to bring on new agency owners in this environment when you're taking a lot of rate, when there's a great deal of activity going on that is requiring them to respond and do things other than merely attempt to get new customers. Our termination rate and turnover rate has not changed. We have added fewer in the recent past. But we expect as this activity dissipates and lessens, we'll be able to add additional agency owners, additional LSPs and I would add, additional financial specialists, because we think the fact that we entered this phase early, took action quickly and aggressively, will allow us to emerge quickly and position us for growth and continued growth in points of presence as well. I hope that answers your question."

So the expense reductions were not as great as they were in prior quarters in the year-over-year comparison. So we manage it both on a short-term and long-term basis. We try to control our expenses in total to make sure we're achieving our target returns. On the other hand, we're not willing to give up our long-term growth. So it's -- I would just say it's balanced. There's -- it's hard to predict where your expenses and your frequency and severity will be in a quarter, obviously, on a forward-looking basis.

And in fact, this is subject to every single change in potential opening practice in claims, how we think about it, how we capture information. And clearly, there's some segment to this that is closed without payment. But for these, and especially in the most recent difficult frequency environment, we're trying to capture as much information as possible with as much granularity as possible and predict claims need, claims staffing need, so that we can provide our customers with the absolute best service in the time that they need it. So it tends to lead and it tends to over-capture, obviously, what is going to be on the paid side. And you have this gap. It's especially true on BI because of the long tail, and that's a timing issue. But you have a natural gap in just claims closure. You also see -- have some small areas where it seems out of pattern, Elyse, but it's really a question of catching up. It's a question of closing out and paying a bunch of claims. It's a question of figuring out where demand is. We see this not just here, but you see it on subro as well. Sometimes we'll get hit with a big lump of subro claims from third-party carriers because they just backed up and all of a sudden, they come in. And so that kind of -- I refer to it as peristalsis in our claims system. Sometimes there's a catch up. As you had a backlog, things slow down, and then it's pushed through. You manage to clear a lot of claims. And so it'll never mirror exactly, but it's eerily similar if pushed over little by time and dampened a little in terms of its volatility and variability."

So I just want to point out and restate what I said in answering Elyse's question. So we made a decision during the second half of 2015 to try to capture additional information on every claim. And as we did that, we did that for the purposes of really digging at a very granular level into what was happening in our claims pattern and make sure that we were ahead of the game in both an ability to staff it and an ability to predict, to the extent we can, emerging trends. And so as we began capturing additional information, we began capturing additional information on what we call hit fixed object or non-vehicle accident. And the fixed object that you hit can vary depending upon the season. In the January and February, that fixed object could be a snow bank. It's less likely to be a snowbank in July and August. But sometimes it's something that can result in a claim, like a mailbox or somebody's tree or a garage door or something like that. And sometimes it's something that would not result in a claim. So we wanted to capture additional information. We did, and as a result, we were probably capturing, and continue to capture, some incidents that when you look at it, you're less likely to think it's going to result in a claim. But to be complete, we wanted to capture everything. It allowed us to make a more informed assessment of liability earlier in the process. As we disclosed in the supplement, as a result of that change, there's been a gross frequency for PD increase. And we quantify that. It's about 1.5 points in the third quarter of 2015, it's about 2 points in the fourth quarter, and it's about 3 points in the second quarter of 2016. And so you'll see adjusted numbers in the supplement as well as the ""gross numbers"" on adjusted numbers. Most of those additional claims that we're capturing are closed without a payment, so they have no impact to the income statement, and they're not impacting our paid. But we wanted to capture it to see trends. And when you're as large as we are, every little change in what you capture and in claims opening practices can influence the gross number."

Let me talk a little bit about our investment portfolio, which I think is what you're referring to. I made a comment in the prepared remarks about the difference between the portfolio yield and the current yield you might be able to reinvest in. And for Property-Liability, it's really close. For life, there's a difference. Obviously, we have longer-duration assets. We're getting good yields on those today, but they slowly run off over time. The good news is, for us, unlike many other companies, is we've been paying out our run-off annuity liabilities, and a lot of that cash flow's coming from the portfolio. So we haven't had to reinvest in the lower interest rate environment. Today, that's slowing down a little bit. So we have some cash flow beyond that, which we're investing primarily in performance-based investments, as we said, which really is designed to match up to our liability profile, which is longer duration than many of our competitors in terms of -- because we're running it off. So if you look at that, and performance-based investments, we believe, would earn substantially higher, albeit variable returns over a period of time than you would in fixed income. So we feel our income for Allstate Financial should hold on investments, should hold reasonably well. Probably a slow downturn, as you can imagine, given some cash flow and some of the market environments and what we do managing the portfolio on a routine basis. In terms of charges, probably, I think you're thinking of maybe a premium deficiency charge. We aggregate our -- all of our life and annuity businesses and we disclosed this in the footnotes in the financial statements. Right now, we have to have sufficiency in that. We continue to look at that. And once again, there have -- being a performance-based investing could -- will help us significantly in terms of increasing and holding the returns we have in those long-dated annuities. I hope that helps and answers your question."

The -- but then w",516,"Josh, let me go way up for a minute and I'll come down. So we expect all of our businesses to earn a current return on the business they write over our cost of capital. So we start there. And that's true with all of our businesses today. The -- but then what we do is we adjust it for what our strategies and the volatilities [indiscernible]. So when you look at the underlying combined ratio for homeowners, for example, we -- it's lower than you would see for the other businesses because it utilizes more capital because it's more volatile. We have a very sophisticated process of allocating economic capital, not just to those lines of business. But then, Matt and his team push it down by state. So we've always talked about the system we have. That system includes taking economic capital for homeowners down to places like Mississippi on the coast is going to be different than Wisconsin in the woods. And so by homeowners, we'll always have a lower underlying combined ratio and lower underlying loss ratio than you would see from the auto business. The auto business, we don't give a target like some of our competitors do, but if you look at the sort of where we've operated, it's kind of been where GEICO and Progressive is, which, call it, the mid-90s. That's the place where our customers have been willing to give us a good return for providing the services we do. That's kind of where we look to be at, in that zone. But we don't have a specific number that we give out either by quarter or year. If you look at the other Property-Liability businesses, they look more like auto insurance than they do homeowner insurance. If you go over to Esurance, we look at it on a longer-term basis than just the underlying combined ratio because of the way the accounting works on getting new customers. So you spend all your money upfront getting new customers and it gets expensed right away, as opposed to in the Allstate channel, we're providing service all along, so the commissions we pay to our customers provide that service, so we could amortize long. So you would -- you should expect to see a higher recorded combined ratio for Esurance than you would for Allstate because of that accounting, but also because of its size and the growth potential we have in that segment, so we've been -- as long as Don's team is creating economic value, we will continue to invest because we believe we're creating long-term shareholder value, even if it hurts current earnings. So if you look at the underwriting loss, we've been running underwriting loss since we bought Esurance, but it's doubled its size. And if you double its size, we believe we'd create a lot of economic value. Encompass looks more like the Allstate channel and customer segment than the other one. So that's how we think -- but obviously, we have similar conversations for the life business and Allstate Benefits. Is that helpful?"

When it will go through will be -- and you'll see it in the P&L, is when it exceeds the growth in frequency and severity. It didn't happen this quarter versus the second quarter of next year, but we don't price just to hold even. So at some point, we would expect to get back to that loss ratio that we talked about earlier."

So if you look at the personal transportation system, we think it offers one of the biggest economic opportunities facing Ame",608,"Okay, Kai, let me answer it first with a 2-component answer: One is the overall environment, and second is Allstate specifically. So if you look at the personal transportation system, we think it offers one of the biggest economic opportunities facing America, the restructuring of it. Just a few statistics: There's 240 million cars in the United States. They're worth about $4 trillion. Direct cost to maintain and run those cars is about $2 trillion. You can add another $1 trillion of indirect cost, and it's very inefficient. Capacity utilization is about 4% in total. It's about 33% at peak hours. And then you see one person in a car most of the time rather than multiple people. So everywhere I look, I see idle cars and if they're moving, they only have one passenger. At the same time there's about 30,000 people killed in that system, and there's billions of hours spent either sitting in traffic or waiting for -- looking for a parking spot. So we can do better. And if it was your system, you'd shut it down and rebuild it. That will be done over time. 
We believe it has the opportunity to increase personal household consumption by up to 5% on an annual basis. So there's big money here. The trains on the track, it's moving and it's picking up speed. So what's Allstate going to do about that? It's first, we can use the telematics data to improve the accuracy of our pricing. So today, most companies estimate the chances of people having an accident by their history and where they live. With DriveWise, we can look contextually at everything you do about driving and price it with a real driving behavior that gives us more accurate price. We're also testing pricing plans, so that you can continue to pay us like we do today, over 6 months, as Matt talked about, or you can pay us per mile if you want to. So there's lots of things that will happen in this personal transportation industry that we believe creates great opportunity for Allstate. 
At same the time we're broadening that value proposition to customers beyond just pricing, so they get more than -- from Allstate, than just advice on how to protect themselves or in more than helping fixing their car when they get in an accident. So today for example, we give them safe driving tips as to how to be -- do better driving. We connect them with Roadside so they can be -- contextually, we can get there faster. We're also doing a number of things in terms of giving them rewards. So we're both doing a better job than what we currently offer, and we're expanding the offering we give them. Now there's many companies that want to get in this space, and we think we have a natural way in because it's direct and it's low friction in terms of giving customers direct benefit from the connection. So it's our belief that we can use that connection then for multiple purposes, such as road usage, providing real-time safety advice, consumer benefits that are determined by a customer's interest and the time and place, specific location they're at. 
So as a result of that, we've created Arity as a way of bundling those services together on one platform. So the strategy is strengthen our existing businesses and find new revenue sources by leveraging those connections with customers. We don't disclose the amount of money. We spent -- we don't get to 1 million customers without spending some money on it. But we don't break that number out."

The other component that is a little more difficult to quantify, but we know is out there, is the level of distracted driving that's taking place today. And that distracted driving, the use of cell phones while driving, the texting, Facebook surfing, we've all watched it, we've all -- some of us have been victims of it on the road. We all watch people sliding around in the lanes. And the combination of increased number of cars on the road due to the first thing, due to the miles driven, means you have a greater density of cars on the road with less margin of error. So there's less space in between those cars. When you add distracted driving to that and you have people swerving and not paying attention and go into hard stops, it's an increased likelihood that they're going to hit somebody else. So it's a perfect storm to have greater number of cars on the road, driving faster. And we've lots of evidence that speed has increased as well. Our DriveWise data is showing us greater number of trips, greater length of those trips and greater speed during those trips. So it's a bad combination when you add to it people looking at their cell phone instead of being focused on their driving."

So let me just close with, we take a proactive approach to the current environment and making sure we invest for the long-term strategic growth opportunities. So we're adapting to the higher costs associated with auto insurance, as most of you have asked us about. But I want to be clear, it's comprehensive in a multifaceted approach. It's not just about raising price. We're taking a more segmented approach to that. We are managing risk-adjusted returns to create shareholder value. That's like what we did in homeowners, where we got smaller to get better, or as we're doing today in paying out annuities. We are focused on growth, whether that's Allstate Benefits, Allstate agencies and their relationships with the 16 million households; Esurance or our telematics offering.

Also here with us this morning are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President of the Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Life and Retirement; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.
This quarter, we delivered balanced operating results, underlying all our margin improved. Home results remained strong, and we generated good total return Wooden on our investment portfolio.
Let's start on Slide 2. Net income for the quarter was $491 million and operating income was $474 million, which was $1.26 per share. Operating income was adversely affected by elevated catastrophe losses and a $99 million increase in reserves of discontinued lines. The property liability reported combined ratio was 95.5 for the quarter. And the underlying combined ratio was 88, both for the quarter and the first 9 months of the year, which is at the favorable end of a full year outlook that we gave you in February of 88 to 90. Investment income was 7.3% lower than last year's third quarter, reflecting last year we sold about $2 billion of long duration bonds in the payout annuity portfolio and results were lower interest income, and we had strong return on our performance-based portfolio in 2015's third quarter.
Total investment returns remained strong at 1.3% for the quarter and 5.2% for the year, driven by both net investment income and price depreciation in the bond portfolio.
Let's go to Slide 3. On a total company basis, about half of the decline in property liability policies was offset by providing consumers a broad set of unique products, using different brands and distribution channels, most notably because of Allstate Benefits. The results for each of the 4 segments of the Property-Liability market are shown on the slide on diagram on this page here, so the Allstate brand, which is in the lower left, comprises 90% of premiums written and serves customers who prefer branded product and value local relationships. Policies in Force of the Allstate brand declined in the third quarter of last year by 2.3% as we continue to raise our auto insurance prices, and you can see the impact of those actions on both new business and retention. 
Allstate brand auto net written premiums grew by 4.1%, which reflects a 7.7% increase in average rate in premium. If you continue down that column, the Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 95.9 for the third quarter of 2016, which is 2.2 points better than the prior year quarter. Homeowners in the next column had a recorded combined ratio of 75.9. The underlying combined ratio in the far right column was 86.9 for the Allstate brand.
Moving over to the right, Esurance serves customers that preferred branded product but are comfortable handling around insurance fees. Policies in Force decline 0.6% from a year ago due to lower new business and retention. Net written premium group by 5.4% as the 6.4% increase in auto average premium more than offset policy declines. We recorded underlying combined ratio's of 109.8 and 106.0 reflect a different economic models in this segment were acquisition costs and expense really in the first policy year versus' spread out distribution over the life of the policy. The underlying of the loss ratio was 75.7 is still above our long-term target, so we continue to implement margin improvement actions. Encompass in the upper left competes for customers who want local advice are less concerned about the branded expense and are served by independent agencies. Encompass remains focused on improving returns, and consequently, policies enforced declined by 12.6% from the same quarter a year ago. The reported an underlying combined ratio of 98.3 and 89.3 in the third quarter were better than the third quarter of 2015. 
Answer Financial on the upper right serves brand-neutral self-service customers. It's an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risk. Total non-propriety written premium were $158 million in the quarter grew by 6% from the prior year. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. As you know, we established operating priorities for each year to focus our decision and to provide clarity to all our stakeholders. The first 3 priorities are intertwined and relate to ensuring that we have a profitable and sustainable business model. We balanced these efforts with a focus on both short-term results and long-term value creation. To better serve customers, we're building new capabilities for Allstate Agency so they can be a better trusted advisers. For example, we successfully introduced new personalized insurance proposal and knocked on over $2 million of those. At the same time, to earn an appropriate return on capital, we've increased auto insurance dangerous prices, which has a negative impact in customer; satisfaction and growth. To grow the entire enterprise, we're leveraging our brands, customer relationships and capabilities, including having Esurance sell homeowner insurance and expanding Allstate Benefits. 
Now as you know, we proactively invest our $81 billion investment portfolio to achieve the best risk-adjusted return over time periods that are either appropriate for the liability of that or consistent with our risk appetite on capital. Steve will talk more about the investment results in just a minute. Lastly, to create long-term growth, we're expanding our growth platform and working to further expand our portfolio of consumer protection [indiscernible]. 
Now let me turn it over to Don."

Third quarter catastrophe",1539,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start on Slide 5. Property liability earned premium of $7.9 billion in the third quarter of 2016 was 2.9% higher than the same period last year. During the first 3 quarters of 2016, earned premium grew by 3.5%. Third quarter catastrophe losses of $481 million were 78.1% higher than the prior year quarter. Catastrophe losses of $2.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2016 were $908 million higher than the first 3 quarters of last year. The recorded combined ratio for Property-Liability was 95.5 in the third quarter of 2016. When we exclude catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates, the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016 were both 88.0, which is better than 2015 and at the favorable end of our annual outlook range of 88 to 90. Property-Liability operating income of $452 million in the third quarter of 2016 was 17.8% below prior year results due to higher catastrophe losses and $99 million reserve increase for discontinued lines.
In the chart on the bottom left, the blue line represents net written premium growth, while the red line shows Policies in Force growth. Property-Liability's Policies in Force were 2.6% below the third quarter of 2015, while net written premiums increased by 2.1% over the same time period. These trends were heavily influenced by our auto property improvement actions across underwriting brands. The widening gap between these 2 trend lines reflects increased average premium per policy.
The bottom-right graph shows the recorded combined ratio in red in comparison to the underlying combined ratio in the blue bars. And it illustrates that most of the quarter-to-quarter volatility is due to catastrophe losses. 
Going to Slide 6. That chart on the top left shows the quarterly underlying loss ratios and combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9 in the third quarter of 2016 improved by 2.2 points compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by a lower underlying loss ratio. As seen on the chart of the top right, annualized average premium increased to $966 or 7% compared to the prior year, while underlying loss and expenses increased by 4.5%, increasing the favorable GAAP to $40.
Underlying loss and expenses are shown by the red line. Underlined losses are business sophisticated and segmented approach to establishing loss reserves. We used a wide range of operational and financial statistics and multiple techniques to estimate loss cost. For example, gross frequency reflects actual notice counts reported in a particular time period, and we use that data to record losses and reserves for each notice accounts received as opposed to estimating an accident year loss ratio based on aggregate claims data. Similarly, they frequency is used to estimate how many of those reported claims will ultimately be paid and helps us measure and better manage paid severity claims staffing. 
To provide you insight into the underlying results, we disclosed several frequency statistics and paid severity transfer the property damage and bodily injury coverage, which are shown on the bottom 2 graphs. Property damage claims represent about 20% of loss cost and reflect both the frequency of accidents and the average pace of severity claims. As you can see, frequency in the blue bar began to rise in the last quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015 and then accelerated until being essentially flat for the last 2 quarters. Severity, however, continues to increase, although the rate of increase has come down throughout 2016. 
Bodily injury claims comprised about 30% of loss cost and have more volatile underlying statistics because of the longer time period it takes to settle these claims and a greater dispersion in the amounts paid per claim. The decrease in pay per for goods and paid severity during the third quarter are related and reflect payment mix and claim closure patterns that were impacted by changes in bodily injury claims processes to require enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatments. And as a result, fewer claims were opened and paid in the third quarter of 2016, but those that were paid had higher average payments. 
Normalizing for the process enhancement made to bodily injury claims in the quarter, both injury paid claim frequency and severity consistently measured would have been generally consistent with those observed during the first half of 2016.
One of the components of the profit improvement plan is claims operational excellence. We are always looking for ways to improve claims processes and continue to settle claims fairly, deliver the best possible claims experience to our customers and settle claims as efficiently as possible. And while claims process changes have impacted some of our operational statistics, we take the impact of those changes into account when setting reserves. And as a result, claims process changes have not impacted our the reported underlying results.
Slide 7 provides detail on the auto property improvement plan. We have continued to diligently pursue approval for higher auto prices where appropriate. And you can see on the lower left chart that in the third quarter of 2016, we received approved rate increases estimated at $209 million across all 3 brands. This brings our total for the first months of 2016 to $1.2 billion higher than the full year of 2015. The chart on the lower right shows average premium increase 7.7% compared to the prior year quarter and acceleration of the trend we have seen since the middle of last year. And average net earned premium shown by the gray line lags average written premium and is up 6%.
Moving to Slide 8. The chart on the left shows Allstate brand auto Policies in Force have decreased, which reflects what the auto margin improvement plan and are 2.5% below the prior year quarter. The chart on the right highlights that while new business and customer retention have been impacted by our property improvement actions, our absolute levels in the new business production have stabilized over the last couple of quarters.

5% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Allstate Benefits grew 11.3% in the third quarter, with an increase of 444,000 policies over the prior 12 months. Allstate Financial's operating income and net income were $94 million and $80 million in the third quarter of 2016, respectively. 
Operating income was $44 million lower than in the third quarter of 2015 to [indiscernible] the lower investment income. Across the bottom, we shall net an operating income through reach business.

Private equity, real estate, timber and agricultural-related businesses from $4.1 billion a year in 2012 to $5.8 billion in 2016, as shown on the upper-left chart. These investments require a higher economic and regulatory capital, but we expect to deliver attractive long-term economic returns to our shareholders. Total return for the third quarter in the upper-right was a solid 1.3%, reflecting a contribution from investment income of 90 basis points, and an increase in the portfolio's value primarily from lower market yields. Gross investment income, as shown on the bottom left graph, you can see performance-based investment results shown in gray are the primary source of income variability between quarters. Performance-based investments generate income of $147 million for the quarter, somewhat lower than the strong results from last year. Investment yield by business segment is shown at the bottom right.
[Audio Gap]
Increased by 8.3% over the same period a year ago, primarily due to increased unrealized gains in the investment portfolio and income generation partially offset by capital return to shareholders. We have $2.7 billion of holding company assets at quarter's end, which when combined with our modest leverage ratio provides a higher degree of financial flexibility.
During the third quarter, we returned $389 million to common shareholders through a combination of dividend and share repurchases. At the end of the third quarter, we returned almost $1.5 billion to our shareholders.

The position you talked about then, and Mary Jane can talk about the results at Allstate Life and Allstate Benefit. So first, Allstate Benefit, I think it was in 2014 we saw this and kind of came around the track on that one already. And so that really beginning in last year's numbers. This year, what you're seeing, it's a different strategic choice which is the choice to do a different asset liability matching program in the annuity
[Audio Gap]
Business. So those -- we have about, as Steve mentioned, we have about $12 billion of payments that are due over the next 40 to 50 years in that immediate annuity business. Of course, we have to have investments that generate returns to make those payments. With current interest rates, it would not generate. If you took all that money and invested in today, first, we couldn't get the right duration; secondly, the rate on that would not be enough to generate enough earnings to pay all of those amounts off. So we would then have to put some capital in. What we've chosen to do is put the capital in now and invest in equities which will generate a higher return. When you get past the 10-year period, the return on equities is twice that of bonds, and that risk is about the same. So we think that's a good use of shareholder capital from a strategic standpoint. That's a different use of capital than the capital you're talking about freeing up investment. Mary Jane, you might want to make some comments about life and benefits."

We have been running favorable in our mortality, which is for the last 4 quarters, we have been experiencing favorable mortality which has been impacting those results in a positive way. In terms of the annuities, as Tom mentioned, we've been actively putting on the $2 billion to work. $1.3 billion has been put to work year-to-date. The returns on their performance-based investments were 10% in the quarter, which is in line with our long-term expectation. So that really reflects kind of the run rate for the annuity business.

First, Esurance is a better company now than when we bought it because of the skills and capabilities, whether that's branding, marketing, claims, pricing, preferred customers getting into the homeowners business. So we added value, and it's a good, strong company, and a much stronger competitor now than it was by 5 years ago. It has grown a lot. It's doubled in size. We accepted a lower return on capital from the auto insurance business at Esurance during that growth than we did from the Allstate Brad because we wanted to lean into their growth, as you pointed out. But it was always above our cost of capital. So with ours is like okay, we've met done and we talked about, we'll take a lower term but it's got to be above what our cost is because we should be creating shareholder value as we grow. That continues to be the case. We continue to write it above our cost of capital as we look at the vintage years of each of their products. That said, when we ran into the increase in frequency and severity that impacted all of the brands, we chose to slow growth some because we don't want to write it at below the cost of capital. We've now got our pricing position in a better place, so I do expect that we'll begin to grow that business again like our other business. But I don't feel like we're at the place right now where we should throw hundreds of million of dollars of marketing money at growth there, in part because while we dramatically improve the brand, we still need to get our consideration and awareness up, and that takes a number of years to invest in that. So we like what we got an in. It's been growing. I think it can be -- it's certainly has broadened our strategic platform and gave us a broader set of capabilities to compete in the market with. But it's not at to the point where I feel like we should run hundreds of millions of dollars of underwriting losses. That said, we don't really manage them to the P&L. We manage them to the economics. And because we're big enough, we can take the underlying losses from that business if we believe it's economic."

[Audio Gap]
Is the way we estimate loss ratio. So as Matt mentioned. We start with the actual number of claims that get reported. We then go through and say how many are paid, how many are not paid.

Also here with us this morning are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President of our Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Life and Retirement; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.
This quarter, we delivered balanced operating results. Underlying auto margins improved. Homeowners results remained strong, and we generated good total return on the investment portfolio.
Let's start on Slide 2. Net income for the quarter was $491 million and operating income was $474 million, which was $1.26 per share. Operating income was adversely affected by elevated catastrophe losses and a $99 million increase in reserves of discontinued lines. The property-liability recorded combined ratio was 95.5 for the quarter. And the underlying combined ratio was 88, both for the quarter and the first 9 months of the year, which is at the favorable end of the full year outlook that we gave you in February of 88 to 90. Investment income was 7.3% lower than last year's third quarter, reflecting last year we sold about $2 billion of long duration bonds in the payout annuity portfolio. And the results were lower interest income, and we had strong return on the performance-based portfolio in 2015's third quarter.
Total investment returns remained strong at 1.3% for the quarter and 5.2% for the year, driven by both net investment income and price depreciation in the bond portfolio.
Let's go to Slide 3. On a total company basis, about half of the decline in property-liability policies was offset by providing consumers a broad set of unique products using different brands and distribution channels, most notably because of Allstate Benefits. The results for each of the 4 segments of the property-liability market are shown on the slide on the diagram on this page here. So the Allstate brand, which is in the lower left, comprises 90% of premiums written that serves customers who prefer branded product and value local relationships. Policies in force at the Allstate brand declined in the third quarter of last year by 2.3% as we continue to raise auto insurance prices. And you can see the impact of those actions on both new business and retention. 
Allstate brand auto net written premiums grew by 4.1%, which reflects a 7.7% increase in average written premium. If you continue down that column, the Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 95.9 for the third quarter of 2016, which is 2.2 points better than the prior year quarter. 
Homeowners in the next column had a recorded combined ratio of 75.9. The underlying combined ratio in the far right column was 86.9 for the Allstate brand.
Moving over to the right. Esurance serves customers that prefer a branded product but are comfortable in handling their own insurance needs. Policies in force decline 0.6% from a year ago due to lower new business and retention. Net written premium grew by 5.4% as the 6.4% increase in auto average premium more than offset policy declines. The recorded underlying combined ratios of 109.8 and 106.0 reflect a different economic model in this segment, where acquisition costs are expense really in the first policy year versus spread out as commissions over the life of the policy. The underlying auto loss ratio of 75.7 is still above our long-term target, so we continue to implement margin improvement actions. 
Encompass in the upper left competes for customers that want local advice, are less concerned about a branded experience and are served by independent agencies. Encompass remains focused on improving returns. And consequently, policies in force declined by 12.6% from the same quarter a year ago. The recorded underlying combined ratios of 98.3 and 89.3 in the third quarter were better than the third quarter of 2015. 
Answer Financial in the upper right serves brand-neutral self-service customers. It's an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risks. Total non-propriety written premium of $158 million in the quarter grew by 6% from the prior year. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. As you know, we established operating priorities each year to focus our decision and to provide clarity to all of our stakeholders. The first 3 priorities are intertwined and relate to ensuring that we have a profitable and sustainable business model. We balance these efforts with a focus on both short-term results and long-term value creation. To better serve customers, we're building new capabilities for Allstate agencies so they can be better trusted advisers. For example, we successfully introduced a new personalized insurance proposal and now has done over $2 million of those. At the same time, to earn an appropriate return on capital, we've increased auto insurance prices, which has a negative impact in customer satisfaction and growth. To grow the entire enterprise, we're leveraging our brands, customer relationships and capabilities, including having Esurance sell homeowners insurance and expanding Allstate Benefits. 
Now as you know, we proactively invested our $81 billion investment portfolio to achieve the best risk-adjusted return over time periods that are either appropriate for the liabilities event or consistent with our risk appetite on capital. Steve will talk more about the investment results in just a minute. 
Lastly, to create long-term growth, we're expanding Arity, our connected car platform, and working to further expand our portfolio of consumer protection products. 
Now let me turn it over to Don."

Third quarter catastrophe",1100,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start on Slide 5. Property-Liability earned premium of $7.9 billion in the third quarter of 2016 was 2.9% higher than the same period last year. During the first 3 quarters of 2016, earned premium grew by 3.5%. Third quarter catastrophe losses of $481 million were 78.1% higher than the prior year quarter. Catastrophe losses of $2.3 billion through the first 9 months of 2016 were $908 million higher than the first 3 quarters of last year. The recorded combined ratio for Property-Liability was 95.5 in the third quarter 2016. When we exclude catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates, the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016 were both 88.0, which is better than 2015 and at the favorable end of our annual outlook range of 88 to 90. Property-Liability operating income of $452 million in the third quarter 2016 was 17.8% below prior year results due to higher catastrophe losses and a $99 million reserve increase for discontinued lines.
In the chart on the bottom left, the blue line represents net written premium growth, while the red line shows policy in force growth. Property-Liability's policies in force were 2.6% below the third quarter of 2015, while net written premium increased by 2.1% over the same time period. These trends were heavily influenced by our auto profit improvement actions across underwriting brands. The widening gap between these 2 trend lines reflects increased average premium per policy.
The bottom-right graph shows the recorded combined ratio in red in comparison to the underlying combined ratio in the blue bars. And it illustrates that most of the quarter-to-quarter volatility is due to catastrophe losses. 
Going to Slide 6. The chart on the top left shows the quarterly underlying loss ratios and combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9 in the third quarter of 2016 improved by 2.2 points compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by a lower underlying loss ratio. As seen on the chart on the top right, annualized average premium increased to $966 or 7% compared to the prior year, while underlying loss and expenses increased by 4.5%, increasing the favorable gap to $40.
Underlying loss and expenses are shown by the red line. Underlying losses are based on a sophisticated and segmented approach to establishing loss reserves. We use a wide range of operational and financial statistics and multiple techniques to estimate loss costs. For example, gross frequency reflects actual notice counts reported in a particular time period, and we use that data to record losses and reserves for each notice count received as opposed to estimating an accident year loss ratio based on aggregate claims data. Similarly, paid frequency is used to estimate how many of those reported claims will ultimately be paid and helps us measure and better manage paid severity claim staffing. 
To provide you insight into the underlying results, we disclosed several frequency statistics and paid severity transfer the property damage and bodily injury coverages, which are shown on the bottom 2 graphs. Property damage claims represent about 20% of loss costs and reflect both the frequency of accidents and the average paid severity for claims. As you can see, frequency in the blue bar began to rise in the last quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015 and then accelerated until being essentially flat for the last 2 quarters. Paid severity, however, continues to increase, although the rate of increase has come down throughout 2016. 
Bodily injury claims comprised about 30% of loss costs and have more volatile underlying statistics because of the longer time period it takes to settle these claims and a greater dispersion in the amounts paid per claim. The decrease in paid frequency and increase in paid severity during the third quarter are related and reflect payment mix and claim closure patterns that were impacted by changes in bodily injury claims processes to require enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatments. And as a result, fewer claims were opened and paid in the third quarter of 2016, but those that were paid had higher average payments. Normalizing for the process enhancement made to bodily injury claims in the quarter, both injury paid claim frequency and severity consistently measured would have been generally consistent with those observed during the first half of 2016.
One of the components of our profit improvement plan is claims operational excellence. We are always looking for ways to improve claims processes and continue to settle claims fairly, deliver the best possible claims experience to our customers and settle claims as efficiently as possible. And while claims process changes have impacted some of our operational statistics, we take the impact of those changes into account when setting reserves. And as a result, claims process changes have not impacted our recorded underwriting results.
Slide 7 provides detail on the auto profit improvement plan. We have continued to diligently pursue approval for higher auto prices where appropriate. And you can see on the lower left chart that in the third quarter 2016, we received approved rate increases estimated at $209 million across all 3 brands. This brings our total for the first 9 months of 2016 to $1.2 billion, higher than the full year of 2015. 
The chart on the lower right shows average premium increased 7.7% compared to the prior year quarter, an acceleration of the trend we have seen since the middle of last year. And average net earned premium shown by the gray line lags average written premium and is up 6%.
Moving to Slide 8. The chart on the left shows Allstate brand auto policies in force have decreased, which reflects the auto margin improvement plan and are 2.5% below the prior year quarter. The chart on the right highlights that while new business and customer retention have been impacted by our profit improvement actions, our absolute levels in new business production have stabilized over the last couple quarters.
Slide 9 highlights the continued strength of Allstate brand homeowners. The chart on the left shows the recorded combined ratio remained a very strong 75.9 in the quarter despite significant catastrophe losses. On a trailing 12-month basis, the recoded combined ratio is 84.3. 
The chart on the right shows annualized average earned premium per policy increase by 2.1% over the prior year quarter, and average underlying loss and expense per policy increased by 2.4%. The gap between these 2 measures improved by $7 compared to the third quarter last year. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Steve."

Slide 10 provides an overview of our profitability and growth trends for Esurance and Encompass. The Esurance recorded combined ratio as shown on the top-left chart was 109.8 in the third quarter and 106.0 when catastrophes, prior year reserve reestimates and the amortization of intangibles are excluded. Do remember, with the direct distribution model, combined ratios are impacted by acquisition expenses being written off much faster than the agency channel, where commissions are spread over the policy life. This result is also adversely impacted by expenses related to expanding into homeowners insurance and new markets. The underlying loss ratio of 74.7 is higher than our long-term target, and we will continue to take actions to raise Esurance returns. 
On the top right, Esurance written premium was up 5.4%, while policies in force declined by 0.6 points compared to a year ago, reflecting the auto improvement initiatives. 
The chart on the bottom left shows Encompass' improvement in both recorded and underlying combined ratios. The recorded combined ratio of 98.3 was 3 points better than the third quarter a year ago, and the underlying combined ratio of 89.3 improved by 1.6 points. 
The chart on the bottom right shows the top line trend, which, as you can see, was impacted by profit improvement actions. Policies in force shown on the bottom right by the gray line declined by 12.6%, while net written premium represented by the blue line declined by 9.7%. Encompass will continue to take pricing, underwriting and expense actions in order to achieve target margins.
Turning to slide 11. Allstate Financial premiums and contract charges totaled $571 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 6.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Allstate Benefits grew 11.3% in the third quarter with an increase of 444,000 policies over the prior 12 months. Allstate Financial's operating income and net income were $94 million and $80 million in the third quarter of 2016, respectively. 
Operating income was $44 million lower than in the third quarter of 2015, due primarily to lower investment income. Across the bottom, we shall net an operating income for reach business. The Allstate Life business operating income of $51 million in the third quarter decreased $7 million compared to last year due to higher expenses and lower investment margins. 
Allstate Benefits operating income of $25 million for the third quarter was relatively consistent with the third quarter of last year. 
The annuity business generated operating income of $18 million, down $36 million from third quarter 2015, primarily due to reduced investment income resulting from the 2015 portfolio repositioning and lower limited partnership income compared to a very strong prior year quarter. 
At the top right of the slide, we provide the liability balance invested mix for our immediate annuity business before and after the portfolio repositioning. The proceeds from the sale of long-duration bonds are being invested over time in performance-based and public equity investments, as you can see by the increased allocations of these assets in the chart. 
While we will maintain a significant allocation to interest-bearing investments, we will continue to increase our performance-based investments, which are well suited to the long-dated immediate annuity liabilities. 
Slide 12 shows our investment results. We increased our emphasis on performance-based investment after the financial crisis to replace market risk with idiosyncratic risk by emphasizing ownership over lending. This increased allocation to investments, such as private equity, real estate, timber and agricultural-related businesses from $4.1 billion a year in 2012 to $5.8 billion in 2016, as shown on the upper-left chart. These investments require a higher economic and regulatory capital, but we expect to deliver attractive long-term economic returns for our shareholders. 
Total return for the third quarter in the upper-right was a solid 1.3%, reflecting a contribution from investment income of 90 basis points and an increase in the portfolio's value primarily from lower market yields. 
Gross investment income, as shown on the bottom-left graph, you can see performance-based investment results shown in gray are the primary source of income variability between quarters. Performance-based investments generate income of $147 million for the quarter, somewhat lower than the strong results from last year. 
Investment yield by business segment is shown at the bottom right. The Property-Liability yield is closer to current market yields as a result of its shorter duration. Allstate Financial's yield has obviously impacted last year's immediate annuity portfolio repositioning, but the yield remains higher due to its longer duration and because investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability reductions. 
Slide 13 illustrates the continued strength of our capital position and highlights our financial flexibility. Shareholders' equity increased to $20.9 billion in the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 19.6%, a reduction of 0.4 points from the prior year quarter. Book value per common share of $51.48 increased by 8.3% over the same period a year ago, primarily due to increased unrealized gains in the investment portfolio and income generation partially offset by capital return to shareholders. We held $2.7 billion of holding company assets at quarter's end, which, when combined with our modest leverage ratio, provides a high degree of financial flexibility.
During the third quarter, we returned $389 million to common shareholders through a combination of dividend and share repurchases. At the end of the third quarter, we returned almost $1.5 billion to our common shareholders.

So we'll see it normalize, but it may not go back to exactly where it was previously because there were some of those changes. As John referred to in his remarks, there's some enhanced documentation requirements. So the mix changes. I think in response to a question you asked last quarter, I talked about the timing impact and the peristalsis that sometimes occurs in the claims area where you have a buildup of claims that are then processed. And especially in BI with the long tail on it, you can see that happen. So you can expect to see some fluctuation.

And we're kind of -- we kind of came around the track on that one already, and so you saw that really beginning in last year's numbers. This year, what you're seeing is a different strategic choice, which is the choice to do a different asset liability matching program in the annuity business. So those -- we have about -- as Steve mentioned, we have about $12 billion of payments that are due over the next 40 to 50 years in that immediate annuity business. Of course, we have to have investments that generate returns to make those payments. With current interest rates, it would not generate. If we took all that money and invested it, today, first, we couldn't get the right duration. Secondly, the rate on that would not be enough to generate enough earnings to pay all those amounts off, so we would then have to put some capital in. What we've chosen to do is put the capital in now and invest in equities, which will generate a higher return. When you get past the 10-year period, the return on equities is twice that of bonds, and the risk is about the same. So we think that's a good use of shareholder capital from a strategic standpoint. That's a different use of capital than the capital you're talking about freeing up the Lincoln Benefit. Mary Jane, you might want to make some comments about Life and Benefits."

And in this quarter, we did have our annual review of DAC [indiscernible]. So this quarter does have the $2 million impact in the Life business for that. And also, we did have some onetime expenses that did impact the quarter, so that is impacting the results this quarter. We have been running favorable in our mortality, which is for the last 4 quarters, we have been experiencing favorable mortality, which has been impacting those results in a positive way. In terms of the annuities, as Tom mentioned, we've been actively putting the $2 billion to work. $1.3 billion has been put to work year-to-date. The returns on the performance-based investments were 10% in the quarter, which is in line with our long-term expectation. So that really reflects kind of the run rate for the annuity business. So we'll continue to actively invest in that asset class, which will generate earnings additionally over time."

I guess I would think that like at a time like this, when you're still smaller than the 2 big direct peers, that this would be like the exact time that you would want to really grow that business maybe at a time when others are not growing -- or at least everyone is not growing as rapidly. Can you just comment a little bit about on that and sort of how you're thinking about it?

So",401,"Okay, yes. Thank you, Mike. First, Esurance is a better company now than when we bought it because of the skills and capabilities it brought, whether that's branding, marketing, claims, pricing preferred, customers getting into the homeowners business. So we added value, and it's a good, strong company and a much stronger competitor now than it was 5 years ago. It has grown a lot. It's doubled in size. We accepted a lower return on capital from the auto insurance business at Esurance during that growth than we did from the Allstate brand because we wanted to lean into the growth, as you pointed out, but it was always above our cost of capital. So with ours, like, okay -- as Matt and Don, I know, has talked about, we're like, okay, we'll take a lower term, but it's got to be above what our cost is because we should be creating shareholder value as we grow. That continues to be the case. We continue to write it above our cost of capital as we look at the vintage years of each of the products. That said, when we ran into the increase in frequency and severity that impacted all of the brands, we chose to slow growth some because we don't want to write it at below the cost of capital. We've now got our pricing position in a better place, so I do expect that we'll begin to grow that business again like we'll grow our other business. But we don't -- I don't feel like we're at the place right now where we should throw hundreds of million of dollars of marketing money at growth there, in part because while we've dramatically improved the brand, we still need to get our consideration and awareness up. And that takes a number of years to invest in that. So we like what we got. It's been growing. I think it can be -- it certainly has broadened our strategic platform and gave us a broader set of capabilities to compete in the market with. But it's not to the point where I feel like we should run hundreds of millions of dollars of underwriting losses. That said, we don't really manage them to the P&L. We manage them to the economics. And because we're big enough, we can take the underlying losses from that business if we believe it's economic."

Let me try to take that. So as we shift out of rate-taking mode and enhance focus on profitability and get back to a more balanced approach, it's not just a question of just ramping up expenses for advertising because that's just one component of what's necessary to get the system growing. So it's multiple components. It's quote volume. It's rate competitiveness, which impacts close rates. It's capacity in agencies. And it's number of points of presence. And what happens when you're unfortunately taking a fair amount of rate, and we have over the last several quarters, is it impacts all of those things. It's not just that you're not advertising. A lot of this, you're eating up agent capacity, you're impacting your close rate. It's hard to put on new agencies in that environment, and so your number of points of presence tends to stabilize. So as we get more stable and as we believe we can see frequency and severity stabilize and that puts us in a better position to begin the growth initiatives, you'll see a whole bunch of things change, and one of them might be some additional marketing expense. But it's only a small component. And I would that marketing in and of itself, if you don't have the agent capacity and if your competitiveness isn't there, it's not a very efficient spend. So we'll consider that among the other levers that are available in the business to work towards long-term profitable growth."

And I think there's -- I want to make sure we're clear on our philosophy on expenses. So I think some people, as we've gone through this increase in frequency and severity that Matt talked about, look at the reduction in expenses, so we'll just cut expenses so we could make our number. That's not the case. Our philosophy on expenses is not left to a target P&L number. It's -- first, don't spend it if your customers don't want it. Do spend it if your customers do want it. Secondly, Matt talked about this integrated basis. And that's if you advertise and your agency is not ready or your competitive position is not right, then it doesn't really make any sense. So we really do run it on an integrated basis. And then we also invest for the long term. So I don't want you -- in 2011, remember, I think I announced it, we made maybe like $750 million or something like that in net income, and we didn't back off a wit on our advertising spend because we knew we needed to do that to stay competitive for the long term. So we will always have things, whether it's advertising, technology, investing. So we try to manage it really on the long-term economics that Matt was talking about. So it's our philosophy. But -- and sometimes, when I read some of the reports that have come out, it feels like people are thinking we've got this. We're managing just to get that P&L number, and that's not the way we run our business. To the extent we can cut our cost, Matt's got a big program going on in continuous improvement. We're reducing our cost as aggressively as we can. To the extent we need to use that money to invest in something else, we will because -- as long as we thing it makes sense for us."

So we think the personal transportation industry is going to change dramatically, and we think that's an opportunity for us to do more for our customers. The [indiscernible] will change dramatically as it's incredibly inefficient, so we have about $4 trillion tied up in hardware called cars and trucks and stuff like that. We spend about $2 trillion a year in direct costs, making that work. Capacity utilization is in the -- even in peak hours, is in the 30%, 34% range, and there's one person in a car. A 20% improvement in the efficiency of that system will be a 5% increase in household income in America. We think that's going to happen. It's going to take a while to happen because it's an economically dispersed system. Nobody controls all of this. There's lots of different pieces to it. So it's not just the autonomous car. It's shared vehicles. It's machine to machine communication. It's better stoplights. It's -- there's a whole bunch of stuff that's going to change in that system. Arity is one of our efforts to take advantage of that. So Arity is outside the insurance company. It provides services to Allstate and Esurance. The services that the insurance company gets from it is, first, it gives them the ability to do a more accurate price for our customers because we know exactly how they drive, where they drive and when they drive. And -- but we have a different model than others. We've taken it beyond pricing to include things like improving the driving experience, so adding applications onto our continuous connection to help those customers have a better driving experience, and then also to use that technology for other things. So there's many other uses -- many other ways that value could be created by cars being connected. We can share that value with customer. We can use that value to reduce cost for other people and capture those [indiscernible]. There's really a 3 focus -- 3-part focus: better pricing, better services and additional ways to use a connected car. So Arity is pursuing all 3 of those. It will do that for our insurance companies. We'll do it for noninsurance companies, and we will also do it for other insurance companies as well.

So we'll distinguish between process changes that impacted PD and those that impacted BI. If you recall in the last quarter and potentially the quarter before that, I referred to our desire in this environment to capture more and more information regarding the claim and PD so that we're better able to manage staffing costs and appropriately serve our customers and ensure that the claims machine is ready to deal with and help out customers at this time. So we began capturing a greater amount of information at first notice of loss, especially on the PD side. And so we told you at that point, and it continues to hold true, that there's a differential between the gross and the paid and that we will overcapture information on PD and have some of those claims closed without payment. And that's okay as far as we're concerned. We're more interested in effectively managing the system and taking care of customers than anything else. And so if we have to have some dislocation in the numbers and some volatility in the numbers to do that properly, we'll do that. On the BI side, as John said in the opening comments, this really had to do with just requiring some enhanced documentation for injuries and related medical treatment in our numbers. And so that does influence the mix. It does influence the -- because it impacts the mix and the timing, it impacts both the frequency and severity. But it -- none of these things impact our overall actual loss trends or our reserving or the P&L because, as John mentioned in his opening comments, all of these changes and all of this information is factored in along with our pay trends and all of the other information that we review on a very careful basis in setting our reserve levels and determining our actual loss cost. So yes, we have some volatility in some of the operational claim statistics that we show you. But no, it doesn't imply any real change in the actual P&L-type statistics that we manage the business on, take rate based upon and report on."

And to your extent, you would see it in this stuff on the BI basis. That takes several years to really get your arms around it, so that tends to be -- it takes much longer to settle those cases.

So let me follow up on that. It's a really good question. And I think it's important to remember, I've been talking during this entire profit improvement program over the last 18 months about the fact that we -- as we've taken rate, tended to take segmented rate. And that is we did not just spread rate along the entire book in any geography, but did it by sub-segment looking at those categories of customers where we were having margin pressures. So we didn't take the rate in equal doses across an entire book but, in fact, broke it down so that we were applying the rate need to those segments of the business that were most problematic. In some cases, that tended to be newer customers, shopping customers, segments that as we had expanded our books over the last couple years tend to be more volatile and they shop more often. And so if we had pressure in that segment and we took rate there, it's not surprising that we had some renewal pressure. But we try very hard, as Tom said, not to lose any customers and not to have any impact. But it is an unintended consequence -- an expected consequence but an unintended consequence of our need to get margin-appropriate. Any time you take rate, you stimulate shopping behavior. And we know that when you stimulate shopping behavior, you are going to lose some segment of those customers. And the same thing will happen to our competitors as they now take rate and begin to disrupt their books as well. We will be the recipient of some of that. And we hope that as we emerge out of -- you will recall, we took a lot of rate in the last quarter, in the second quarter and -- in some of the larger states, so that is why our number looked particularly large in second quarter. But as that comes down a little bit, we hope to be less disruptive to our customer base. And on a system-wide basis, we hope to get back to a more normalized basis, where we're not disrupting customers. It's not good for customers. Obviously, we think they're all better off staying with Allstate. And it's also not good for our agencies who are dealing with that disruption."

I do think that it is an opportunity for us to further do more sophisticated pricing, for other people to do more sophisticated pricing, which, if you look back over a long period of time when we first moved into credit, first moved into more algorithmic pricing for auto insurance, has led to more stability in overall returns for the industry. So I will just point out the fact that many people today are moving their pricing with respect to frequency and severity because they have the analytics to know it.

Also here with us this morning are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President of our Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Life and Retirement; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.
This quarter, we delivered balanced operating results. Underlying auto margins improved. Homeowners results remained strong, and we generated good total return on the investment portfolio.
Let's start on Slide 2. Net income for the quarter was $491 million and operating income was $474 million, which was $1.26 per share. Operating income was adversely affected by elevated catastrophe losses and a $99 million increase in reserves of discontinued lines. The property-liability recorded combined ratio was 95.5 for the quarter. And the underlying combined ratio was 88, both for the quarter and the first 9 months of the year, which is at the favorable end of the full year outlook that we gave you in February of 88 to 90. Investment income was 7.3% lower than last year's third quarter, reflecting last year we sold about $2 billion of long duration bonds in the payout annuity portfolio. And the results were lower interest income, and we had strong return on the performance-based portfolio in 2015's third quarter.
Total investment returns remained strong at 1.3% for the quarter and 5.2% for the year, driven by both net investment income and price appreciation in the bond portfolio.
Let's go to Slide 3. On a total company basis, about half of the decline in property-liability policies was offset by providing consumers a broad set of unique products using different brands and distribution channels, most notably because of Allstate Benefits. The results for each of the 4 segments of the property-liability market are shown on the bottom diagram on this page here. So the Allstate brand, which is in the lower left, comprises 90% of premiums written that serves customers who prefer branded product and value local relationships. Policies in force at the Allstate brand declined in the third quarter of last year by 2.3% as we continue to raise auto insurance prices. And you can see the impact of those actions on both new business and retention. 
Allstate brand auto net written premiums grew by 4.1%, which reflects a 7.7% increase in average written premium. If you continue down that column, the Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 95.9 for the third quarter of 2016, which is 2.2 points better than the prior year quarter. 
Homeowners in the next column had a recorded combined ratio of 75.9. The underlying combined ratio in the far right column was 86.9 for the Allstate brand.
Moving over to the right. Esurance serves customers that prefer a branded product but are comfortable in handling their own insurance needs. Policies in force decline 0.6% from a year ago due to lower new business and retention. Net written premium grew by 5.4% as the 6.4% increase in auto average premium more than offset policy declines. The recorded underlying combined ratios of 109.8 and 106.0 reflect a different economic model in this segment, where acquisition costs are expensed really in the first policy year versus spread out as commissions over the life of the policy. The underlying auto loss ratio of 75.7 is still above our long-term target, so we continue to implement margin improvement actions. 
Encompass in the upper left competes for customers that want local advice, are less concerned about a branded experience and are served by independent agencies. Encompass remains focused on improving returns. And consequently, policies in force declined by 12.6% from the same quarter a year ago. The recorded underlying combined ratios of 98.3 and 89.3 in the third quarter were better than the third quarter of 2015. 
Answer Financial in the upper right serves brand-neutral self-service customers. It's an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risks. Total non-propriety written premium of $158 million in the quarter grew by 6% from the prior year. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. As you know, we established operating priorities each year to focus our decision and to provide clarity to all of our stakeholders. The first 3 priorities are intertwined and relate to ensuring that we have a profitable and sustainable business model. We balance these efforts with a focus on both short-term results and long-term value creation. To better serve customers, we're building new capabilities for Allstate agencies so they can be better trusted advisers. For example, we successfully introduced a new personalized insurance proposal and now have done over 2 million of those. At the same time, to earn an appropriate return on capital, we've increased auto insurance prices, which has a negative impact in customer satisfaction and growth. To grow the entire enterprise, we're leveraging our brands, customer relationships and capabilities, including having Esurance sell homeowners insurance and expanding Allstate Benefits. 
Now as you know, we proactively invested our $81 billion investment portfolio to achieve the best risk-adjusted return over time periods that are either appropriate for the liabilities event or consistent with our risk appetite on capital. Steve will talk more about the investment results in just a minute. 
Lastly, to create long-term growth, we're expanding Arity, our connected car platform, and working to further expand our portfolio of consumer protection products. 
Now let me turn it over to Don."

Third quarter catastrophe",1101,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start on Slide 5. Property-Liability earned premium of $7.9 billion in the third quarter of 2016 was 2.9% higher than the same period last year. During the first 3 quarters of 2016, earned premium grew by 3.5%. Third quarter catastrophe losses of $481 million were 78.1% higher than the prior year quarter. Catastrophe losses of $2.3 billion through the first 9 months of 2016 were $908 million higher than the first 3 quarters of last year. The recorded combined ratio for Property-Liability was 95.5 in the third quarter of 2016. When we exclude catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates, the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016 were both 88.0, which is better than 2015 and at the favorable end of our annual outlook range of 88 to 90. Property-Liability operating income of $452 million in the third quarter 2016 was 17.8% below prior year results due to higher catastrophe losses and a $99 million reserve increase for discontinued lines.
In the chart on the bottom left, the blue line represents net written premium growth, while the red line shows policy in force growth. Property-Liability's policies in force were 2.6% below the third quarter of 2015, while net written premium increased by 2.1% over the same time period. These trends were heavily influenced by our auto profit improvement actions across underwriting brands. The widening gap between these 2 trend lines reflects increased average premium per policy.
The bottom-right graph shows the recorded combined ratio in red in comparison to the underlying combined ratio in the blue bars. And it illustrates that most of the quarter-to-quarter volatility is due to catastrophe losses. 
Going to Slide 6. The chart on the top left shows the quarterly underlying loss ratios and combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9 in the third quarter of 2016 improved by 2.2 points compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by a lower underlying loss ratio. As seen on the chart on the top right, annualized average premium increased to $966 or 7% compared to the prior year, while underlying loss and expenses increased by 4.5%, increasing the favorable gap to $40.
Underlying loss and expenses are shown by the red line. Underlying losses are based on a sophisticated and segmented approach to establishing loss reserves. We use a wide range of operational and financial statistics and multiple techniques to estimate loss costs. For example, gross frequency reflects actual notice counts reported in a particular time period, and we use that data to record losses and reserves for each notice count received as opposed to estimating an accident year loss ratio based on aggregate claims data. Similarly, paid frequency is used to estimate how many of those reported claims will ultimately be paid and helps us measure and better manage paid severity claim staffing. 
To provide you insight into the underlying results, we disclosed several frequency statistics and paid severity transfer the property damage and bodily injury coverages, which are shown on the bottom 2 graphs. Property damage claims represent about 20% of loss costs and reflect both the frequency of accidents and the average paid severity for claims. As you can see, frequency in the blue bar began to rise in the last quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015 and then accelerated until being essentially flat for the last 2 quarters. Paid severity, however, continues to increase, although the rate of increase has come down throughout 2016. 
Bodily injury claims comprised about 30% of loss costs and have more volatile underlying statistics because of the longer time period it takes to settle these claims and a greater dispersion in the amounts paid per claim. The decrease in paid frequency and increase in paid severity during the third quarter are related and reflect payment mix and claim closure patterns that were impacted by changes in bodily injury claims processes to require enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatments. And as a result, fewer claims were opened and paid in the third quarter of 2016, but those that were paid had higher average payments. Normalizing for the process enhancement made to bodily injury claims in the quarter, both injury paid claim frequency and severity consistently measured would have been generally consistent with those observed during the first half of 2016.
One of the components of our profit improvement plan is claims operational excellence. We are always looking for ways to improve claims processes and continue to settle claims fairly, deliver the best possible claims experience to our customers and settle claims as efficiently as possible. And while claims process changes have impacted some of our operational statistics, we take the impact of those changes into account when setting reserves. And as a result, claims process changes have not impacted our recorded underwriting results.
Slide 7 provides detail on the auto profit improvement plan. We have continued to diligently pursue approval for higher auto prices where appropriate. And you can see on the lower left chart that in the third quarter 2016, we received approved rate increases estimated at $209 million across all 3 brands. This brings our total for the first 9 months of 2016 to $1.2 billion, higher than the full year of 2015. 
The chart on the lower right shows average premium increased 7.7% compared to the prior year quarter, an acceleration of the trend we have seen since the middle of last year. And average net earned premium shown by the gray line lags average written premium and is up 6%.
Moving to Slide 8. The chart on the left shows Allstate brand auto policies in force have decreased, which reflects the auto margin improvement plan and are 2.5% below the prior year quarter. The chart on the right highlights that while new business and customer retention have been impacted by our profit improvement actions, our absolute levels in new business production have stabilized over the last couple quarters.
Slide 9 highlights the continued strength of Allstate brand homeowners. The chart on the left shows the recorded combined ratio remained a very strong 75.9 in the quarter despite significant catastrophe losses. On a trailing 12-month basis, the recorded combined ratio is 84.3. 
The chart on the right shows annualized average earned premium per policy increase by 2.1% over the prior year quarter, and average underlying loss and expense per policy increased by 2.4%. The gap between these 2 measures improved by $7 compared to the third quarter last year. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Steve."

Slide 10 provides an overview of our profitability and growth trends for Esurance and Encompass. The Esurance recorded combined ratio as shown on the top-left chart was 109.8 in the third quarter and 106.0 when catastrophes, prior year reserve reestimates and the amortization of intangibles are excluded. Do remember, with the direct distribution model, combined ratios are impacted by acquisition expenses being written off much faster than the agency channel, where commissions are spread over the policy life. This result is also adversely impacted by expenses related to expanding into homeowners insurance and new markets. The underlying loss ratio of 74.7 is higher than our long-term target, and we will continue to take actions to raise Esurance returns. 
On the top right, Esurance written premium was up 5.4%, while policies in force declined by 0.6 points compared to a year ago, reflecting the auto improvement initiatives. 
The chart on the bottom left shows Encompass' improvement in both recorded and underlying combined ratios. The recorded combined ratio of 98.3 was 3 points better than the third quarter a year ago, and the underlying combined ratio of 89.3 improved by 1.6 points. 
The chart on the bottom right shows the top line trend, which, as you can see, was impacted by profit improvement actions. Policies in force shown on the bottom right by the gray line declined by 12.6%, while net written premium represented by the blue line declined by 9.7%. Encompass will continue to take pricing, underwriting and expense actions in order to achieve target margins.
Turning to slide 11. Allstate Financial premiums and contract charges totaled $571 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 6.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Allstate Benefits grew 11.3% in the third quarter with an increase of 444,000 policies over the prior 12 months. Allstate Financial's operating income and net income were $94 million and $80 million in the third quarter of 2016, respectively. 
Operating income was $44 million lower than in the third quarter of 2015, due primarily to lower investment income. Across the bottom, we show net an operating income for reach business. The Allstate Life business operating income of $51 million in the third quarter decreased $7 million compared to last year due to higher expenses and lower investment margins. 
Allstate Benefits operating income of $25 million for the third quarter was relatively consistent with the third quarter of last year. 
The annuity business generated operating income of $18 million, down $36 million from third quarter 2015, primarily due to reduced investment income resulting from the 2015 portfolio repositioning and lower limited partnership income compared to a very strong prior year quarter. 
At the top right of the slide, we provide the liability balance invested mix for our immediate annuity business before and after the portfolio repositioning. The proceeds from the sale of long-duration bonds are being invested over time in performance-based and public equity investments, as you can see by the increased allocations of these assets in the chart. 
While we will maintain a significant allocation to interest-bearing investments, we will continue to increase our performance-based investments, which are well suited to the long-dated immediate annuity liabilities. 
Slide 12 shows our investment results. We increased our emphasis on performance-based investment after the financial crisis to replace market risk with idiosyncratic risk by emphasizing ownership over lending. This increased allocation to investments, such as private equity, real estate, timber and agricultural-related businesses from $4.1 billion a year in 2012 to $5.8 billion in 2016, as shown on the upper-left chart. These investments require a higher economic and regulatory capital, but we expect they will deliver attractive long-term economic returns for our shareholders. 
Total return for the third quarter in the upper-right was a solid 1.3%, reflecting a contribution from investment income of 90 basis points and an increase in the portfolio's value primarily from lower market yields. 
Gross investment income is shown on the bottom-left graph. You can see performance-based investment results shown in gray are the primary source of income variability between quarters. Performance-based investments generate income of $147 million for the quarter, somewhat lower than the strong results from last year. 
Investment yield by business segment is shown at the bottom right. The Property-Liability yield is closer to current market yields as a result of its shorter duration. Allstate Financial's yield has obviously impacted last year's immediate annuity portfolio repositioning, but the yield remains higher due to its longer duration and because investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability reductions. 
Slide 13 illustrates the continued strength of our capital position and highlights our financial flexibility. Shareholders' equity increased to $20.9 billion in the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 19.6%, a reduction of 0.4 points from the prior year quarter. Book value per common share of $51.48 increased by 8.3% over the same period a year ago, primarily due to increased unrealized gains in the investment portfolio and income generation partially offset by capital return to shareholders. We held $2.7 billion of holding company assets at quarter's end, which, when combined with our modest leverage ratio, provides a high degree of financial flexibility.
During the third quarter, we returned $389 million to common shareholders through a combination of dividend and share repurchases. By the end of the third quarter, we returned almost $1.5 billion to our common shareholders.

As John referred to in his remarks, there's some enhanced documentation requirements. So the mix changes. I think in response to a question you asked last quarter, I talked about the timing impact and the peristalsis that sometimes occurs in the claims area where you have a buildup of claims that are then processed. And especially in BI with the long tail on it, you can see that happen. So you can expect to see some fluctuation.

So first, Lincoln Benefit. I think it was 2014 when we saw this. And we're kind of -- we kind of came around the track on that one already, and so you saw that really beginning in last year's numbers. This year, what you're seeing is a different strategic choice, which is the choice to do a different asset liability matching program in the annuity business. So those -- we have about -- as Steve mentioned, we have about $12 billion of payments that are due over the next 40 to 50 years in that immediate annuity business. Of course, we have to have investments that generate returns to make those payments. With current interest rates, it would not generate. If we took all that money and invested it, today, first, we couldn't get the right duration. Secondly, the rate on that would not be enough to generate enough earnings to pay all those amounts off, so we would then have to put some capital in. What we've chosen to do is put the capital in now and invest in equities, which will generate a higher return. When you get past the 10-year period, the return on equities is twice that of bonds, and the risk is about the same. So we think that's a good use of shareholder capital from a strategic standpoint. That's a different use of capital than the capital you're talking about freeing up from Lincoln Benefit. Mary Jane, you might want to make some comments about Life and Benefits."

The returns on the performance-based investments were 10% in the quarter, which is in line with our long-term expectation. So that really reflects kind of the run rate for the annuity business.

Thank you, Mike. First, Esurance is a better company now than when we bought it because of the skills and capabilities we brought to it, whether that's branding, marketing, claims, pricing preferred, customers getting into the homeowners business. So we added value, and it's a good, strong company and a much stronger competitor now than it was 5 years ago. It has grown a lot. It's doubled in size. We accepted a lower return on capital from the auto insurance business at Esurance during that growth than we did from the Allstate brand because we wanted to lean into the growth, as you point out, but it was always above our cost of capital. So with ours, like, okay -- as Matt and Don and I and others, has talked about, we're like, okay, we'll take a lower term, but it's got to be above what our cost is because we should be creating shareholder value as we grow. That continues to be the case. We continue to write it above our cost of capital as we look at the vintage years of each of the products. That said, when we ran into the increase in frequency and severity that impacted all of the brands, we chose to slow growth some because we don't want to write it at below the cost of capital. We've now got our pricing position in a better place, so I do expect that we'll begin to grow that business again like we'll grow our other business. But we don't -- I don't feel like we're at the place right now where we should throw hundreds of million of dollars of marketing money at growth there, in part because while we've dramatically improved the brand, we still need to get our consideration and awareness up. And that takes a number of years to invest in that. So we like what we got. It's been growing. I think it can be -- it certainly has broadened our strategic platform and gave us a broader set of capabilities to compete in the market with. But it's not to the point where I feel like we should run hundreds of millions of dollars of underwriting losses. That said, we don't really manage them to the P&L. We manage them to the economics.

Let me try to take that. So as we shift out of rate-taking mode and enhanced focus on profitability and get back to a more balanced approach, it's not just a question of just ramping up expenses for advertising because that's just one component of what's necessary to get the system growing. So it's multiple components. It's quote volume. It's rate competitiveness, which impacts close rates. It's capacity in agencies. And it's number of points of presence. And what happens when you're unfortunately taking a fair amount of rate, and we have over the last several quarters, is it impacts all of those things. It's not just that you're not advertising. A lot is you're eating up agent capacity, you're impacting your close rate. It's hard to put on new agencies in that environment, and so your number of points of presence tends to stabilize. So as we get more stable and as we believe we can see frequency and severity stabilize and that puts us in a better position to begin the growth initiatives, you'll see a whole bunch of things change, and one of them might be some additional marketing expense. But it's only a small component. And I would that marketing in and of itself, if you don't have the agent capacity and if your competitiveness isn't there, it's not a very efficient spend. So we'll consider that among the other levers that are available in the business to work towards long-term profitable growth."

And I think there's -- I want to make sure we're clear on our philosophy on expenses. So I think some people, as we've gone through this increase in frequency and severity that Matt talked about, look at the reduction in expenses, so we'll just cut expenses so we could make our number. That's not the case. Our philosophy on expenses is not let's do a target P&L number. It's -- first, don't spend it if your customers don't want it. Do spend it if your customers do want it. Secondly, Matt talked about this integrated basis. And that's if you advertise and your agency is not ready or your competitive position is not right, then it doesn't really make any sense. So we really do run it on an integrated basis. And then we also invest for the long term. So I don't want you -- in 2011, remember, I think I announced it, we made maybe like $750 million or something like that in net income, and we didn't back off a wit on our advertising spend because we knew we needed to do that to stay competitive for the long term. So we will always have things, whether it's advertising, technology, investing. So we try to manage it really on the long-term economics that Matt was talking about. So it's our philosophy. But -- and sometimes, when I read some of the reports that have come out, it feels like people are thinking we've got this. We're managing just to get that P&L number, and that's not the way we run our business. To the extent we can cut our costs, Matt's got a big program going on in continuous improvement. We're reducing our costs as aggressively as we can. To the extent we need to use that money to invest in something else, we will because -- as long as we think it makes sense for us."

I'll go up for a second, and then I'll come down very quickly to Arity. So we think the personal transportation industry is going to change dramatically, and we think that's an opportunity for us to do more for our customers. The reason it will change dramatically as it's incredibly inefficient, so we have about $4 trillion tied up in hardware called cars and trucks and stuff like that. We spend about $2 trillion a year in direct costs, making that work. Capacity utilization is in the -- even in peak hours, is in the 30%, 34% range, and there's one person in a car. A 20% improvement in the efficiency of that system will be a 5% increase in household income in America. We think that's going to happen. It's going to take a while to happen because it's an economically dispersed system. Nobody controls all of this. There's lots of different pieces to it. So it's not just the autonomous car. It's shared vehicles. It's machine to machine communication. It's better stoplights. It's -- there's a whole bunch of stuff that's going to change in that system. Arity is one of our efforts to take advantage of that. So Arity is outside the insurance company. It provides services to Allstate and Esurance. The services that the insurance company gets from it is, first, it gives them the ability to do a more accurate price for our customers because we know exactly how they drive, where they drive and when they drive. And -- but we have a different model than others. We've taken it beyond pricing to include things like improving the driving experience, so adding applications onto our continuous connection to help those customers have a better driving experience, and then also to use that technology for other things. So there's many other uses -- many other ways that value could be created by cars being connected. We can share that value with customer. We can use that value to reduce cost for other people and capture those costs. There's really a 3 focus -- 3-part focus: better pricing, better services and additional ways to use a connected car. So Arity is pursuing all 3 of those. It will do that for our insurance companies. We'll do it for noninsurance companies, and we will also do it for other insurance companies as well. So we think it's a platform where we will all be stronger because we are together without giving up our competitive ability to price with our own data in the marketplace."

So we'll distinguish between process changes that impacted PD and those that impacted BI. If you recall in the last quarter and potentially the quarter before that, I referred to our desire in this environment to capture more and more information regarding the claim and PD so that we're better able to manage staffing costs and appropriately serve our customers and ensure that the claims machine is ready to deal with and help out customers at this time. So we began capturing a greater amount of information at first notice of loss, especially on the PD side. And so we told you at that point, and it continues to hold true, that there's a differential between the gross and the paid and that we will overcapture information on PD and have some of those claims closed without payment. And that's okay as far as we're concerned. We're more interested in effectively managing the system and taking care of customers than anything else. And so if we have to have some dislocation in the numbers and some volatility in the numbers to do that properly, we'll do that. On the BI side, as John said in the opening comments, this really had to do with just requiring some enhanced documentation for injuries and related medical treatment in our numbers. And so that does influence the mix. It does influence the -- because it impacts the mix and the timing, it impacts both the frequency and severity. But it -- none of these things impact our overall actual loss trends or our reserving or the P&L because, as John mentioned in his opening comments, all of these changes and all of this information is factored in along with our pay trends and all of the other information that we review on a very careful basis in setting our reserve levels and determining our actual loss cost. So yes, we have some volatility in some of the operational claim statistics that we show you. But no, it doesn't imply any real change in the actual P&L-type statistics that we manage the business on, take rate based upon and report on."

So to Matt's point, you do see it in PD earlier, so those claims tend to get resolved in about 90 days to the extent we're getting better. And to your extent, you would see it in this stuff on the BI basis. That takes several years to really get your arms around it, so that tends to be -- it takes much longer to settle those cases. So whatever we've done in opening practices, to Matt's point, that is reflected in our loss cost.

So let me follow up on that. It's a really good question. And I think it's important to remember, I've been talking during this entire profit improvement program over the last 18 months about the fact that we -- as we've taken rate, tended to take segmented rate. And that is we did not just spread rate along the entire book in any geography, but did it by sub-segment looking at those categories of customers where we were having margin pressures. So we didn't take the rate in equal doses across an entire book but, in fact, broke it down so that we were applying the rate need to those segments of the business that were most problematic. In some cases, that tended to be newer customers, shopping customers, segments that as we had expanded our books over the last couple years tend to be more volatile and they shop more often. And so if we had pressure in that segment and we took rate there, it's not surprising that we had some renewal pressure. But we try very hard, as Tom said, not to lose any customers and not to have any impact. But it is an unintended consequence -- an expected consequence but an unintended consequence of our need to get margin-appropriate. Any time you take rate, you stimulate shopping behavior. And we know that when you stimulate shopping behavior, you are going to lose some segment of those customers. And the same thing will happen to our competitors as they now take rate and begin to disrupt their books as well. We will be the recipient of some of that. And we hope that as we emerge out of -- you will recall, we took a lot of rate in the last quarter, in the second quarter and -- in some of the larger states, so that is why our number looked particularly large in second quarter. But as that comes down a little bit, we hope to be less disruptive to our customer base. And on a system-wide basis, we hope to get back to a more normalized basis, where we're not disrupting customers. It's not good for customers. Obviously, we think they're all better off staying with Allstate. And it's also not good for our agencies who are dealing with that disruption."

I don't think that, that overwrites the overall industry impact of higher frequency and severity. So I don't think that telematics will enable you to get around the fact that there's just more miles driven and people get in more accidents when they drive more. So I don't think that's an answer for why some people's combined ratio does not appear to have moved as much as others. I can only answer what they do. I do think that it is an opportunity for us to further do more sophisticated pricing, for other people to do more sophisticated pricing, which, if you look back over a long period of time when we first moved into credit, first moved into more algorithmic pricing for auto insurance, has led to more stability in overall returns for the industry. So I will just point out the fact that many people today are moving their pricing with respect to frequency and severity because they have the analytics to know it. And so I think in the long term, it's just good for stability and lower volatility in auto insurance profitability. 
Let me just close by thanking you all. So in looking forward, we're going to stay focused on our 5 operating priorities. We try to balance long-term and short-term priorities in a way that enables us to build a sustainable business model that creates values for our customers, our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. So thank you, and we'll talk in the fourth quarter."

Also here with us this morning are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President of our Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Life and Retirement; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.
This quarter, we delivered balanced operating results. Underlying auto margins improved. Homeowners results remained strong, and we generated good total return on the investment portfolio.
Let's start on Slide 2. Net income for the quarter was $491 million and operating income was $474 million, which was $1.26 per share. Operating income was adversely affected by elevated catastrophe losses and a $99 million increase in reserves of discontinued lines. The property-liability recorded combined ratio was 95.5 for the quarter. And the underlying combined ratio was 88, both for the quarter and the first 9 months of the year, which is at the favorable end of the full year outlook that we gave you in February of 88 to 90. Investment income was 7.3% lower than last year's third quarter, reflecting last year we sold about $2 billion of long duration bonds in the payout annuity portfolio. And the results were lower interest income, and we had strong return on the performance-based portfolio in 2015's third quarter.
Total investment returns remained strong at 1.3% for the quarter and 5.2% for the year, driven by both net investment income and price appreciation in the bond portfolio.
Let's go to Slide 3. On a total company basis, about half of the decline in property-liability policies was offset by providing consumers a broad set of unique products using different brands and distribution channels, most notably because of Allstate Benefits. The results for each of the 4 segments of the property-liability market are shown on the bottom diagram on this page here. So the Allstate brand, which is in the lower left, comprises 90% of premiums written that serves customers who prefer branded product and value local relationships. Policies in force at the Allstate brand declined in the third quarter of last year by 2.3% as we continue to raise auto insurance prices. And you can see the impact of those actions on both new business and retention. 
Allstate brand auto net written premiums grew by 4.1%, which reflects a 7.7% increase in average written premium. If you continue down that column, the Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 95.9 for the third quarter of 2016, which is 2.2 points better than the prior year quarter. 
Homeowners in the next column had a recorded combined ratio of 75.9. The underlying combined ratio in the far right column was 86.9 for the Allstate brand.
Moving over to the right. Esurance serves customers that prefer a branded product but are comfortable in handling their own insurance needs. Policies in force decline 0.6% from a year ago due to lower new business and retention. Net written premium grew by 5.4% as the 6.4% increase in auto average premium more than offset policy declines. The recorded underlying combined ratios of 109.8 and 106.0 reflect a different economic model in this segment, where acquisition costs are expensed really in the first policy year versus spread out as commissions over the life of the policy. The underlying auto loss ratio of 75.7 is still above our long-term target, so we continue to implement margin improvement actions. 
Encompass in the upper left competes for customers that want local advice, are less concerned about a branded experience and are served by independent agencies. Encompass remains focused on improving returns. And consequently, policies in force declined by 12.6% from the same quarter a year ago. The recorded underlying combined ratios of 98.3 and 89.3 in the third quarter were better than the third quarter of 2015. 
Answer Financial in the upper right serves brand-neutral self-service customers. It's an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risks. Total non-propriety written premium of $158 million in the quarter grew by 6% from the prior year. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. As you know, we established operating priorities each year to focus our decision and to provide clarity to all of our stakeholders. The first 3 priorities are intertwined and relate to ensuring that we have a profitable and sustainable business model. We balance these efforts with a focus on both short-term results and long-term value creation. To better serve customers, we're building new capabilities for Allstate agencies so they can be better trusted advisers. For example, we successfully introduced a new personalized insurance proposal and now have done over 2 million of those. At the same time, to earn an appropriate return on capital, we've increased auto insurance prices, which has a negative impact in customer satisfaction and growth. To grow the entire enterprise, we're leveraging our brands, customer relationships and capabilities, including having Esurance sell homeowners insurance and expanding Allstate Benefits. 
Now as you know, we proactively invested our $81 billion investment portfolio to achieve the best risk-adjusted return over time periods that are either appropriate for the liabilities event or consistent with our risk appetite on capital. Steve will talk more about the investment results in just a minute. 
Lastly, to create long-term growth, we're expanding Arity, our connected car platform, and working to further expand our portfolio of consumer protection products. 
Now let me turn it over to Don."

Third quarter catastrophe",1101,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start on Slide 5. Property-Liability earned premium of $7.9 billion in the third quarter of 2016 was 2.9% higher than the same period last year. During the first 3 quarters of 2016, earned premium grew by 3.5%. Third quarter catastrophe losses of $481 million were 78.1% higher than the prior year quarter. Catastrophe losses of $2.3 billion through the first 9 months of 2016 were $908 million higher than the first 3 quarters of last year. The recorded combined ratio for Property-Liability was 95.5 in the third quarter of 2016. When we exclude catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates, the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016 were both 88.0, which is better than 2015 and at the favorable end of our annual outlook range of 88 to 90. Property-Liability operating income of $452 million in the third quarter 2016 was 17.8% below prior year results due to higher catastrophe losses and a $99 million reserve increase for discontinued lines.
In the chart on the bottom left, the blue line represents net written premium growth, while the red line shows policy in force growth. Property-Liability's policies in force were 2.6% below the third quarter of 2015, while net written premium increased by 2.1% over the same time period. These trends were heavily influenced by our auto profit improvement actions across underwriting brands. The widening gap between these 2 trend lines reflects increased average premium per policy.
The bottom-right graph shows the recorded combined ratio in red in comparison to the underlying combined ratio in the blue bars. And it illustrates that most of the quarter-to-quarter volatility is due to catastrophe losses. 
Going to Slide 6. The chart on the top left shows the quarterly underlying loss ratios and combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9 in the third quarter of 2016 improved by 2.2 points compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by a lower underlying loss ratio. As seen on the chart on the top right, annualized average premium increased to $966 or 7% compared to the prior year, while underlying loss and expenses increased by 4.5%, increasing the favorable gap to $40.
Underlying loss and expenses are shown by the red line. Underlying losses are based on a sophisticated and segmented approach to establishing loss reserves. We use a wide range of operational and financial statistics and multiple techniques to estimate loss costs. For example, gross frequency reflects actual notice counts reported in a particular time period, and we use that data to record losses and reserves for each notice count received as opposed to estimating an accident year loss ratio based on aggregate claims data. Similarly, paid frequency is used to estimate how many of those reported claims will ultimately be paid and helps us measure and better manage paid severity claim staffing. 
To provide you insight into the underlying results, we disclosed several frequency statistics and paid severity transfer the property damage and bodily injury coverages, which are shown on the bottom 2 graphs. Property damage claims represent about 20% of loss costs and reflect both the frequency of accidents and the average paid severity for claims. As you can see, frequency in the blue bar began to rise in the last quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015 and then accelerated until being essentially flat for the last 2 quarters. Paid severity, however, continues to increase, although the rate of increase has come down throughout 2016. 
Bodily injury claims comprised about 30% of loss costs and have more volatile underlying statistics because of the longer time period it takes to settle these claims and a greater dispersion in the amounts paid per claim. The decrease in paid frequency and increase in paid severity during the third quarter are related and reflect payment mix and claim closure patterns that were impacted by changes in bodily injury claims processes to require enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatments. And as a result, fewer claims were opened and paid in the third quarter of 2016, but those that were paid had higher average payments. Normalizing for the process enhancement made to bodily injury claims in the quarter, both injury paid claim frequency and severity consistently measured would have been generally consistent with those observed during the first half of 2016.
One of the components of our profit improvement plan is claims operational excellence. We are always looking for ways to improve claims processes and continue to settle claims fairly, deliver the best possible claims experience to our customers and settle claims as efficiently as possible. And while claims process changes have impacted some of our operational statistics, we take the impact of those changes into account when setting reserves. And as a result, claims process changes have not impacted our recorded underwriting results.
Slide 7 provides detail on the auto profit improvement plan. We have continued to diligently pursue approval for higher auto prices where appropriate. And you can see on the lower left chart that in the third quarter 2016, we received approved rate increases estimated at $209 million across all 3 brands. This brings our total for the first 9 months of 2016 to $1.2 billion, higher than the full year of 2015. 
The chart on the lower right shows average premium increased 7.7% compared to the prior year quarter, an acceleration of the trend we have seen since the middle of last year. And average net earned premium shown by the gray line lags average written premium and is up 6%.
Moving to Slide 8. The chart on the left shows Allstate brand auto policies in force have decreased, which reflects the auto margin improvement plan and are 2.5% below the prior year quarter. The chart on the right highlights that while new business and customer retention have been impacted by our profit improvement actions, our absolute levels in new business production have stabilized over the last couple quarters.
Slide 9 highlights the continued strength of Allstate brand homeowners. The chart on the left shows the recorded combined ratio remained a very strong 75.9 in the quarter despite significant catastrophe losses. On a trailing 12-month basis, the recorded combined ratio is 84.3. 
The chart on the right shows annualized average earned premium per policy increase by 2.1% over the prior year quarter, and average underlying loss and expense per policy increased by 2.4%. The gap between these 2 measures improved by $7 compared to the third quarter last year. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Steve."

Slide 10 provides an overview of our profitability and growth trends for Esurance and Encompass. The Esurance recorded combined ratio as shown on the top-left chart was 109.8 in the third quarter and 106.0 when catastrophes, prior year reserve reestimates and the amortization of intangibles are excluded. Do remember, with the direct distribution model, combined ratios are impacted by acquisition expenses being written off much faster than the agency channel, where commissions are spread over the policy life. This result is also adversely impacted by expenses related to expanding into homeowners insurance and new markets. The underlying loss ratio of 74.7 is higher than our long-term target, and we will continue to take actions to raise Esurance returns. 
On the top right, Esurance written premium was up 5.4%, while policies in force declined by 0.6 points compared to a year ago, reflecting the auto improvement initiatives. 
The chart on the bottom left shows Encompass' improvement in both recorded and underlying combined ratios. The recorded combined ratio of 98.3 was 3 points better than the third quarter a year ago, and the underlying combined ratio of 89.3 improved by 1.6 points. 
The chart on the bottom right shows the top line trend, which, as you can see, was impacted by profit improvement actions. Policies in force shown on the bottom right by the gray line declined by 12.6%, while net written premium represented by the blue line declined by 9.7%. Encompass will continue to take pricing, underwriting and expense actions in order to achieve target margins.
Turning to Slide 11. Allstate Financial premiums and contract charges totaled $571 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 6.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Allstate Benefits grew 11.3% in the third quarter with an increase of 444,000 policies over the prior 12 months. Allstate Financial's operating income and net income were $94 million and $80 million in the third quarter of 2016, respectively. 
Operating income was $44 million lower than in the third quarter of 2015, due primarily to lower investment income. Across the bottom, we show net an operating income for reach business. The Allstate Life business operating income of $51 million in the third quarter decreased $7 million compared to last year due to higher expenses and lower investment margins. 
Allstate Benefits operating income of $25 million for the third quarter was relatively consistent with the third quarter of last year. 
The annuity business generated operating income of $18 million, down $36 million from third quarter 2015, primarily due to reduced investment income resulting from the 2015 portfolio repositioning and lower limited partnership income compared to a very strong prior year quarter. 
At the top right of the slide, we provide the liability balance invested mix for our immediate annuity business before and after the portfolio repositioning. The proceeds from the sale of long-duration bonds are being invested over time in performance-based and public equity investments, as you can see by the increased allocations of these assets in the chart. 
While we will maintain a significant allocation to interest-bearing investments, we will continue to increase our performance-based investments, which are well suited to the long-dated immediate annuity liabilities. 
Slide 12 shows our investment results. We increased our emphasis on performance-based investment after the financial crisis to replace market risk with idiosyncratic risk by emphasizing ownership over lending. This increased allocation to investments, such as private equity, real estate, timber and agricultural-related businesses from $4.1 billion a year in 2012 to $5.8 billion in 2016, as shown on the upper-left chart. These investments require a higher economic and regulatory capital, but we expect they will deliver attractive long-term economic returns for our shareholders. 
Total return for the third quarter in the upper-right was a solid 1.3%, reflecting a contribution from investment income of 90 basis points and an increase in the portfolio's value primarily from lower market yields. 
Gross investment income is shown on the bottom-left graph. You can see performance-based investment results shown in gray are the primary source of income variability between quarters. Performance-based investments generate income of $147 million for the quarter, somewhat lower than the strong results from last year. 
Investment yield by business segment is shown at the bottom right. The Property-Liability yield is closer to current market yields as a result of its shorter duration. Allstate Financial's yield has obviously impacted last year's immediate annuity portfolio repositioning, but the yield remains higher due to its longer duration and because investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability reductions. 
Slide 13 illustrates the continued strength of our capital position and highlights our financial flexibility. Shareholders' equity increased to $20.9 billion in the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 19.6%, a reduction of 0.4 points from the prior year quarter. Book value per common share of $51.48 increased by 8.3% over the same period a year ago, primarily due to increased unrealized gains in the investment portfolio and income generation partially offset by capital return to shareholders. We held $2.7 billion of holding company assets at quarter's end, which, when combined with our modest leverage ratio, provides a high degree of financial flexibility.
During the third quarter, we returned $389 million to common shareholders through a combination of dividend and share repurchases. By the end of the third quarter, we returned almost $1.5 billion to our common shareholders.

So we'll see it normalize, but it may not go back to exactly where it was previously because there were some of those changes. As John referred to in his remarks, there's some enhanced documentation requirements. So the mix changes. I think in response to a question you asked last quarter, I talked about the timing impact and the peristalsis that sometimes occurs in the claims area where you have a buildup of claims that are then processed. And especially in BI with the long tail on it, you can see that happen. So you can expect to see some fluctuation.

So first, Lincoln Benefit. I think it was 2014 when we saw this. And we're kind of -- we kind of came around the track on that one already, and so you saw that really beginning in last year's numbers. This year, what you're seeing is a different strategic choice, which is the choice to do a different asset liability matching program in the annuity business. So those -- we have about -- as Steve mentioned, we have about $12 billion of payments that are due over the next 40 to 50 years in that immediate annuity business. Of course, we have to have investments that generate returns to make those payments. With current interest rates, it would not generate. If we took all that money and invested it, today, first, we couldn't get the right duration. Secondly, the rate on that would not be enough to generate enough earnings to pay all those amounts off, so we would then have to put some capital in. What we've chosen to do is put the capital in now and invest in equities, which will generate a higher return. When you get past the 10-year period, the return on equities is twice that of bonds, and the risk is about the same. So we think that's a good use of shareholder capital from a strategic standpoint. That's a different use of capital than the capital you're talking about freeing up from Lincoln Benefit. Mary Jane, you might want to make some comments about Life and Benefits."

We have been running favorable in our mortality, which is for the last 4 quarters, we have been experiencing favorable mortality, which has been impacting those results in a positive way. In terms of the annuities, as Tom mentioned, we've been actively putting the $2 billion to work. $1.3 billion has been put to work year-to-date. The returns on the performance-based investments were 10% in the quarter, which is in line with our long-term expectation. So that really reflects kind of the run rate for the annuity business. So we'll continue to actively invest in that asset class, which will generate earnings additionally over time."

Thank you, Mike. First, Esurance is a better company now than when we bought it because of the skills and capabilities we brought to it, whether that's branding, marketing, claims, pricing preferred, customers getting into the homeowners business. So we added value, and it's a good, strong company and a much stronger competitor now than it was 5 years ago. It has grown a lot. It's doubled in size. We accepted a lower return on capital from the auto insurance business at Esurance during that growth than we did from the Allstate brand because we wanted to lean into the growth, as you point out, but it was always above our cost of capital. So with ours, like, okay -- as Matt and Don and I and others, has talked about, we're like, okay, we'll take a lower term, but it's got to be above what our cost is because we should be creating shareholder value as we grow. That continues to be the case. We continue to write it above our cost of capital as we look at the vintage years of each of the products. That said, when we ran into the increase in frequency and severity that impacted all of the brands, we chose to slow growth some because we don't want to write it at below the cost of capital. We've now got our pricing position in a better place, so I do expect that we'll begin to grow that business again like we'll grow our other business. But we don't -- I don't feel like we're at the place right now where we should throw hundreds of million of dollars of marketing money at growth there, in part because while we've dramatically improved the brand, we still need to get our consideration and awareness up. And that takes a number of years to invest in that. So we like what we got. It's been growing. I think it can be -- it certainly has broadened our strategic platform and gave us a broader set of capabilities to compete in the market with. But it's not to the point where I feel like we should run hundreds of millions of dollars of underwriting losses. That said, we don't really manage them to the P&L. We manage them to the economics. And because we're big enough, we can take the underlying losses from that business if we believe it's economic."

Let me try to take that. So as we shift out of rate-taking mode and enhanced focus on profitability and get back to a more balanced approach, it's not just a question of just ramping up expenses for advertising because that's just one component of what's necessary to get the system growing. So it's multiple components. It's quote volume. It's rate competitiveness, which impacts close rates. It's capacity in agencies. And it's number of points of presence. And what happens when you're unfortunately taking a fair amount of rate, and we have over the last several quarters, is it impacts all of those things. It's not just that you're not advertising. A lot is you're eating up agent capacity, you're impacting your close rate. It's hard to put on new agencies in that environment, and so your number of points of presence tends to stabilize. So as we get more stable and as we believe we can see frequency and severity stabilize and that puts us in a better position to begin the growth initiatives, you'll see a whole bunch of things change, and one of them might be some additional marketing expense. But it's only a small component. And I would that marketing in and of itself, if you don't have the agent capacity and if your competitiveness isn't there, it's not a very efficient spend. So we'll consider that among the other levers that are available in the business to work towards long-term profitable growth."

So I think some people, as we've gone through this increase in frequency and severity that Matt talked about, look at the reduction in expenses, so we'll just cut expenses so we could make our number. That's not the case. Our philosophy on expenses is not let's do a target P&L number. It's -- first, don't spend it if your customers don't want it. Do spend it if your customers do want it. Secondly, Matt talked about this integrated basis. And that's if you advertise and your agency is not ready or your competitive position is not right, then it doesn't really make any sense. So we really do run it on an integrated basis. And then we also invest for the long term. So I don't want you -- in 2011, remember, I think I announced it, we made maybe like $750 million or something like that in net income, and we didn't back off a wit on our advertising spend because we knew we needed to do that to stay competitive for the long term. So we will always have things, whether it's advertising, technology, investing. So we try to manage it really on the long-term economics that Matt was talking about. So it's our philosophy. But -- and sometimes, when I read some of the reports that have come out, it feels like people are thinking we've got this. We're managing just to get that P&L number, and that's not the way we run our business. To the extent we can cut our costs, Matt's got a big program going on in continuous improvement. We're reducing our costs as aggressively as we can. To the extent we need to use that money to invest in something else, we will because -- as long as we think it makes sense for us."

I'll go up for a second, and then I'll come down very quickly to Arity. So we think the personal transportation industry is going to change dramatically, and we think that's an opportunity for us to do more for our customers. The reason it will change dramatically as it's incredibly inefficient, so we have about $4 trillion tied up in hardware called cars and trucks and stuff like that. We spend about $2 trillion a year in direct costs, making that work. Capacity utilization is in the -- even in peak hours, is in the 30%, 34% range, and there's one person in a car. A 20% improvement in the efficiency of that system will be a 5% increase in household income in America. We think that's going to happen. It's going to take a while to happen because it's an economically dispersed system. Nobody controls all of this. There's lots of different pieces to it. So it's not just the autonomous car. It's shared vehicles. It's machine to machine communication. It's better stoplights. It's -- there's a whole bunch of stuff that's going to change in that system. Arity is one of our efforts to take advantage of that. So Arity is outside the insurance company. It provides services to Allstate and Esurance. The services that the insurance company gets from it is, first, it gives them the ability to do a more accurate price for our customers because we know exactly how they drive, where they drive and when they drive. And -- but we have a different model than others. We've taken it beyond pricing to include things like improving the driving experience, so adding applications onto our continuous connection to help those customers have a better driving experience, and then also to use that technology for other things. So there's many other uses -- many other ways that value could be created by cars being connected. We can share that value with customer. We can use that value to reduce cost for other people and capture those costs. There's really a 3 focus -- 3-part focus: better pricing, better services and additional ways to use a connected car. So Arity is pursuing all 3 of those. It will do that for our insurance companies. We'll do it for noninsurance companies, and we will also do it for other insurance companies as well. So we think it's a platform where we will all be stronger because we are together without giving up our competitive ability to price with our own data in the marketplace."

So we'll distinguish between process changes that impacted PD and those that impacted BI. If you recall in the last quarter and potentially the quarter before that, I referred to our desire in this environment to capture more and more information regarding the claim and PD so that we're better able to manage staffing costs and appropriately serve our customers and ensure that the claims machine is ready to deal with and help out customers at this time. So we began capturing a greater amount of information at first notice of loss, especially on the PD side. And so we told you at that point, and it continues to hold true, that there's a differential between the gross and the paid and that we will overcapture information on PD and have some of those claims closed without payment. And that's okay as far as we're concerned. We're more interested in effectively managing the system and taking care of customers than anything else. And so if we have to have some dislocation in the numbers and some volatility in the numbers to do that properly, we'll do that. On the BI side, as John said in the opening comments, this really had to do with just requiring some enhanced documentation for injuries and related medical treatment in our numbers. And so that does influence the mix. It does influence the -- because it impacts the mix and the timing, it impacts both the frequency and severity. But it -- none of these things impact our overall actual loss trends or our reserving or the P&L because, as John mentioned in his opening comments, all of these changes and all of this information is factored in along with our pay trends and all of the other information that we review on a very careful basis in setting our reserve levels and determining our actual loss cost. So yes, we have some volatility in some of the operational claim statistics that we show you. But no, it doesn't imply any real change in the actual P&L-type statistics that we manage the business on, take rate based upon and report on."

So whatever we've done in opening practices, to Matt's point, that is reflected in our loss cost. And if you look at our reserving practices over a 10- or 20-year period, we have a pretty consistent ability to accurately predict what losses are."

And I think it's important to remember, I've been talking during this entire profit improvement program over the last 18 months about the fact that we -- as we've taken rate, tende",390,"Ryan, it's Matt. So let me follow up on that. It's a really good question. And I think it's important to remember, I've been talking during this entire profit improvement program over the last 18 months about the fact that we -- as we've taken rate, tended to take segmented rate. And that is we did not just spread rate along the entire book in any geography, but did it by sub-segment looking at those categories of customers where we were having margin pressures. So we didn't take the rate in equal doses across an entire book but, in fact, broke it down so that we were applying the rate need to those segments of the business that were most problematic. In some cases, that tended to be newer customers, shopping customers, segments that as we had expanded our books over the last couple years tend to be more volatile and they shop more often. And so if we had pressure in that segment and we took rate there, it's not surprising that we had some renewal pressure. But we try very hard, as Tom said, not to lose any customers and not to have any impact. But it is an unintended consequence -- an expected consequence but an unintended consequence of our need to get margin-appropriate. Any time you take rate, you stimulate shopping behavior. And we know that when you stimulate shopping behavior, you are going to lose some segment of those customers. And the same thing will happen to our competitors as they now take rate and begin to disrupt their books as well. We will be the recipient of some of that. And we hope that as we emerge out of -- you will recall, we took a lot of rate in the last quarter, in the second quarter and -- in some of the larger states, so that is why our number looked particularly large in second quarter. But as that comes down a little bit, we hope to be less disruptive to our customer base. And on a system-wide basis, we hope to get back to a more normalized basis, where we're not disrupting customers. It's not good for customers. Obviously, we think they're all better off staying with Allstate. And it's also not good for our agencies who are dealing with that disruption."

So I don't think that's an answer for why some people's combined ratio does not appear to have moved as much as others. I can only answer what they do. I do think that it is an opportunity for us to further do more sophisticated pricing, for other people to do more sophisticated pricing, which, if you look back over a long period of time when we first moved into credit, first moved into more algorithmic pricing for auto insurance, has led to more stability in overall returns for the industry. So I will just point out the fact that many people today are moving their pricing with respect to frequency and severity because they have the analytics to know it. And so I think in the long term, it's just good for stability and lower volatility in auto insurance profitability.
