Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I will provide an update on the steps we are taking in response to the low oil price environment and will review highlights from 2015.

I will provide an update on the steps we are taking in response to the low oil price environment and will review highlights from 2015. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance. And John Rielly will review our financial results. 
Three principles are guiding us through this lower-for-longer oil price environment: Preserve the strength of our balance sheet, preserve our operating capabilities and preserve our long-term growth options. By adhering to this disciplined approach, we finished the year with one of the strongest balance sheets and liquidity positions among our E&P peers, with $2.7 billion of cash and undrawn $4 billion revolving credit facility that goes out to January 2020 and a net debt to capitalization ratio excluding the Bakken midstream joint venture of approximately 15%.
Our top priority in this challenging environment is to continue to keep our balance sheet strong. Yesterday, we announced a 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, 40% below our 2015 spend and approximately 20% below the preliminary guidance we provided in late October of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. Our focus is on value, not volume, and we do not think it makes sense to accelerate production in the current price environment, particularly given the recent further deterioration in the oil markets. For this reason, we will reduce activity levels across our producing portfolio in 2016, both onshore and offshore, and will continue to pursue further cost reductions to preserve the strength of our balance sheet.
Our 2016 production forecast remains the same as our previous guidance of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, even with the roughly $600 million of additional cuts in capital spend from our previous guidance and the recent sale of our assets in Algeria in December, which contributed net production of 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2015.
In terms of our year-end reserves, as a result of a significant price-driven negative revision and a corresponding reduction in activity levels, our proved reserves decreased year-over-year to 1.086 billion barrels of oil equivalent at year-end 2015. It is important to note that all of the decrease was in proved undeveloped category and that our proved developed producing reserves increased by approximately 4% versus 2014.
Now turning to our 2015 financial results. Our adjusted net loss was $1.1 billion, and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $1.9 billion. Compared to 2014, our results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas sales volumes, which were more than offset by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher DD&A expense. 
From an operational standpoint, 2015 was a year of outstanding performance with strong execution across the portfolio and we are very proud of the work our team has done in a difficult oil price environment. Actual production was 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus our October guidance of 370,000 to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a pro forma basis, excluding Libya and asset sales, 2015 production increased by 18% compared to 2014, averaging 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus 311,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day the prior year on the same basis. 
Also, during 2015, we delivered significant reductions in both capital expenditures and cash operating costs and achieved early success with our focused exploration program.
Turning to the Bakken. Hess has an industry-leading acreage position that is competitive with the best shale oil plays in the United States. Through the application of lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team has continued to drill some of the lowest cost and most productive wells in the play. Our 2016 focus is on the core of the core where Hess has significantly more drilling spacing units or DSUs than any other competitor. Maintaining a 2-rig program will help preserve our top quartile operating capabilities so that we are positioned to efficiently increase activity when oil prices recover. Bakken production in 2015 averaged 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up approximately 35% from 2014. Despite dropping to 2 rigs, we continue to forecast Bakken production to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. 
On July 1, 2015, we closed on the Bakken Midstream joint venture, which resulted in total cash proceeds to Hess of $3 billion. Hess maintains operational control of these strategic assets, giving us access to the best markets for our products through the flexibility that it offers. As previously announced, the joint venture plans to proceed with an initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP common units when market conditions improve. 
In terms of developments, while we are significantly reducing investment across our base portfolio, we plan to continue to invest for future growth with 2 offshore developments. The first in North Malay Basin is a long life, low risk natural gas resource with Oil Enterprises. Hess is operator with a 50% interest. Full field development is on track for startup in 2017 after which the project is expected to add an incremental 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production and become a long-term cash generator. 
Our second offshore development, Stampede, is one of the largest undeveloped fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with estimated gross recoverable resources of between 300 million and 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. Hess is the operator of Stampede and we have a 25% interest. Following startup in 2018, the project will add an incremental 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production and become a material cash generator.
Turning to explorations. We are very pleased with the early results from our focused exploration program namely, the Exxon-operated Liza discovery offshore Guyana in which Hess has a 30% working interest and the Chevron-operated Sicily discovery in the deep water Gulf of Mexico in which Hess has a 25% working interest. In particular, we believe that the Stabroek Block in Guyana has the potential to be very material to Hess and create significant long-term value for our shareholders even in a lower price environment. About 90% of a 17,000 square kilometer 3D seismic acquisition program has been completed. In 2016, we plan to drill up to 4 wells to evaluate the Liza discovery, perform a drill stem test and explore additional prospects on the block.
In summary, we are well-positioned to navigate this lower-for-longer price environment and are taking a disciplined approach to: Preserve our financial strength, competitively advantage capabilities and long-term growth options. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."
249841,321461103,921499,"Hess Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. I would like to provide an operational update on our progress in 2015 and our plans for 2016. As John mentioned, 2015 was a year of strong execution across our portfolio. Production averaged 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the",1916,"Thanks, John. I would like to provide an operational update on our progress in 2015 and our plans for 2016. 
As John mentioned, 2015 was a year of strong execution across our portfolio. Production averaged 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the top end of our October guidance of 370,000 to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter, production averaged 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, exceeding our October guidance of 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the same quarter. 
In 2015, we also reduced capital and exploratory expenditures by $400 million during the year and cash operating cost by more than $300 million. We continue to drive down our drilling and completion costs and successfully conducted tighter spacing and increased stage count pilots in the Bakken. We also achieved material exploration success in Guyana and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico where the Liza and Sicily wells were ranked as the 2 largest oil discoveries of 2015 by both Wood Mackenzie and IHS. 
Clearly, 2015 was a challenging year in terms of oil prices, and we believe it is prudent to manage the business, assuming that prices remain lower for longer. On that basis, we announced yesterday a 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, which is 40% below 2015 levels and will result in significant reductions in activity levels across our unconventionals and offshore business.
Year-end 2015 proved reserves were significantly impacted by the price environment, with the addition of 84 million barrels of oil equivalent offset by price-related downward revisions of 282 million barrels of oil equivalent. Year-end proved reserves accounting for the sale of our Algeria asset were 1.086 billion barrels of oil equivalent, of which 73% were proved developed. Nonetheless, the notable early success of our exploration program and continued technical advances in our unconventionals business have allowed us to materially grow our total resource base. 
In 2016, we forecast companywide production to average between 330,000 and 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This forecast is unchanged from preliminary guidance provided on our last quarterly conference call despite the further 20% reduction in our capital and exploratory expenditures. In the first quarter of 2016, we forecast companywide production to average between 340,000 and 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Turning to operations. The Bakken continues to deliver outstanding performance as well as higher upside. We exceeded our production targets; continued to substantially reduce our well cost through the continued application of lean manufacturing techniques; significantly improved our well IP rates through the successful testing of 50 stage sliding sleeve fracs, an industry first in the Bakken; and increased our well inventory and estimated open recovery through infilling to tighter spacing using a 9/8 configuration. Full year production in the Bakken averaged 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 35% above 2014 and above our guidance from the beginning of the year of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In the fourth quarter, as a result of lower drilling activity, net production averaged 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 7% from the year-ago quarter. Lean manufacturing practices enabled us to once again significantly drive down our Bakken drilling and completion costs, with the fourth quarter averaging $5.1 million per well versus $7.1 million per well in the year-ago quarter, a reduction of 28%. Looking forward, we expect drilling and completion costs in 2016 to remain near this level even though we will increase stage counts by approximately 40% as we move from our standard 35-stage design to a 50-stage design. The 50-stage trials conducted in 2015 had been very successful, delivering more than a 20% average increase in IP 30, 60 and 90. Our tighter well spacing pilots in 2015 have also been successful. Results to date confirm that moving from 13 wells to 17 wells per DSU is value accretive in the core of the play, enabling us to add 200 new drilling locations to our inventory. Additional pilots will be required in the future to fully understand the applicability across all of our acreage, which, to some degree, will be a function of price. 
The combination of our successful infill pilot and overall stronger type curve performance has allowed us to increase our estimated ultimate recovery from the Bakken to $1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent from our previous estimate of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. 
Our industry-leading Bakken position continues to provide a forward well inventory that has one of the lowest breakevens in the play. However, in the current pricing environment, we believe it is prudent to reduce drilling until oil prices recover. With this in mind, in 2016, we intend to reduce our activity to 2 rigs at the end of February compared to an average of 8.5 rigs in 2015 and 17 rigs in 2014.
Our 2016 capital budget for the Bakken is $425 million, approximately a 70% reduction from 2015. We plan to drill approximately 50 wells and bring approximately 80 new wells online in 2016 compared to 219 new wells online in 2015. Despite this significant reduction in well activity, we forecast Bakken net production to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 and also in the first quarter of 2016.
Moving to the Utica. In 2015, the joint venture drilled 24 wells and brought 32 new wells on production. In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. Net production for the year in the Utica averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2014. 
In 2015, by applying the same lean manufacturing techniques that we used in the Bakken, we reduced drilling and completion costs by 30%, down to $9.6 million per well from $13.7 million per well in 2014. Despite the high quality of our acreage position and low 5% average royalty, the joint venture intends to lay down the 1 rig we have operating at the end of the first quarter of 2016 given low natural gas and NGL prices and wide basin differentials. 
In 2016, we plan to drill 5 wells and bring 14 new wells online. Production is forecast to average between 20,000 and 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.
Turning to our offshore operations. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we commenced remediation work at our Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator. This work includes asset jobs at 2 wells and opening a sac subsurface safety valve at another well. The field produced approximately 20,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015, and we forecast that the remediation work will allow production to increase to approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2016. 
In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, production averaged 33,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. In response to low prices, the operator plans a very minimal amount of activity in 2016. Full-year net production is expected to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.
At the South Armfield in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, we expect to complete the current phase of development drilling and release the rig at the end of the first quarter. Net production averaged 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015 and is expected to average approximately 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. 
In Equatorial Guinea, where we are operator with an 85% interest, we recently completed the acquisition of new 4D seismic. Processing of this seismic is underway, and the early data indicates additional infill production and water injection well opportunities that can be pursued when oil prices recover. Net production averaged 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. Looking forward, production is expected to decline over 2016, reflecting a continuation of the drilling pause that has been in place since mid-2015. 
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, work continues on the booster compression project which is expected to be completed in the third quarter. Further drilling activity will not be required to meet contracted volumes for the next couple of years as a result of the compression project.  Net production averaged 42,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015 and is expected to be approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016, reflecting planned downtime associated with the booster compression project and lower PSC entitlements due to lower capital expenditure. 
We continue to progress our North Malay Basin and Stampede developments, which remain on target to come on stream in 2017 and 2018, respectively. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, the first 2 wells of the development drilling campaign have reached total depth and are fully in line with pre-drill expectations. Net production averaged approximately 40 million cubic feet per day through the early production system in 2015 and is expected to stay at this level through 2016. Following completion of the full field development project in 2017, net production is planned to increase to 165 million cubic feet per day. 
At the Stampede development in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully completed installation of piles, started setting equipment on the top side and made good progress on the whole in 2015. Looking forward, in 2016, we aim to complete the top side's main deck, begin offshore installation of the whole block and install a subsea system. Development drilling will commence in 2016 and first oil remains targeted for 2018.
Moving to exploration. In the Gulf of Mexico, following the success of the Sicily 1 discovery well, in which Hess holds a 25% interest, the operator Chevron has commenced drilling the Sicily 2 appraisal well to delineate a large 4-way closure in the outward. The operator expects to reach target depth during the second quarter of 2016. 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, we are participating in a ConocoPhillips-operated prospect called Melmar in which Hess has a 35% interest. The lower price environment has enabled access to high-quality, longer-term offshore prospects at attractive entry costs. Melmar is a good example of this and fits well with our strategy. It is one of the last large Paleogene 4-way prospects in the prolific trend. Drilling operations began in December, and the operator expects to reach total depth in the second quarter 2016. 
In Guyana, where the Liza 1 well encountered [ph] 295 feet of high-quality oilbearing reservoir, the operator, Exxon Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, is planning to evaluate the Liza discovery and test the further potential of the Stabroek Block, in which Hess has a 30% interest. The next well, Liza 2, is planned to spud later in the first quarter.
In closing, despite the challenging price environment, 2015 was a year of excellent execution and delivery across our business, which is a tribute to the outstanding people of Hess. Our strategy is to continue protecting our balance sheet while maintaining our core capabilities and growth options. I will now turn the call over to John Reilly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2015. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $396 million in the fourth quart",1145,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2015. 
Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $396 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $291 million in the third quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, the Corporation incurred a net loss of $1,821,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a net loss of $279 million in the previous quarter. 
The fourth quarter results contained noncash charges of $1,359,000,000 resulting from the low commodity price environment, including the writeoff of our E&P segment goodwill of $1,098,000,000. The nontaxable goodwill charge was allocated in our financial results to U.S. and international operations. 
In addition, fourth quarter exploration expenses include $178 million after tax for the write off of previously capitalized gas wells in Ghana, 3 previously capitalized wells in Australia that are not included in the most recent development concept and the impairment of certain leasehold costs in the Gulf of Mexico. In the United States, we also recognized an impairment charge of $83 million after tax associated with our legacy conventional North Dakota assets. 
In connection with the sale of Hovensa's assets and completion of its bankruptcy, Hess agreed to assume obligations under the Hovensa pension plan and relinquish our rights to receive any proceeds from financing provided to Hovensa during bankruptcy in exchange for the release of all claims from the Virgin Islands government that were asserted against us. Our fourth quarter results include charges of $41 million after tax for the cost of the pension obligations amounts funded in the quarter and legal fees.
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred losses of $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $221 million in the third quarter of 2015. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the fourth quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2015 were as follows: Lower sales volumes reduced results by $46 million, lower realized selling prices reduced results by $33 million, higher exploration expenses reduced results by $21 million. All other items net to a reduction results in $7 million for an overall reduction in fourth quarter adjusted results of $107 million. In the fourth quarter, our E&P operations were underlifted compared with production by approximately 1 million barrels, which did not have a material impact on fourth-quarter results. 
The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 38% for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a benefit of 47% in the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, the fourth quarter effective tax rate reflects the fact that goodwill impairment charge did not have an associated tax benefit.
Turning to Midstream. Fourth-quarter net income of $11 million was down versus third quarter net income of $16 million, primarily due to lower volume throughput at the Tioga Gas Plant as a result of unplanned downtime and increased crude export via pipeline in response to market differentials. Bakken Midstream EBITDA, excluding the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $79 million in the previous quarter.
Turning to Corporate. After-tax Corporate and interest expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $86 million in the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter, including an increase of $401 million from changes in working capital, was $623 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $935 million. Net borrowings were $93 million. Common stock dividends paid were $72 million. Other net amounted to a use of cash of $6 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $297 million. 
Excluding amounts held in our Bakken midstream joint venture, we had approximately $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015, compared to $3 billion at September 30, 2015. Total debt, excluding Bakken Midstream, was $5.9 billion at December 31, 2015, and our debt to capitalization ratio was 24.4%. In addition, we have a committed $4 billion revolving credit facility that is undrawn.
Turning to 2016 guidance. We project cash cost for E&P operations to be in the range of $15 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2016 and $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel for the full-year 2016, down from 2015 cash cost of $15.69 per barrel. The first quarter cash costs include well work over cost at the Tubular Bells Field. 
DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2016 is forecast to be $29 to $30 per barrel and $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel for the full year of 2016, up from 2015  DD&A of $28.14 per barrel. This results in projected total E&P unit operating cost of $44 to $46 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 and $43 to $45 per barrel for the full year of 2016 compared with 2015 E&P unit operating cost of $43.83 per barrel. 
The Bakken midstream tariff expense is expected to be $3.55 to $3.65 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2016 and $3.55 to $3.95 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2016, up from 2015 midstream tariffs of $3.28 per barrel. 
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs and items affecting comparability, are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $260 million to $280 million for the full year 2016, down from $338 million in 2015. 
The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 41% to 45% for the first quarter and full year of 2016 versus a benefit of 45% in 2015.
Turning to Midstream. In 2016, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter and in the range of $40 million to $50 million for the full year.
Turning to Corporate and interest. In 2016, we estimate Corporate expenses net of taxes to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million in the first quarter and in the range of $110 million to $120 million for the full year. We estimate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the first quarter of 2016 and in the range of $205 million to $215 million for the full-year 2016. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So in the fourth quarter, we did have some special charges in the fourth quarter and some of them do have a cash flow impact. So they are impacting what a normal run rate would be in the fourth quarter. So the first part of that in the E&P charges are first surplus materials and supplies just due to reduced drilling plans. So that was approximately $25 million in the quarter that was reducing cash flow that 2 21. And then also we had lower cost of market in the fourth quarter of approximately $40 million. So those 2 right there from a special charges aspect gets you about $65 million kind of a nonrecurring impact in the quarter. And then there's a couple of other things. One, from the specials outside of the E&P is Hovensa. So part of the charge relates to the relinquishments of proceeds that we provided during bankruptcy, plus we had legal fees in there. So that was approximately $20 million in the quarter, again reducing cash flow from operations. And then on an operating standpoint, you probably saw you noticed our exploration costs were up in the quarter. Just from a run rate standpoint, it was in line with our full-year guidance. But in the fourth quarter, we had higher seismic, approximately $20 million to $25 million in the quarter. So again from a recurring type standpoint, it's just impacting that lower cash flow in the fourth quarter. And then the last thing you heard I did mention there was 1 million-barrel underlift. So even though that had from a results standpoint not much of an impact, it does have a cash flow impact in the quarter. And so you're ranging that $10 million to $15 million for that underlift. So all told, it's about $125 million when you add those numbers kind of reducing the cash flow from operations in the quarter."

So and one of the things we're seeing is this low price environment has created a lot of opportunities to access very high quality longer-term growth options at very competitive entry costs. So Melmar is a great example of that. Melmar, if you look at it, it's a very large four-way on the proven prolific trend. So we farmed in to a 35% working interest position on all 8 blocks covered by the structure. I think importantly, it's one of the last undrilled large Paleogene 4 ways in the trend and therefore has a very high chance of geologic success. The second thing about it, it's got a water depth of about 5,200 feet. Now that's compared to 7,900 feet at Great White. And so what that means is it has higher projected reservoir pressures compared to Great White. The development cost could be significantly lower given the shallower depth. And importantly, the property that porosity and permeability and deliverability are also going to be likely be the best in the trend. So when you look at the prospect, it was one of these really quality prospects that you get in at very low entry cost. So that's why we did it."

And so obviously, we are trying to attack the fixed cost in this low-price environment as well as the variable cost and making sure we get all the variable cost out as we reduce activity. So we have been seeing from let's just pick the Bakken on our cash cost per barrel, we've been seeing significant reductions like if you go back from the first quarter of 2014 or through the fourth quarter 2015, we've been seeing significant cost reductions on our cash cost per barrel. And you probably heard when I gave the 2016 guidance, we are giving guidance that our cash costs per barrel are going down in 2016, and that's with a reduction from 368,000 barrels a day pro forma production down to a 3 30 to 3 50. So we are trying to stay up with especially in this low oil price environment reducing fixed costs and variable cost. And so we are attacking both of them. As far as DD&A from our trajectory standpoint, you heard from our guidance actually our DD&A was going up in 2016, and that it's directly related to the reserves. So you heard the reserves are going down from the price revisions. So with those lower reserve amounts that's going to increase our DD&A as prices recover within those reserves come right back on the book. And so in a normal environment, what would be happening say in the Bakken is that as we continue to add reserves for our performance and additional drilling and know that we've got all the infrastructure spend kind of behind us, our DD& a would be going down over time.

In that $2.4 billion is approximately $200 million of exploration cash spend like seismic and G&A that's part of cash flow. So we have to fund capital expenditures of $2.2 billion.

We have a cash balance at the end of '15 of $2.7 billion. So effectively, we can fund our capital program and our dividend out of our cash balance and still have $200 million left over at the end of 2016. And obviously, we'd still have a revolver undrawn. So then with that $200 million left in the cash account, David, I am going to give you some work to do here because now you have to estimate what the cash flow from operations are going to be in 2016, and that depends on your commodity price assumption.

Now we don't have exactly what the budget will be for North Malay Basin next year as far as pure capital, but it will be considerably lower than the $375 million. But again, no matter what that number is, it will be generating free cash flow. So as you look to 2017, we will get an improvement of free cash flow just related to North Malay Basin of $375 million. And then again, you follow on that with Stampede, so you have $325 million this year not generating free cash flow. Again, we don't have the budget set for '17.

Also on the IP rates, you could see a similar sort of effect. I mean, the range we've given on IP rates is 800 to 950. And obviously, with the 50 stage fracs on the IP rates, you're going to be up there. One other point I want to make about the well cost in the Bakken, the well cost for the fourth quarter averaged $5.1 million per well, which is about a 28% reduction from the year ago and a 4% reduction from Q3. Again, that lean manufacturing machine just continuing to work. We said that we expect cost next year to be broadly flat at that $5 million to $5.1 million per well level. But of course, that math, the significant amount of ongoing improvement because embedded in that number of the 5 1 is a 40% increase in stage on. So we expect to fully offset that increase in cost due to the higher stage count with continued lean manufacturing gains. So again, a 20% uplift in production for basically the same cost is what you have this year. So obviously, that's going to be good for returns."

We're already seeing those benefits in Guyana with the rig rates that Exxon was able to get Guyana, also the seismic boat rates that they're able to get in Guyana. So you're starting to see some of that come through the value chain. But more to come on the offshore."

I just wanted to let you know, in our supplement that is being posted, we actually have the 2016 minimum volume commitment there. Maybe I can just walk you through that. From a processing standpoint, the '16 commitment is 186 at million [indiscernible] a day and the fourth quarter we were right at that 186. And as I mentioned earlier, we had unplanned downtime in the third quarter, we were up at 2 10 and the second quarter 2 0 2. Don't see any issues with that with the 2 rig program. From the pipeline standpoint, we gathered 50,000 barrels of oil per day and the commitment is 45 in '16. And gas gathering was 198 in the fourth quarter and the minimum is 189, do not see any issue there. So the one small thing that we may see and we think it's under $10 million say to us is going to be on our logistics on the rail. Because as we mentioned earlier, the economics now are favoring more to the pipeline but obviously that can change. So just from in the fourth quarter, our terminal throughput was 62,000 barrels of oil per day. The minimum volume commitment is 73,000. Back in the second quarter, we had 82,000 going through that terminal. But as far as the rail terminal crude loading, we were at 42,000 barrels a day. The minimum volume commitment is 38,000. And for rail real services, it's 43,000 barrels a day for the minimum volume commitment and the fourth quarter was at 43,000. So bottom line, we do not expect any real issues from the minimum volume standpoint and the buildout from the Hawkeye south of the river will begin to add throughput back into the system for us."

Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I will provide an update on the steps we are taking in response to the low oil price environment and review highlights from 2015.

I will provide an update on the steps we are taking in response to the low oil price environment and review highlights from 2015. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results. 
Three principles are guiding us through this lower-for-longer oil price environment: Preserve the strength of our balance sheet, preserve our operating capabilities and preserve our long-term growth options. By adhering to this disciplined approach, we finished the year with one of the strongest balance sheets and liquidity positions among our E&P peers, with $2.7 billion of cash and undrawn $4 billion revolving credit facility that goes out to January 2020 and a net debt to capitalization ratio excluding the Bakken Midstream joint venture of approximately 15%.
Our top priority in this challenging environment is to continue to keep our balance sheet strong. Yesterday, we announced a 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, 40% below our 2015 spend and approximately 20% below the preliminary guidance we provided in late October of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. Our focus is on value, not volume, and we do not think it makes sense to accelerate production in the current price environment, particularly given the recent further deterioration in the oil markets. For this reason, we will reduce activity levels across our producing portfolio in 2016, both onshore and offshore, and we'll continue to pursue further cost reductions to preserve the strength of our balance sheet.
Our 2016 production forecast remains the same as our previous guidance of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, even with the roughly $600 million of additional cuts in capital spend from our previous guidance and the recent sale of our assets in Algeria in December, which contributed net production of 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2015.
In terms of our year-end reserves, as a result of significant price-driven negative revisions and a corresponding reduction in activity levels, our proved reserves decreased year-over-year to 1.086 billion barrels of oil equivalent at year-end 2015. It is important to note that all of the decrease was in proved undeveloped category and that our proved developed producing reserves increased by approximately 4% versus 2014.
Now turning to our 2015 financial results. Our adjusted net loss was $1.1 billion and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $1.9 billion. Compared to 2014, our results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas sales volumes, which were more than offset by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher DD&A expense. 
From an operational standpoint, 2015 was a year of outstanding performance with strong execution across the portfolio and we are very proud of the work our team has done in a difficult oil price environment. Actual production was 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus our October guidance of 370,000 to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a pro forma basis, excluding Libya and asset sales, 2015 production increased by 18% compared to 2014, averaging 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus 311,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day the prior year on the same basis. 
Also, during 2015, we delivered significant reductions in both capital expenditures and cash operating costs and achieved early success with our focused exploration program.
Turning to the Bakken. Hess has an industry-leading acreage position that is competitive with the best shale oil plays in the United States. Through the application of lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team has continued to drill some of the lowest cost and most productive wells in the play. Our 2016 focus is on the core of the core where Hess has significantly more drilling spacing units or DSUs than any other competitor. Maintaining a 2-rig program will help preserve our top quartile operating capabilities so that we are positioned to efficiently increase activity when oil prices recover. Bakken production in 2015 averaged 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up approximately 35% from 2014. Despite dropping to 2 rigs, we continue to forecast Bakken production to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. 
On July 1, 2015, we closed on the Bakken Midstream joint venture, which resulted in total cash proceeds to Hess of $3 billion. Hess maintains operational control of these strategic assets, giving us access to the best markets for our products through the flexibility that it offers. As previously announced, the joint venture plans to proceed with an initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP common units when market conditions improve. 
In terms of developments, while we are significantly reducing investment across our base portfolio, we plan to continue to invest for future growth with 2 offshore developments. The first, North Malay Basin, is a long-life, low-risk natural gas resource with oil-linked pricing. Hess is operator with a 50% interest. Full field development is on track for startup in 2017 after which the project is expected to add an incremental 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production and become a long-term cash generator. 
Our second offshore development, Stampede, is one of the largest undeveloped fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with estimated gross recoverable resources of between 300 million and 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. Hess is the operator of Stampede and we have a 25% interest. Following startup in 2018, the project will add an incremental 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production and become a material cash generator.
Turning to explorations. We are very pleased with the early results from our focused exploration program namely, the Exxon-operated Liza discovery offshore Guyana, in which Hess has a 30% working interest, and the Chevron-operated Sicily discovery in the deep water Gulf of Mexico in which Hess has a 25% working interest. In particular, we believe that the Stabroek Block in Guyana has the potential to be very material to Hess and create significant long-term value for our shareholders even in a lower price environment. About 90% of a 17,000 square kilometer 3D seismic acquisition program has been completed. In 2016, we plan to drill up to 4 wells to evaluate the Liza discovery, perform a drill stem test and explore additional prospects on the block.
In summary, we are well positioned to navigate this lower-for-longer price environment and are taking a disciplined approach to: Preserve our financial strength, competitively advantage capabilities and long-term growth options. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."

I would like to provide an operational update on our progress in 2015 and our plans for 2016. As John mentioned, 2015 was a year of strong execution across our portfolio.

As John mentioned, 2015 was a year of strong execution across our portfolio. Production averaged 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the top end of our October guidance of 370,000 to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter, production averaged 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, exceeding our October guidance of 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the same quarter. 
In 2015, we also reduced capital and exploratory expenditures by $400 million during the year and cash operating cost by more than $300 million. We continue to drive down our drilling and completion costs and successfully conducted tighter spacing and increased stage count pilots in the Bakken. We also achieved material exploration success in Guyana and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where the Liza and Sicily wells were ranked as the 2 largest oil discoveries of 2015 by both Wood Mackenzie and IHS. 
Clearly, 2015 was a challenging year in terms of oil prices, and we believe it is prudent to manage the business, assuming that prices remain lower for longer. On that basis, we announced yesterday a 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, which is 40% below 2015 levels and will result in significant reductions in activity levels across our unconventionals and offshore business.
Year-end 2015 proved reserves were significantly impacted by the price environment, with the addition of 84 million barrels of oil equivalent offset by price-related downward revisions of 282 million barrels of oil equivalent. Year-end proved reserves accounting for the sale of our Algeria asset were 1.086 billion barrels of oil equivalent, of which 73% were proved developed. Nonetheless, the notable early success of our exploration program and continued technical advances in our unconventionals business have allowed us to materially grow our total resource base. 
In 2016, we forecast companywide production to average between 330,000 and 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This forecast is unchanged from preliminary guidance provided on our last quarterly conference call despite the further 20% reduction in our capital and exploratory expenditures. In the first quarter of 2016, we forecast companywide production to average between 340,000 and 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Turning to operations. The Bakken continues to deliver outstanding performance as well as higher upside. We exceeded our production targets; continued to substantially reduce our well cost through the continued application of the lean manufacturing techniques; significantly improved our well IP rates through the successful testing of 50-stage sliding sleeve fracs, an industry first in the Bakken; and increased our well inventory and estimated ultimate recovery through infilling to tighter spacing using a 9/8 configuration. Full year production in the Bakken averaged 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 35% above 2014 and above our guidance from the beginning of the year of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
 
In the fourth quarter, as a result of lower drilling activity, net production averaged 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 7% from the year-ago quarter. Lean manufacturing practices enabled us to once again significantly drive down our Bakken drilling and completion costs, with the fourth quarter averaging $5.1 million per well versus $7.1 million per well in the year-ago quarter, a reduction of 28%. Looking forward, we expect drilling and completion costs in 2016 to remain near this level even though we will increase stage counts by approximately 40% as we move from our standard 35-stage design to a 50-stage design. The 50-stage trials conducted in 2015 had been very successful, delivering more than a 20% average increase in IP 30, 60 and 90. Our tighter well spacing pilots in 2015 have also been successful. Results to date confirm that moving from 13 wells to 17 wells per DSU is value accretive in the core of the play, enabling us to add 200 new drilling locations to our inventory. Additional pilots will be required in the future to fully understand the applicability across all of our acreage, which, to some degree, will be a function of price. 
The combination of our successful infill pilot and overall stronger type curve performance has allowed us to increase our estimated ultimate recovery from the Bakken to $1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent from our previous estimate of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. 
Our industry-leading Bakken position continues to provide a forward well inventory that has one of the lowest breakevens in the play. However, in the current pricing environment, we believe it is prudent to reduce drilling until oil prices recover. With this in mind, in 2016, we intend to reduce our activity to 2 rigs at the end of February compared to an average of 8.5 rigs in 2015 and 17 rigs in 2014.
Our 2016 capital budget for the Bakken is $425 million, approximately a 70% reduction from 2015. We plan to drill approximately 50 wells and bring approximately 80 new wells online in 2016 compared to 219 new wells online in 2015. Despite this significant reduction in well activity, we forecast Bakken net production to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 and also in the first quarter of 2016.
Moving to the Utica. In 2015, the joint venture drilled 24 wells and brought 32 new wells on production. In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. Net production for the year in the Utica averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2014. 
In 2015, by applying the same lean manufacturing techniques that we used in the Bakken, we reduced drilling and completion costs by 30%, down to $9.6 million per well from $13.7 million per well in 2014. Despite the high quality of our acreage position and low 5% average royalty, the joint venture intends to lay down the 1 rig we have operating at the end of the first quarter of 2016 given the low natural gas and NGL prices and wide basin differentials. In 2016, we plan to drill 5 wells and bring 14 new wells online. Production is forecast to average between 20,000 and 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.
Turning to our offshore operations. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we commenced remediation work at our Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator. This work includes asset jobs at 2 wells and opening a sac subsurface safety valve at another well. The field produced approximately 20,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015, and we forecast that the remediation work will allow production to increase to approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2016. 
In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, production averaged 33,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. In response to low prices, the operator plans a very minimal amount of activity in 2016. full year net production is expected to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.
At the South Arne field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, we expect to complete the current phase of development drilling and release the rig at the end of the first quarter. Net production averaged 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015 and is expected to average approximately 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. 
In Equatorial Guinea, where we are operator with an 85% interest, we recently completed the acquisition of new 4D seismic. Processing of this seismic is underway and the early data indicates additional infill production and water injection well opportunities that can be pursued when oil prices recover. Net production averaged 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. Looking forward, production is expected to decline over 2016, reflecting a continuation of the drilling pause that has been in place since mid-2015. 
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, work continues on the booster compression project which is expected to be completed in the third quarter. Further drilling activity will not be required to meet contracted volumes for the next couple of years as a result of the compression project. Net production averaged 42,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015 and is expected to be approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016, reflecting planned downtime associated with the booster compression project and lower PSC entitlements due to lower capital expenditure. 
We continue to progress our North Malay Basin and Stampede developments, which remain on target to come on stream in 2017 and 2018, respectively. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, the first 2 wells of the development drilling campaign have reached total depth and are fully in line with pre-drill expectations. Net production averaged approximately 40 million cubic feet per day through the early production system in 2015 and is expected to stay at this level through 2016. Following completion of the full field development project in 2017, net production is planned to increase to 165 million cubic feet per day. 
At the Stampede development in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully completed installation of piles, started setting equipment on the top side and made good progress on the whole in 2015. Looking forward, in 2016, we aim to complete the top side's main deck, begin offshore installation to the whole block and install the subsea systems. Development drilling will commence in 2016 and first oil remains targeted for 2018.
Moving to exploration. In the Gulf of Mexico, following the success of the Sicily-1 discovery well, in which Hess holds a 25% interest, the operator Chevron has commenced drilling the Sicily-2 appraisal well to delineate a large 4-way closure in the outward Paleogene. The operator expects to reach target depth during the second quarter of 2016. 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, we are participating in a ConocoPhillips-operated prospect called Melmar in which Hess has a 35% interest. The lower price environment has enabled access to high-quality, longer-term offshore prospects at attractive entry costs. Melmar is a good example of this and fits well with our strategy. It is one of the last large Paleogene 4-way prospects in the prolific Perdido trend. Drilling operations began in December, and the operator expects to reach total depth in the second quarter of 2016. 
In Guyana, where the Liza-1 well accounted 295 feet of high-quality oil-bearing reservoir, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, is planning to evaluate the Liza discovery and test the further potential of the Stabroek Block, in which Hess has a 30% interest. The next well, Liza-2, is planned to spud later in the first quarter.
In closing, despite the challenging price environment, 2015 was a year of excellent execution and delivery across our business, which is a tribute to the outstanding people of Hess. Our strategy is to continue protecting our balance sheet while maintaining our core capabilities and growth options. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."
249841,321461103,921628,"Hess Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2015. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $396 million in the fourth quart",1146,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2015. 
Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $396 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $291 million in the third quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, the corporation incurred a net loss of $1,821,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a net loss of $279 million in the previous quarter. 
The fourth quarter results contained noncash charges of $1,359,000,000 resulting from the low commodity price environment, including the writeoff of our E&P segment goodwill of $1,098,000,000. The nontaxable goodwill charge was allocated in our financial results to U.S. and international operations. 
In addition, fourth quarter exploration expenses include $178 million after tax for the writeoff of previously capitalized gas wells in Ghana, 3 previously capitalized wells in Australia that are not included in the most recent development concept and the impairment of certain leasehold costs in the Gulf of Mexico. In the United States, we also recognized an impairment charge of $83 million after tax associated with our legacy conventional North Dakota assets. 
In connection with the sale of Hovensa's assets and completion of its bankruptcy, Hess agreed to assume obligations under the Hovensa pension plan and relinquish our rights to receive any proceeds from financing provided to Hovensa during bankruptcy in exchange for the release of all claims from the Virgin Islands government that were asserted against us. Our fourth quarter results include charges of $41 million after tax for the cost of the pension obligations amounts funded in the quarter and legal fees.
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred losses of $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $221 million in the third quarter of 2015. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the fourth quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2015 were as follows: Lower sales volumes reduced results by $46 million, lower realized selling prices reduced results by $33 million, higher exploration expenses reduced results by $21 million. All other items net to a reduction in results of $7 million for an overall reduction in fourth quarter adjusted results of $107 million. In the fourth quarter, our E&P operations were underlifted compared with production by approximately 1 million barrels, which did not have a material impact on fourth-quarter results. 
The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 38% for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a benefit of 47% in the third quarter. On an unadjusted basis, the fourth quarter effective tax rate reflects the fact that goodwill impairment charge did not have an associated tax benefit.
Turning to Midstream. Fourth-quarter net income of $11 million was down versus third quarter net income of $16 million, primarily due to lower volume throughput at the Tioga Gas Plant as a result of unplanned downtime and increased crude export via pipeline in response to market differentials. Bakken Midstream EBITDA, excluding the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $79 million in the previous quarter.
Turning to Corporate. After-tax Corporate and interest expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $86 million in the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter, including an increase of $401 million from changes in working capital, was $623 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $935 million. Net borrowings were $93 million. Common stock dividends paid were $72 million. Other net amounted to a use of cash of $6 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $297 million. 
Excluding amounts held in our Bakken Midstream joint venture, we had approximately $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015, compared to $3 billion at September 30, 2015. Total debt, excluding Bakken Midstream, was $5.9 billion at December 31, 2015, and our debt to capitalization ratio was 24.4%. In addition, we have a committed $4 billion revolving credit facility that is undrawn.
Turning to 2016 guidance. We project cash cost for E&P operations to be in the range of $15 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2016 and $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel for the full year 2016, down from 2015 cash cost of $15.69 per barrel. The first quarter cash costs include well work-over cost at the Tubular Bells Field. 
DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2016 is forecast to be $29 to $30 per barrel and $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel for the full year of 2016, up from 2015  DD&A of $28.14 per barrel. This results in projected total E&P unit operating cost of $44 to $46 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 and $43 to $45 per barrel for the full year of 2016 compared with 2015 E&P unit operating cost of $43.83 per barrel. 
The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $3.55 to $3.65 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2016 and $3.55 to $3.95 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2016, up from 2015 midstream tariffs of $3.28 per barrel. 
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs and items affecting comparability, are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $260 million to $280 million for the full year 2016, down from $338 million in 2015. 
The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 41% to 45% for the first quarter and full year of 2016 versus a benefit of 45% in 2015.
Turning to Midstream. In 2016, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter and in the range of $40 million to $50 million for the full year.
Turning to Corporate and interest. In 2016, we estimate Corporate expenses net of taxes to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million in the first quarter and in the range of $110 million to $120 million for the full year. We estimate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the first quarter of 2016 and in the range of $205 million to $215 million for the full year 2016. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So they're impacting what a normal run rate would be in the fourth quarter. So the first part of that in the E&P charges ar",322,"Sure. So in the fourth quarter, we did have some special charges in the fourth quarter and some of them do have a cash flow impact. So they're impacting what a normal run rate would be in the fourth quarter. So the first part of that in the E&P charges are for surplus materials and supplies just due to reduced drilling plans. So that was approximately $25 million in the quarter that was reducing cash flow that $221 million. And then also we had lower cost to market in the fourth quarter of approximately $40 million. So those 2 right there from a special charges aspect gets you about $65 million of kind of a nonrecurring impact in the quarter. And then there's a couple of other things. One, from the specials outside of E&P is for Hovensa. So part of the charge relates to the relinquishment of proceeds that we provided during bankruptcy, plus we had legal fees in there. So that was approximately $20 million in the quarter, again reducing cash flow from operations. And then on an operating standpoint, you probably saw, you noticed our exploration costs were up in the quarter. Just from a run rate standpoint, it was in line with our full year guidance. But in the fourth quarter, we had higher seismic, approximately $20 million to $25 million in the quarter. So again from a recurring type standpoint, it's just impacting that lower cash flow in the fourth quarter. And then the last thing, you heard, I did mention there was 1 million-barrel underlift. So even though that had from a results standpoint not much of an impact, it does have a cash flow impact in the quarter. And so you're ranging that $10 million to $15 million for that underlift. So all told, it's about $125 million when you add those numbers up, kind of reducing the cash flow from operations in the quarter."

So on Melmar, let me just open, Doug, with, of course, we are in a long term business and we need to both think about today and tomorrow. So and one of the things we're seeing is this low price environment has created a lot of opportunities to access very high quality longer-term growth options at very competitive entry costs. So Melmar is a great example of that. Melmar, if you look at it, it's a very large 4-way on the proven prolific Perdido trend. So we farmed in to a 35% working interest position on all 8 blocks covered by the structure. I think importantly, it's one of the last undrilled large Paleogene 4 ways in the Perdido trend and therefore has a very high chance of geologic success. The second thing about it, it's got a water depth of about 5,200 feet. Now that's compared to 7,900 feet at Great White. And so that -- what that means is it has higher projected reservoir pressures compared to Great White. The development cost could be significantly lower given the shallower depth. And importantly, the rock property, that porosity and permeability and deliverability are also going to be likely be the best in the Perdido trend. So when you look at the prospect, it was one of these really quality prospects that you get in at very low entry cost. So that's why we did it."

I think the third thing is, we're going to have increased gas and NGL capture in the plant as the Hawkeye South of the river system comes on in the third quarter of the year.

So the first one, you're focusing on the Bakken, but it does apply across the portfolio that we do have high -- I mean, there's a good amount of the costs that are fixed. And so obviously, we are trying to attack the fixed cost in this low-price environment as well as the variable cost and making sure we get all the variable cost out as we reduce activity. So we have been seeing from -- let's just pick the Bakken on our cash cost per barrel. We've been seeing significant reductions like if you go back from the first quarter of 2014  through the fourth quarter of 2015, we've been seeing significant cost reductions on our cash cost per barrel. And you probably heard when I gave the 2016 guidance, we are giving guidance that our cash costs per barrel are going down in 2016, and that's with a reduction from 368,000 barrels a day pro forma production down to a 330,000 to 350,000. So we are trying to stay up with, especially in this low oil price environment reducing fixed costs and variable cost. And so we are attacking both of them. As far as DD&A, from a trajectory standpoint, you heard from our guidance actually, our DD&A was going up in 2016, and that it's directly related to the reserves. So you heard the reserves are going down from the price revisions. So with those lower reserve amounts that's going to increase our DD&A as prices recover. Then those reserves will come right back on the book. And so in a normal environment, what would be happening, say, in the Bakken is that as we continue to add reserves through our performance and additional drilling and now that we've got all the infrastructure spend kind of behind us, our DD&A would be going down over time. As far as Stampede, and -- I'm going to hand it back to Greg for that."

And obviously, we're going to have cash flow from operations in 2016. So as we just released yesterday, you saw our capital spend program is estimated to be $2.4 billion in 2016. In that $2.4 billion is approximately $200 million of exploration cash spend like seismic and G&A that's part of cash flow. So we have to fund capital expenditures of $2.2 billion. And we have our dividend of approximately $285 million. Let me just round that to $300 million. So our capital and our dividend is going to be $2.5 billion in 2016. We have a cash balance at the end of '15 of $2.7 billion. So effectively, we can fund our capital program and our dividend out of our cash balance and still have $200 million left over at the end of 2016. And obviously, we'd still have the revolver undrawn. So then with that $200 million left in the cash account, David, I am going to give you some work to do here because now you have to estimate what the cash flow from operations are going to be in 2016, and that depends on your commodity price assumption. So we've given you the production guidance, the cash cost guidance and whatever cash flow from operations that you then come to, you can add to that $200 million, and that's where we'll sit.

Now we don't have exactly what the budget will be for North Malay Basin next year as far as pure capital, but it will be considerably lower than the $375 million.

And then, again, you'd follow on that with Stampede, so you have $325 million this year not generating free cash flow. Again, we don't have the budget set for '17.

Also on the IP rates, you could see a similar sort of effect. I mean, the range we've given on IP rates is 800 to 950. And obviously, with the 50-stage fracs on the IP rates, you're going to be up there. One other point I want to make about the well cost in the Bakken, the well cost for the fourth quarter averaged $5.1 million per well, which is about a 28% reduction from the year ago and a 4% reduction from Q3. Again, that lean manufacturing machine just continuing to work. We said that we expect cost next year to be broadly flat at that $5 million to $5.1 million per well level. But of course, that math, the significant amount of ongoing improvement because embedded in that number of the $5.1 million is a 40% increase in stage count. So we expect to fully offset that increase in cost due to the higher stage count with continued lean manufacturing gains. So again, a 20% uplift in production for basically the same cost is what you have this year. So obviously, that's going to be good for returns."

So we see that really opening up though. As rigs come off contract in the offshore, as yards become not at capacity, those costs are going to come down as well. It's just taking longer in the offshore because they're very busy. So I think if you are developing something in that time frame of 2017 or so, I think you really get the full benefit of that. We're already seeing those benefits in Guyana with the rig rates that Exxon was able to get in Guyana, also the seismic boat rates that they were able to get in Guyana.

I just wanted to let you know, in our supplement that is being posted, we actually have the 2016 minimum volume commitments there. Maybe I can just walk you through that. From a processing standpoint, the '16 commitment is 186 million scufs a day. In the fourth quarter, we were right at that 186. And as I mentioned earlier, we had unplanned downtime. In the third quarter, we were up at 210 and the second quarter 202. Don't see any issues with that with the 2-rig program. From the pipeline standpoint, we gathered 50,000 barrels of oil per day and the commitment is 45,000 in '16. And gas gathering was 198 in the fourth quarter and the minimum vol is 189. Do not see an issue there. So the one small thing that we may see and we think it's under $10 million, say, to us is going to be on our logistics on the rail. Because as we mentioned earlier, the economics now are favoring more to the pipeline, but obviously that can change. So just from -- in the fourth quarter, our terminal throughput was 62,000 barrels of oil per day. The minimum volume commitment is 73,000. Back in the second quarter, we had 82,000 going through that terminal. But as far as the rail terminal crude loading, we were at 42,000 barrels a day. The minimum volume commitment is 38,000. And for rail  services, it's 43,000 barrels a day for the minimum volume commitment and the fourth quarter was at 43,000. So bottom line, we do not expect any real issues from the minimum volume standpoint and the buildout from the Hawkeye south of the river will begin to add throughput back into the system for us."

Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I will provide an update on the steps we are taking in response to the low oil price environment and review highlights from 2015.

I will provide an update on the steps we are taking in response to the low oil price environment and review highlights from 2015. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results. 
Three principles are guiding us through this lower-for-longer oil price environment: Preserve the strength of our balance sheet, preserve our operating capabilities and preserve our long-term growth options. By adhering to this disciplined approach, we finished the year with one of the strongest balance sheets and liquidity positions among our E&P peers, with $2.7 billion of cash and undrawn $4 billion revolving credit facility that goes out to January 2020 and a net debt to capitalization ratio excluding the Bakken Midstream joint venture of approximately 15%.
Our top priority in this challenging environment is to continue to keep our balance sheet strong. Yesterday, we announced a 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, 40% below our 2015 spend and approximately 20% below the preliminary guidance we provided in late October of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. Our focus is on value, not volume, and we do not think it makes sense to accelerate production in the current price environment, particularly given the recent further deterioration in the oil markets. For this reason, we will reduce activity levels across our producing portfolio in 2016, both onshore and offshore, and we'll continue to pursue further cost reductions to preserve the strength of our balance sheet.
Our 2016 production forecast remains the same as our previous guidance of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, even with the roughly $600 million of additional cuts in capital spend from our previous guidance and the recent sale of our assets in Algeria in December, which contributed net production of 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2015.
In terms of our year-end reserves, as a result of significant price-driven negative revisions and a corresponding reduction in activity levels, our proved reserves decreased year-over-year to 1.086 billion barrels of oil equivalent at year-end 2015. It is important to note that all of the decrease was in proved undeveloped category and that our proved developed producing reserves increased by approximately 4% versus 2014.
Now turning to our 2015 financial results. Our adjusted net loss was $1.1 billion and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $1.9 billion. Compared to 2014, our results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas sales volumes, which were more than offset by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher DD&A expense. 
From an operational standpoint, 2015 was a year of outstanding performance with strong execution across the portfolio and we are very proud of the work our team has done in a difficult oil price environment. Actual production was 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus our October guidance of 370,000 to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a pro forma basis, excluding Libya and asset sales, 2015 production increased by 18% compared to 2014, averaging 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus 311,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day the prior year on the same basis. 
Also, during 2015, we delivered significant reductions in both capital expenditures and cash operating costs and achieved early success with our focused exploration program.
Turning to the Bakken. Hess has an industry-leading acreage position that is competitive with the best shale oil plays in the United States. Through the application of lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team has continued to drill some of the lowest cost and most productive wells in the play. Our 2016 focus is on the core of the core where Hess has significantly more drilling spacing units or DSUs than any other competitor. Maintaining a 2-rig program will help preserve our top quartile operating capabilities so that we are positioned to efficiently increase activity when oil prices recover. Bakken production in 2015 averaged 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up approximately 35% from 2014. Despite dropping to 2 rigs, we continue to forecast Bakken production to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. 
On July 1, 2015, we closed on the Bakken Midstream joint venture, which resulted in total cash proceeds to Hess of $3 billion. Hess maintains operational control of these strategic assets, giving us access to the best markets for our products through the flexibility that it offers. As previously announced, the joint venture plans to proceed with an initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP common units when market conditions improve. 
In terms of developments, while we are significantly reducing investment across our base portfolio, we plan to continue to invest for future growth with 2 offshore developments. The first, North Malay Basin, is a long-life, low-risk natural gas resource with oil-linked pricing. Hess is operator with a 50% interest. Full field development is on track for startup in 2017 after which the project is expected to add an incremental 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production and become a long-term cash generator. 
Our second offshore development, Stampede, is one of the largest undeveloped fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with estimated gross recoverable resources of between 300 million and 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. Hess is the operator of Stampede and we have a 25% interest. Following startup in 2018, the project will add an incremental 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production and become a material cash generator.
Turning to explorations. We are very pleased with the early results from our focused exploration program namely, the Exxon-operated Liza discovery offshore Guyana, in which Hess has a 30% working interest, and the Chevron-operated Sicily discovery in the deep water Gulf of Mexico in which Hess has a 25% working interest. In particular, we believe that the Stabroek Block in Guyana has the potential to be very material to Hess and create significant long-term value for our shareholders even in a lower price environment. About 90% of a 17,000 square kilometer 3D seismic acquisition program has been completed. In 2016, we plan to drill up to 4 wells to evaluate the Liza discovery, perform a drill stem test and explore additional prospects on the block.
In summary, we are well positioned to navigate this lower-for-longer price environment and are taking a disciplined approach to: Preserve our financial strength, competitively advantage capabilities and long-term growth options. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."
249841,321461103,921726,"Hess Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. I would like to provide an operational update on our progress in 2015 and our plans for 2016. As John mentioned, 2015 was a year of strong execution across our portfolio. Production averaged 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the",1917,"Thanks, John. I would like to provide an operational update on our progress in 2015 and our plans for 2016. 
As John mentioned, 2015 was a year of strong execution across our portfolio. Production averaged 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the top end of our October guidance of 370,000 to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter, production averaged 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, exceeding our October guidance of 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the same quarter. 
In 2015, we also reduced capital and exploratory expenditures by $400 million during the year and cash operating cost by more than $300 million. We continue to drive down our drilling and completion costs and successfully conducted tighter spacing and increased stage count pilots in the Bakken. We also achieved material exploration success in Guyana and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where the Liza and Sicily wells were ranked as the 2 largest oil discoveries of 2015 by both Wood Mackenzie and IHS. 
Clearly, 2015 was a challenging year in terms of oil prices, and we believe it is prudent to manage the business, assuming that prices remain lower for longer. On that basis, we announced yesterday a 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, which is 40% below 2015 levels and will result in significant reductions in activity levels across our unconventionals and offshore business.
Year-end 2015 proved reserves were significantly impacted by the price environment, with the addition of 84 million barrels of oil equivalent offset by price-related downward revisions of 282 million barrels of oil equivalent. Year-end proved reserves accounting for the sale of our Algeria asset were 1.086 billion barrels of oil equivalent, of which 73% were proved developed. Nonetheless, the notable early success of our exploration program and continued technical advances in our unconventionals business have allowed us to materially grow our total resource base. 
In 2016, we forecast companywide production to average between 330,000 and 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This forecast is unchanged from preliminary guidance provided on our last quarterly conference call despite the further 20% reduction in our capital and exploratory expenditures. In the first quarter of 2016, we forecast companywide production to average between 340,000 and 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Turning to operations. The Bakken continues to deliver outstanding performance as well as higher upside. We exceeded our production targets; continued to substantially reduce our well cost through the continued application of the lean manufacturing techniques; significantly improved our well IP rates through the successful testing of 50-stage sliding sleeve fracs, an industry first in the Bakken; and increased our well inventory and estimated ultimate recovery through infilling to tighter spacing using a 9/8 configuration. Full year production in the Bakken averaged 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 35% above 2014 and above our guidance from the beginning of the year of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
 
In the fourth quarter, as a result of lower drilling activity, net production averaged 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 7% from the year-ago quarter. Lean manufacturing practices enabled us to once again significantly drive down our Bakken drilling and completion costs, with the fourth quarter averaging $5.1 million per well versus $7.1 million per well in the year-ago quarter, a reduction of 28%. Looking forward, we expect drilling and completion costs in 2016 to remain near this level even though we will increase stage counts by approximately 40% as we move from our standard 35-stage design to a 50-stage design. The 50-stage trials conducted in 2015 had been very successful, delivering more than a 20% average increase in IP 30, 60 and 90. Our tighter well spacing pilots in 2015 have also been successful. Results to date confirm that moving from 13 wells to 17 wells per DSU is value accretive in the core of the play, enabling us to add 200 new drilling locations to our inventory. Additional pilots will be required in the future to fully understand the applicability across all of our acreage, which, to some degree, will be a function of price. 
The combination of our successful infill pilot and overall stronger type curve performance has allowed us to increase our estimated ultimate recovery from the Bakken to $1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent from our previous estimate of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. 
Our industry-leading Bakken position continues to provide a forward well inventory that has one of the lowest breakevens in the play. However, in the current pricing environment, we believe it is prudent to reduce drilling until oil prices recover. With this in mind, in 2016, we intend to reduce our activity to 2 rigs at the end of February compared to an average of 8.5 rigs in 2015 and 17 rigs in 2014.
Our 2016 capital budget for the Bakken is $425 million, approximately a 70% reduction from 2015. We plan to drill approximately 50 wells and bring approximately 80 new wells online in 2016 compared to 219 new wells online in 2015. Despite this significant reduction in well activity, we forecast Bakken net production to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 and also in the first quarter of 2016.
Moving to the Utica. In 2015, the joint venture drilled 24 wells and brought 32 new wells on production. In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. Net production for the year in the Utica averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2014. 
In 2015, by applying the same lean manufacturing techniques that we used in the Bakken, we reduced drilling and completion costs by 30%, down to $9.6 million per well from $13.7 million per well in 2014. Despite the high quality of our acreage position and low 5% average royalty, the joint venture intends to lay down the 1 rig we have operating at the end of the first quarter of 2016 given the low natural gas and NGL prices and wide basin differentials. In 2016, we plan to drill 5 wells and bring 14 new wells online. Production is forecast to average between 20,000 and 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.
Turning to our offshore operations. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we commenced remediation work at our Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator. This work includes asset jobs at 2 wells and opening a stuck subsurface safety valve at another well. The field produced approximately 20,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015, and we forecast that the remediation work will allow production to increase to approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2016. 
In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, production averaged 33,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. In response to low prices, the operator plans a very minimal amount of activity in 2016. Full year net production is expected to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.
At the South Arne field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, we expect to complete the current phase of development drilling and release the rig at the end of the first quarter. Net production averaged 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015 and is expected to average approximately 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. 
In Equatorial Guinea, where we are operator with an 85% interest, we recently completed the acquisition of new 4D seismic. Processing of this seismic is underway and the early data indicates additional infill production and water injection well opportunities that can be pursued when oil prices recover. Net production averaged 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. Looking forward, production is expected to decline over 2016, reflecting a continuation of the drilling pause that has been in place since mid-2015. 
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, work continues on the booster compression project which is expected to be completed in the third quarter. Further drilling activity will not be required to meet contracted volumes for the next couple of years as a result of the compression project. Net production averaged 42,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015 and is expected to be approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016, reflecting planned downtime associated with the booster compression project and lower PSC entitlements due to lower capital expenditure. 
We continue to progress our North Malay Basin and Stampede developments, which remain on target to come on stream in 2017 and 2018, respectively. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, the first 2 wells of the development drilling campaign have reached total depth and are fully in line with pre-drill expectations. Net production averaged approximately 40 million cubic feet per day through the early production system in 2015 and is expected to stay at this level through 2016. Following completion of the full field development project in 2017, net production is planned to increase to 165 million cubic feet per day. 
At the Stampede development in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully completed installation of piles, started setting equipment on the top side and made good progress on the whole in 2015. Looking forward, in 2016, we aim to complete the top side's main deck, begin offshore installation to the whole block and install the subsea systems. Development drilling will commence in 2016 and first oil remains targeted for 2018.
Moving to exploration. In the Gulf of Mexico, following the success of the Sicily-1 discovery well, in which Hess holds a 25% interest, the operator Chevron has commenced drilling the Sicily-2 appraisal well to delineate a large 4-way closure in the outward Paleogene. The operator expects to reach target depth during the second quarter of 2016. 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, we are participating in a ConocoPhillips-operated prospect called Melmar in which Hess has a 35% interest. The lower price environment has enabled access to high-quality, longer-term offshore prospects at attractive entry costs. Melmar is a good example of this and fits well with our strategy. It is one of the last large Paleogene 4-way prospects in the prolific Perdido trend. Drilling operations began in December, and the operator expects to reach total depth in the second quarter of 2016. 
In Guyana, where the Liza-1 well accounted 295 feet of high-quality oil-bearing reservoir, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, is planning to evaluate the Liza discovery and test the further potential of the Stabroek Block, in which Hess has a 30% interest. The next well, Liza-2, is planned to spud later in the first quarter.
In closing, despite the challenging price environment, 2015 was a year of excellent execution and delivery across our business, which is a tribute to the outstanding people of Hess. Our strategy is to continue protecting our balance sheet while maintaining our core capabilities and growth options. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2015. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $396 million in the fourth quart",1146,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2015. 
Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $396 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $291 million in the third quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, the corporation incurred a net loss of $1,821,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a net loss of $279 million in the previous quarter. 
The fourth quarter results contained noncash charges of $1,359,000,000 resulting from the low commodity price environment, including the writeoff of our E&P segment goodwill of $1,098,000,000. The nontaxable goodwill charge was allocated in our financial results to U.S. and international operations. 
In addition, fourth quarter exploration expenses include $178 million after tax for the writeoff of previously capitalized gas wells in Ghana, 3 previously capitalized wells in Australia that are not included in the most recent development concept and the impairment of certain leasehold costs in the Gulf of Mexico. In the United States, we also recognized an impairment charge of $83 million after tax associated with our legacy conventional North Dakota assets. 
In connection with the sale of Hovensa's assets and completion of its bankruptcy, Hess agreed to assume obligations under the Hovensa pension plan and relinquish our rights to receive any proceeds from financing provided to Hovensa during bankruptcy in exchange for the release of all claims from the Virgin Islands government that were asserted against us. Our fourth quarter results include charges of $41 million after tax for the cost of the pension obligations, amounts funded in the quarter and legal fees.
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred losses of $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $221 million in the third quarter of 2015. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the fourth quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2015 were as follows: Lower sales volumes reduced results by $46 million, lower realized selling prices reduced results by $33 million, higher exploration expenses reduced results by $21 million. All other items net to a reduction in results of $7 million for an overall reduction in fourth quarter adjusted results of $107 million. In the fourth quarter, our E&P operations were underlifted compared with production by approximately 1 million barrels, which did not have a material impact on fourth-quarter results. 
The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 38% for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a benefit of 47% in the third quarter. On an unadjusted basis, the fourth quarter effective tax rate reflects the fact that goodwill impairment charge did not have an associated tax benefit.
Turning to Midstream. Fourth-quarter net income of $11 million was down versus third quarter net income of $16 million, primarily due to lower volume throughput at the Tioga Gas Plant as a result of unplanned downtime and increased crude export via pipeline in response to market differentials. Bakken Midstream EBITDA, excluding the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $79 million in the previous quarter.
Turning to Corporate. After-tax Corporate and interest expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $86 million in the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter, including an increase of $401 million from changes in working capital, was $623 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $935 million. Net borrowings were $93 million. Common stock dividends paid were $72 million. Other net amounted to a use of cash of $6 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $297 million. 
Excluding amounts held in our Bakken Midstream joint venture, we had approximately $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015, compared to $3 billion at September 30, 2015. Total debt, excluding Bakken Midstream, was $5.9 billion at December 31, 2015, and our debt to capitalization ratio was 24.4%. In addition, we have a committed $4 billion revolving credit facility that is undrawn.
Turning to 2016 guidance. We project cash cost for E&P operations to be in the range of $15 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2016 and $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel for the full year 2016, down from 2015 cash cost of $15.69 per barrel. The first quarter cash costs include well work-over cost at the Tubular Bells Field. 
DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2016 is forecast to be $29 to $30 per barrel and $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel for the full year of 2016, up from 2015  DD&A of $28.14 per barrel. This results in projected total E&P unit operating cost of $44 to $46 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 and $43 to $45 per barrel for the full year of 2016 compared with 2015 E&P unit operating cost of $43.83 per barrel. 
The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $3.55 to $3.65 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2016 and $3.55 to $3.95 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2016, up from 2015 midstream tariffs of $3.28 per barrel. 
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs and items affecting comparability, are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $260 million to $280 million for the full year 2016, down from $338 million in 2015. 
The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 41% to 45% for the first quarter and full year of 2016 versus a benefit of 45% in 2015.
Turning to Midstream. In 2016, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter and in the range of $40 million to $50 million for the full year.
Turning to Corporate and interest. In 2016, we estimate Corporate expenses net of taxes to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million in the first quarter and in the range of $110 million to $120 million for the full year. We estimate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the first quarter of 2016 and in the range of $205 million to $215 million for the full year 2016. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So in the fourth quarter, we did have some special charges in the fourth quarter and some of them do have a cash flow impact. So they're impacting what a normal run rate would be in the fourth quarter. So the first part of that in the E&P charges are for surplus materials and supplies just due to reduced drilling plans. So that was approximately $25 million in the quarter that was reducing cash flow that $221 million. And then also we had lower cost of market in the fourth quarter of approximately $40 million. So those 2 right there from a special charges aspect gets you about $65 million of kind of a nonrecurring impact in the quarter. And then there's a couple of other things. One, from the specials outside of E&P is for Hovensa. So part of the charge relates to the relinquishment of proceeds that we provided during bankruptcy, plus we had legal fees in there. So that was approximately $20 million in the quarter, again reducing cash flow from operations. And then on an operating standpoint, you probably saw, you noticed our exploration costs were up in the quarter. Just from a run rate standpoint, it was in line with our full year guidance. But in the fourth quarter, we had higher seismic, approximately $20 million to $25 million in the quarter. So again from a recurring type standpoint, it's just impacting that lower cash flow in the fourth quarter. And then the last thing, you heard, I did mention there was 1 million-barrel underlift. So even though that had from a results standpoint not much of an impact, it does have a cash flow impact in the quarter. And so you're ranging that $10 million to $15 million for that underlift. So all told, it's about $125 million when you add those numbers up, kind of reducing the cash flow from operations in the quarter."

So on Melmar, let me just open, Doug, with, of course, we are in a long term business and we need to both think about today and tomorrow. So and one of the things we're seeing is this low price environment has created a lot of opportunities to access very high quality longer-term growth options at very competitive entry costs. So Melmar is a great example of that. Melmar, if you look at it, it's a very large 4-way on the proven prolific Perdido trend. So we farmed in to a 35% working interest position on all 8 blocks covered by the structure. I think importantly, it's one of the last undrilled large Paleogene 4 ways in the Perdido trend and therefore has a very high chance of geologic success. The second thing about it, it's got a water depth of about 5,200 feet. Now that's compared to 7,900 feet at Great White. And so that -- what that means is it has higher projected reservoir pressures compared to Great White. The development cost could be significantly lower given the shallower depth. And importantly, the rock property, that porosity and permeability and deliverability are also going to be likely be the best in the Perdido trend. So when you look at the prospect, it was one of these really quality prospects that you get in at very low entry cost. So that's why we did it."

So the first one, you're focusing on the Bakken, but it does apply across the portfolio that we do have high -- I mean, there's a good amount of the costs that are fixed. And so obviously, we are trying to attack the fixed cost in this low-price environment as well as the variable cost and making sure we get all the variable cost out as we reduce activity. So we have been seeing from -- let's just pick the Bakken on our cash cost per barrel. We've been seeing significant reductions like if you go back from the first quarter of 2014 through the fourth quarter of 2015, we've been seeing significant cost reductions on our cash cost per barrel. And you probably heard when I gave the 2016 guidance, we are giving guidance that our cash costs per barrel are going down in 2016, and that's with a reduction from 368,000 barrels a day pro forma production down to our 330,000 to 350,000. So we are trying to stay up with, especially in this low oil price environment, reducing fixed costs and variable cost. And so we are attacking both of them. As far as DD&A, from a trajectory standpoint, you heard from our guidance actually, our DD&A was going up in 2016, and that it's directly related to the reserves. So you heard the reserves are going down from the price revisions. So with those lower reserve amounts, that's going to increase our DD&A. As prices recover, then those reserves will come right back on the book. And so in a normal environment, what would be happening, say, in the Bakken is that as we continue to add reserves through our performance and additional drilling and now that we've got all the infrastructure spend kind of behind us, our DD&A would be going down over time. As far as Stampede, and -- I'm going to hand it back to Greg for that."

And obviously, we're going to have cash flow from operations in 2016. So as we just released yesterday, you saw our capital spend program is estimated to be $2.4 billion in 2016. In that $2.4 billion is approximately $200 million of exploration cash spend like seismic and G&A that's part of cash flow. So we have to fund capital expenditures of $2.2 billion. And we have our dividend of approximately $285 million. Let me just round that to $300 million. So our capital and our dividend is going to be $2.5 billion in 2016. We have a cash balance at the end of '15 of $2.7 billion. So effectively, we can fund our capital program and our dividend out of our cash balance and still have $200 million left over at the end of 2016. And obviously, we'd still have the revolver undrawn. So then with that $200 million left in the cash account, David, I am going to give you some work to do here because now you have to estimate what the cash flow from operations are going to be in 2016, and that depends on your commodity price assumption. So we've given you the production guidance, the cash cost guidance and whatever cash flow from operations that you then come to, you can add to that $200 million, and that's where we'll sit. So we're in a good liquidity position coming into this year, and I think that's how you have to look at 2016."

So in 2017, North Malay Basin will be coming online. So we have $375 million in the budget this year that is essentially reducing our free cash flow by that $375 million. Now we don't have exactly what the budget will be for North Malay Basin next year as far as pure capital, but it will be considerably lower than the $375 million. But again, no matter what that number is, it will be generating free cash flow. So as you look to 2017, we will get an improvement of free cash flow just related to North Malay Basin of $375 million. And then, again, you'd follow on that with Stampede, so you have $325 million this year not generating free cash flow. Again, we don't have the budget set for '17. I don't expect it to be that different in '17 as you move forward with Stampede. And so it won't be until '18 that you'll turn around that $325 million of free cash flow."

And as we drill on the core of the core next year and do the 50-stage fracs, we expect to be in the high 600 to the mid-700 range. So you're seeing that uplift. Also on the IP rates, you could see a similar sort of effect. I mean, the range we've given on IP rates is 800 to 950. And obviously, with the 50-stage fracs on the IP rates, you're going to be up there. One other point I want to make about the well cost in the Bakken, the well cost for the fourth quarter averaged $5.1 million per well, which is about a 28% reduction from the year ago and a 4% reduction from Q3. Again, that lean manufacturing machine just continuing to work. We said that we expect cost next year to be broadly flat at that $5 million to $5.1 million per well level. But of course, that math, the significant amount of ongoing improvement because embedded in that number of the $5.1 million is a 40% increase in stage count. So we expect to fully offset that increase in cost due to the higher stage count with continued lean manufacturing gains. So again, a 20% uplift in production for basically the same cost is what you have this year. So obviously, that's going to be good for returns."

I mean if you look at cost reductions, if you look at the onshore, I would say the progression of cost reductions in the onshore has been much more rapid than the offshore. For very practical reasons, the offshore fleet, there's still a lot of rigs on contract at relatively high prices. The yards are full, still full, as you kind of look around the globe. So we see that really opening up though. As rigs come off contract in the offshore, as yards become not at capacity, those costs are going to come down as well. It's just taking longer in the offshore because they're very busy. So I think if you are developing something in that time frame of 2017 or so, I think you really get the full benefit of that. We're already seeing those benefits in Guyana with the rig rates that Exxon was able to get in Guyana, also the seismic boat rates that they were able to get in Guyana. So you're starting to see some of that come through the value chain. But more to come on the offshore."

I just wanted to let you know, in our supplement that is being posted, we actually have the 2016 minimum volume commitments there. Maybe I can just walk you through that. From a processing standpoint, the '16 commitment is 186 million scufs a day. In the fourth quarter, we were right at that 186. And as I mentioned earlier, we had unplanned downtime. In the third quarter, we were up at 210 and the second quarter 202. Don't see any issues with that with the 2-rig program. From the pipeline standpoint, we gathered 50,000 barrels of oil per day and the commitment is 45,000 in '16. And gas gathering was 198 in the fourth quarter and the minimum vol is 189. Do not see an issue there. So the one small thing that we may see and we think it's under $10 million, say, to us is going to be on our logistics on the rail. Because as we mentioned earlier, the economics now are favoring more to the pipeline, but obviously that can change. So just from -- in the fourth quarter, our terminal throughput was 62,000 barrels of oil per day. The minimum volume commitment is 73,000. Back in the second quarter, we had 82,000 going through that terminal. But as far as the rail terminal crude loading, we were at 42,000 barrels a day. The minimum volume commitment is 38,000. And for rail services, it's 43,000 barrels a day for the minimum volume commitment and the fourth quarter was at 43,000. So bottom line, we do not expect any real issues from the minimum volume standpoint and the buildout from the Hawkeye south of the river will begin to add throughput back into the system for us."

I will provide an update on the steps we are taking to manage in the low price oil price environment and review some of the highlights from the quarter. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results. 
Our strategy in this lower-for-longer price environment is guided by 3 principles: Preserve our balance sheet, preserve our operating capabilities and preserve our growth options. 
To preserve our balance sheet, on February 4, we successfully executed a capital raise of $1.6 billion through common and mandatory convertible preferred stock offerings. These proceeds will keep our strong balance sheet strong in the low oil price environment and provide the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our growth projects, north Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and exploration offshore Guyana. 
Further to preserving the strength of our balance sheet, in January, we announced our 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, 40% below 2015 levels. Our focus remains on value, not volume, and we do not believe that accelerating production in the current oil price environment makes sense. Rather, we have reduced activity levels across our producing portfolio, both onshore and offshore. Our Bakken rig count will be reduced from 3 rigs currently to 2 rigs during the third quarter and is expected to remain at this level until the WTI price is closer to $60 per barrel. In the Utica, our 1 drilling rig was released in March and no further drilling is planned this year. Offshore, we continue the drilling break in Norway and Equatorial Guinea and the rig at Sourth Arne in Denmark is set to be released in the second quarter.
In terms of our operating capabilities, we are delivering industry-leading performance, as confirmed by third-party benchmarks, both in unconventionals and offshore drilling and development. Our resilient portfolio is linked to our top quartile operating capabilities and is balanced between unconventionals and offshore, providing an attractive mix of short cycle and long cycle investment opportunities. This balanced portfolio also casts a wider net for future long-term growth options. 
Our portfolio is leveraged to oil and liquids, with industry-leading cash margins and advantaged tax positions in the U.S. and Norway that will accelerate cash flow growth as oil prices improve. 
In terms of our growth opportunities we have, leading positions in the Bakken and Utica shale plays; new field startups North Malay Basin and Stampede, which, combined, are expected to add 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of new production over the next 2 years and, by 2018, will become material cash generators; and recent exploration success in Guyana that has the potential to provide significant long-term value creation and growth.
Turning to our financial results. In the first quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $509 million or $1.72 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $0.98 per share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher exploration expense, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower cash costs and DD&A.
While low crude oil prices significantly impacted our first quarter financial results, we delivered strong operational performance. Net production was at the high end of our guidance range, averaging 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to net production of 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter pro forma for last year's sale of our assets in Algeria. Net production from the Bakken averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2016, above our guidance range. Our Bakken team reduced drilling and completion costs 25% from the year-ago quarter to an average of $5.1 million per well.
In summary, with our strong balance sheet, oil-leveraged portfolio and attractive growth opportunities, we believe the company is well positioned to deliver strong cash flow growth and long-term value as oil prices recover. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update"

I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. Starting with production. In the first quarter, we averaged 350,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the top end of our guidance ran",1396,"Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. 
Starting with production. In the first quarter, we averaged 350,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the top end of our guidance range of 340,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and, once again, reflecting strong operating performance across our portfolio. In the second quarter, we expect net production to average between 320,000 and 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime at Valhall and several of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. As usual, we will provide an update to our full year production guidance on our midyear call in July.
Turning to operations and beginning with the Bakken. Our lean manufacturing approach has once again enabled us to deliver outstanding performance from one of the best core of the core positions in the play where we retain a substantial drilling inventory with attractive economics even at current prices. Despite reducing our Bakken rig count to an average of 4 rigs in the first quarter 2016 from 12 rigs in the year-ago quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter compared to 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. 
During the first quarter, we drilled 19 wells and brought 31 new wells online. This compares to the year-ago quarter when we drilled 60 wells and brought 70 wells online. We currently plan to maintain a 3-rig program through the second quarter, to release 1 rig during the third quarter and operate 2 rigs for the remainder of the year.
In 2016, we now expect to drill 62 wells and bring 87 new wells online. This compares to last year when we drilled 182 wells and brought 219 wells online. 
In the first quarter, our average drilling and completion costs is $5.1 million per well. We expect to be able to maintain this cost level over 2016 even as we transition from our previous 35-stage completion design to our new standard 50-stage completion design. This higher stage count is expected to deliver a 15% to 20% increase in initial production rates. And with our rigs focused in the core of the play, we expect our estimated ultimate recovery per well to move toward 1 million barrels of oil equivalent in the latter part of 2016. We also continue to successfully execute our 17 well per DSU spacing pilots and still see the majority of the wells performing in line with type curves and with minimal interference. The combination of both higher overall type curve performance and higher density well spacing has allowed us to increase our estimated ultimate recovery from the Bakken from our previous estimate of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. For the second quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average between 100,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Moving to the Utica. In the first quarter, the joint venture drilled 6 wells and brought 9 wells on production. Net production for the first quarter averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica acreage is largely held by production, which allows us to reduce activity in the short term while preserving optionality and longer-term upside. While we benefit from our acreage being in the core of the play in a low 5% [indiscernible], we released the 1 rig we had operating in the play in early March. As a result of applying our distinctive lean manufacturing approach, over the past several years we have been able to reduce our drilling cost per foot by approximately 75% and our completion cost per stage by approximately 50% while at the same time drilling some of the longest laterals in the play. 
We plan to run the assets for cash in 2016 and to resume drilling following a sustained recovery in commodity prices and further third-party infrastructure buildout, which will reduce the currently wide basin differentials.
Now turning to the offshore. At the Tubular Bells Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, net production averaged 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. During the quarter, we conducted the remediation work highlighted in our fourth quarter call, completing asset jobs at 2 wells. We are now moving the rig to replace a defective subsurface valve that failed to open. This is the second failure of this type in the field, and we are working with the supplier to understand the root causes of the manufacturing feedback.
In the second quarter, we have an extended shutdown scheduled to tie back nobles Gunflint field to the William zone host facility, and we plan to spud a fifth producing well in the field. 
In early April, we also completed our first water injection well, and we expect to commence injection in the third quarter.
In Norway, at BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. The operator plans to commence an extended shutdown in the second quarter due to required maintenance work at the ConocoPhillips operated Ekofisk field. 
At the South Arne Field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, we have completed the current phase of development drilling and do not plan to drill any additional wells in 2016. Net production averaged 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter.
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, work continues on the booster compression project, which remains on schedule for completion in the third quarter. Net production averaged 230 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter.
Moving to developments. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, progress continues on full field development. 6 out of 11 developed wells have now been drilled, and drilling results to date are better than expected. Net production from the Early Production System averaged 30 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter. Following completion of full field development in 2017, net production is planned to increase to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day. 
At the Stampede development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully floated the top sites main deck onto the production deck, set the whole structure into the offshore floating dock and installed the oil export line. Drilling operations are underway on the first production well, and first oil remains on schedule for 2018.
Moving to exploration. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Chevron-operated Sicily-2 well, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest, reached its target depth and results are currently being evaluated. 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the ConocoPhillips-operated Melmar well, in which Hess has a 35% working interest, reached target depth in the early April and logging operations are now complete. The well results are still being evaluated, but as noncommercial quantities of oil were encountered at the current location, the well was expensed in the quarter. 
In Guyana, in the Stabroek Block, in which Hess holds a 30% interest, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, spud the Liza #2 well in February. This well is designed to further evaluate the significant Liza oil discovery and will include an extended drill steam test. We expect the operator to complete operations on the Liza-2 well late in the second quarter. Following the Liza-2 well, the operator intends to move the rig to test a separate prospect located approximately 25 miles Northwest of Liza. We remain excited about the opportunity set on this block, which we believe could be material to our company.
In closing, we have maintained excellent execution and delivery across our portfolio. We believe that our focus on preserving the strength of our balance sheet, while also preserving our top quartile capabilities and growth options, is the right strategy. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, we reported a net loss of $509 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $396 million in the previo",729,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
In the first quarter of 2016, we reported a net loss of $509 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $396 million in the previous quarter that excludes a net charge of $1,425,000,000.
Turning to exploration and production. E&P incurred a net loss of $451 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to an adjusted net loss of $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. That excludes net charges totaling $1,385,000,000. 
The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 were as follows: Lower realized selling prices reduced results by $187 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $4 million. Lower cash operating costs improved results by $28 million. Lowe DD&A expense improved results by $71 million. Higher exploration expenses reduced results by $18 million. All other items net to a decrease in results of $13 million for an overall increase in the first quarter net loss of $123 million.
In the first quarter, our E&P operations were overlifted compared with production by approximately 500,000 barrels which did not have a material impact on first quarter results. 
The E&P effective income tax rate was a benefit of 41% for the first quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 38% in the fourth quarter, excluding items affecting comparability.
Turning to midstream. First quarter net income of $14 million increased from $11 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to lower operating costs. Bakken Midstream EBITDA, excluding the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $70 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $67 million in the previous quarter.
Turning to Corporate and interest. After-tax Corporate and interest expenses were $72 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, which excludes net charges totaling $32 million. The reduction resulted from lower professional fees and general and administrative costs.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $148 million. A net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $208 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $620 million. Net debt repayments were $12 million. Net proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock were $1,644,000,000. Common stock dividends paid were $80 million. Other net amounted to a use of cash of $31 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $841 million.
Turning to our financial position. We had approximately $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2016 and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities of approximately $8.3 billion. Excluding Bakken Midstream, total debt was $5.9 billion at March of 31, 2016, and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 23.1%.
Now turning to second quarter guidance. For E&P, we project cash cost for E&P operations to be in the range of $16.50 to $17.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, reflecting lower production and higher maintenance costs from the planned offshore facility shutdowns. 
DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent is forecast to be $26.50 to $27.50 per barrel, resulting in projected total E&P unit operating cost of $43 to $45 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016.
The Bakken midstream tariff expense is expected to be $3.75 to $3.85 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter of 2016, while exploration expenses, excluding dry-hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million. 
The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the second quarter. 
For Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the second quarter. 
For Corporate and interest, we expect Corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, and interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the second quarter of 2016. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

We actually lifted about 89,000 barrels a day in January and 130,000 barrels a day in February. And March liftings were only 19,000. So obviously, we lifted more just timing wise when oil prices were lower in the quarter. And so that had an impact on our differentials.

So obviously, we want to improve returns for our shareholders. The next aspect of it is, we are spending money on growth right now. You know North Malay Basin and Stampede, so we will have 35,000 barrels a day coming in 2018 from those 2 projects. And like you said, we've already added some valuable resources here in Guyana, and we're going to continue exploration there and see if we can add more valuable resources there. Then it comes to the last part of your point was, we do look at overall corporate cash flow and we want to deliver growth with free cash flow and at $60 Bakken, we can add rigs and Bakken will grow and generate free cash flow. So that is something that we are looking to do from the portfolio aspect. And then with our balance sheet with this low point in the cycle, we want to come out of that low point in the cycle with a strong balance sheet.

And certainly, directionally, that mimics what is going to happen in the production curve. So it's going to start out high and then end the year probably close to the end of that -- the bottom end of that range.

Now on the flip side, Greg just mentioned that we have some extended shutdowns that were not part of our original plan.

But broadly, the pace of the cost reductions has been slower in offshore than onshore due to the need to work off the backlog of those higher cost rig contracts and also the work in the yards associated with previously sanctioned projects. So now rigs both and associated equipment are already starting to come down substantially, and we know that because we're seeing a lot of those benefits in Guyana, for example, on the rig rates in the seismic boat rates. And then we expect that to continue as offshore projects are completed. So we think further rig cost capitulation will occur. And then importantly, the yard rates will start to come down as well as capacity becomes available. So and in fact, in some of our pre-FEED work that we're doing around, we are already seeing significantly lower indicative bid in the offshore yard and Greg space. So more to come in the offshore. But again, restart, I think it's going to be back to what John Rielly said, is going to be a function of corporate cash flow."

I will provide an update on the steps we are taking to manage in the low price oil price environment and review some of the highlights from the quarter. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results. 
Our strategy in this lower-for-longer price environment is guided by 3 principles: Preserve our balance sheet, preserve our operating capabilities and preserve our growth options. 
To preserve our balance sheet, on February 4, we successfully executed a capital raise of $1.6 billion through common and mandatory convertible preferred stock offerings. These proceeds will keep our strong balance sheet strong in the low oil price environment and provide the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our growth projects: North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and exploration offshore Guyana. 
Further to preserving the strength of our balance sheet, in January, we announced our 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, 40% below 2015 levels. Our focus remains on value, not volume, and we do not believe that accelerating production in the current oil price environment makes sense. Rather, we have reduced activity levels across our producing portfolio, both onshore and offshore. Our Bakken rig count will be reduced from 3 rigs currently to 2 rigs during the third quarter and is expected to remain at this level until the WTI price is closer to $60 per barrel. In the Utica, our 1 drilling rig was released in March and no further drilling is planned this year. Offshore, we continue the drilling break in Norway and Equatorial Guinea, and the rig at South Arne in Denmark is set to be released in the second quarter.
In terms of our operating capabilities, we are delivering industry-leading performance, as confirmed by third-party benchmarks, both in unconventionals and offshore drilling and development. Our resilient portfolio is linked to our top-quartile operating capabilities and is balanced between unconventionals and offshore, providing an attractive mix of short-cycle and long-cycle investment opportunities. This balanced portfolio also casts a wider net for future long-term growth options. 
Our portfolio is leveraged to oil and liquids with industry-leading cash margins and advantaged tax positions in the U.S. and Norway that will accelerate cash flow growth as oil prices improve. 
In terms of our growth opportunities, we have leading positions in the Bakken and Utica shale plays; new field startups North Malay Basin and Stampede, which combined, are expected to add 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of new production over the next 2 years, and by 2018, will become material cash generators; and recent exploration success in Guyana that has the potential to provide significant long-term value creation and growth.
Turning to our financial results. In the first quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $509 million or $1.72 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $0.98 per share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher exploration expense, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower cash costs and DD&A.
While low crude oil prices significantly impacted our first quarter financial results, we delivered strong operational performance. Net production was at the high end of our guidance range, averaging 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to net production of 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter, pro forma for last year's sale of our assets in Algeria. Net production from the Bakken averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2016, above our guidance range. Our Bakken team reduced drilling and completion cost 25% from the year-ago quarter to an average of $5.1 million per well.
In summary, with our strong balance sheet, oil-leveraged portfolio and attractive growth opportunities, we believe the company is well positioned to deliver strong cash flow growth and long-term value as oil prices recover. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."

I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. Starting with production. In the first quarter, we averaged 350,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the top end of our guidance ran",1397,"Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. 
Starting with production. In the first quarter, we averaged 350,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the top end of our guidance range of 340,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and once again reflecting strong operating performance across our portfolio. In the second quarter, we expect net production to average between 320,000 and 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime at Valhall and several of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. As usual, we will provide an update to our full year production guidance on our midyear call in July.
Turning to operations and beginning with the Bakken. Our lean manufacturing approach has once again enabled us to deliver outstanding performance from one of the best core of the core positions in the play, where we retain a substantial drilling inventory with attractive economics even at current prices. Despite reducing our Bakken rig count to an average of 4 rigs in the first quarter 2016 from 12 rigs in the year-ago quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter compared to 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. 
During the first quarter, we drilled 19 wells and brought 31 new wells online. This compares to the year-ago quarter, when we drilled 60 wells and brought 70 wells online. We currently plan to maintain a 3-rig program through the second quarter, to release 1 rig during the third quarter and then operate 2 rigs for the remainder of the year.
In 2016, we now expect to drill 62 wells and bring 87 new wells online. This compares to last year, when we drilled 182 wells and brought 219 wells online. 
In the first quarter, our average drilling and completion costs was $5.1 million per well. We expect to be able to maintain this cost level over 2016 even as we transition from our previous 35-stage completion design to our new standard 50-stage completion design. This higher stage count is expected to deliver a 15% to 20% increase in initial production rates. And with our rigs focused in the core of the play, we expect our estimated ultimate recovery per well to move toward 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day -- oil equivalent in the latter part of 2016. 
We also continue to successfully execute our 17 well per DSU spacing pilots and still see the majority of the wells performing in line with type curves and with minimal interference. The combination of both higher overall type curve performance and higher-density well spacing has allowed us to increase our estimated ultimate recovery from the Bakken from our previous estimate of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. For the second quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average between 100,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Moving to the Utica. In the first quarter, the joint venture drilled 6 wells and brought 9 wells on production. Net production for the first quarter averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica acreage is largely held by production, which allows us to reduce activity in the short term while preserving optionality and longer-term upside. While we benefit from our acreage being in the core of the play at a low 5% royalty, we released the 1 rig we had operating in the play in early March. 
As a result of applying our distinctive lean manufacturing approach, over the past several years, we have been able to reduce our drilling cost per foot by approximately 75% and our completion cost per stage by approximately 50%, while at the same time, drilling some of the longest laterals in the play. 
We plan to run the asset for cash in 2016 and to resume drilling following a sustained recovery in commodity prices and further third-party infrastructure buildout, which will reduce the currently wide basin differentials.
Now turning to the offshore. At the Tubular Bells Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, net production averaged 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. 
During the quarter, we conducted the remediation work highlighted in our fourth quarter call, completing asset jobs at 2 wells. We are now moving the rig to replace a defective subsurface valve that failed to open. This is the second failure of this type in the field, and we are working with the supplier to understand the root causes of the manufacturing defect.
In the second quarter, we have an extended shutdown scheduled to tie back Noble's Gunflint field to the Williams-owned host facility. And we plan to spud a fifth producing well in the field. In early April, we also completed our first water injection well, and we expect to commence injection in the third quarter.
In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. The operator plans to commence an extended shutdown in the second quarter due to required maintenance work at the ConocoPhillips-operated Ekofisk field. 
At the South Arne Field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, we have completed the current phase of development drilling and do not plan to drill any additional wells in 2016. Net production averaged 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter.
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, work continues on the booster compression project, which remains on schedule for completion in the third quarter. Net production averaged 230 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter.
Moving to developments. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, progress continues on full field development. 6 out of 11 development wells have now been drilled, and drilling results to date are better than expected. Net production from the Early Production System averaged 30 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter. Following completion of full field development in 2017, net production is planned to increase to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day. 
At the Stampede development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully floated the top site's main deck onto the production deck, set the hull structure into the offshore floating dock and installed the oil export line. Drilling operations are underway on the first production well, and first oil remains on schedule for 2018.
Moving to exploration. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Chevron-operated Sicily-2 well, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest, reached its target depth, and results are currently being evaluated. 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the ConocoPhillips-operated Melmar well, in which Hess has a 35% working interest, reached target depth in early April, and logging operations are now complete. The well results are still being evaluated, but as noncommercial quantities of oil were encountered at the current location, the well was expensed in the quarter. 
In Guyana, in the Stabroek Block, in which Hess holds a 30% interest, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, spud the Liza-2 well in February. This well is designed to further evaluate the significant Liza oil discovery and will include an extended drill stem test. We expect the operator to complete operations on the Liza-2 well late in the second quarter. Following the Liza-2 well, the operator intends to move the rig to test a separate prospect located approximately 25 miles Northwest of Liza. We remain excited about the opportunity set on this block, which we believe could be material to our company.
In closing, we have maintained excellent execution and delivery across our portfolio. We believe that our focus on preserving the strength of our balance sheet, while also preserving our top-quartile capabilities and growth options, is the right strategy. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, we reported a net loss of $509 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $396 million in the previo",729,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
In the first quarter of 2016, we reported a net loss of $509 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $396 million in the previous quarter. That excludes a net charge of $1,425,000,000.
Turning to exploration and production. E&P incurred a net loss of $451 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to an adjusted net loss of $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. That excludes net charges totaling $1,385,000,000. 
The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 were as follows: Lower realized selling prices reduced results by $187 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $4 million. Lower cash operating costs improved results by $28 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $71 million. Higher exploration expenses reduced results by $18 million. All other items net to a decrease in results of $13 million for an overall increase in the first quarter net loss of $123 million.
In the first quarter, our E&P operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 500,000 barrels, which did not have a material impact on first quarter results. 
The E&P effective income tax rate was a benefit of 41% for the first quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 38% in the fourth quarter, excluding items affecting comparability.
Turning to midstream. First quarter net income of $14 million increased from $11 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to lower operating costs. Bakken Midstream EBITDA, excluding the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $70 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $67 million in the previous quarter.
Turning to corporate and interest. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $72 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, which excludes net charges totaling $32 million. The reduction resulted from lower professional fees and general and administrative costs.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $148 million. A net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $208 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $620 million. Net debt repayments were $12 million. Net proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock were $1,644,000,000. Common stock dividends paid were $80 million. Other net amounted to a use of cash of $31 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $841 million.
Turning to our financial position. We had approximately $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2016, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities of approximately $8.3 billion. Excluding Bakken Midstream, total debt was $5.9 billion at March of 31, 2016, and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 23.1%.
Now turning to second quarter guidance. For E&P, we project cash cost for E&P operations to be in the range of $16.50 to $17.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, reflecting lower production and higher maintenance costs from the planned offshore facility shutdowns. 
DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent is forecast to be $26.50 to $27.50 per barrel, resulting in projected total E&P unit operating cost of $43 to $45 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016.
The Bakken midstream tariff expense is expected to be $3.75 to $3.85 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter of 2016, while exploration expenses, excluding dry-hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million. 
The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the second quarter. 
For Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the second quarter. 
For Corporate and interest, we expect Corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, and interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the second quarter of 2016. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So with the timing, actually, we produce about approximately 75,000 barrels a day of oil internationally, but our liftings were heavily in January and February. We actually lifted about 89,000 barrels a day in January and 130,000 barrels a day in February. And March liftings were only 19,000. So obviously, we lifted more, just timing-wise, when oil prices were lower in the quarter. And so that had an impact on our differentials. The other thing that did a true weakening was on West African crudes. It's not just ours, but in general, West African crudes were -- kind of, the differential widened about $1.

So let's just start with returns. We have an excellent acreage position in the Bakken. And as you know, we've got good returns, that we could drill wells here at $40 and we could drill at $50 and get good-return wells. But obviously at $60, the returns are going to be better, and more of our acreage than meets our return threshold as you move towards $60. So obviously, we want to improve returns for our shareholders. The next aspect of it is, we are spending money on growth right now. You know North Malay Basin and Stampede, so we will have 35,000 barrels a day coming in 2018 from those 2 projects. And like you said, we've already added some valuable resources here in Guyana, and we're going to continue exploration there and see if we can add more valuable resources there. Then it comes to the last part of your point was, we do look at overall corporate cash flow, and we want to deliver growth with free cash flow. And at $60 Bakken, we can add rigs and Bakken will grow and generate free cash flow. So that is something that we're looking to do from the portfolio aspect. And then with our balance sheet with this low point in the cycle, we want to come out of that low point in the cycle with this strong balance sheet. So our plan is, because our portfolio is so levered to oil, $1 for us gives us $75 million of annual cash flow.

So our locations compete not only with the best acreage in the Bakken, but the best acreage of any shale play in the United States, including the Permian. So our focus, even though we have those locations, is on value, not volume. And we're going to be guided by capital discipline and financial returns, and that's why we've said the $60 is our price that we will focus on where we start ramping up Bakken activity."

So that was purely an efficiency thing as we kind of lined out the work for the year. If you look at the Bakken production character, what we've said is that our ranges for the year is 105 to 95. And certainly, directionally, that mimics what is going to happen in the production curves. So it's going to start out high and then end the year probably close to the end of that -- or the bottom end of that range. So that will give you a sense for kind of how Bakken production is going to look over the year.

Now on the flip side, Greg just mentioned that we had some extended shutdowns that were not part of our original plan. So that is, from that second quarter guidance, is driving up.

I think -- again, think if you think about when we would restart drilling, as John Rielly mentioned in his comments, it's really going to be a function of corporate cash flow, so we're really going to be watching corporate cash flow before we restart drilling either offshore or onshore in the Bakken. So that's going to be the primary driver. But broadly, the pace of the cost reductions has been slower in offshore than onshore due to the need to work off the backlog of those higher-cost rig contracts and also the work in the yards associated with previously sanctioned projects. So now rigs, boats and associated equipment are already starting to come down substantially, and we know that because we're seeing a lot of those benefits in Guyana, for example, on the rig rates and the seismic boat rates. And then we expect that to continue as offshore projects are completed. So we think further rig cost capitulation will occur. And then importantly, the yard rates will start to come down as well as capacity becomes available. So -- and in fact, in some of our pre-FEED work that we're doing around the globe, we're already seeing significantly lower indicative bids in the offshore yard and rig space. So more to come in the offshore. But again, restart, I think, is going to be back to what John Rielly said, it's going to be a function of corporate cash flow."

And again, I just want to remind you, we have some great opportunities and great return locations even at these lower prices, but due to corporate cash flow and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet, is why we're going to move towards $60 before we put rigs back to work in the Bakken.

And that's why as we look, as we get to $60, and there's plenty of running room there, we'll start putting more rigs to work. What it means now in offshore, as -- and I think Greg might have mentioned it, it's not that we don't have very good return opportunities of tiebacks on our offshore assets, we do. Some of it is good or even better than the Bakken, the issue that we now have is you have to then commit to a rig. So we'll have to get a rig to location.

I will provide an update on the steps we are taking to manage in the low price oil price environment and review some of the highlights from the quarter. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results. 
Our strategy in this lower-for-longer price environment is guided by 3 principles: Preserve our balance sheet, preserve our operating capabilities and preserve our growth options. 
To preserve our balance sheet, on February 4, we successfully executed a capital raise of $1.6 billion through common and mandatory convertible preferred stock offerings. These proceeds will keep our strong balance sheet strong in the low oil price environment and provide the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our growth projects: North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and exploration offshore Guyana. 
Further to preserving the strength of our balance sheet, in January, we announced our 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, 40% below 2015 levels. Our focus remains on value, not volume, and we do not believe that accelerating production in the current oil price environment makes sense. Rather, we have reduced activity levels across our producing portfolio, both onshore and offshore. Our Bakken rig count will be reduced from 3 rigs currently to 2 rigs during the third quarter and is expected to remain at this level until the WTI price is closer to $60 per barrel. In the Utica, our 1 drilling rig was released in March and no further drilling is planned this year. Offshore, we continue the drilling break in Norway and Equatorial Guinea, and the rig at South Arne in Denmark is set to be released in the second quarter.
In terms of our operating capabilities, we are delivering industry-leading performance, as confirmed by third-party benchmarks, both in unconventionals and offshore drilling and development. Our resilient portfolio is linked to our top-quartile operating capabilities and is balanced between unconventionals and offshore, providing an attractive mix of short-cycle and long-cycle investment opportunities. This balanced portfolio also casts a wider net for future long-term growth options. 
Our portfolio is leveraged to oil and liquids with industry-leading cash margins and advantaged tax positions in the U.S. and Norway that will accelerate cash flow growth as oil prices improve. 
In terms of our growth opportunities, we have leading positions in the Bakken and Utica shale plays; new field startups North Malay Basin and Stampede, which combined, are expected to add 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of new production over the next 2 years, and by 2018, will become material cash generators; and recent exploration success in Guyana that has the potential to provide significant long-term value creation and growth.
Turning to our financial results. In the first quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $509 million or $1.72 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $0.98 per share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher exploration expense, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower cash costs and DD&A.
While low crude oil prices significantly impacted our first quarter financial results, we delivered strong operational performance. Net production was at the high end of our guidance range, averaging 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to net production of 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter, pro forma for last year's sale of our assets in Algeria. Net production from the Bakken averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2016, above our guidance range. Our Bakken team reduced drilling and completion cost 25% from the year-ago quarter to an average of $5.1 million per well.
In summary, with our strong balance sheet, oil-leveraged portfolio and attractive growth opportunities, we believe the company is well positioned to deliver strong cash flow growth and long-term value as oil prices recover. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."

I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. Starting with production. In the first quarter, we averaged 350,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the top end of our guidance ran",1397,"Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. 
Starting with production. In the first quarter, we averaged 350,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the top end of our guidance range of 340,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and once again reflecting strong operating performance across our portfolio. In the second quarter, we expect net production to average between 320,000 and 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime at Valhall and several of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. As usual, we will provide an update to our full year production guidance on our midyear call in July.
Turning to operations and beginning with the Bakken. Our lean manufacturing approach has once again enabled us to deliver outstanding performance from one of the best core of the core positions in the play, where we retain a substantial drilling inventory with attractive economics even at current prices. Despite reducing our Bakken rig count to an average of 4 rigs in the first quarter 2016 from 12 rigs in the year-ago quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter compared to 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. 
During the first quarter, we drilled 19 wells and brought 31 new wells online. This compares to the year-ago quarter, when we drilled 60 wells and brought 70 wells online. We currently plan to maintain a 3-rig program through the second quarter, to release 1 rig during the third quarter and then operate 2 rigs for the remainder of the year.
In 2016, we now expect to drill 62 wells and bring 87 new wells online. This compares to last year, when we drilled 182 wells and brought 219 wells online. 
In the first quarter, our average drilling and completion costs was $5.1 million per well. We expect to be able to maintain this cost level over 2016 even as we transition from our previous 35-stage completion design to our new standard 50-stage completion design. This higher stage count is expected to deliver a 15% to 20% increase in initial production rates. And with our rigs focused in the core of the play, we expect our estimated ultimate recovery per well to move toward 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day -- oil equivalent in the latter part of 2016. 
We also continue to successfully execute our 17 well per DSU spacing pilots and still see the majority of the wells performing in line with type curves and with minimal interference. The combination of both higher overall type curve performance and higher-density well spacing has allowed us to increase our estimated ultimate recovery from the Bakken from our previous estimate of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. For the second quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average between 100,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Moving to the Utica. In the first quarter, the joint venture drilled 6 wells and brought 9 wells on production. Net production for the first quarter averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica acreage is largely held by production, which allows us to reduce activity in the short term while preserving optionality and longer-term upside. While we benefit from our acreage being in the core of the play at a low 5% royalty, we released the 1 rig we had operating in the play in early March. 
As a result of applying our distinctive lean manufacturing approach, over the past several years, we have been able to reduce our drilling cost per foot by approximately 75% and our completion cost per stage by approximately 50%, while at the same time, drilling some of the longest laterals in the play. 
We plan to run the asset for cash in 2016 and to resume drilling following a sustained recovery in commodity prices and further third-party infrastructure buildout, which will reduce the currently wide basin differentials.
Now turning to the offshore. At the Tubular Bells Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, net production averaged 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. 
During the quarter, we conducted the remediation work highlighted in our fourth quarter call, completing asset jobs at 2 wells. We are now moving the rig to replace a defective subsurface valve that failed to open. This is the second failure of this type in the field, and we are working with the supplier to understand the root causes of the manufacturing defect.
In the second quarter, we have an extended shutdown scheduled to tie back Noble's Gunflint field to the Williams-owned host facility. And we plan to spud a fifth producing well in the field. In early April, we also completed our first water injection well, and we expect to commence injection in the third quarter.
In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. The operator plans to commence an extended shutdown in the second quarter due to required maintenance work at the ConocoPhillips-operated Ekofisk field. 
At the South Arne Field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, we have completed the current phase of development drilling and do not plan to drill any additional wells in 2016. Net production averaged 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter.
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, work continues on the booster compression project, which remains on schedule for completion in the third quarter. Net production averaged 230 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter.
Moving to developments. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, progress continues on full field development. 6 out of 11 development wells have now been drilled, and drilling results to date are better than expected. Net production from the Early Production System averaged 30 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter. Following completion of full field development in 2017, net production is planned to increase to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day. 
At the Stampede development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully floated the top site's main deck onto the production deck, set the hull structure into the offshore floating dock and installed the oil export line. Drilling operations are underway on the first production well, and first oil remains on schedule for 2018.
Moving to exploration. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Chevron-operated Sicily-2 well, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest, reached its target depth, and results are currently being evaluated. 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the ConocoPhillips-operated Melmar well, in which Hess has a 35% working interest, reached target depth in early April, and logging operations are now complete. The well results are still being evaluated, but as noncommercial quantities of oil were encountered at the current location, the well was expensed in the quarter. 
In Guyana, in the Stabroek Block, in which Hess holds a 30% interest, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, spud the Liza-2 well in February. This well is designed to further evaluate the significant Liza oil discovery and will include an extended drill stem test. We expect the operator to complete operations on the Liza-2 well late in the second quarter. Following the Liza-2 well, the operator intends to move the rig to test a separate prospect located approximately 25 miles northwest of Liza. We remain excited about the opportunity set on this block, which we believe could be material to our company.
In closing, we have maintained excellent execution and delivery across our portfolio. We believe that our focus on preserving the strength of our balance sheet, while also preserving our top-quartile capabilities and growth options, is the right strategy. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In the first quarter of 2016, we reported a net loss of $509 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $396 million in the previous quarter. That excludes a net charge of $1,425,000,000.
Turning to exploration and production. E&P incurred a net loss of $451 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to an adjusted net loss of $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. That excludes net charges totaling $1,385,000,000. 
The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 were as follows: Lower realized selling prices reduced results by $187 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $4 million. Lower cash operating costs improved results by $28 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $71 million. Higher exploration expenses reduced results by $18 million. All other items net to a decrease in results of $13 million for an overall increase in the first quarter net loss of $123 million.
In the first quarter, our E&P operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 500,000 barrels, which did not have a material impact on first quarter results. 
The E&P effective income tax rate was a benefit of 41% for the first quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 38% in the fourth quarter, excluding items affecting comparability.
Turning to midstream. First quarter net income of $14 million increased from $11 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to lower operating costs. Bakken Midstream EBITDA, excluding the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $70 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $67 million in the previous quarter.
Turning to corporate and interest. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $72 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, which excludes net charges totaling $32 million. The reduction resulted from lower professional fees and general and administrative costs.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $148 million. A net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $208 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $620 million. Net debt repayments were $12 million. Net proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock were $1,644,000,000. Common stock dividends paid were $80 million. Other net amounted to a use of cash of $31 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $841 million.
Turning to our financial position. We had approximately $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2016, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities of approximately $8.3 billion. Excluding Bakken Midstream, total debt was $5.9 billion at March of 31, 2016, and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 23.1%.
Now turning to second quarter guidance. For E&P, we project cash cost for E&P operations to be in the range of $16.50 to $17.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, reflecting lower production and higher maintenance costs from the planned offshore facility shutdowns. 
DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent is forecast to be $26.50 to $27.50 per barrel, resulting in projected total E&P unit operating cost of $43 to $45 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016.
The Bakken midstream tariff expense is expected to be $3.75 to $3.85 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter of 2016, while exploration expenses, excluding dry-hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million. 
The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the second quarter. 
For Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the second quarter. 
For Corporate and interest, we expect Corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, and interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the second quarter of 2016. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

There was something unusual just from -- in the first quarter, and it had to do just with our timing of lift. So there's 2 aspects of why our differentials widened. So with the timing, actually, we produce about approximately 75,000 barrels a day of oil internationally, but our liftings were heavily in January and February. We actually lifted about 89,000 barrels a day in January and 130,000 barrels a day in February. And March liftings were only 19,000. So obviously, we lifted more, just timing-wise, when oil prices were lower in the quarter. And so that had an impact on our differentials. The other thing that did a true weakening was on West African crudes. It's not just ours, but in general, West African crudes were -- kind of, the differential widened about $1. And that did happen with our EG liftings as well in the quarter."

So let's just start with returns. We have an excellent acreage position in the Bakken. And as you know, we've got good returns, that we could drill wells here at $40 and we could drill at $50 and get good-return wells. But obviously at $60, the returns are going to be better, and more of our acreage then meets our return threshold as you move towards $60. So obviously, we want to improve returns for our shareholders. The next aspect of it is, we are spending money on growth right now. You know North Malay Basin and Stampede, so we will have 35,000 barrels a day coming in 2018 from those 2 projects. And like you said, we've already added some valuable resources here in Guyana, and we're going to continue exploration there and see if we can add more valuable resources there. Then it comes to the last part of your point was, we do look at overall corporate cash flow, and we want to deliver growth with free cash flow. And at $60 Bakken, we can add rigs and Bakken will grow and generate free cash flow. So that is something that we're looking to do from the portfolio aspect. And then with our balance sheet with this low point in the cycle, we want to come out of that low point in the cycle with this strong balance sheet. So our plan is, because our portfolio is so levered to oil, $1 for us gives us $75 million of annual cash flow. So we want to bank that cash flow as you move up to $60, again, to improve the balance sheet. So all those factors play a role."

So our locations compete not only with the best acreage in the Bakken, but the best acreage of any shale play in the United States, including the Permian. So our focus, even though we have those locations, is on value, not volume.

Because while the rig's there, you'd just soon complete those pads rather than get them partially done and then come back later. So that was purely an efficiency thing as we kind of lined out the work for the year. If you look at the Bakken production character, what we've said is that our ranges for the year is 105 to 95. And certainly, directionally, that mimics what is going to happen in the production curves. So it's going to start out high and then end the year probably close to the end of that -- or the bottom end of that range. So that will give you a sense for kind of how Bakken production is going to look over the year. Obviously, we are starting a little bit higher, but you can assume about a 10% decline over the year in the Bakken."

So that's going to be the primary driver. But broadly, the pace of the cost reductions has been slower in offshore than onshore due to the need to work off the backlog of those higher-cost rig contracts and also the work in the yards associated with previously sanctioned projects. So now rigs, boats and associated equipment are already starting to come down substantially, and we know that because we're seeing a lot of those benefits in Guyana, for example, on the rig rates and the seismic boat rates. And then we expect that to continue as offshore projects are completed. So we think further rig cost capitulation will occur. And then importantly, the yard rates will start to come down as well as capacity becomes available. So -- and in fact, in some of our pre-FEED work that we're doing around the globe, we're already seeing significantly lower indicative bids in the offshore yard and rig space.

And again, I just want to remind you, we have some great opportunities and great return locations even at these lower prices, but due to corporate cash flow and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet, is why we're going to move towards $60 before we put rigs back to work in the Bakken. The way we are thinking about it with -- we have our development projects, Stampede in North Malay Basin, that's going to generate 35,000 barrels a day of production in 2018; we have Guyana, that the next call in our capital will be Bakken. And that's why as we look, as we get to $60, and there's plenty of running room there, we'll start putting more rigs to work. What it means now in offshore, as -- and I think Greg might have mentioned it, it's not that we don't have very good return opportunities of tiebacks on our offshore assets, we do. Some of it is good or even better than the Bakken, the issue that we now have is you have to then commit to a rig. So we'll have to get a rig to location. And what you're going to mean is you're going to have to commit to multi wells or maybe more than 1 year. So at that point, we're going to want even stronger prices than $60 and feel that it's sustainable before we go commit to that."

Welcome to our First Quarter Conference Call. I will provide an update on the steps we are taking to manage in the low price oil price environment and review some of the highlights from the quarter.

I will provide an update on the steps we are taking to manage in the low price oil price environment and review some of the highlights from the quarter. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results. 
Our strategy in this lower-for-longer price environment is guided by 3 principles: Preserve our balance sheet, preserve our operating capabilities and preserve our growth options. 
To preserve our balance sheet, on February 4, we successfully executed a capital raise of $1.6 billion through common and mandatory convertible preferred stock offerings. These proceeds will keep our strong balance sheet strong in the low oil price environment and provide the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our growth projects: North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and exploration offshore Guyana. 
Further to preserving the strength of our balance sheet, in January, we announced our 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, 40% below 2015 levels. Our focus remains on value, not volume, and we do not believe that accelerating production in the current oil price environment makes sense. Rather, we have reduced activity levels across our producing portfolio, both onshore and offshore. Our Bakken rig count will be reduced from 3 rigs currently to 2 rigs during the third quarter and is expected to remain at this level until the WTI price is closer to $60 per barrel. In the Utica, our one drilling rig was released in March and no further drilling is planned this year. Offshore, we continue the drilling break in Norway and Equatorial Guinea, and the rig at South Arne in Denmark is set to be released in the second quarter.
In terms of our operating capabilities, we are delivering industry-leading performance, as confirmed by third-party benchmarks, both in unconventionals and offshore drilling and development. Our resilient portfolio is linked to our top-quartile operating capabilities and is balanced between unconventionals and offshore, providing an attractive mix of short-cycle and long-cycle investment opportunities. This balanced portfolio also casts a wider net for future long-term growth options. 
Our portfolio is leveraged to oil and liquids with industry-leading cash margins and advantaged tax positions in the U.S. and Norway that will accelerate cash flow growth as oil prices improve. 
In terms of our growth opportunities, we have leading positions in the Bakken and Utica shale plays; new field startups North Malay Basin and Stampede, which combined, are expected to add 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of new production over the next 2 years, and by 2018, will become material cash generators; and recent exploration success in Guyana that has the potential to provide significant long-term value creation and growth.
Turning to our financial results. In the first quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $509 million or $1.72 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $0.98 per share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher exploration expense, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower cash costs and DD&A.
While low crude oil prices significantly impacted our first quarter financial results, we delivered strong operational performance. Net production was at the high end of our guidance range, averaging 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to net production of 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter, pro forma for last year's sale of our assets in Algeria. Net production from the Bakken averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2016, above our guidance range. Our Bakken team reduced drilling and completion cost 25% from the year-ago quarter to an average of $5.1 million per well.
In summary, with our strong balance sheet, oil-leveraged portfolio and attractive growth opportunities, we believe the company is well positioned to deliver strong cash flow growth and long-term value as oil prices recover. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."

I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. Starting with production. In the first quarter, we averaged 350,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the top end of our guidance ran",1397,"Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. 
Starting with production. In the first quarter, we averaged 350,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the top end of our guidance range of 340,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and once again reflecting strong operating performance across our portfolio. In the second quarter, we expect net production to average between 320,000 and 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime at Valhall and several of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. As usual, we will provide an update to our full year production guidance on our midyear call in July.
Turning to operations and beginning with the Bakken. Our lean manufacturing approach has once again enabled us to deliver outstanding performance from one of the best core of the core positions in the play, where we retain a substantial drilling inventory with attractive economics even at current prices. Despite reducing our Bakken rig count to an average of 4 rigs in the first quarter 2016 from 12 rigs in the year-ago quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter compared to 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. 
During the first quarter, we drilled 19 wells and brought 31 new wells online. This compares to the year-ago quarter, when we drilled 60 wells and brought 70 wells online. We currently plan to maintain a 3-rig program through the second quarter, to release 1 rig during the third quarter and then operate 2 rigs for the remainder of the year.
In 2016, we now expect to drill 62 wells and bring 87 new wells online. This compares to last year, when we drilled 182 wells and brought 219 wells online. 
In the first quarter, our average drilling and completion costs was $5.1 million per well. We expect to be able to maintain this cost level over 2016 even as we transition from our previous 35-stage completion design to our new standard 50-stage completion design. This higher stage count is expected to deliver a 15% to 20% increase in initial production rates. And with our rigs focused in the core of the play, we expect our estimated ultimate recovery per well to move toward 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day -- oil equivalent in the latter part of 2016. 
We also continue to successfully execute our 17 well per DSU spacing pilots and still see the majority of the wells performing in line with type curves and with minimal interference. The combination of both higher overall type curve performance and higher-density well spacing has allowed us to increase our estimated ultimate recovery from the Bakken from our previous estimate of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. For the second quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average between 100,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Moving to the Utica. In the first quarter, the joint venture drilled 6 wells and brought 9 wells on production. Net production for the first quarter averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica acreage is largely held by production, which allows us to reduce activity in the short term while preserving optionality and longer-term upside. While we benefit from our acreage being in the core of the play at a low 5% royalty, we released the 1 rig we had operating in the play in early March. 
As a result of applying our distinctive lean manufacturing approach, over the past several years, we have been able to reduce our drilling cost per foot by approximately 75% and our completion cost per stage by approximately 50%, while at the same time, drilling some of the longest laterals in the play. 
We plan to run the asset for cash in 2016 and to resume drilling following a sustained recovery in commodity prices and further third-party infrastructure buildout, which will reduce the currently wide basin differentials.
Now turning to the offshore. At the Tubular Bells Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, net production averaged 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. 
During the quarter, we conducted the remediation work highlighted in our fourth quarter call, completing asset jobs at 2 wells. We are now moving the rig to replace a defective subsurface valve that failed to open. This is the second failure of this type in the field, and we are working with the supplier to understand the root causes of the manufacturing defect.
In the second quarter, we have an extended shutdown scheduled to tie back Noble's Gunflint field to the Williams-owned host facility. And we plan to spud a fifth producing well in the field. In early April, we also completed our first water injection well, and we expect to commence injection in the third quarter.
In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. The operator plans to commence an extended shutdown in the second quarter due to required maintenance work at the ConocoPhillips-operated Ekofisk field. 
At the South Arne Field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, we have completed the current phase of development drilling and do not plan to drill any additional wells in 2016. Net production averaged 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter.
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, work continues on the booster compression project, which remains on schedule for completion in the third quarter. Net production averaged 230 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter.
Moving to developments. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, progress continues on full field development. 6 out of 11 development wells have now been drilled, and drilling results to date are better than expected. Net production from the Early Production System averaged 30 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter. Following completion of full field development in 2017, net production is planned to increase to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day. 
At the Stampede development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully floated the top site's main deck onto the production deck, set the hull structure into the offshore floating dock and installed the oil export line. Drilling operations are underway on the first production well, and first oil remains on schedule for 2018.
Moving to exploration. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Chevron-operated Sicily-2 well, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest, reached its target depth, and results are currently being evaluated. 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the ConocoPhillips-operated Melmar well, in which Hess has a 35% working interest, reached target depth in early April, and logging operations are now complete. The well results are still being evaluated, but as noncommercial quantities of oil were encountered at the current location, the well was expensed in the quarter. 
In Guyana, in the Stabroek Block, in which Hess holds a 30% interest, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, spud the Liza-2 well in February. This well is designed to further evaluate the significant Liza oil discovery and will include an extended drill stem test. We expect the operator to complete operations on the Liza-2 well late in the second quarter. Following the Liza-2 well, the operator intends to move the rig to test a separate prospect located approximately 25 miles northwest of Liza. We remain excited about the opportunity set on this block, which we believe could be material to our company.
In closing, we have maintained excellent execution and delivery across our portfolio. We believe that our focus on preserving the strength of our balance sheet, while also preserving our top-quartile capabilities and growth options, is the right strategy. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, we reported a net loss of $509 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $396 million in the previo",729,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
In the first quarter of 2016, we reported a net loss of $509 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $396 million in the previous quarter. That excludes a net charge of $1,425,000,000.
Turning to exploration and production. E&P incurred a net loss of $451 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to an adjusted net loss of $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. That excludes net charges totaling $1,385,000,000. 
The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 were as follows: Lower realized selling prices reduced results by $187 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $4 million. Lower cash operating costs improved results by $28 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $71 million. Higher exploration expenses reduced results by $18 million. All other items net to a decrease in results of $13 million for an overall increase in the first quarter net loss of $123 million.
In the first quarter, our E&P operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 500,000 barrels, which did not have a material impact on first quarter results. 
The E&P effective income tax rate was a benefit of 41% for the first quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 38% in the fourth quarter, excluding items affecting comparability.
Turning to midstream. First quarter net income of $14 million increased from $11 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to lower operating costs. Bakken Midstream EBITDA, excluding the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $70 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $67 million in the previous quarter.
Turning to corporate and interest. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $72 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, which excludes net charges totaling $32 million. The reduction resulted from lower professional fees and general and administrative costs.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $148 million. A net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $208 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $620 million. Net debt repayments were $12 million. Net proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock were $1,644,000,000. Common stock dividends paid were $80 million. Other net amounted to a use of cash of $31 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $841 million.
Turning to our financial position. We had approximately $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2016, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities of approximately $8.3 billion. Excluding Bakken Midstream, total debt was $5.9 billion at March of 31, 2016, and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 23.1%.
Now turning to second quarter guidance. For E&P, we project cash cost for E&P operations to be in the range of $16.50 to $17.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, reflecting lower production and higher maintenance costs from the planned offshore facility shutdowns. 
DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent is forecast to be $26.50 to $27.50 per barrel, resulting in projected total E&P unit operating cost of $43 to $45 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016.
The Bakken midstream tariff expense is expected to be $3.75 to $3.85 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter of 2016, while exploration expenses, excluding dry-hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million. 
The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the second quarter. 
For Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the second quarter. 
For Corporate and interest, we expect Corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, and interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the second quarter of 2016. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So with the timing, actually, we produce about approximately 75,000 barrels a day of oil internationally, but our liftings were heavily in January and February. We actually lifted about 89,000 barrels a day in January and 130,000 barrels a day in February. And March liftings were only 19,000. So obviously, we lifted more, just timing-wise, when oil prices were lower in the quarter. And so that had an impact on our differentials.

So let's just start with returns. We have an excellent acreage position in the Bakken. And as you know, we've got good returns, that we could drill wells here at $40 and we could drill at $50 and get good-return wells. But obviously at $60, the returns are going to be better, and more of our acreage then meets our return threshold as you move towards $60. So obviously, we want to improve returns for our shareholders. The next aspect of it is, we are spending money on growth right now. You know North Malay Basin and Stampede, so we will have 35,000 barrels a day coming in 2018 from those 2 projects. And like you said, we've already added some valuable resources here in Guyana, and we're going to continue exploration there and see if we can add more valuable resources there. Then it comes to the last part of your point was, we do look at overall corporate cash flow, and we want to deliver growth with free cash flow. And at $60 Bakken, we can add rigs and Bakken will grow and generate free cash flow. So that is something that we're looking to do from the portfolio aspect. And then with our balance sheet with this low point in the cycle, we want to come out of that low point in the cycle with this strong balance sheet. So our plan is, because our portfolio is so levered to oil, $1 for us gives us $75 million of annual cash flow.

So that was purely an efficiency thing as we kind of lined out the work for the year. If you look at the Bakken production character, what we've said is that our ranges for the year is 105 to 95. And certainly, directionally, that mimics what is going to happen in the production curves. So it's going to start out high and then end the year probably close to the end of that -- or the bottom end of that range. So that will give you a sense for kind of how Bakken production is going to look over the year. Obviously, we are starting a little bit higher, but you can assume about a 10% decline over the year in the Bakken."

So that's going to be the primary driver. But broadly, the pace of the cost reductions has been slower in offshore than onshore due to the need to work off the backlog of those higher-cost rig contracts and also the work in the yards associated with previously sanctioned projects. So now rigs, boats and associated equipment are already starting to come down substantially, and we know that because we're seeing a lot of those benefits in Guyana, for example, on the rig rates and the seismic boat rates. And then we expect that to continue as offshore projects are completed. So we think further rig cost capitulation will occur. And then importantly, the yard rates will start to come down as well as capacity becomes available. So -- and in fact, in some of our pre-FEED work that we're doing around the globe, we're already seeing significantly lower indicative bids in the offshore yard and rig space.

And again, I just want to remind you, we have some great opportunities and great return locations even at these lower prices, but due to corporate cash flow and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet, is why we're going to move towards $60 before we put rigs back to work in the Bakken. The way we are thinking about it with -- we have our development projects, Stampede in North Malay Basin, that's going to generate 35,000 barrels a day of production in 2018; we have Guyana, that the next call in our capital will be Bakken. And that's why as we look, as we get to $60, and there's plenty of running room there, we'll start putting more rigs to work. What it means now in offshore, as -- and I think Greg might have mentioned it, it's not that we don't have very good return opportunities of tiebacks on our offshore assets, we do. Some of it is good or even better than the Bakken, the issue that we now have is you have to then commit to a rig. So we'll have to get a rig to location. And what you're going to mean is you're going to have to commit to multi wells or maybe more than 1 year. So at that point, we're going to want even stronger prices than $60 and feel that it's sustainable before we go commit to that."

I will provide an update on the progress we continue to make in managing in the low oil price environment while preserving our long-term growth options. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance from the quarter, and John Riley will review our financial results. 
Our company is well positioned for the current price environment and for the eventual recovery in oil prices. We have one of the strongest balance sheet and liquidity positions among our peers, a resilient portfolio and an exceptional long-term growth outlook. 
In terms of our balance sheet, we started 2016 by reducing our E&P capital and exploratory budgets to $2.4 billion, 40% below our 2015 spend, and cut activity across our producing portfolio, both onshore and offshore. Since then, we have continued to pursue further capital reductions. 
In the second quarter of 2016, we reduced E&P capital and exploratory expenditures by 52% from the second quarter of last year to $485 million. We now project our full year 2016 capital and exploratory expenditures to be $2.1 billion, about 48% below 2015 levels and $300 million lower than our previous forecast. Efforts are underway to make further reductions as well. 
We have the balance sheet and liquidity necessary to invest in our future growth. Our 3 growth projects will make us a much stronger company in the next few years in terms of visible production and cash flow growth, as well as improving returns. 
As you know, we are investing about $700 million in 2016 in 2 offshore developments, North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These 2 projects, which will come online in 2017 and 2018, respectively, will add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and go from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company. 
In terms of our third major growth project, Offshore Guyana, on June 30, Hess, and coventure partner and operator ExxonMobil, announced positive results from the Liza-2 well in the Stabroek Block. The results confirmed a world-class oil discovery, one of the largest in the last 10 years, with estimated recoverable resource for the Liza discovery of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We believe the Stabroek Block has the potential to materially contribute to our resource base and future production growth and create significant value for our shareholders. 
On July 17, the operators spud the Skipjack Well, which is a separate, but similar prospect, located approximately 25 miles to the Northwest of the Liza-1 well. We expect to have the results from this well by our next conference call. Following the Skipjack well, the operator intends to drill a third well at Liza to further appraise the discovery. In addition, predevelopment activities are underway, and we look forward to working with our partners in the government of Guyana to move this exciting discovery towards a commercialization decision. We believe Liza will offer very attractive economics and expect to call [ph] on capital next year to be manageable given our strong cash position. As plans progress, we will continue to keep you informed. Turning to our financial results. In the second quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $392 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $335 million or $1.10 per common share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $147 million or $0.52 per common share in the second quarter of last year. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and sales volumes, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower cash cost and DD&A. 
Net production averaged 313,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to net production of 386,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter, pro forma for last year's sale of our Algeria asset. While we continue to have strong performance from the Bakken, overall company production during the quarter was primarily affected by unplanned downtime due to subsurface safety valve failures and related remediation work at the Tubular Bells Field and a mechanical issue at 1 well in the Conger Field, both in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico; planned shutdown set several offshore fields, including Tubular Bells and Valhall Field in Norway, and reduced capital investment as compared with last year. Due to the unplanned downtime of the Tubular Bells and Conger Fields, which Greg will address in more detail, we are revising our overall company production forecast for 2016 to a range of 315,000 to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, from our previous guidance of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Turning to the Bakken. Net production in the second quarter of 2016 averaged 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter of 2015, reflecting our reduced drilling program. Through the use of Lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team continues to drill some of the lowest cost and most productive wells in the play. Notably, during the second quarter, we reduced drilling and completion costs 14% from the year-ago quarter to an average of $4.8 million per well, even as we shifted from 35-stage to 50-stage wells, which is delivering a 15% to 20% uplift in initial production rates. For full year 2016, we are narrowing our Bakken production forecast to a range of 100,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing the upper end of our previous guidance of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our focus remains on value, not volume, and we do not believe that accelerating production or drilling up our best locations in the current low price environment is in the best interest of our shareholders. While our Bakken acreage can generate attractive returns at current low prices, we will remain disciplined and begin to increase activity there when oil prices approach $60 per barrel. As we see that a price recovery is sustained, we will also then resume drilling activities in the Utica and offshore, where we have numerous high return investment opportunities. 
In summary, we have one of the strongest balance sheets and at most attractive long-term growth profile among all our peers. We remain confident in our ability to manage through the current environment and deliver strong production and cash flow growth as oil prices recover. Our resilient portfolio provides an attractive mix of short-cycle and long-cycle growth options, including an unparalleled position in the Bakken, 2 significant offshore developments that will become cash generators starting 2017 and 2018, and the recent world-class oil discovery in Guyana that has the potential to create material value for our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."

I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. As John said, we are focused on maximizing value, not volume, and have reduced our drilling program to levels that allow us to manage near-term cash flow while maintaining our operating capabilities in the current low price environment. When oil prices approach $60 per barrel, we will begin to ramp up activity, starting with the Bakken. As the price recovery is sustained, we will then resume drilling activities in the Utica and offshore. However, given that oil prices have remained below $50 barrels per day barrel, we have further reduced our 2016 E&P capital and exploratory budget to $2.1 billion from our previous guidance of $2.4 billion, which represents a 48% reduction from 2015. This decrease reflects our continuing focus on reducing costs across our portfolio. 
Now moving to production. In the second quarter, we averaged 313,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of 320,000 to 325,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter. As discussed on our last call, we had a series of expanded planned shutdowns at the Valhall Field in Norway and at the Tubular Bells and Conger Fields in the Gulf of Mexico during the second quarter. In addition, we experienced a mechanical issue that affected 1 well at the Conger Field and had further downtime at the Tubular Bells field to replace a second defective subsurface safety valve. In July, we have experienced a third subsurface safety valve failure. We're actively pursuing legal claims against the vendor who provided the defective valves at Tubular Bells. The third valve failure at Tubular Bells and the mechanical issue with the Conger well will be remediated in the fourth quarter. These issues, along with decreased investment levels, led us to reduce our full year 2016 production guidance to 315,000 to 325,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. We forecast company-wide production in the third quarter to average between 310,000 and 315,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Our third quarter forecast reflects planned downtime at the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand, the South Arne Field in Denmark and the mechanical issues that Tubular Bells and Conger, as well as hurricane continuously in the Gulf of Mexico and reduced investment level. 
While preserving the strength of our balance sheet in the current environment is crucial, it is equally important for us to be well positioned for price recovery by maintaining both our operating capabilities and the opportunities to drive future profitable growth. It is, therefore, significant to Hess, that at the end of June, ExxonMobil announced the drilling result from the Liza-2 well, the second well in the Stabroek black offshore Guyana in which Hess holds a 30% interest. The Liza-2 well encountered more than 190 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs in the Upper Cretaceous formations. After successfully concluding an extensive well evaluation program and extended production test, ExxonMobil confirmed Liza as world-class discovery, with a recoverable resource of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The Stabroek Block extends to 6.6 million acres, and on July 17, we spud an exploration well on a second prospect, Skipjack, located approximately 25 miles Northwest of Liza. We remain excited not only about the Liza discovery, but the wider opportunity set on this block, which has the potential to be transformational to our company. 
Turning now to unconventionals. Net production from the Bakken averaged 106,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, in line with the guidance of 110,000 to -- 100,000 to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day given on our first quarter call. We maintained an average of 3 Bakken rigs in the second quarter. We plan to drop the 2 rigs in August, and we'll begin to increase activity when oil prices approach $60 per barrel. Over 2016, we now expect to drill 65 wells and bring 90 new wells online. 
In the first half of 2016, we drilled 39 new wells and brought 57 new wells online, and we plan to drill 26 new wells and bring 33 online in the second half of the year, as the lower rig count takes effect. 
In the second quarter, our average drilling and completion cost was $4.8 million per well. I'm very proud of our Bakken team, who has driven down D&C cost by 14% versus the year-ago quarter, even as we transition from our previous 35-stage completion design to our new 50-stage completion design. With a higher stage count, we expect to see 30-day IP rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second half of 2016, and expect that these wells in the core of the play will show a 7% uplift in EUR per well. As a result of the increased productivity and EUR and well we're drilling completion cost, we have significantly increased the number of well locations that are economic at lower prices. Because of our continued strong performance, we are narrowing our full year 2016 net production guidance for the Bakken to 100,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the upper end of the 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day range that we provided in January. 
Moving to the Utica. The joint venture has drilled no new well since we released the rig we had operating in the play in early March. Net production for the second quarter averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica activity is focused in the core of the play. Because the acreage in the core is held by production, we can reduce activity in the short term and preserve optionality and longer term upside. We plan to run the asset for cash in 2016 and to resume drilling following a sustained recovery in commodity prices. As a result of applying our distinctive Lean manufacturing approach, over the past few years, we have been able to reduce our Utica drilling cost per foot by approximately 75% and our completion cost per stage by approximately 50%. Using competitor benchmarking, we know that we are achieving some of the lowest D&C cost and drilling some of the longest laterals in the play. These advances position us well to restart activity when prices improve. 
Now turning to the offshore in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. At the Conger Field, a mechanical failure on 1 well resulted in the loss of 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production during the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this well will be worked over in the fourth quarter. 
At our Tubular Bells Field in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, net production averaged 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter due to the remediation work on the second well with a defective valve and a 35-day shutdown to allow for the tieback of nobles government to the Williams owned facility. As mentioned previously, in July, we experienced another valve failure on a third well. This well will remain shut-in until completion of remediation work in the fourth quarter. As a result of the cumulative downtime in 2016 from the 3 valve failures, we have reduced our full year 2016 net production guidance for Tubular Bells to 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
A fifth production well at Tubular Bells was spud mid June, which is scheduled to be brought online in early 2017 and we anticipate starting water injection in the third quarter. 
In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. The planned annual turnaround was completed on schedule in early July. In June, BP and [indiscernible] announced the creation of a new operating entity, [indiscernible] BP ASA. We look forward to working with the new partner to deliver further operational efficiencies and value from future development. 
At the South Arne Field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, net production averaged 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter. Looking forward, a 20-day planned maintenance shutdown is scheduled in the third quarter. 
At the Malaysia/Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, net production averaged 236 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter. There's a scheduled 15-day shutdown in the third quarter to commission the new booster compressor .
Moving to developments. At North Malay Basin, in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, second quarter net production averaged 33 million cubic feet per day through the Early Production System and is expected to remain at about this level through 2016. In the second quarter, we installed 3 wellhead platforms and the jacket for the central processing platform. We also successfully drilled the first 8 of 11 wells for Phase I of the Full Field Development Project, which is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day following startup in 2017. 
At the Stampede development in the Gulf -- in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, the hole left the manufacturing yard in South Korea on schedule. Fabrication and pre-commissioning of the Topsides continued according to plan and drilling operations continued to progress. First oil remains on schedule for 2018. 
In closing, while the second quarter has been challenging as a result of continued low oil prices and short-term production issues, we remain confident in our resilient portfolio and strong long-term growth outlook, which includes our offshore development projects in North Malay Basin and Stampede, our premier positions in the Bakken and Utica, our high-margin reservoir positions at Valhall and South Arne and our position in Guyana, which represents a world-class opportunity.

The corporation incurred a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $509 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $335 million in the second quarter of 2016. 
Turning to Exploration & Production. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $271 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $451 million in the first quarter of 2016. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the second quarter and the first quarter of 2016 were as follows: High realized selling prices improved results by $155 million; lower sales volumes reduced results by $31 million; lower DD&A expense improved results by $36 million; lower production expenses improved results by $9 million; lower exploration expenses improved results by $8 million. All other items improved results by $3 million, for an overall decrease in the second quarter net loss of $180 million. 
In the second quarter, our E&P operations were overlifted compared with production by approximately 1.7 million barrels, which had the effect of decreasing our second quarter net loss by approximately $5 million. 
The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 47% in the second quarter of 2016, compared with a benefit of 41% in the first quarter. 
Turning to Bakken Midstream. Second quarter net income of $11 million decreased from $14 million in the first quarter, primarily due to higher DD&A and interest expense. EBITDA for the Bakken Midstream, excluding the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $68 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $70 million in the first quarter. 
Turning to corporate. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $75 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $72 million in the first quarter. The increase resulted from higher professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses. 
Turning to cash flow for the second quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $257 million. The net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $60 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $615 million. Proceeds from asset sales were $80 million. Net debt repayments were $43 million. Common and preferred dividends paid were $89 million. All other items resulted in an increase in cash of $8 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $462 million. 
Excluding the Bakken Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion, total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of $7.7 billion, and total debt of $5.9 million at June 30, 2016. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio, excluding the Bakken Midstream, was 23.5%. 
Now to provide additional third quarter and full year 2016 guidance. First, for Exploration & Production. We project cash cost for E&P operations to be in the range of $16 to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $16 to $17 per barrel for the full year of 2016, which is up from previous guidance of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel. The increase in full year guidance is due to workovers required at Tubular Bells and Conger and the impact of fixed costs other than lower production volumes. DD&A per barrel is forecast to be $28 to $29 per barrel in the third quarter and $27 to $28 per barrel for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel. The decrease in full year guidance is due to the change in the mix of production. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $44 to $46 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016, and $43 to $45 per barrel for the full year. 
The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $4.10 to $4.20 per barrel for the third quarter of 2016, and $3.80 to $4 per barrel for the full year of 2016 versus prior guidance of $3.55 to $3.95 per barrel, reflecting lower total production volumes. 
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $68 million to the $70 million in the third quarter and $260 million to $280 million for the full year, consistent with previous guidance. 
The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the third quarter and 41% to 45% for the full year of 2016, consistent with previous guidance. 
For Bakken Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the third quarter and $40 million to $50 million for the full year of 2016, consistent with previous guidance. 
Turning the corporate. We expect corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million in the third quarter of 2016, and $100 million to $110 million for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $110 million to $120 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the third quarter of 2016, and $195 million to $205 million for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $205 million to $215 million. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

Obviously, when you gave guidance at the end of the first quarter, some of these issues were already known. So I'm just trying to understand how much of the incremental problems occurred post first quarter. And if possible, can you speak to the production capacity in the Gulf going into next year? Is that impacted in any way or is the capacity basically -- what would you expect the production capacity to recover to, I guess, is what I'm trying to find out."

As we kind of said in our opening remarks, now we've had 3 subsurface safety valve failures in Tubular Bells. The second valve affected us in the second quarter, and the third valve is going to affect us in the third quarter. And in addition to that, we had a mechanical failure at Conger that was unanticipated as well. So the net effect of that, if we look at kind of guidance, for those assets, is about 15,000 barrels a day difference lowering of our guidance. And about 10 of that at Tubular Bells and about 5 of that at Conger. So if we look at capacity, going into the end of the year, we should be back up to that 70,000 to 75,000 barrels a day range in the Gulf of Mexico. So again, going back to the guidance, it was actually about 15,000 on T-Bells and 5,000 on Conger. I said 10 and 5, it's actually 15 and 5, so that gives you a sense for how the big magnitude was of those 2 issues in the Gulf."

We saw about 190 feet of well bearing sandstone in the Upper Cretaceous and remember the Liza 2 well was only 2 miles from the Liza 1 well. So all that taken in context means that the possibility of Skipjack has gone up substantially. So we're excited about it. And certainly, the seismic signature looks very similar to the one on Liza. So but until we get a well on the ground, we can't be 100% positive to the outcome, but very encouraging, very excited."

Our current judgment is that the future spend will fit nicely in our portfolio, as our major project spending and obligations on North Malay basin and Stampede will be falling off over the next couple of years. And so by 2018, North Malay Basin and Stampede will have flipped from material cash users, as John said earlier, approximately $700 million this year to cash generators. So just with the normal phasing, with any development we see this fits nicely in '17 and then with more of the spend happening in 2018 and beyond. And as we look at our portfolio at the capital for Guyana and, like you said, there are other capital it will be falling off in '17, such as like in the Gulf of Mexico and some of the capital we have spent in this year. So it does fit nicely into '17, and we project from our strong cash position that we can fund our capital, including our growth projects, through 2017, even in this low-price environment with the current cash on hand."

What I want a really comment on, because if you think about our performance of delivering a $4.8 million well, substantial reduction from the prior year and the prior quarter, that was while also increasing the stage count from 35 to 50. So that's a major performance improvement, and all of that was lean manufacturing. So I think that will continue in our operation to drive those cost down. Because we know that there's even more efficiencies in spud to spud and so we're going after those in earnest. In the offshore, I think there have definitely been some major price reductions, so rigs, both all the associated equipment is down substantially. We're already seeing some of those benefits in Guyana, for example on the rig rates and seismic boat rates and all that. And then the last kind of penny to drop I think really is the yards in Southeast Asia. So if you look at their capacity loading, it's going to drop substantially over the next 12 months. I think that will open up another cost-reduction opportunity. So for us, Guyana is coming almost at just the right time, because you'll have low cost, not only in drilling, but also in development, if we sanction the project for the development project as well."

So what are the benefits of Liza, which we always want to make sure that we talk about the difference of Guyana, Liza, in general versus let's offshore Gulf of Mexico, Paleogene. And in offshore Guyana, these wells are only 13,000 feet below the mud line, so 18,000 total depth. So the depth is much -- is shorter than obviously the Gulf of Mexico so drilling wells will be cheaper. So reservoir is quite good, so we should get good flowrates out of Guyana for that. There is no salt cover, which one helps with imaging as we were talking about the Skipjack prospect, but again, takes casing strings as while we're drilling wells. So again, that makes it better. And then the other thing from -- I can't talk about the particulars, but it is a PSC, so you get benefit, obviously, in lower prices a bit higher cost recovery. So putting all those together makes Guyana, I'm going to say completely different than the Gulf of Mexico, and therefore, in a lower price environment, Guyana competes. So I think beyond that, you'll have to talk to the operator. As we get to FID and Exxon puts out costs and numbers like that when FID happen, get a better feel for those economics."

So what we'll be doing, we will be spending in Guyana for all those reasons that we've talked about today on the returns that we believe we see in Guyana, so we'll be spending there, we'll be finishing North Malay Basin and we'll be finishing Stampede, to bring on that 35,000 barrels a day in 2018. So along with that, depending on where we see price moving to, if we don't see it moving more to $55, $60, you'll see more of the same what we're doing in portfolio right now as prices move up, than were going to start going back to those opportunities that Greg just talked about that we see across the portfolio."

I will provide an update on the progress we continue to make in managing in the low oil price environment while preserving our long-term growth options. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance from the quarter, and JohnRielly will review our financial results. 
Our company is well positioned for the current price environment and for the eventual recovery in oil prices. We have one of the strongest balance sheet and liquidity positions among our peers, a resilient portfolio and an exceptional long-term growth outlook.
In terms of our balance sheet, we started 2016 by reducing our E&P capital and exploratory budgets to $2.4 billion, 40% below our 2015 spend, and cut activity across our producing portfolio, both onshore and offshore. Since then, we have continued to pursue further capital reductions.
In the second quarter of 2016, we reduced E&P capital and exploratory expenditures by 52% from the second quarter of last year to $485 million. We now project our full year 2016 capital and exploratory expenditures to be $2.1 billion, about 48% below 2015 levels and $300 million lower than our previous forecast. Efforts are underway to make further reductions as well.
We have the balance sheet and liquidity necessary to invest in our future growth. Our 3 growth projects will make us a much stronger company in the next few years in terms of visible production and cash flow growth as well as improving returns.
As you know, we are investing about $700 million in 2016 in 2 offshore developments: North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These 2 projects, which will come online in 2017 and 2018, respectively, will add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and go from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company.
In terms of our third major growth project, Offshore Guyana, on June 30, Hess and coventure partner and operator ExxonMobil announced positive results from the Liza-2 well in the Stabroek Block. The results confirmed a world-class oil discovery one of the largest in the last 10 years, with estimated recoverable resource for the Liza discovery of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We believe the Stabroek Block has the potential to materially contribute to our resource base and future production growth and create significant value for our shareholders.
On July 17, the operators spud the Skipjack well, which is a separate but similar prospect located approximately 25 miles to the northwest of the Liza-1 well. We expect to have the results from this well by our next conference call. Following the Skipjack well, the operator intends to drill a third well at Liza to further appraise the discovery.
In addition, predevelopment activities are underway, and we look forward to working with our partners in the government of Guyana to move this exciting discovery towards a commercialization decision. We believe Liza will offer very attractive economics and expect to call on capital next year to be manageable, given our strong cash position. As plans progress, we will continue to keep you informed.
Turning to our financial results. In the second quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $392 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $335 million or $1.10 per common share compared to an adjusted net loss of $147 million or $0.52 per common share in the second quarter of last year. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and sales volumes, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower cash costs and DD&A. 
Net production averaged 313,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to net production of 386,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter, pro forma for last year's sale of our Algeria asset. While we continue to have strong performance from the Bakken, overall company production during the quarter was primarily affected by unplanned downtime due to subsurface safety valve failures and related remediation work at the Tubular Bells Field and a mechanical issue at one well in the Conger Field, both in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; planned shutdown set several offshore fields, including Tubular Bells and Valhall Field in Norway, and reduced capital investment as compared with last year. Due to the unplanned downtime at the Tubular Bells and Conger fields, which Greg will address in more detail, we are revising our overall company production forecast for 2016 to a range of 315,000 to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, from our previous guidance of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Turning to the Bakken. Net production in the second quarter of 2016 averaged 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter of 2015, reflecting our reduced drilling program. Through the use of Lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team continues to drill some of the lowest cost and most productive wells in the play. Notably, during the second quarter, we've reduced drilling and completion costs 14% from the year ago quarter to an average of $4.8 million per well, even as we shifted from 35-stage to 50-stage wells, which is delivering a 15% to 20% uplift in initial production rates. For full year 2016, we are narrowing our Bakken production forecast to a range of 100,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing the upper end of our previous guidance of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our focus remains on value, not volume, and we do not believe that accelerating production or drilling up our best locations in the current low price environment is in the best interest of our shareholders. While our Bakken acreage can generate attractive returns at current low prices, we will remain disciplined and begin to increase activity there when oil prices approach $60 per barrel. As we see that a price recovery is sustained, we will also then resume drilling activities in the Utica and offshore, where we have numerous high return investment opportunities.
In summary, we have one of the strongest balance sheets and most attractive long-term growth profiles among our peers. We remain confident in our ability to manage through the current environment and deliver strong production and cash flow growth as oil prices recover. Our resilient portfolio provides an attractive mix of short-cycle and long-cycle growth options, including an unparalleled position in the Bakken, 2 significant offshore developments that will become cash generators starting 2017 and 2018, and the recent world-class oil discovery in Guyana that has the potential to create material value for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."

I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. As John said, we are focused on maximizing value, not volume, and have reduced our drilling program to levels that",1715,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. As John said, we are focused on maximizing value, not volume, and have reduced our drilling program to levels that allow us to manage near-term cash flow while maintaining our operating capabilities in the current low price environment. When oil prices approach $60 per barrel, we will begin to ramp up activity, starting with the Bakken. As the price recovery is sustained, we will then resume drilling activities in the Utica and offshore. However, given that oil prices have remained below $50 barrels per day barrel, we have further reduced our 2016 E&P capital and exploratory budget to $2.1 billion from our previous guidance of $2.4 billion, which represents a 48% reduction from 2015. This decrease reflects our continuing focus on reducing costs across our portfolio.
Now moving to production. In the second quarter, we averaged 313,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of 320,000 to 325,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter. As discussed on our last call, we had a series of extended planned shutdowns at the Valhall Field in Norway and at the Tubular Bells and Conger fields in the Gulf of Mexico during the second quarter. In addition, we experienced a mechanical issue that affected one well at the Conger Field and had further downtime at the Tubular Bells Field to replace a second defective subsurface safety valve.
In July, we have experienced a third subsurface safety valve failure. We're actively pursuing legal claims against the vendor who provided the defective valves at Tubular Bells. The third valve failure at Tubular Bells and the mechanical issue with the Conger well will be remediated in the fourth quarter. These issues, along with decreased investment levels, led us to reduce our full year 2016 production guidance to 315,000 to 325,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya.
We forecast company-wide production in the third quarter to average between 310,000 and 315,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Our third quarter forecast reflects planned downtime at the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand, the South Arne field in Denmark and the mechanical issues at Tubular Bells and Conger as well as hurricane contingency in the Gulf of Mexico and reduced investment levels.
While preserving the strength of our balance sheet in the current environment is crucial, it is equally important for us to be well positioned for price recovery by maintaining both our operating capabilities and the opportunities to drive future profitable growth. It is, therefore, significant to Hess that at the end of June ExxonMobil announced the drilling results from the Liza-2 well, the second well in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana in which Hess holds a 30% interest. The Liza-2 well encountered more than 190 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs in Upper Cretaceous formations. After successfully concluding an extensive well evaluation program and extended production test, ExxonMobil confirmed Liza as world-class discovery, with a recoverable resource of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The Stabroek Block extends to 6.6 million acres. On July 17, we spud an exploration well on a second prospect, Skipjack, located approximately 25 miles Northwest of Liza. We remain excited not only about the Liza discovery, but the wider opportunity set on this block, which has the potential to be transformational to our company.
Turning now to unconventionals. Net production from the Bakken averaged 106,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, in line with the guidance of 110,000 to -- 100,000 to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day given on our first quarter call. We maintained an average of 3 Bakken rigs in the second quarter. We plan to drop the 2 rigs in August, and we'll begin to increase activity when oil prices approach $60 per barrel. Over 2016, we now expect to drill 65 wells and bring 90 new wells online.
In the first half of 2016, we drilled 39 new wells and brought 57 new wells online, and we plan to drill 26 new wells and bring 33 online in the second half of the year, as the lower rig count takes effect. 
In the second quarter, our average drilling and completion cost was $4.8 million per well. I'm very proud of our Bakken team, who has driven down D&C cost by 14% versus the year ago quarter, even as we transition from our previous 35-stage completion design to our new 50-stage completion design. With the higher stage count, we expect to see 30-day IP rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second half of 2016, and expect that these wells in the core of the play will show a 7% uplift in EUR per well.
As a result of the increased productivity and EUR and lower drilling and completion cost, we have significantly increased the number of well locations that are economic at lower prices. Because of our continued strong performance, we are narrowing our full year 2016 net production guidance for the Bakken to 100,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the upper end of the 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day range that we provided in January.
Moving to the Utica. The joint venture has drilled no new wells since we released the rig we had operating in the play in early March. Net production for the second quarter averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter.
Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica activity is focused in the core of the play. Because the acreage in the core is held by production, we can reduce activity in the short term and preserve optionality and longer-term upside. We plan to run the asset for cash in 2016 and to resume drilling following a sustained recovery in commodity prices.
As a result of applying our distinctive Lean manufacturing approach, over the past few years, we've been able to reduce our Utica drilling cost per foot by approximately 75% and our completion cost per stage by approximately 50%. Using competitor benchmarking, we know that we are achieving some of the lowest D&C costs and drilling some of the longest laterals in the play. These advances position us well to restart activity when prices improve. 
Now turning to the offshore in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Net production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. At the Conger Field, a mechanical failure on one well resulted in the loss of 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production during the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this well will be worked over in the fourth quarter.
At our Tubular Bells Field in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, net production averaged 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter due to the remediation work on the second well with a defective valve and a 35-day shutdown to allow for the tieback of Noble's Gunflint to the Williams owned facility.
As mentioned previously, in July, we experienced another valve failure on a third well. This well will remain shut-in until completion of remediation work in the fourth quarter. As a result of the cumulative downtime in 2016 from the 3 valve failures, we have reduced our full year 2016 net production guidance for Tubular Bells to 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
A fifth production well at Tubular Bells was spud mid-June, which is scheduled to be brought online in early 2017, and we anticipate starting water injection in the third quarter.
In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. The planned annual turnaround was completed on schedule in early July.
In June, BP and Aker announced the creation of a new operating entity, Aker BP ASA. We look forward to working with the new partner to deliver further operational efficiencies and value from future development.
At the South Arne field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, net production averaged 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter. Looking forward, a 20-day planned maintenance shutdown is scheduled in the third quarter.
At the Malaysia/Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, net production averaged 236 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter. There's a scheduled 15-day shutdown in the third quarter to commission the new booster compressor.
Moving to developments. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, second quarter net production averaged 33 million cubic feet per day through the Early Production System and is expected to remain at about this level through 2016. In the second quarter, we installed 3 wellhead platforms and the jacket for the central processing platform. We also successfully drilled the first 8 of 11 wells for Phase 1 of the full field development project, which is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day following start-up in 2017.
At the Stampede development in the Gulf -- in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, the hole left the manufacturing yard in South Korea on schedule. Fabrication and precommissioning of the Topsides continue according to plan and drilling operations continue to progress. First oil remains on schedule for 2018.
In closing, while the second quarter has been challenging as a result of continued low oil prices and short-term production issues, we remain confident in our resilient portfolio and strong long-term growth outlook, which includes our offshore development projects in North Malay Basin and Stampede, our premier positions in the Bakken and Utica, our high-margin chalk reservoir positions at Valhall and South Arne and our position in Guyana, which represents a world-class opportunity. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2016.The corporation incurred a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $509 million in the firs",960,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2016.
The corporation incurred a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $509 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $335 million in the second quarter of 2016.
Turning to Exploration and Production. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $271 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $451 million in the first quarter of 2016.
The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the second quarter and the first quarter of 2016 were as follows: Higher realized selling prices improved results by $155 million; lower sales volumes reduced results by $31 million; lower DD&A expense improved results by $36 million; lower production expenses improved results by $9 million; lower exploration expenses improved results by $8 million; all other items improved results by $3 million, for an overall decrease in the second quarter net loss of $180 million. 
In the second quarter, our E&P operations were overlifted compared with production by approximately 1.7 million barrels, which had the effect of decreasing our second quarter net loss by approximately $5 million. 
The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 47% in the second quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 41% in the first quarter.
Turning to Bakken Midstream. Second quarter net income of $11 million decreased from $14 million in the first quarter, primarily due to higher DD&A and interest expense. EBITDA for the Bakken Midstream, excluding the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $68 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $70 million in the first quarter.
Turning to corporate. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $75 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $72 million in the first quarter. The increase resulted from higher professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses. 
Turning to cash flow for the second quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $257 million. The net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $60 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $615 million. Proceeds from asset sales were $80 million. Net debt repayments were $43 million. Common and preferred dividends paid were $89 million. All other items resulted in an increase in cash of $8 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $462 million.
Excluding the Bakken Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion, total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of $7.7 billion, and total debt of $5.9 million at June 30, 2016. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio, excluding the Bakken Midstream, was 23.5%.
Now to provide additional third quarter and full year 2016 guidance. First, for Exploration & Production. We project cash cost for E&P operations to be in the range of $16 to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $16 to $17 per barrel for the full year of 2016, which is up from previous guidance of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel. The increase in full year guidance is due to workovers required at Tubular Bells and Conger and the impact of fixed costs spread over lower production volumes.
DD&A per barrel is forecast to be $28 to $29 per barrel in the third quarter and $27 to $28 per barrel for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel. The decrease in full year guidance is due to the change in the mix of production. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $44 to $46 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016 and $43 to $45 per barrel for the full year. 
The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $4.10 to $4.20 per barrel for the third quarter of 2016 and $3.80 to $4 per barrel for the full year of 2016 versus prior guidance of $3.55 to $3.95 per barrel, reflecting lower total production volumes.
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $60 million to the $70 million in the third quarter and $260 million to $280 million for the full year, consistent with previous guidance.
The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the third quarter and 41% to 45% for the full year of 2016, consistent with previous guidance. 
For Bakken Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the third quarter and $40 million to $50 million for the full year of 2016, consistent with previous guidance.
Turning to corporate. We expect corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the third quarter of 2016 and $100 million to $110 million for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $110 million to $120 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the third quarter of 2016 and $195 million to $205 million for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $205 million to $215 million. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

Yes, the -- as we kind of said in our opening remarks, now we've had 3 subsurface safety valve failures in Tubular Bells. The second valve affected us in the second quarter, and the third valve is going to affect us in the third quarter. And in addition to that, we had a mechanical failure at Conger that was unanticipated as well. So the net effect of that, if we look at kind of guidance for those assets, is about 15,000 barrels a day difference lowering of our guidance, and about 10,000 of that at Tubular Bells and about 5,000 of that at Conger. So if we look at capacity, going into the end of the year, we should be back up to that 70,000 to 75,000 barrels a day range in the Gulf of Mexico. So again, going back to the guidance, it was actually about 15,000 on T-Bells and 5,000 on Conger. I said 10,000 and 5,000. It's actually 15,000 and 5,000.

And remember that the Liza-2 well was only 2 miles from the Liza-1 well. So all that taken in context means that the possibility [ph] of Skipjack has gone up substantially. So we're excited about it. And certainly, the seismic signature looks very similar to the one on Liza. So -- but until we get a well on the ground, we can't be 100% positive as to the outcome.

As John mentioned, we do see this as being manageable at this point. Our current judgment is that the future spend will fit nicely in our portfolio, as our major project spending and obligations on North Malay Basin and Stampede will be falling off over the next couple of years. And so by 2018, North Malay Basin and Stampede will have flipped from material cash users, as John said earlier, approximately $700 million this year to cash generators. So just with the normal phasing, with any development, we see this fits nicely in '17 and then with more of the spend happening 2018 and beyond. And as we look at our portfolio at the capital for Guyana and, like you said, there are other capital it will be falling off in '17, such as like in the Gulf of Mexico and some of the capital we have spent in Denmark this year.

Now with the 15% to 20% uplift in the 50-stage frac, it's probably somewhere between 3 and 4 as a result of that uplift. Regarding the cost reductions, I think, obviously in the onshore, I think that's largely flattened out. So I think further cost reductions there will be minimal. The ones that we are accomplishing are due to lean manufacturing, which is continuing to chop out waste and inefficiency and all those things. I want to really comment on that because if you think about our performance of delivering a $4.8 million well, substantial reduction from the prior year and the prior quarter, that was while also increasing the stage count from 35 to 50. So that's a major performance improvement, and all of that was lean manufacturing. So I think that will continue in our operation to drive those costs down because we know that there's even more efficiencies in spud to spud and so we're going after those in earnest. In the offshore, I think there have definitely been some major price reductions. So rigs, boats and all the associated equipment is down substantially. We're already seeing some of those benefits in Guyana, for example on the rig rates and seismic boat rates and all that. And then the last kind of penny to drop I think is really the yards in Southeast Asia. So if you look at their capacity loading, it's going to drop substantially over the next 12 months, and I think that will open up another cost reduction opportunity. So for us, Guyana is coming almost at just the right time because you'll have low cost, not only in drilling but also in development, if we sanction a project there for the development project as well."

So what are the benefits of Liza, let's just say because we always want to make sure we talk about the difference of Guyana, Liza, in general versus, let's say, offshore Gulf of Mexico, Paleogene. So in offshore Guyana, these wells are only 13,000 feet below the mud line. So 18,000 total depth. So the depth is much -- is shorter than obviously the Gulf of Mexico. So drilling wells will be cheaper. So reservoir is quite good. So we should get good flow rates out of Guyana for that. There is no salt cover, which one helps with imaging as we were talking about the Skipjack prospect, but again, takes casing strings out while we're drilling well. So again, that makes it better. And then the other thing from a -- I can't talk about the particulars, but it is a PSC. So you get benefit, obviously, at lower prices with higher cost recovery. So putting all those together makes Guyana, I'm going to say, completely different than the Gulf of Mexico. And therefore, in lower-price environments, Guyana competes. So I think beyond that, you'll have to talk to the operator. And as we get to FID and Exxon puts out costs and numbers like that as -- when FID happens, you can get a better feel for those economics."

Can you just talk a bit more about really how you see yourselves in terms of whether this is the best, say, to throw out yet another potential development of a similar scale to Liza or another? Would you be looking to reduce your position? Or do you really want to run this one through and stay with the fact that you've got a world-class operation and such material stake. I'm just struggling to sort of to get my arms around the scale and how to scale relates to Hess and whether you can help us with whether if it's within this current range you would want to stay fully invested at the current level? Or if there's some sort of trigger point, just to help us out?"

John and I met with the senior leadership of Aker BP, and I will say that we left very encouraged. They have a culture similar to ours, meaning an independent. And they like to get after staff, and they're innovative. And in particular, they're practitioners of lean. And as you know, us applying lean on Valhall through BP has led to a substantial reduction in abandonment cost, well abandonment cost by up to 50% as a result of applying lean and then drilling cost for new wells on the order of 30% with much more to come. So we're excited about having another partner in this venture that also is a lean practitioner. We think there'll be a lot of power in that and really driving down the cost and delivering value from Valhall."

So what we'll be doing, we will be spending in Guyana for all those reasons that we've talked about today on the returns that we believe we see in Guyana. So we'll be spending there. We'll be finishing North Malay Basin, and we'll be finishing Stampede to bring on that 35,000 barrels a day in 2018.

I will provide an update on the progress we continue to make in managing in a low oil price environment while preserving our long-term growth options. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance from the quarter, and John Rielly will review our financial results. 
Our company is well positioned for the current price environment and for the eventual recovery in oil prices. We have one of the strongest balance sheet and liquidity positions among our peers, a resilient portfolio and an exceptional long-term growth outlook.
In terms of our balance sheet, we started 2016 by reducing our E&P capital and exploratory budgets to $2.4 billion, 40% below our 2015 spend, and cut activity across our producing portfolio, both onshore and offshore. Since then, we have continued to pursue further capital reductions.
In the second quarter of 2016, we reduced E&P capital and exploratory expenditures by 52% from the second quarter of last year to $485 million. We now project our full year 2016 capital and exploratory expenditures to be $2.1 billion, about 48% below 2015 levels and $300 million lower than our previous forecast. Efforts are underway to make further reductions as well.
We have the balance sheet and liquidity necessary to invest in our future growth. Our 3 growth projects will make us a much stronger company in the next few years in terms of visible production and cash flow growth, as well as improving returns.
As you know, we are investing about $700 million in 2016 in 2 offshore developments: North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These 2 projects, which will come online in 2017 and 2018, respectively, will add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and go from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company.
In terms of our third major growth project, offshore Guyana, on June 30, Hess and co-venture partner and operator ExxonMobil announced positive results from the Liza-2 well in the Stabroek Block. The results confirmed a world-class oil discovery, one of the largest in the last 10 years, with estimated recoverable resource for the Liza discovery of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We believe the Stabroek Block has the potential to materially contribute to our resource base and future production growth and create significant value for our shareholders.
On July 17, the operator spud the Skipjack well, which is a separate but similar prospect located approximately 25 miles to the northwest of the Liza-1 well. We expect to have the results from this well by our next conference call. Following the Skipjack well, the operator intends to drill a third well at Liza to further appraise the discovery.
In addition, predevelopment activities are underway, and we look forward to working with our partners in the government of Guyana to move this exciting discovery towards a commercialization decision. We believe Liza will offer very attractive economics and expect the call on capital next year to be manageable, given our strong cash position. As plans progress, we will continue to keep you informed.
Turning to our financial results. In the second quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $392 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $335 million or $1.10 per common share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $147 million or $0.52 per common share in the second quarter of last year. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and sales volumes, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower cash costs and DD&A. 
Net production averaged 313,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to net production of 386,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter, pro forma for last year's sale of our Algeria asset. While we continue to have strong performance from the Bakken, overall company production during the quarter was primarily affected by: Unplanned downtime due to subsurface safety valve failures and related remediation work at the Tubular Bells Field and a mechanical issue at one well in the Conger Field, both in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; planned shutdowns at several offshore fields, including Tubular Bells and Valhall Field in Norway; and reduced capital investment as compared with last year. Due to the unplanned downtime at the Tubular Bells and Conger fields, which Greg will address in more detail, we are revising our overall company production forecast for 2016 to a range of 315,000 to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, from our previous guidance of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Turning to the Bakken. Net production in the second quarter of 2016 averaged 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter of 2015, reflecting our reduced drilling program. Through the use of lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team continues to drill some of the lowest cost and most productive wells in the play. Notably, during the second quarter, we reduced drilling and completion costs 14% from the year ago quarter to an average of $4.8 million per well, even as we shifted from 35-stage to 50-stage wells, which is delivering a 15% to 20% uplift in initial production rates. For full year 2016, we are narrowing our Bakken production forecast to a range of 100,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing the upper end of our previous guidance of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our focus remains on value, not volume, and we do not believe that accelerating production or drilling up our best locations in the current low price environment is in the best interest of our shareholders. While our Bakken acreage can generate attractive returns at current low prices, we will remain disciplined and begin to increase activity there when oil prices approach $60 per barrel. As we see that a price recovery is sustained, we will also then resume drilling activities in the Utica and offshore, where we have numerous high-return investment opportunities.
In summary, we have one of the strongest balance sheets and most attractive long-term growth profiles among our peers. We remain confident in our ability to manage through the current environment and deliver strong production and cash flow growth as oil prices recover. Our resilient portfolio provides an attractive mix of short-cycle and long-cycle growth options, including an unparalleled position in the Bakken, 2 significant offshore developments that will become cash generators starting in 2017 and 2018, and the recent world-class oil discovery in Guyana that has the potential to create material value for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."

I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy.

I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. As John said, we are focused on maximizing value, not volume, and have reduced our drilling program to levels that allow us to manage near-term cash flow while maintaining our operating capabilities in the current low price environment. When oil prices approach $60 per barrel, we will begin to ramp up activity, starting with the Bakken. As the price recovery is sustained, we will then resume drilling activities in the Utica and offshore. However, given that oil prices have remained below $50 per barrel, we have further reduced our 2016 E&P capital and exploratory budget to $2.1 billion from our previous guidance of $2.4 billion, which represents a 48% reduction from 2015. This decrease reflects our continuing focus on reducing costs across our portfolio.
Now moving to production. In the second quarter, we averaged 313,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of 320,000 to 325,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter. As discussed on our last call, we had a series of extended planned shutdowns at the Valhall Field in Norway and at the Tubular Bells and Conger fields in the Gulf of Mexico during the second quarter. In addition, we experienced a mechanical issue that affected one well at the Conger Field and had further downtime at the Tubular Bells Field to replace a second defective subsurface safety valve.
In July, we have experienced a third subsurface safety valve failure. We are actively pursuing legal claims against the vendor who provided the defective valves at Tubular Bells. The third valve failure at Tubular Bells and the mechanical issue at the Conger well will be remediated in the fourth quarter. These issues, along with decreased investment levels, led us to reduce our full year 2016 production guidance to 315,000 to 325,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya.
We forecast company-wide production in the third quarter to average between 310,000 and 315,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Our third quarter forecast reflects planned downtime at the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand, the South Arne field in Denmark and the mechanical issues at Tubular Bells and Conger, as well as hurricane contingency in the Gulf of Mexico and reduced investment levels.
While preserving the strength of our balance sheet in the current environment is crucial, it is equally important for us to be well positioned for price recovery by maintaining both our operating capabilities and the opportunities to drive future profitable growth. It is therefore significant to Hess that at the end of June, ExxonMobil announced the drilling results from the Liza-2 well, the second well in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana in which Hess holds a 30% interest. The Liza-2 well encountered more than 190 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs in Upper Cretaceous formations. After successfully concluding an extensive well evaluation program and extended production test, ExxonMobil confirmed Liza as world-class discovery, with a recoverable resource of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The Stabroek Block extends to 6.6 million acres. On July 17, we spud an exploration well on a second prospect, Skipjack, located approximately 25 miles northwest of Liza. We remain excited not only about the Liza discovery, but the wider opportunity set on this block, which has the potential to be transformational to our company.
Turning now to unconventionals. Net production from the Bakken averaged 106,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, in line with the guidance of 110,000 to -- 100,000 to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day given on our first quarter call. We maintained an average of 3 Bakken rigs in the second quarter. We plan to drop the 2 rigs in August, and we'll begin to increase activity when oil prices approach $60 per barrel. Over 2016, we now expect to drill 65 wells and bring 90 new wells online.
In the first half of 2016, we drilled 39 new wells and brought 57 new wells online, and we plan to drill 26 new wells and bring 33 online in the second half of the year, as the lower rig count takes effect. 
In the second quarter, our average drilling and completion cost was $4.8 million per well. I'm very proud of our Bakken team, who has driven down D&C cost by 14% versus the year ago quarter, even as we transition from our previous 35-stage completion design to our new 50-stage completion design. With the higher stage count, we expect to see 30-day IP rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second half of 2016, and expect that these wells in the core of the play will show a 7% uplift in EUR per well.
As a result of the increased productivity and EUR and lower drilling and completion cost, we have significantly increased the number of well locations that are economic at lower prices. Because of our continued strong performance, we are narrowing our full year 2016 net production guidance for the Bakken to 100,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the upper end of the 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day range that we provided in January.
Moving to the Utica. The joint venture has drilled no new wells since we released the rig we had operating in the play in early March. Net production for the second quarter averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter.
Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica activity is focused in the core of the play. Because the acreage in the core is held by production, we can reduce activity in the short term and preserve optionality and longer-term upside. We plan to run the asset for cash in 2016 and to resume drilling following a sustained recovery in commodity prices.
As a result of applying our distinctive lean manufacturing approach, over the past few years, we've been able to reduce our Utica drilling cost per foot by approximately 75% and our completion cost per stage by approximately 50%. Using competitor benchmarking, we know that we are achieving some of the lowest D&C costs and drilling some of the longest laterals in the play. These advances position us well to restart activity when prices improve. 
Now turning to the offshore in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Net production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. At the Conger Field, a mechanical failure on one well resulted in the loss of 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production during the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this well will be worked over in the fourth quarter.
At our Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, net production averaged 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter due to the remediation work on the second well with a defective valve and a 35-day shutdown to allow for the tieback of Noble's Gunflint to the Williams-owned facility.
As mentioned previously, in July, we experienced another valve failure on a third well. This well will remain shut-in until completion of remediation work in the fourth quarter. As a result of the cumulative downtime in 2016 from the 3 valve failures, we have reduced our full year 2016 net production guidance for Tubular Bells to 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
A fifth production well at Tubular Bells was spud mid-June, which is scheduled to be brought online in early 2017, and we anticipate starting water injection in the third quarter.
In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. The planned annual turnaround was completed on schedule in early July.
In June, BP and Aker announced the creation of a new operating entity, Aker BP ASA. We look forward to working with the new partner to deliver further operational efficiencies and value from future development.
At the South Arne field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, net production averaged 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter. Looking forward, a 20-day planned maintenance shutdown is scheduled in the third quarter.
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, net production averaged 236 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter. There is a scheduled 15-day shutdown in the third quarter to commission the new booster compressor.
Moving to developments. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, second quarter net production averaged 33 million cubic feet per day through the Early Production System and is expected to remain at about this level through 2016. In the second quarter, we installed 3 wellhead platforms and the jacket for the central processing platform. We also successfully drilled the first 8 of 11 wells for Phase 1 of the full field development project, which is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day following startup in 2017.
At the Stampede development in the Gulf -- in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, the hull left the manufacturing yard in South Korea on schedule. Fabrication and precommissioning of the Topsides continue according to plan and drilling operations continue to progress. First oil remains on schedule for 2018.
In closing, while the second quarter has been challenging as a result of continued low oil prices and short-term production issues, we remain confident in our resilient portfolio and strong long-term growth outlook, which includes our offshore development projects in North Malay Basin and Stampede, our premier positions in the Bakken and Utica, our high-margin chalk reservoir positions at Valhall and South Arne and our position in Guyana, which represents a world-class opportunity. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2016.The corporation incurred a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared with a net loss of $509 million in the fir",959,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2016.
The corporation incurred a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared with a net loss of $509 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $335 million in the second quarter of 2016.
Turning to Exploration and Production. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $271 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to a net loss of $451 million in the first quarter of 2016.
The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the second quarter and the first quarter of 2016 were as follows: Higher realized selling prices improved results by $155 million; lower sales volumes reduced results by $31 million; lower DD&A expense improved results by $36 million; lower production expenses improved results by $9 million; lower exploration expenses improved results by $8 million; all other items improved results by $3 million, for an overall decrease in the second quarter net loss of $180 million. 
In the second quarter, our E&P operations were overlifted compared with production by approximately 1.7 million barrels, which had the effect of decreasing our second quarter net loss by approximately $5 million. 
The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 47% in the second quarter of 2016, compared with a benefit of 41% in the first quarter.
Turning to Bakken Midstream. Second quarter net income of $11 million decreased from $14 million in the first quarter, primarily due to higher DD&A and interest expense. EBITDA for the Bakken Midstream, excluding the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $68 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $70 million in the first quarter.
Turning to corporate. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $75 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $72 million in the first quarter. The increase resulted from higher professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses. 
Turning to cash flow for the second quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $257 million. The net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $60 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $615 million. Proceeds from asset sales were $80 million. Net debt repayments were $43 million. Common and preferred dividends paid were $89 million. All other items resulted in an increase in cash of $8 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $462 million.
Excluding the Bakken Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion, total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of $7.7 billion, and total debt of $5.9 billion at June 30, 2016. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio, excluding the Bakken Midstream, was 23.5%.
Now to provide additional third quarter and full year 2016 guidance. First, for Exploration and Production. We project cash cost for E&P operations to be in the range of $16 to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $16 to $17 per barrel for the full year of 2016, which is up from previous guidance of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel. The increase in full year guidance is due to workovers required at Tubular Bells and Conger and the impact of fixed costs spread over lower production volumes.
DD&A per barrel is forecast to be $28 to $29 per barrel in the third quarter and $27 to $28 per barrel for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel. The decrease in full year guidance is due to the change in the mix of production. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $44 to $46 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016 and $43 to $45 per barrel for the full year. 
The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $4.10 to $4.20 per barrel for the third quarter of 2016 and $3.80 to $4 per barrel for the full year of 2016, versus prior guidance of $3.55 to $3.95 per barrel, reflecting lower total production volumes.
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million in the third quarter and $260 million to $280 million for the full year, consistent with previous guidance.
The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the third quarter and 41% to 45% for the full year of 2016, consistent with previous guidance. 
For Bakken Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the third quarter and $40 million to $50 million for the full year of 2016, consistent with previous guidance.
Turning to corporate. We expect corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the third quarter of 2016 and $100 million to $110 million for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $110 million to $120 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the third quarter of 2016 and $195 million to $205 million for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $205 million to $215 million. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

Yes, the -- as we kind of said in our opening remarks, now we've had 3 subsurface safety valve failures in Tubular Bells. The second valve affected us in the second quarter, and the third valve is going to affect us in the third quarter. And in addition to that, we had a mechanical failure at Conger that was unanticipated as well. So the net effect of that, if we look at kind of guidance for those assets, is about 15,000 barrels a day difference lowering of our guidance, and about 10,000 of that is at Tubular Bells and about 5,000 of that is at Conger. So if we look at capacity, going into the end of the year, we should be back up to that 70,000 to 75,000 barrels a day range in the Gulf of Mexico. So again, going back to the guidance, it was actually about 15,000 on T-Bells and 5,000 on Conger. I said 10,000 and 5,000. It's actually 15,000 and 5,000.

As John mentioned, we do see this as being manageable at this point. Our current judgment is that the future spend will fit nicely in our portfolio, as our major project spending and obligations on North Malay Basin and Stampede will be falling off over the next couple of years. And so by 2018, North Malay Basin and Stampede will have flipped from material cash users, as John said earlier, approximately $700 million this year, to cash generators. So just with the normal phasing, with any development, we see this fits nicely in '17 and then with more of the spend happening 2018 and beyond. And as we look at our portfolio at the capital for Guyana, and like you said, there are other capital that will be falling off in '17, such as like in the Gulf of Mexico and some of the capital we have spent in Denmark this year. So it does fit nicely into '17. And we project from our strong cash position that we can fund our capital, including our growth projects through 2017, even in this low-price environment, with the current cash on hand."

Now with the 15% to 20% uplift in the 50-stage fracs, it's probably somewhere between 3 and 4 as a result of that uplift. Regarding the cost reductions, I think, obviously in the onshore, I think that's largely flattened out. So I think further cost reductions there will be minimal. The ones that we are accomplishing are due to lean manufacturing, which is continuing to chop out waste and inefficiency and all those things. I want to really comment on that, because if you think about our performance of delivering a $4.8 million well, substantial reduction from the prior year and the prior quarter, that was while also increasing the stage count from 35 to 50. So that's a major performance improvement, and all of that was lean manufacturing. So I think that will continue in our operation to drive those costs down, because we know that there's even more efficiencies in spud to spud and so we're going after those in earnest. In the offshore, I think there have definitely been some major price reductions. So rigs, boats and all the associated equipment is down substantially. We're already seeing some of those benefits in Guyana, for example, on the rig rates and seismic boat rates and all that. And then the last kind of penny to drop I think is really the yards in Southeast Asia. So if you look at their capacity loading, it's going to drop substantially over the next 12 months, and I think that will open up another cost reduction opportunity. So for us, Guyana is coming almost at just the right time, because you'll have low costs, not only in drilling but also in development, if we sanction a project there for the development project as well."

So in offshore Guyana, these wells are only 13,000 feet below the mud line. So 18,000 total depth. So the depth is much -- is shorter than obviously the Gulf of Mexico. So drilling wells will be cheaper. So reservoir is quite good. So we should get good flow rates out of Guyana for that. There is no salt cover, which one, helps with imaging, as we were talking about the Skipjack prospect, but again, takes casing strings out while we're drilling wells. So again, that makes it better. And then the other thing from a -- I can't talk about the particulars, but it is a PSC. So you get benefit, obviously, at lower prices with higher cost recovery. So putting all those together makes Guyana, I'm going to say, completely different than the Gulf of Mexico. And therefore, in lower-price environments, Guyana competes. So I think beyond that, you'll have to talk to the operator.

As from the oil price standpoint, to get the prices up for us to put more rigs back to work, and in this great position that we have in the Bakken, that's when we start to see that and that growth, combined with any improvements in the MLP market, is when we'd be looking at timing of that."

I will provide an update on the progress we continue to make in managing in a low oil price environment while preserving our long-term growth options. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance from the quarter, and John Rielly will review our financial results. 
Our company is well positioned for the current price environment and for the eventual recovery in oil prices. We have one of the strongest balance sheet and liquidity positions among our peers, a resilient portfolio and an exceptional long-term growth outlook.
In terms of our balance sheet, we started 2016 by reducing our E&P capital and exploratory budgets to $2.4 billion, 40% below our 2015 spend, and cut activity across our producing portfolio, both onshore and offshore. Since then, we have continued to pursue further capital reductions.
In the second quarter of 2016, we reduced E&P capital and exploratory expenditures by 52% from the second quarter of last year to $485 million. We now project our full year 2016 capital and exploratory expenditures to be $2.1 billion, about 48% below 2015 levels and $300 million lower than our previous forecast. Efforts are underway to make further reductions as well.
We have the balance sheet and liquidity necessary to invest in our future growth. Our 3 growth projects will make us a much stronger company in the next few years in terms of visible production and cash flow growth as well as improving returns.
As you know, we are investing about $700 million in 2016 in 2 offshore developments: North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These 2 projects, which will come online in 2017 and 2018, respectively, will add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and go from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company.
In terms of our third major growth project, offshore Guyana, on June 30, Hess and co-venture partner and operator ExxonMobil announced positive results from the Liza-2 well in the Stabroek Block. The results confirmed a world-class oil discovery, one of the largest in the last 10 years, with estimated recoverable resource for the Liza discovery of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We believe the Stabroek Block has the potential to materially contribute to our resource base and future production growth and create significant value for our shareholders.
On July 17, the operator spud the Skipjack well, which is a separate but similar prospect located approximately 25 miles to the northwest of the Liza-1 well. We expect to have the results from this well by our next conference call. Following the Skipjack well, the operator intends to drill a third well at Liza to further appraise the discovery.
In addition, predevelopment activities are underway, and we look forward to working with our partners in the government of Guyana to move this exciting discovery towards a commercialization decision. We believe Liza will offer very attractive economics and expect the call on capital next year to be manageable, given our strong cash position. As plans progress, we will continue to keep you informed.
Turning to our financial results. In the second quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $392 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $335 million or $1.10 per common share compared to an adjusted net loss of $147 million or $0.52 per common share in the second quarter of last year. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and sales volumes, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower cash costs and DD&A. 
Net production averaged 313,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to net production of 386,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter, pro forma for last year's sale of our Algeria asset. While we continue to have strong performance from the Bakken, overall company production during the quarter was primarily affected by: Unplanned downtime due to subsurface safety valve failures and related remediation work at the Tubular Bells Field and a mechanical issue at one well in the Conger Field, both in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; planned shutdowns at several offshore fields, including Tubular Bells and Valhall Field in Norway; and reduced capital investment as compared with last year. Due to the unplanned downtime at the Tubular Bells and Conger fields, which Greg will address in more detail, we are revising our overall company production forecast for 2016 to a range of 315,000 to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, from our previous guidance of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Turning to the Bakken. Net production in the second quarter of 2016 averaged 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter of 2015, reflecting our reduced drilling program. Through the use of lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team continues to drill some of the lowest cost and most productive wells in the play. Notably, during the second quarter, we reduced drilling and completion costs 14% from the year ago quarter to an average of $4.8 million per well, even as we shifted from 35-stage to 50-stage wells, which is delivering a 15% to 20% uplift in initial production rates. For full year 2016, we are narrowing our Bakken production forecast to a range of 100,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing the upper end of our previous guidance of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Our focus remains on value, not volume, and we do not believe that accelerating production or drilling up our best locations in the current low price environment is in the best interest of our shareholders. While our Bakken acreage can generate attractive returns at current low prices, we will remain disciplined and begin to increase activity there when oil prices approach $60 per barrel. As we see that a price recovery is sustained, we will also then resume drilling activities in the Utica and offshore, where we have numerous high-return investment opportunities.
In summary, we have one of the strongest balance sheets and most attractive long-term growth profiles among our peers. We remain confident in our ability to manage through the current environment and deliver strong production and cash flow growth as oil prices recover. Our resilient portfolio provides an attractive mix of short-cycle and long-cycle growth options, including an unparalleled position in the Bakken, 2 significant offshore developments that will become cash generators starting in 2017 and 2018, and the recent world-class oil discovery in Guyana that has the potential to create material value for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."

I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy.

I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. As John said, we are focused on maximizing value, not volume, and have reduced our drilling program to levels that allow us to manage near-term cash flow while maintaining our operating capabilities in the current low price environment. When oil prices approach $60 per barrel, we will begin to ramp up activity, starting with the Bakken. As the price recovery is sustained, we will then resume drilling activities in the Utica and offshore. However, given that oil prices have remained below $50 per barrel, we have further reduced our 2016 E&P capital and exploratory budget to $2.1 billion from our previous guidance of $2.4 billion, which represents a 48% reduction from 2015. This decrease reflects our continuing focus on reducing costs across our portfolio.
Now moving to production. In the second quarter, we averaged 313,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of 320,000 to 325,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter. As discussed on our last call, we had a series of extended planned shutdowns at the Valhall Field in Norway and at the Tubular Bells and Conger fields in the Gulf of Mexico during the second quarter. In addition, we experienced a mechanical issue that affected one well at the Conger Field and had further downtime at the Tubular Bells Field to replace a second defective subsurface safety valve.
In July, we have experienced a third subsurface safety valve failure. We are actively pursuing legal claims against the vendor who provided the defective valves at Tubular Bells. The third valve failure at Tubular Bells and the mechanical issue at the Conger well will be remediated in the fourth quarter. These issues, along with decreased investment levels, led us to reduce our full year 2016 production guidance to 315,000 to 325,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya.
We forecast company-wide production in the third quarter to average between 310,000 and 315,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Our third quarter forecast reflects planned downtime at the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand, the South Arne field in Denmark and the mechanical issues at Tubular Bells and Conger as well as hurricane contingency in the Gulf of Mexico and reduced investment levels.
While preserving the strength of our balance sheet in the current environment is crucial, it is equally important for us to be well positioned for price recovery by maintaining both our operating capabilities and the opportunities to drive future profitable growth. It is therefore significant to Hess that at the end of June, ExxonMobil announced the drilling results from the Liza-2 well, the second well in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana in which Hess holds a 30% interest. The Liza-2 well encountered more than 190 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs in Upper Cretaceous formations. After successfully concluding an extensive well evaluation program and extended production test, ExxonMobil confirmed Liza as world-class discovery, with a recoverable resource of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The Stabroek Block extends to 6.6 million acres. On July 17, we spud an exploration well on a second prospect, Skipjack, located approximately 25 miles northwest of Liza. We remain excited not only about the Liza discovery, but the wider opportunity set on this block, which has the potential to be transformational to our company.
Turning now to unconventionals. Net production from the Bakken averaged 106,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, in line with the guidance of 110,000 to -- 100,000 to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day given on our first quarter call. We maintained an average of 3 Bakken rigs in the second quarter. We plan to drop the 2 rigs in August, and we'll begin to increase activity when oil prices approach $60 per barrel. Over 2016, we now expect to drill 65 wells and bring 90 new wells online.
In the first half of 2016, we drilled 39 new wells and brought 57 new wells online, and we plan to drill 26 new wells and bring 33 online in the second half of the year, as the lower rig count takes effect. 
In the second quarter, our average drilling and completion cost was $4.8 million per well. I'm very proud of our Bakken team, who has driven down D&C cost by 14% versus the year ago quarter, even as we transition from our previous 35-stage completion design to our new 50-stage completion design. With the higher stage count, we expect to see 30-day IP rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second half of 2016, and expect that these wells in the core of the play will show a 7% uplift in EUR per well.
As a result of the increased productivity and EUR and lower drilling and completion cost, we have significantly increased the number of well locations that are economic at lower prices. Because of our continued strong performance, we are narrowing our full year 2016 net production guidance for the Bakken to 100,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the upper end of the 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day range that we provided in January.
Moving to the Utica. The joint venture has drilled no new wells since we released the rig we had operating in the play in early March. Net production for the second quarter averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter.
Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica activity is focused in the core of the play. Because the acreage in the core is held by production, we can reduce activity in the short term and preserve optionality and longer-term upside. We plan to run the asset for cash in 2016 and to resume drilling following a sustained recovery in commodity prices.
As a result of applying our distinctive lean manufacturing approach, over the past few years, we've been able to reduce our Utica drilling cost per foot by approximately 75% and our completion cost per stage by approximately 50%. Using competitor benchmarking, we know that we are achieving some of the lowest D&C costs and drilling some of the longest laterals in the play. These advances position us well to restart activity when prices improve. 
Now turning to the offshore in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Net production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. At the Conger Field, a mechanical failure on one well resulted in the loss of 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production during the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this well will be worked over in the fourth quarter.
At our Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, net production averaged 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter due to the remediation work on the second well with a defective valve and a 35-day shutdown to allow for the tieback of Noble's Gunflint to the Williams-owned facility.
As mentioned previously, in July, we experienced another valve failure on a third well. This well will remain shut-in until completion of remediation work in the fourth quarter. As a result of the cumulative downtime in 2016 from the 3 valve failures, we have reduced our full year 2016 net production guidance for Tubular Bells to 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
A fifth production well at Tubular Bells was spud mid-June, which is scheduled to be brought online in early 2017, and we anticipate starting water injection in the third quarter.
In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. The planned annual turnaround was completed on schedule in early July.
In June, BP and Aker announced the creation of a new operating entity, Aker BP ASA. We look forward to working with the new partner to deliver further operational efficiencies and value from future development.
At the South Arne field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, net production averaged 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter. Looking forward, a 20-day planned maintenance shutdown is scheduled in the third quarter.
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, net production averaged 236 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter. There is a scheduled 15-day shutdown in the third quarter to commission the new booster compressor.
Moving to developments. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, second quarter net production averaged 33 million cubic feet per day through the Early Production System and is expected to remain at about this level through 2016. In the second quarter, we installed 3 wellhead platforms and the jacket for the central processing platform. We also successfully drilled the first 8 of 11 wells for Phase 1 of the full field development project, which is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day following startup in 2017.
At the Stampede development in the Gulf -- in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, the hull left the manufacturing yard in South Korea on schedule. Fabrication and precommissioning of the Topsides continue according to plan and drilling operations continue to progress. First oil remains on schedule for 2018.
In closing, while the second quarter has been challenging as a result of continued low oil prices and short-term production issues, we remain confident in our resilient portfolio and strong long-term growth outlook, which includes our offshore development projects in North Malay Basin and Stampede, our premier positions in the Bakken and Utica, our high-margin chalk reservoir positions at Valhall and South Arne and our position in Guyana, which represents a world-class opportunity. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2016.The corporation incurred a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $509 million in the firs",959,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2016.
The corporation incurred a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $509 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $335 million in the second quarter of 2016.
Turning to Exploration and Production. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $271 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $451 million in the first quarter of 2016.
The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the second quarter and the first quarter of 2016 were as follows: Higher realized selling prices improved results by $155 million; lower sales volumes reduced results by $31 million; lower DD&A expense improved results by $36 million; lower production expenses improved results by $9 million; lower exploration expenses improved results by $8 million; all other items improved results by $3 million, for an overall decrease in the second quarter net loss of $180 million. 
In the second quarter, our E&P operations were overlifted compared with production by approximately 1.7 million barrels, which had the effect of decreasing our second quarter net loss by approximately $5 million. 
The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 47% in the second quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 41% in the first quarter.
Turning to Bakken Midstream. Second quarter net income of $11 million decreased from $14 million in the first quarter, primarily due to higher DD&A and interest expense. EBITDA for the Bakken Midstream, excluding the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $68 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $70 million in the first quarter.
Turning to corporate. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $75 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $72 million in the first quarter. The increase resulted from higher professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses. 
Turning to cash flow for the second quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $257 million. The net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $60 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $615 million. Proceeds from asset sales were $80 million. Net debt repayments were $43 million. Common and preferred dividends paid were $89 million. All other items resulted in an increase in cash of $8 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $462 million.
Excluding the Bakken Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion, total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of $7.7 billion, and total debt of $5.9 billion at June 30, 2016. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio, excluding the Bakken Midstream, was 23.5%.
Now to provide additional third quarter and full year 2016 guidance. First, for Exploration and Production. We project cash cost for E&P operations to be in the range of $16 to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $16 to $17 per barrel for the full year of 2016, which is up from previous guidance of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel. The increase in full year guidance is due to workovers required at Tubular Bells and Conger and the impact of fixed costs spread over lower production volumes.
DD&A per barrel is forecast to be $28 to $29 per barrel in the third quarter and $27 to $28 per barrel for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel. The decrease in full year guidance is due to the change in the mix of production. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $44 to $46 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016 and $43 to $45 per barrel for the full year. 
The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $4.10 to $4.20 per barrel for the third quarter of 2016 and $3.80 to $4 per barrel for the full year of 2016, versus prior guidance of $3.55 to $3.95 per barrel, reflecting lower total production volumes.
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million in the third quarter and $260 million to $280 million for the full year, consistent with previous guidance.
The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the third quarter and 41% to 45% for the full year of 2016, consistent with previous guidance. 
For Bakken Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the third quarter and $40 million to $50 million for the full year of 2016, consistent with previous guidance.
Turning to corporate. We expect corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the third quarter of 2016 and $100 million to $110 million for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $110 million to $120 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the third quarter of 2016 and $195 million to $205 million for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $205 million to $215 million. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

Yes, the -- as we kind of said in our opening remarks, now we've had 3 subsurface safety valve failures in Tubular Bells. The second valve affected us in the second quarter, and the third valve is going to affect us in the third quarter. And in addition to that, we had a mechanical failure at Conger that was unanticipated as well. So the net effect of that, if we look at kind of guidance for those assets, is about 15,000 barrels a day difference lowering of our guidance, and about 10,000 of that is at Tubular Bells and about 5,000 of that is at Conger. So if we look at capacity, going into the end of the year, we should be back up to that 70,000 to 75,000 barrels a day range in the Gulf of Mexico. So again, going back to the guidance, it was actually about 15,000 on T-Bells and 5,000 on Conger. I said 10,000 and 5,000. It's actually 15,000 and 5,000. So that gives you a sense for how big the magnitude was, Doug, of those 2 issues in the Gulf."

So just with the normal phasing, with any development, we see this fits nicely in '17 and then with more of the spend happening 2018 and beyond. And as we look at our portfolio at the capital for Guyana, and like you said, there are other capital that will be falling off in '17, such as like in the Gulf of Mexico and some of the capital we have spent in Denmark this year.

Now with the 15% to 20% uplift in the 50-stage fracs, it's probably somewhere between 3 and 4 as a result of that uplift. Regarding the cost reductions, I think, obviously in the onshore, I think that's largely flattened out. So I think further cost reductions there will be minimal. The ones that we are accomplishing are due to lean manufacturing, which is continuing to chop out waste and inefficiency and all those things. I want to really comment on that because if you think about our performance of delivering a $4.8 million well, substantial reduction from the prior year and the prior quarter, that was while also increasing the stage count from 35 to 50. So that's a major performance improvement, and all of that was lean manufacturing. So I think that will continue in our operation to drive those costs down because we know that there's even more efficiencies in spud to spud and so we're going after those in earnest. In the offshore, I think there have definitely been some major price reductions. So rigs, boats and all the associated equipment is down substantially. We're already seeing some of those benefits in Guyana, for example, on the rig rates and seismic boat rates and all that. And then the last kind of penny to drop I think is really the yards in Southeast Asia. So if you look at their capacity loading, it's going to drop substantially over the next 12 months, and I think that will open up another cost reduction opportunity. So for us, Guyana is coming almost at just the right time because you'll have low costs, not only in drilling but also in development, if we sanction a project there for the development project as well."

So what are the benefits of Liza, let's just say because we always want to make sure we talk about the difference of Guyana, Liza in general, versus, let's say, offshore Gulf of Mexico, Paleogene. So in offshore Guyana, these wells are only 13,000 feet below the mud line. So 18,000 total depth. So the depth is much -- is shorter than obviously the Gulf of Mexico. So drilling wells will be cheaper. So reservoir is quite good. So we should get good flow rates out of Guyana for that. There is no salt cover, which one, helps with imaging, as we were talking about the Skipjack prospect, but again, takes casing strings out while we're drilling wells. So again, that makes it better. And then the other thing from a -- I can't talk about the particulars, but it is a PSC. So you get benefit, obviously, at lower prices with higher cost recovery. So putting all those together makes Guyana, I'm going to say, completely different than the Gulf of Mexico. And therefore, in lower-price environments, Guyana competes. So I think beyond that, you'll have to talk to the operator. And as we get to FID and Exxon puts out costs and numbers like that as -- when FID happens, you can get a better feel for those economics."

249841,403428944,1061505,"Hess Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Our company has made important progress in maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping a tight control on our spending while continuing to invest in future growth, which we believe will create significant val",727,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Our company has made important progress in maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping a tight control on our spending while continuing to invest in future growth, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders. Over the course of 2016, we have materially reduced our spending in response to this lower-for-longer oil price environment. We now project our full year 2016 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures to be approximately $2 billion, down $100 million from our previous forecast and more than 50% below 2015. In addition, this month, we will complete a $1.5 billion refinancing of higher-coupon debt, extending our average maturities and lowering our average coupon rate. This transaction further strengthens our balance sheet and liquidity position and defers any significant debt maturities until 2027. 
While we have reduced investment across our producing portfolio, we believe it is very important to continue to fund our growth projects in the Gulf of Thailand, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and offshore Guyana. 
With regard to Guyana, we are very encouraged about the significant resource potential on the 6.6 million acres Stabroek Block. The Liza-3 well was successful, encountering approximately 200 feet of net oil pay and the same high-quality reservoir encountered in the Liza-1 and Liza-2 wells. These result further confirms that Liza is a world-class resource and one of the industry's largest oil discoveries in the last 10 years. With this information, we now expect estimated recoverable resources for Liza to be at the upper end of the previously announced range of 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Predevelopment planning is underway, and we expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017. We believe Liza will offer very attractive economics at current oil prices. 
In addition, we are in the early stages of evaluating the exploration potential on the Stabroek Block. The drilling rig will next move to the Payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northeast from Liza, which with [ph] results from this exploration well expected by the time of our next conference call. 
With regard to our 2 other offshore developments, North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, are on track to come online in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Together, they will add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in transition from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company. 
Turning to our financial results. In the third quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $339 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $340 million or $1.12 per common share compared to an adjusted net loss of $291 million or $1.03 per common share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas sales volumes and selling prices, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower operating costs and DD&A. 
Net production was 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the upper end of our guidance range for the quarter, while net production from the Bakken exceeded our guidance, averaging 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. Our Bakken team continues to deliver excellent operating results and returns in the core of the play that are competitive with the Permian and Eagle Ford. 
In the third quarter, drilling and completion costs averaged $4.7 million per well, 11% below the year-ago quarter, even as we transition from a 35-stage to a 50-stage completion design. Our high-quality Bakken acreage, industry-leading drilling and completion costs and advantaged infrastructure position our Bakken asset to be a major contributor to the company's future production and cash flow growth. With the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making initial preparations to increase our drilling activity in the play next year. We will provide 2017 guidance, including capital and exploratory expenditures, as usual in January. 
In summary, our company remains well positioned for the current low oil price environment and for a recovery in oil prices. We have one of the strongest balance sheets and long-term growth outlooks among our peers, which we believe will deliver profitable growth and improving returns for our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg."

I'd like to provide an operational update and review our progress in executing our strategy. In the third quarter of 2016, we delivered strong operating performance and advanced our offshore developments and exploration activities.  
Starting with production. In the third quarter, we averaged 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the upper end of our guidance range of 310,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong performance across our producing assets. As a result, we reconfirm our full year 2016 production guidance of 315,000 to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. 
Turning to the Bakken. In the third quarter, production averaged 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter and 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. We drilled 21 wells and brought 22 wells online in the third quarter. For 2016, we now expect to drill approximately 70 wells and bring 100 wells online. This compares to last year when we drilled 182 wells and brought 219 wells online. We currently have 2 rigs operating in the play. But as John mentioned, given the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making preparations to ramp up activity levels next year as prices recover. In the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken production to average between 100,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting fewer new wells being brought online. For the full year 2016, we expect Bakken production to be approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Over the third quarter, we continued to optimize our completions from our current 50-stage design by successfully completing 53-stage and 57-stage wells, and we are trialing a 60-stage well this quarter. Even with these higher stage count trials, we still reduced our average drilling and completion costs in the third quarter to $4.7 million per well. We expect the 50-stage completion design to yield a 7% uplift in EUR per well in the quarter to [ph] play. Wells brought online in the third quarter are expected to deliver growth EUR per well of approximately 830,000 barrels of oil equivalent, and we anticipate this will approach 1 million barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, average 30-day IP rate from our Middle Bakken wells increased to 899 barrels of oil per day from 811 barrels of oil per day in the second quarter, and we expect to see a further increase in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to the Utica. Net production for the third quarter held at 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter and 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016. 
Now turning to offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 61,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter compared to 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016. At the Conger field, in which Hess has a 37.5% working interest and is operator, we started a work over to remediate a mechanical failure as announced in our second quarter call and anticipate the well returning to production in the first quarter of 2017. 
At our Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, we will commence water injection this quarter and are currently completing a fifth producer that we anticipate bringing online in the first quarter of 2017. We will also replace a third defective subsurface valve in the fourth quarter and expect to have the well back online in the first quarter of 2017. As with other fields in the Mississippi Canyon area, Tubular Bells was also shut in for 5 days as a precaution for hurricane activity. 
In Norway, the Aker BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, continues to perform strongly with net production of 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on average in the third quarter compared to 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. 
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, the booster compression -- compressor tie-in was successfully completed during a planned shut down. Net production averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the last year's third quarter, reflecting downtime associated with the compression tie-in and reduced entitlement. In the fourth quarter, we expect net production to be back above 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Moving to developments. At the North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, we completed installation of the topsides at 3 remote wellhead platforms, which are part of the full field development project. We also completed the drilling of 3 development wells. The project is on schedule for completion in the third quarter of 2017, after which net production is expected to ramp up steadily to 165 million cubic feet per day. 
At the Stampede development project in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully lifted and set the topsides deck on the hull. All major lifts are now complete. Drilling operations continued to progress, and first oil remains on schedule for 2018. 
I'd now like to move to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the 6.6 million acre Stabroek block. On September 5, the operator, ExxonMobil, spread the wings [ph] of 3 wells [ph] located approximately 2.7 miles from the Liza-1 discovery well. Liza-3 was drilled in 6,000 feet of water and reached a TD of approximately 18,100 feet. The well encountered approximately 200 feet of net oil pay in the same high-quality reservoir encountered during tethered [ph] Liza wells. This reservoir sequence is also confirmed to have a common pressure regime with that of the equivalent reservoir interval found in both Liza-1 and Liza-2. Based on the positive Liza-3 results, we now expect estimated recoverable resources for Liza alone to be at the upper end of ExxonMobil's previously announced range of 0.8 billion and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The operator then plans to drill an exploration well at the Payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northeast from Liza with results expected by late January. In parallel, we continue to progress predevelopment activities at Liza and expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017. We remain excited, not only by Liza, which is world class in its own right, but also by the significant further exploration potential of the very large Stabroek Block, which, as a reminder, is the equivalent of approximately 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks. 
In closing, I'm very pleased with our team who once again have delivered strong operational performance, relentless continuous improvement and some key milestones and results, which we believe, in combination, will deliver one of the most exciting growth profiles among our large-cap E&P peers over the next decade and beyond.

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2016. The corporation incurred a net loss of $339 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter. Excluding items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods, our adjusted net loss was $340 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with an adjusted net loss of $335 million in the second quarter. 
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $285 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $271 million in the second quarter of 2016. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the third quarter and the second quarter of 2016 were as follows: higher realized selling prices improved results by $3 million; lower sales volumes reduced results by $33 million; lower exploration expenses improved results by $26 million; all other items reduced results by $10 million for an overall increase in third quarter net loss of $14 million. 
In the third quarter, our E&P sales volumes were the same as production volumes, and therefore, the timing of lifting had no impact on our financial results. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 41% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 47% in the second quarter. 
Turning to Bakken Midstream. Third quarter net income of $13 million increased from $11 million in the second quarter primarily due to lower operating costs and interest expense. EBITDA for the Bakken Midstream before the noncontrolling interest amounted to $73 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $68 million in the second quarter. 
Turning to corporate. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $118 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $75 million in the second quarter. The third quarter results include an after-tax charge of $50 million for the premium paid to purchase 65% of our notes due in 2019. 
Turning to cash flow for the third quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $309 million. The net increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $23 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $529 million. Net borrowings were $731 million. Common and preferred dividends paid were $91 million. All other items resulted in a decrease in cash of $9 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $434 million. 
Turning to cash and liquidity. Excluding the Bakken Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 billion; total liquidity of $8.2 billion, including available committed credit facilities; and total debt of $6.7 billion at September 30, 2016. The increase in debt during the quarter was attributable to the partial completion of a refinancing transaction launched in September to improve the company's liquidity position by purchasing higher-coupon bonds, redeeming near-term maturities and lowering go-forward interest expense. 
To accomplish the refinancing, the corporation issued in September $1 billion of 4.3% notes due in 2027 and $500 million of 5.8% notes due in 2047. The company used $750 million during the third quarter to retire 8.125% notes with a carrying value of $670 million due in 2019. In October, the company will use $625 million to redeem $300 million of notes due in 2017 and to retire notes with a carrying value of $259 million due in 2029 and 2031. As a result of this refinancing, we have no significant debt maturities until 2027. Pro forma for the notes purchased or redeemed in October and excluding the Bakken Midstream, our cash and cash equivalents were $2.9 billion and total debt was $6.1 billion at September 30, 2016. Our pro forma debt-to-capitalization ratio was 24.5%. 
Now turning to guidance. Starting with E&P, cash cost for E&P operations are projected to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter, which includes approximately $2 per barrel for planned workover activity to replace defective subsurface valves at the Conger and Tubular Bells Fields in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Full year cash costs are projected to be in the range of $16 to $16.50 per barrel, which compares to previous full year guidance of $16 to $17 per barrel. DD&A per barrel is forecast to be $26 to $27 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $26.50 to $27 per barrel for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $27 to $28 per barrel. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $43.50 to $45.50 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $42.50 to $43.50 per barrel for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $43 to $45 per barrel. 
The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $4.20 to $4.30 per barrel for the fourth quarter and $3.85 to $3.95 per barrel for the full year, consistent with previous guidance of $3.80 to $4 per barrel. 
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million in the fourth quarter and $250 million to $260 million for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $260 million to $280 million. 
The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 36% to 40% for the fourth quarter and 40% to 44% for the full year of 2016, which compares to previous full year guidance of 41% to 45%. 
Turning to Bakken Midstream. We estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter and $48 million to $53 million for the full year of 2016, which is up from previous full year guidance of $40 million to $50 million. 
Turning to corporate. We expect corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the fourth quarter and $90 million to $95 million for the full year of 2016, which compares to previous full year guidance of $100 million to $110 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the fourth quarter and $200 million to $205 million for the full year of 2016. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

Well, Doug, thank you. As you know, our strategy in this lower-for-longer oil price environment has been to preserve our balance sheet, preserve our capability and preserve our growth options, so it's a balance. And we're about value, not volume. But with the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making initial preparations to increase activity levels once again in the Bakken next year. We'll provide detailed 2017 guidance, including capital and exploratory expenditures as usual in January, but we've been staying fiscally disciplined. The balance sheet that's premier here to fund through the cycle the excellent growth opportunities we have for short cycle in the Bakken and longer cycle in Guyana. And as long as those opportunities offer superior financial returns to our shareholders, that will obviously come into our capital going forward with an eye to keeping the balance sheet in check as well as looking at over time offering competitive growth and increasing cash returns to shareholders as well. So it's going to be a balance and it's going to be a function of oil price."

So Evan, we think that the Bakken is really 2 different areas, right? So in the core of the core, we believe that sticking with sliding sleeve completions and increasing that stage count as high as you can practically go delivers the highest return. The proppant loading we're using in those areas, again, the core of the core, is anywhere from 80,000 to 110,000 pounds per stage. And this is really depends on where we are because we have the data to kind of say it's better to optimize that between 80,000 and 110,000. Now it should move outside the core. We continue to evaluate other designs, which includes slick water, plug-in curve, high proppant volume completions. And what we ultimately decide there, we'll begin testing some of those techniques. Whatever technique gives us the highest return for DSU, that is the one we're going to select. So the reason for the differences are simply because in the core of the core, you're on the flecture of the structure to have an awful high amount of natural fracturing so you just need less of a proppant load. As you get outside the quarter, there's less of that effect, so that's what drives these different completion designs outside the quarter."

Our company has made important progress in maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping a tight control on our spending while continuing to invest in future growth, which we believe will create significant val",726,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Our company has made important progress in maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping a tight control on our spending while continuing to invest in future growth, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders. Over the course of 2016, we have materially reduced our spending in response to this lower-for-longer oil price environment. We now project our full year 2016 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures to be approximately $2 billion, down $100 million from our previous forecast and more than 50% below 2015. In addition, this month, we will complete a $1.5 billion refinancing of higher-coupon debt, extending our average maturities and lowering our average coupon rate. This transaction further strengthens our balance sheet and liquidity position and defers any significant debt maturities until 2027. 
While we have reduced investment across our producing portfolio, we believe it is very important to continue to fund our growth projects in the Gulf of Thailand, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and offshore Guyana. 
With regard to Guyana, we are very encouraged about the significant resource potential on the 6.6 million acres Stabroek Block. The Liza-3 well was successful, encountering approximately 200 feet of net oil pay and the same high-quality reservoir encountered in the Liza-1 and Liza-2 wells. These result further confirms that Liza is a world-class resource and one of the industry's largest oil discoveries in the last 10 years. With this information, we now expect estimated recoverable resources for Liza to be at the upper end of the previously announced range of 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Predevelopment planning is underway, and we expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017. We believe Liza will offer very attractive economics at current oil prices. 
In addition, we are in the early stages of evaluating the exploration potential on the Stabroek Block. The drilling rig will next move to the Payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northeast from Liza, which with results from this exploration well expected by the time of our next conference call. 
With regard to our 2 other offshore developments, North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, are on track to come online in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Together, they will add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in transition from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company. 
Turning to our financial results. In the third quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $339 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $340 million or $1.12 per common share compared to an adjusted net loss of $291 million or $1.03 per common share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas sales volumes and selling prices, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower operating costs and DD&A. 
Net production was 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the upper end of our guidance range for the quarter, while net production from the Bakken exceeded our guidance, averaging 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. Our Bakken team continues to deliver excellent operating results and returns in the core of the play that are competitive with the Permian and Eagle Ford. 
In the third quarter, drilling and completion costs averaged $4.7 million per well, 11% below the year-ago quarter, even as we transition from a 35-stage to a 50-stage completion design. Our high-quality Bakken acreage, industry-leading drilling and completion costs and advantaged infrastructure position our Bakken asset to be a major contributor to the company's future production and cash flow growth. With the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making initial preparations to increase our drilling activity in the play next year. We will provide 2017 guidance, including capital and exploratory expenditures, as usual in January. 
In summary, our company remains well positioned for the current low oil price environment and for a recovery in oil prices. We have one of the strongest balance sheets and long-term growth outlooks among our peers, which we believe will deliver profitable growth and improving returns for our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg."

I'd like to provide an operational update and review our progress in executing our strategy. In the third quarter of 2016, we delivered strong operating performance and advanced our offshore developments and exploration activities.  Starti",1219,"Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an operational update and review our progress in executing our strategy. In the third quarter of 2016, we delivered strong operating performance and advanced our offshore developments and exploration activities.  
Starting with production. In the third quarter, we averaged 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the upper end of our guidance range of 310,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong performance across our producing assets. As a result, we reconfirm our full year 2016 production guidance of 315,000 to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. 
Turning to the Bakken. In the third quarter, production averaged 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter and 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. We drilled 21 wells and brought 22 wells online in the third quarter. For 2016, we now expect to drill approximately 70 wells and bring 100 wells online. This compares to last year when we drilled 182 wells and brought 219 wells online. We currently have 2 rigs operating in the play. But as John mentioned, given the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making preparations to ramp up activity levels next year as prices recover. In the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken production to average between 100,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting fewer new wells being brought online. For the full year 2016, we expect Bakken production to be approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Over the third quarter, we continued to optimize our completions from our current 50-stage design by successfully completing 53-stage and 57-stage wells, and we are trialing a 60-stage well this quarter. Even with these higher stage count trials, we still reduced our average drilling and completion costs in the third quarter to $4.7 million per well. We expect the 50-stage completion design to yield a 7% uplift in EUR per well in the quarter to play. Wells brought online in the third quarter are expected to deliver growth EUR per well of approximately 830,000 barrels of oil equivalent, and we anticipate this will approach 1 million barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, average 30-day IP rate from our Middle Bakken wells increased to 899 barrels of oil per day from 811 barrels of oil per day in the second quarter, and we expect to see a further increase in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to the Utica. Net production for the third quarter held at 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter and 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016. 
Now turning to offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 61,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter compared to 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016. At the Conger field, in which Hess has a 37.5% working interest and is operator, we started a work over to remediate a mechanical failure as announced in our second quarter call and anticipate the well returning to production in the first quarter of 2017. 
At our Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, we will commence water injection this quarter and are currently completing a fifth producer that we anticipate bringing online in the first quarter of 2017. We will also replace a third defective subsurface valve in the fourth quarter and expect to have the well back online in the first quarter of 2017. As with other fields in the Mississippi Canyon area, Tubular Bells was also shut in for 5 days as a precaution for hurricane activity. 
In Norway, the Aker BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, continues to perform strongly with net production of 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on average in the third quarter compared to 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. 
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, the booster compression -- compressor tie-in was successfully completed during a planned shut down. Net production averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the last year's third quarter, reflecting downtime associated with the compression tie-in and reduced entitlement. In the fourth quarter, we expect net production to be back above 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Moving to developments. At the North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, we completed installation of the topsides at 3 remote wellhead platforms, which are part of the full field development project. We also completed the drilling of 3 development wells. The project is on schedule for completion in the third quarter of 2017, after which net production is expected to ramp up steadily to 165 million cubic feet per day. 
At the Stampede development project in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully lifted and set the topsides deck on the hull. All major lifts are now complete. Drilling operations continued to progress, and first oil remains on schedule for 2018. 
I'd now like to move to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the 6.6 million acre Stabroek block. On September 5, the operator, ExxonMobil, spud the Liza-3 well located approximately 2.7 miles from the Liza-1 discovery well -- Liza-3 was drilled in 6,000 feet of water and reached a TD of approximately 18,100 feet. The well encountered approximately 200 feet of net oil pay in the same high-quality reservoir encountered during other Liza wells. This reservoir sequence is also confirmed to have a common pressure regime with that of the equivalent reservoir interval found in both Liza-1 and Liza-2. Based on the positive Liza-3 results, we now expect estimated recoverable resources for Liza alone to be at the upper end of ExxonMobil's previously announced range of 0.8 billion and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The operator then plans to drill an exploration well at the Payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northeast from Liza with results expected by late January. In parallel, we continue to progress predevelopment activities at Liza and expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017. We remain excited, not only by Liza, which is world class in its own right, but also by the significant further exploration potential of the very large Stabroek Block, which, as a reminder, is the equivalent of approximately 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks. 
In closing, I'm very pleased with our team who once again have delivered strong operational performance, relentless continuous improvement and some key milestones and results, which we believe, in combination, will deliver one of the most exciting growth profiles among our large-cap E&P peers over the next decade and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly"

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2016. The corporation incurred a net loss of $339 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $392 million in the second",1122,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2016. The corporation incurred a net loss of $339 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter. Excluding items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods, our adjusted net loss was $340 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with an adjusted net loss of $335 million in the second quarter. 
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $285 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $271 million in the second quarter of 2016. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the third quarter and the second quarter of 2016 were as follows: higher realized selling prices improved results by $3 million; lower sales volumes reduced results by $33 million; lower exploration expenses improved results by $26 million; all other items reduced results by $10 million for an overall increase in third quarter net loss of $14 million. 
In the third quarter, our E&P sales volumes were the same as production volumes, and therefore, the timing of lifting had no impact on our financial results. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 41% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 47% in the second quarter. 
Turning to Bakken Midstream. Third quarter net income of $13 million increased from $11 million in the second quarter primarily due to lower operating costs and interest expense. EBITDA for the Bakken Midstream before the noncontrolling interest amounted to $73 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $68 million in the second quarter. 
Turning to corporate. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $118 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $75 million in the second quarter. The third quarter results include an after-tax charge of $50 million for the premium paid to purchase 65% of our notes due in 2019. 
Turning to cash flow for the third quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $309 million. The net increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $23 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $529 million. Net borrowings were $731 million. Common and preferred dividends paid were $91 million. All other items resulted in a decrease in cash of $9 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $434 million. 
Turning to cash and liquidity. Excluding the Bakken Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 billion; total liquidity of $8.2 billion, including available committed credit facilities; and total debt of $6.7 billion at September 30, 2016. The increase in debt during the quarter was attributable to the partial completion of a refinancing transaction launched in September to improve the company's liquidity position by purchasing higher-coupon bonds, redeeming near-term maturities and lowering go-forward interest expense. 
To accomplish the refinancing, the corporation issued in September $1 billion of 4.3% notes due in 2027 and $500 million of 5.8% notes due in 2047. The company used $750 million during the third quarter to retire 8.125% notes with a carrying value of $670 million due in 2019. In October, the company will use $625 million to redeem $300 million of notes due in 2017 and to retire notes with a carrying value of $259 million due in 2029 and 2031. As a result of this refinancing, we have no significant debt maturities until 2027. Pro forma for the notes purchased or redeemed in October and excluding the Bakken Midstream, our cash and cash equivalents were $2.9 billion and total debt was $6.1 billion at September 30, 2016. Our pro forma debt-to-capitalization ratio was 24.5%. 
Now turning to guidance. Starting with E&P, cash cost for E&P operations are projected to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter, which includes approximately $2 per barrel for planned workover activity to replace defective subsurface valves at the Conger and Tubular Bells Fields in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Full year cash costs are projected to be in the range of $16 to $16.50 per barrel, which compares to previous full year guidance of $16 to $17 per barrel. DD&A per barrel is forecast to be $26 to $27 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $26.50 to $27 per barrel for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $27 to $28 per barrel. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $43.50 to $45.50 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $42.50 to $43.50 per barrel for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $43 to $45 per barrel. 
The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $4.20 to $4.30 per barrel for the fourth quarter and $3.85 to $3.95 per barrel for the full year, consistent with previous guidance of $3.80 to $4 per barrel. 
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million in the fourth quarter and $250 million to $260 million for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $260 million to $280 million. 
The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 36% to 40% for the fourth quarter and 40% to 44% for the full year of 2016, which compares to previous full year guidance of 41% to 45%. 
Turning to Bakken Midstream. We estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter and $48 million to $53 million for the full year of 2016, which is up from previous full year guidance of $40 million to $50 million. 
Turning to corporate. We expect corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the fourth quarter and $90 million to $95 million for the full year of 2016, which compares to previous full year guidance of $100 million to $110 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the fourth quarter and $200 million to $205 million for the full year of 2016. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So my question is how you guys are thinking about capital management over the medium term if we have a scenario, whereby the oil price does recover, and whether you feel that the balance between returns on capital and production growth and financial flexibility requires adjustment in relation to the past decade? And if so, how should it change?"

And that's why we gave you the Middle Bakken numbers. The Middle Bakken numbers were very strong, less impacted by the production and curtailment.

So Evan, we think that the Bakken is really 2 different areas, right. So in the core of the core, we believe that sticking with sliding-sleeve completions and increasing that stage count as high as you can practically go delivers the highest return. The proppant loading we're using in those areas, again, the core of the core, is anywhere from 80,000 to 110,000 pounds per stage, and that just really depends on where we are because we have the data to kind of say it's better to optimize that between 80,000 and 110,000. Now as should move outside the core, we continue to evaluate other designs, which includes slickwater plug and perf, high-proppant volume completions. And what we ultimately decide there and we'll begin testing some of those techniques, whatever technique gives us the highest return for DSU, that is the one we're going to select. And so the reason for the differences are simply because in the core of the core, you're on the flexure of the structure, so you have an awful high amount of natural fracturing. So you just need less of a proppant load. As you get outside the core, there's less of that effect. So that's what drives these different completion designs outside the core."

That increase, though, is being offset and slightly even more. There's going to be a reduction, about 12,000 barrels a day, as it relates to as we talked about Utica. Utica is going to be start declining. We're not bringing -- we're not drilling and bringing any wells online there. The Bakken, as you mentioned, still going to -- it's going to come off the 107,000 and begin to decline with the 2 rigs. And in EG, we do have a bit of our normal entitlement change that we have in the fourth quarter as you get through the year of your cost recoveries. So combined, Utica, EG and Bakken will be down about 12,000 barrels a day. And then you have the 1s and 2s across the portfolio, again, where we're not drilling, and that comes to approximately 8,000 barrels a day there just things in the Gulf of Mexico, as Greg mentioned.

249841,403428944,1062149,"Hess Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Our company has made important progress in maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping a tight control on our spending while continuing to invest in future growth, which we believe will create significant val",726,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Our company has made important progress in maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping a tight control on our spending while continuing to invest in future growth, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders. Over the course of 2016, we have materially reduced our spending in response to this lower-for-longer oil price environment. We now project our full year 2016 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures to be approximately $2 billion, down $100 million from our previous forecast and more than 50% below 2015. In addition, this month, we will complete a $1.5 billion refinancing of higher-coupon debt, extending our average maturities and lowering our average coupon rate. This transaction further strengthens our balance sheet and liquidity position and defers any significant debt maturities until 2027. 
While we have reduced investment across our producing portfolio, we believe it is very important to continue to fund our growth projects in the Gulf of Thailand, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and offshore Guyana. 
With regard to Guyana, we are very encouraged about the significant resource potential on the 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block. The Liza-3 well was successful, encountering approximately 200 feet of net oil pay and the same high-quality reservoir encountered in the Liza-1 and Liza-2 wells. This result further confirms that Liza is a world-class resource and one of the industry's largest oil discoveries in the last 10 years. With this information, we now expect estimated recoverable resources for Liza to be at the upper end of the previously-announced range of 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Predevelopment planning is underway, and we expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017. We believe Liza will offer very attractive economics at current oil prices. 
In addition, we are in the early stages of evaluating the exploration potential on the Stabroek Block. The drilling rig will next move to the Payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northeast from Liza, which -- with results from this exploration well expected by the time of our next conference call. 
With regard to our 2 other offshore developments, North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, are on track to come online in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Together, they will add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in transition from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company. 
Turning to our financial results. In the third quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $339 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $340 million or $1.12 per common share compared to an adjusted net loss of $291 million or $1.03 per common share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas sales volumes and selling prices, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower operating costs and DD&A. 
Net production was 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the upper end of our guidance range for the quarter, while net production from the Bakken exceeded our guidance, averaging 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. Our Bakken team continues to deliver excellent operating results and returns in the core of the play that are competitive with the Permian and Eagle Ford. 
In the third quarter, drilling and completion costs averaged $4.7 million per well, 11% below the year-ago quarter, even as we transition from a 35-stage to a 50-stage completion design. Our high-quality Bakken acreage, industry-leading drilling and completion costs and advantaged infrastructure, position our Bakken asset to be a major contributor to the company's future production and cash flow growth. With the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making initial preparations to increase our drilling activity in the play next year. We will provide 2017 guidance, including capital and exploratory expenditures, as usual in January. 
In summary, our company remains well positioned for the current low oil price environment and for a recovery in oil prices. We have one of the strongest balance sheets and long-term growth outlooks among our peers, which we believe will deliver profitable growth and improving returns for our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg."

I'd like to provide an operational update and review our progress in executing our strategy. In the third quarter of 2016, we delivered strong operating performance and advanced our offshore developments and exploration activities.  
Starting with production. In the third quarter, we averaged 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the upper end of our guidance range of 310,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong performance across our producing assets. As a result, we reconfirm our full year 2016 production guidance of 315,000 to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. 
Turning to the Bakken. In the third quarter, production averaged 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter and 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. We drilled 21 wells and brought 22 wells online in the third quarter. For 2016, we now expect to drill approximately 70 wells and bring 100 wells online. This compares to last year when we drilled 182 wells and brought 219 wells online. We currently have 2 rigs operating in the play. But as John mentioned, given the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making preparations to ramp up activity levels next year as prices recover. In the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken production to average between 100,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting fewer new wells being brought online. For the full year 2016, we expect Bakken production to be approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Over the third quarter, we continued to optimize our completions from our current 50-stage design by successfully completing 53-stage and 57-stage wells, and we are trialing a 60-stage well this quarter. Even with these higher stage count trials, we still reduced our average drilling and completion costs in the third quarter to $4.7 million per well. We expect the 50-stage completion design to yield a 7% uplift in EUR per well in the corridor play. Wells brought online in the third quarter are expected to deliver growth EUR per well of approximately 830,000 barrels of oil equivalent, and we anticipate this will approach 1 million barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, average 30-day IP rate from our Middle Bakken wells increased to 899 barrels of oil per day from 811 barrels of oil per day in the second quarter, and we expect to see a further increase in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to the Utica. Net production for the third quarter held at 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter and 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016. 
Now turning to offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 61,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter compared to 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016. At the Conger field, in which Hess has a 37.5% working interest and is operator, we started a work over to remediate a mechanical failure as announced in our second quarter call and anticipate the well returning to production in the first quarter of 2017. 
At our Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, we will commence water injection this quarter and are currently completing a fifth producer that we anticipate bringing online in the first quarter of 2017. We will also replace a third defective subsurface valve in the fourth quarter and expect to have the well back online in the first quarter of 2017. As with other fields in the Mississippi Canyon area, Tubular Bells was also shut in for 5 days as a precaution for hurricane activity. 
In Norway, the Aker BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, continues to perform strongly with net production of 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on average in the third quarter compared to 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. 
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, the booster compression -- compressor tie-in was successfully completed during a planned shutdown. Net production averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the last year's third quarter, reflecting downtime associated with the compression tie-in and reduced entitlement. In the fourth quarter, we expect net production to be back above 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Moving to developments. At the North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, we completed installation of the topsides at 3 remote wellhead platforms, which are part of the full field development project. We also completed the drilling of 3 development wells. The project is on schedule for completion in the third quarter of 2017, after which net production is expected to ramp up steadily to 165 million cubic feet per day. 
At the Stampede development project in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully lifted and set the topsides deck on the hull. All major lifts are now complete. Drilling operations continue to progress, and first oil remains on schedule for 2018. 
I'd now like to move to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the 6.6 million acre Stabroek block. On September 5, the operator, ExxonMobil, spud the Liza-3 well, located approximately 2.7 miles from the Liza-1 discovery well. Liza-3 was drilled in 6,000 feet of water and reached a TD of approximately 18,100 feet. The well encountered approximately 200 feet of net oil pay in the same high-quality reservoir encountered during other Liza wells. This reservoir sequence is also confirmed to have a common pressure regime with that of the equivalent reservoir interval found in both Liza-1 and Liza-2. Based on the positive Liza-3 results, we now expect estimated recoverable resources for Liza alone to be at the upper end of ExxonMobil's previously-announced range of 0.8 billion and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The operator then plans to drill an exploration well at the Payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northeast from Liza with results expected by late January. In parallel, we continue to progress predevelopment activities at Liza and expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017. We remain excited, not only by Liza, which is world class in its own right, but also by the significant further exploration potential of the very large Stabroek Block, which, as a reminder, is the equivalent of approximately 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks. 
In closing, I'm very pleased with our team who once again have delivered strong operational performance, relentless continuous improvement and some key milestones and results, which we believe, in combination, will deliver one of the most exciting growth profiles among our large-cap E&P peers over the next decade and beyond.

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2016. The corporation incurred a net loss of $339 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $392 million in the second",1122,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2016. The corporation incurred a net loss of $339 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter. Excluding items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods, our adjusted net loss was $340 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with an adjusted net loss of $335 million in the second quarter. 
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $285 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $271 million in the second quarter of 2016. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the third quarter and the second quarter of 2016 were as follows: higher realized selling prices improved results by $3 million; lower sales volumes reduced results by $33 million; lower exploration expenses improved results by $26 million; all other items reduced results by $10 million for an overall increase in third quarter net loss of $14 million. 
In the third quarter, our E&P sales volumes were the same as production volumes, and therefore the timing of liftings had no impact on our financial results. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 41% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 47% in the second quarter. 
Turning to Bakken Midstream. Third quarter net income of $13 million increased from $11 million in the second quarter primarily due to lower operating cost and interest expense. EBITDA for the Bakken Midstream, before the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $73 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $68 million in the second quarter. 
Turning to corporate. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $118 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $75 million in the second quarter. The third quarter results include an after-tax charge of $50 million for the premium paid to purchase 65% of our notes due in 2019. 
Turning to cash flow for the third quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $309 million. The net increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $23 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $529 million. Net borrowings were $731 million. Common and preferred dividends paid were $91 million. All other items resulted in a decrease in cash of $9 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $434 million. 
Turning to cash and liquidity. Excluding the Bakken Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 billion; total liquidity of $8.2 billion, including available committed credit facilities; and total debt of $6.7 billion at September 30, 2016. The increase in debt during the quarter was attributable to the partial completion of a refinancing transaction launched in September to improve the company's liquidity position by purchasing higher-coupon bonds, redeeming near-term maturities and lowering go-forward interest expense. 
To accomplish the refinancing, the corporation issued in September $1 billion of 4.3% notes due in 2027 and $500 million of 5.8% notes due in 2047. The company used $750 million during the third quarter to retire 8.125% notes with a carrying value of $670 million due in 2019. In October, the company will use $625 million to redeem $300 million of notes due in 2017 and to retire notes with a carrying value of $259 million due in 2029 and 2031. As a result of this refinancing, we have no significant debt maturities until 2027. Pro forma for the notes purchased or redeemed in October and excluding the Bakken Midstream, our cash and cash equivalents were $2.9 billion and total debt was $6.1 billion at September 30, 2016. Our pro forma debt-to-capitalization ratio was 24.5%. 
Now turning to guidance. Starting with E&P, cash costs for E&P operations are projected to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter, which includes approximately $2 per barrel for planned workover activity to replace defective subsurface valves at the Conger and Tubular Bells Fields in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Full year cash costs are projected to be in the range of $16 to $16.50 per barrel, which compares to previous full year guidance of $16 to $17 per barrel. DD&A per barrel is forecast to be $26 to $27 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $26.50 to $27 per barrel for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $27 to $28 per barrel. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $43.50 to $45.50 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $42.50 to $43.50 per barrel for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $43 to $45 per barrel. 
The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $4.20 to $4.30 per barrel for the fourth quarter and $3.85 to $3.95 per barrel for the full year, consistent with previous guidance of $3.80 to $4 per barrel. 
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million in the fourth quarter and $250 million to $260 million for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $260 million to $280 million. 
The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 36% to 40% for the fourth quarter and 40% to 44% for the full year of 2016, which compares to previous full year guidance of 41% to 45%. 
Turning to Bakken Midstream. We estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter and $48 million to $53 million for the full year of 2016, which is up from previous full year guidance of $40 million to $50 million. 
Turning to corporate. We expect corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the fourth quarter and $90 million to $95 million for the full year of 2016, which compares to previous full year guidance of $100 million to $110 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the fourth quarter and $200 million to $205 million for the full year of 2016. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So my question is how you guys are thinking about capital management over the medium term if we have a scenario whereby the oil price does recover, and whether you feel that the balance between returns on capital and production growth and financial flexibility requires adjustment in relation to the past decade?

We'll provide detailed 2017 guidance, including capital and exploratory expenditures, as usual in January. But we're going to stay fiscally disciplined. It's a balance sheet that's premiered here to fund through the cycle the excellent growth opportunities we have both short cycle in the Bakken and longer cycle in Guyana. And as long as those opportunities offer superior financial returns to our shareholders, that will obviously command our capital going forward, with an eye to keeping the balance sheet in check as well as looking at, over time, offering competitive growth and increasing cash returns to shareholders as well. So it's going to be a balance, and it's going to be a function of oil price."

And my second question is there appears to be success with higher proppant loading the Bakken amongst your peers.

So Evan, we think that the Bakken is really 2 different areas, right. So in the core of the core, we believe that sticking with sliding-sleeve completions and increasing that stage count as high as you can practically go delivers the highest return. The proppant loading we're using in those areas, again, the core of the core, is anywhere from 80,000 to 110,000 pounds per stage, and that just really depends on where we are because we have the data to kind of say it's better to optimize that between 80,000 and 110,000. Now as you move outside the core, we continue to evaluate other designs, which include slickwater, plug and perf, high-proppant volume completions. And what we ultimately decide there and we'll begin testing some of those techniques, whatever technique gives us the highest return for DSU, that is the one we're going to select. And so the reason for the differences are simply because in the core of the core, you're on the flexure of the structure, so you have an awful high amount of natural fracturing. So you just need less of a proppant load. As you get outside the core, there's less of that effect. So that's what drives these different completion designs outside the core."

Utica is going to start declining. We're not bringing -- we're not drilling and bringing any wells online there. The Bakken, as you mentioned, still going to -- it's going to come off the 107,000 and begin to decline with the 2 rigs.

249841,403428944,1062698,"Hess Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Our company has made important progress in maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping a tight control on our spending while continuing to invest in future growth, which we believe will create significant val",726,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Our company has made important progress in maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping a tight control on our spending while continuing to invest in future growth, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders. Over the course of 2016, we have materially reduced our spending in response to this lower-for-longer oil price environment. We now project our full year 2016 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures to be approximately $2 billion, down $100 million from our previous forecast and more than 50% below 2015. In addition, this month, we will complete a $1.5 billion refinancing of higher-coupon debt, extending our average maturities and lowering our average coupon rate. This transaction further strengthens our balance sheet and liquidity position and defers any significant debt maturities until 2027. 
While we have reduced investment across our producing portfolio, we believe it is very important to continue to fund our growth projects in the Gulf of Thailand, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and offshore Guyana. 
With regard to Guyana, we are very encouraged about the significant resource potential on the 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block. The Liza-3 well was successful, encountering approximately 200 feet of net oil pay and the same high-quality reservoir encountered in the Liza-1 and Liza-2 wells. This result further confirms that Liza is a world-class resource and one of the industry's largest oil discoveries in the last 10 years. With this information, we now expect estimated recoverable resources for Liza to be at the upper end of the previously-announced range of 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Predevelopment planning is underway, and we expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017. We believe Liza will offer very attractive economics at current oil prices. 
In addition, we are in the early stages of evaluating the exploration potential on the Stabroek Block. The drilling rig will next move to the Payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northeast from Liza, which -- with results from this exploration well expected by the time of our next conference call. 
With regard to our 2 other offshore developments, North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, are on track to come online in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Together, they will add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in transition from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company. 
Turning to our financial results. In the third quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $339 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $340 million or $1.12 per common share compared to an adjusted net loss of $291 million or $1.03 per common share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas sales volumes and selling prices, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower operating costs and DD&A. 
Net production was 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the upper end of our guidance range for the quarter, while net production from the Bakken exceeded our guidance, averaging 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. Our Bakken team continues to deliver excellent operating results and returns in the core of the play that are competitive with the Permian and Eagle Ford. 
In the third quarter, drilling and completion costs averaged $4.7 million per well, 11% below the year-ago quarter, even as we transition from a 35-stage to a 50-stage completion design. Our high-quality Bakken acreage, industry-leading drilling and completion costs and advantaged infrastructure, position our Bakken asset to be a major contributor to the company's future production and cash flow growth. With the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making initial preparations to increase our drilling activity in the play next year. We will provide 2017 guidance, including capital and exploratory expenditures, as usual in January. 
In summary, our company remains well positioned for the current low oil price environment and for a recovery in oil prices. We have one of the strongest balance sheets and long-term growth outlooks among our peers, which we believe will deliver profitable growth and improving returns for our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg."

I'd like to provide an operational update and review our progress in executing our strategy. In the third quarter of 2016, we delivered strong operating performance and advanced our offshore developments and exploration activities.  Starti",1215,"Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an operational update and review our progress in executing our strategy. In the third quarter of 2016, we delivered strong operating performance and advanced our offshore developments and exploration activities.  
Starting with production. In the third quarter, we averaged 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the upper end of our guidance range of 310,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong performance across our producing assets. As a result, we reconfirm our full year 2016 production guidance of 315,000 to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. 
Turning to the Bakken. In the third quarter, production averaged 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter and 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. We drilled 21 wells and brought 22 wells online in the third quarter. For 2016, we now expect to drill approximately 70 wells and bring 100 wells online. This compares to last year when we drilled 182 wells and brought 219 wells online. We currently have 2 rigs operating in the play. But as John mentioned, given the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making preparations to ramp up activity levels next year as prices recover. In the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken production to average between 100,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting fewer new wells being brought online. For the full year 2016, we expect Bakken production to be approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Over the third quarter, we continued to optimize our completions from our current 50-stage design by successfully completing 53-stage and 57-stage wells, and we are trialing a 60-stage well this quarter. Even with these higher stage count trials, we still reduced our average drilling and completion costs in the third quarter to $4.7 million per well. We expect the 50-stage completion design to yield a 7% uplift in EUR per well in the corridor play. Wells brought online in the third quarter are expected to deliver growth EUR per well of approximately 830,000 barrels of oil equivalent, and we anticipate this will approach 1 million barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, average 30-day IP rate from our Middle Bakken wells increased to 899 barrels of oil per day from 811 barrels of oil per day in the second quarter, and we expect to see a further increase in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to the Utica. Net production for the third quarter held at 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter and 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016. 
Now turning to offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 61,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter compared to 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016. At the Conger field, in which Hess has a 37.5% working interest and is operator, we started a work over to remediate a mechanical failure as announced in our second quarter call and anticipate the well returning to production in the first quarter of 2017. 
At our Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, we will commence water injection this quarter and are currently completing a fifth producer that we anticipate bringing online in the first quarter of 2017. We will also replace a third defective subsurface valve in the fourth quarter and expect to have the well back online in the first quarter of 2017. As with other fields in the Mississippi Canyon area, Tubular Bells was also shut in for 5 days as a precaution for hurricane activity. 
In Norway, the Aker BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, continues to perform strongly with net production of 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on average in the third quarter compared to 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. 
At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, the booster compression -- compressor tie-in was successfully completed during a planned shutdown. Net production averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the last year's third quarter, reflecting downtime associated with the compression tie-in and reduced entitlement. In the fourth quarter, we expect net production to be back above 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Moving to developments. At the North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, we completed installation of the topsides at 3 remote wellhead platforms, which are part of the full field development project. We also completed the drilling of 3 development wells. The project is on schedule for completion in the third quarter of 2017, after which net production is expected to ramp up steadily to 165 million cubic feet per day. 
At the Stampede development project in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully lifted and set the topsides deck on the hull. All major lifts are now complete. Drilling operations continue to progress, and first oil remains on schedule for 2018. 
I'd now like to move to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the 6.6 million acre Stabroek block. On September 5, the operator, ExxonMobil, spud the Liza-3 well, located approximately 2.7 miles from the Liza-1 discovery well. Liza-3 was drilled in 6,000 feet of water and reached a TD of approximately 18,100 feet. The well encountered approximately 200 feet of net oil pay in the same high-quality reservoir encountered during other Liza wells. This reservoir sequence is also confirmed to have a common pressure regime with that of the equivalent reservoir interval found in both Liza-1 and Liza-2. Based on the positive Liza-3 results, we now expect estimated recoverable resources for Liza alone to be at the upper end of ExxonMobil's previously-announced range of 0.8 billion and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The operator then plans to drill an exploration well at the Payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northeast from Liza with results expected by late January. In parallel, we continue to progress predevelopment activities at Liza and expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017. We remain excited, not only by Liza, which is world class in its own right, but also by the significant further exploration potential of the very large Stabroek Block, which, as a reminder, is the equivalent of approximately 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks. 
In closing, I'm very pleased with our team who once again have delivered strong operational performance, relentless continuous improvement and some key milestones and results, which we believe, in combination, will deliver one of the most exciting growth profiles among our large-cap E&P peers over the next decade and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly"

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2016. The corporation incurred a net loss of $339 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $392 million in the second",1122,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2016. The corporation incurred a net loss of $339 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter. Excluding items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods, our adjusted net loss was $340 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with an adjusted net loss of $335 million in the second quarter. 
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $285 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $271 million in the second quarter of 2016. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the third quarter and the second quarter of 2016 were as follows: higher realized selling prices improved results by $3 million; lower sales volumes reduced results by $33 million; lower exploration expenses improved results by $26 million; all other items reduced results by $10 million for an overall increase in third quarter net loss of $14 million. 
In the third quarter, our E&P sales volumes were the same as production volumes, and therefore the timing of liftings had no impact on our financial results. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 41% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 47% in the second quarter. 
Turning to Bakken Midstream. Third quarter net income of $13 million increased from $11 million in the second quarter primarily due to lower operating cost and interest expense. EBITDA for the Bakken Midstream, before the noncontrolling interest, amounted to $73 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $68 million in the second quarter. 
Turning to corporate. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $118 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $75 million in the second quarter. The third quarter results include an after-tax charge of $50 million for the premium paid to purchase 65% of our notes due in 2019. 
Turning to cash flow for the third quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $309 million. The net increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $23 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $529 million. Net borrowings were $731 million. Common and preferred dividends paid were $91 million. All other items resulted in a decrease in cash of $9 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $434 million. 
Turning to cash and liquidity. Excluding the Bakken Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 billion; total liquidity of $8.2 billion, including available committed credit facilities; and total debt of $6.7 billion at September 30, 2016. The increase in debt during the quarter was attributable to the partial completion of a refinancing transaction launched in September to improve the company's liquidity position by purchasing higher-coupon bonds, redeeming near-term maturities and lowering go-forward interest expense. 
To accomplish the refinancing, the corporation issued in September $1 billion of 4.3% notes due in 2027 and $500 million of 5.8% notes due in 2047. The company used $750 million during the third quarter to retire 8.125% notes with a carrying value of $670 million due in 2019. In October, the company will use $625 million to redeem $300 million of notes due in 2017 and to retire notes with a carrying value of $259 million due in 2029 and 2031. As a result of this refinancing, we have no significant debt maturities until 2027. Pro forma for the notes purchased or redeemed in October and excluding the Bakken Midstream, our cash and cash equivalents were $2.9 billion and total debt was $6.1 billion at September 30, 2016. Our pro forma debt-to-capitalization ratio was 24.5%. 
Now turning to guidance. Starting with E&P, cash costs for E&P operations are projected to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter, which includes approximately $2 per barrel for planned workover activity to replace defective subsurface valves at the Conger and Tubular Bells Fields in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Full year cash costs are projected to be in the range of $16 to $16.50 per barrel, which compares to previous full year guidance of $16 to $17 per barrel. DD&A per barrel is forecast to be $26 to $27 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $26.50 to $27 per barrel for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $27 to $28 per barrel. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $43.50 to $45.50 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $42.50 to $43.50 per barrel for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $43 to $45 per barrel. 
The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $4.20 to $4.30 per barrel for the fourth quarter and $3.85 to $3.95 per barrel for the full year, consistent with previous guidance of $3.80 to $4 per barrel. 
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million in the fourth quarter and $250 million to $260 million for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $260 million to $280 million. 
The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 36% to 40% for the fourth quarter and 40% to 44% for the full year of 2016, which compares to previous full year guidance of 41% to 45%. 
Turning to Bakken Midstream. We estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter and $48 million to $53 million for the full year of 2016, which is up from previous full year guidance of $40 million to $50 million. 
Turning to corporate. We expect corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the fourth quarter and $90 million to $95 million for the full year of 2016, which compares to previous full year guidance of $100 million to $110 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the fourth quarter and $200 million to $205 million for the full year of 2016. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

And within this context, some of your peers and semi-peers have taken a little bit of a different tack recently, and they've indicated that even if the oil price does increase, that their spending is not going to rise through 2020 with capital returned to shareholders instead and to reduce debt, et cetera. So my question is how you guys are thinking about capital management over the medium term if we have a scenario whereby the oil price does recover, and whether you feel that the balance between returns on capital and production growth and financial flexibility requires adjustment in relation to the past decade? And if so, how should it change?"

It's a balance sheet that's premiered here to fund through the cycle the excellent growth opportunities we have both short cycle in the Bakken and longer cycle in Guyana. And as long as those opportunities offer superior financial returns to our shareholders, that will obviously command our capital going forward, with an eye to keeping the balance sheet in check as well as looking at, over time, offering competitive growth and increasing cash returns to shareholders as well. So it's going to be a balance, and it's going to be a function of oil price."

But that's why we gave you the Middle Bakken numbers. The Middle Bakken numbers were very strong, less impacted by the production and curtailment.

So Evan, we think that the Bakken is really 2 different areas, right. So in the core of the core, we believe that sticking with sliding-sleeve completions and increasing that stage count as high as you can practically go delivers the highest return. The proppant loading we're using in those areas, again, the core of the core, is anywhere from 80,000 to 110,000 pounds per stage, and that just really depends on where we are because we have the data to kind of say it's better to optimize that between 80,000 and 110,000. Now as you move outside the core, we continue to evaluate other designs, which include slickwater, plug and perf, high-proppant volume completions. And what we ultimately decide there and we'll begin testing some of those techniques, whatever technique gives us the highest return for DSU, that is the one we're going to select. And so the reason for the differences are simply because in the core of the core, you're on the flexure of the structure, so you have an awful high amount of natural fracturing. So you just need less of a proppant load. As you get outside the core, there's less of that effect. So that's what drives these different completion designs outside the core."

So that's going to have our first call on capital will be going to the Bakken. Then again, now as prices continue to move, and as you know $1 move for us is $70 million of annual cash flow, we'll begin to look across the portfolio. And there are opportunities across our offshore portfolio that we could increase capital to. So it will be something that we'll be looking at and balancing it with where our balance sheet is and commodity prices are and returns to shareholders, but there's very good returns across our portfolio."

So if you're starting with our third quarter, the 314,000 barrels per day, we're going to get an increase, about 11,000 barrels a day, combined from JDA and South Arne.

So if you're starting with our third quarter, the 314,000 barrels per day, we're going to get an increase, about 11,000 barrels a day, combined from JDA and South Arne. As Greg had mentioned in his comments earlier, JDA will get back above 30,000 barrels a day because the booster compression tie-in work that we had in the second quarter and South Arne did have a turnaround as well, so we're getting a pickup there. That increase, though, is being offset and slightly even more. There's going to be a reduction, about 12,000 barrels a day, as it relates to as we talked about Utica. Utica is going to start declining. We're not bringing -- we're not drilling and bringing any wells online there. The Bakken, as you mentioned, still going to -- it's going to come off the 107,000 and begin to decline with the 2 rigs. And in EG, we do have a bit of our normal entitlement change that we have in the fourth quarter as you get through the year of your cost recoveries. So combined, Utica, EG and Bakken will be down about 12,000 barrels a day. And then you have the 1s and 2s across the portfolio, again, where we're not drilling, and that comes to approximately 8,000 barrels a day there, just things in the Gulf of Mexico, as Greg mentioned. So that's where we get to this approximate of about 305,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter."
