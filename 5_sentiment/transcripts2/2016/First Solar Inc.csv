Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2015 was another remarkable year for First Solar and we finished the year with strong operational and financial results. Slide 4 highlights some of the outstanding achievements from this p",1180,"Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2015 was another remarkable year for First Solar and we finished the year with strong operational and financial results. Slide 4 highlights some of the outstanding achievements from this past year. First, on the strength of our research and development efforts, we have continued to be the driving force in the advancement of CadTel solar technology. In the first half of 2015, we set cell efficiency and module efficiency records of 21.5% and 18.6% respectively. The cell record at that time represented eighth substantial update to our record sale roadmap since 2011 and the record module efficiency placed us in a superior position to the best recorded multicrystalline silicon module. Building on the success, today, we have announced that we have achieved yet another new record cell efficiency of 22.1% as certified by Newport Labs and documented by NREL. At our last analyst day in March 2014, we set a target to reach a 22% research cell efficiency milestone by the end of 2015, and with this announcement, we have delivered on that promise. The accomplishment validates our continued confidence in CadTel as a superior PV material that combines cost effectiveness, reliability and high-performance. This achievement is also a testament to our world-class research and development team which continues to push the boundary of CadTel technology. 
Turning back to our 2015 performance, our full fleet averaged 15.6% for the year, which is 160 basis point improvement from our 2014 average. In percentage terms, our full fleet average module cost per watt decreased by over 15% versus the prior year. Our EPC group also had tremendous execution as we installed more than 1.8 gigawatts of modules in 2015. This brings the total cumulative modules installed by our EPC group to over 6 gigawatts and underscores our tremendous capabilities in providing power plant solutions to our customers. The performance of our global sales team was also outstanding last year as we booked a record 3.4 gigawatts DC. Compared to our shipments of 2.9 gigawatts, we once again exceeded our targeted one-to-one book-to-bill ratio. Our financial results for the full year were equally impressive with new record annual revenue of $3.6 billion, which resulted in earnings per fully diluted share of $5.37. We also closed the year with $1.8 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet, even while ending the year with over $1.3 billion in project-related assets, representing projects on our balance sheet under development and in construction.  While I am pleased with these exceptional results for 2015, as an organization, we will not grow complacent but are setting our sights on even greater success as we look at our long-term vision for this company. 
Next, let me provide a brief update on our technology performance in the fourth quarter. Relative to the prior quarter, our Q4 fleet average efficiency improved to 16.1% or a 30 basis points improvement. This is the first time our full fleet has averaged above 16% for an entire quarter. Also, as expected, our lead line efficiency held steady at 16.4% as we did not implement any new efficiency process improvements in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6, I'll review our progress in securing new business since our last earnings call. With our 2015 bookings of 3.4 gigawatts and additional year-to-date 2016 bookings of over 160 megawatts, we have a remaining expected module shipment balance of 4.4 gigawatt as of today's call. Our book-to-bill ratio for 2015 was approximately 1.2, which exceeded our goal of a one-to-one book-to-bill ratio. Since our Q3 earnings call, we have booked 420 megawatts DC, with the majority of this volume contracted in international markets, signaling the continued diversification of our business. A prime example of this diversification is in Turkey, where we have recently booked third party module sales of over 200 megawatts DC. The largest of these deals is a 100-megawatt agreement signed with Zorlu Energy which adds additional contracted volume to our 2017 shipments. We made further progress in Japan this past quarter with additional contracted bookings which now brings our total development pipeline in the country to nearly 100 megawatts. We see attractive opportunities in this market and continue to pursue additional project pipeline. The remainder of the international volume book include an EPC project in Australia and third party module sales or module plus sales in India and Africa.  In the U.S., as discussed on our guidance call in December, we signed a 79-megawatt AC 20-year PPA with NV Energy which was an expansion of a 100-megawatt plant signed earlier in 2015. All power generated by the combined 179-megawatt switch station will support Switch's commitment to renewable energy in Nevada. 
Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7 billion, as shown on Slide 7. The decrease in revenue from the beginning of the year is due to a combination of our record 2015 revenue recognized, assets dropped to 8.3 and also due to a higher mix of module and module plus deals in the bookings for the year. 
Turning to Slide 8, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities which have further increased to 20.3 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 2.9 gigawatts from the prior quarter. The sharp increase in potential bookings was primarily driven by a number of new opportunities that we are pursuing in the U.S. With greater certainty now in place related to the ITC, we are seeing an increase in opportunities. Our mid to late-stage bookings increased another 600 megawatts this past quarter to 4.5 gigawatts DC which was a new record number of advanced stage opportunities. International opportunity comprised over 75% of these mid- to late-stage bookings. Looking back 1 year ago to the time when our potential bookings opportunity stood at 13.5 gigawatts, the growth in our opportunity set to now over 20 megawatts is remarkable. It is a testament to our global sales effort, as well as the increasing realization in the marketplace of the energy density advantage of First Solar Technology. 
Moving onto Slide 9, our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography shows a significant increase in U.S. opportunities, as previously indicated. The portion of U.S. opportunities is now over 40% versus 25% in the prior quarter. Besides the U.S., we also saw an increase in potential opportunities in India. 
Lastly, we will be holding an analyst day on Tuesday, April 5, in New York City. At this event, we will provide an update on our strategic priorities. This includes the latest developments in our technology and operations roadmaps, our plans for growth and capacity, progress we are making in key markets and our latest business outlook. There will be a live webcast of the event available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our executive management team looks forward to the opportunity to provide the latest updates on our business and answer your questions. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our fourth quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

I'll begin by discussing our fourth quarter operational performance on Slide 12. In Q4, we produced 760 megawatts DC, an increase of 16% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiencies, increased manufacturing capacity and less downtime for technology updates. Production was 50% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the restart of certain manufacturing lines, higher efficiencies, improved throughput and the addition of new capacity. For the full year, we produced over 2.5 gigawatts DC, which is a 36% increase compared to 2014. Our factory capacity utilization raised 100% in Q4 which represents an increase of 6 percentage points compared to the third quarter and a 16 percentage point increase versus the same period in 2014. Fast utilization increased in the fourth quarter due to fewer upgrade activities across the fleet. For the full year, our capacity utilization was 92%, an increase of 11 percentage points as compared to 2014. 
Our fourth quarter best line efficiency averaged 16.4%, which as planned was unchanged from the prior quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, our lead line efficiency improved by 160 basis points. Our fourth quarter average module conversion efficiency for the entire fleet was 16.1%, an increase of 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 170 basis points higher year-over-year. Since quarter end, our full fleet efficiency has continued to improve and has averaged 16.2% quarter-to-date with the an expectation of 16.3% by the end of Q1. For the full year 2015, our fleet average efficiency was 15.6%, which represents 160 basis points improvement from the prior year. 
Continuing onto Slide 13, I'll discuss the P&L results for the fourth quarter. Net sales were $942 million in the quarter compared to our record quarterly revenue of $1.3 billion in Q3. A decrease in sales primarily resulted from lower revenue on the Stateline project, which achieved initial revenue recognition in the prior quarter. Net sales also decreased due to lower third party module and module plus sales. As Jim indicated, we set a new record for net sales for the year of $3.6 billion, which was on the high end of our guidance range. As percentage of total quarterly sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems project was unchanged from the prior quarter at 95%. Module plus sales are included in our solar power systems revenue and totaled approximately $60 million in Q4. Third party module sales were lower in the fourth quarter with majority of shipments to India. Gross margin for the quarter was 24.6% compared to 38.1% in the. The decrease in gross margin percentage this due to both the lower mix and Stateline revenue and a benefit in that third quarter from a reduction of cost associated with our module collection and recycling program. 
Our gross margin for the full year was 25.7% versus 25% at the high end of our projections. Our ongoing improvements in module cost per watt and balance system across our project portfolio where the major drivers of the gross margin guidance speak. The significant reduction in fleet average model cost per watt in the fourth quarter and robust competitiveness of our technology is also visible in our segment gross margin, which reached over 26% in the quarter. Operating expenses increased by $13 million from Q3 to $100 million. The prior quarter operating expenses benefited from reduction in our EOL obligation. In addition, our R&D expenses increased as we continue to invest in our technology. For the full year, our operating expenses were $403 million, or slightly below the high end of our guidance. The fourth quarter operating profit was $132 million compared to an operating profit of $398 million in Q3. For 2015, operating profit was $517 million, significantly above the high end of our guidance range of $490 million. The strong performance relative to guidance was primarily driven by favorable cost performance across our portfolio of system projects. In addition, we were able to successfully avoid potential penalties on a couple of project that had aggressive year-end completion requirements. 
We had a tax benefit of approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter resulting from a favorable mix in jurisdictional income. Over the year, the tax rate was a 1% benefit which included a $28 million net benefit associated with a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority, highlighted in Q3. Our quarterly earnings of $1.60 per fully diluted share of net income for it, excuse me core net income of $164 million. Full year 2015 our earnings per share was $5.37. Over full year results exceeded our guidance midpoint by almost $1 per share. Operational improvements accounted for slightly more than half of the upside to our guidance and we're for primarily due to cost reductions reductions realized across our project portfolio. Our operational strength and ability to scale our module and BOS cost improvements across our large system portfolio continues to be one of our key value drivers. 
The remaining guidance to the midpoint was from lower-than-expected tax expense which resulted from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income. Moving onto Slide 14, I'll now discuss the selected balance sheet items and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities were essentially flat at $1.8 billion. Our net cash position was unchanged at $1.5 billion. Compared to the end of 2014, our cash balance decreased by approximately $160 million. We ended 2015 with over $1.3 billion in project-related assets, both in development and under construction. When taking into account the size of these assets, which increased by approximately $460 million year-on-year, it demonstrates how we have continued to maintain remarkable financial strength will still find it our project development activities. As a reminder, we expect significant portion of the projects comprised in this balance to be sold by the end of 2016. 
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities increased by $85 million compared to Q3. The increase was driven by higher project asset associated with our CA flat's advice other projects under development. Total debt increased MAFA slightly from the prior quarter to $289 million. Cash flow from operations was $53 million compared to $21 million in that third quarter. Free cash flow was $20 million compared to a negative $17 million in Q3. Capital expenditures were $27 million, a sequential decrease of $18 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $60 million or $1 million lower than the prior quarter. 
Turning to Slide 15, I'll now discuss our updated full year 2016 guidance. As we indicated on our guidance call in December, the outlook we provided at that time did not incorporate an extension of the ITC, and that such a change could lead us to extend some project schedules into 2017. The revised guidance now incorporates these updates after reviewing our development portfolio. The adjustments we are making to the development timing of projects benefits our business over the combined 2 year horizon as the schedule adjustments will allow us to achieve a lower installed cost per watt on the construction of these plants. Specifically, we now anticipate achieving COD on our Kuyama switch station in the first phase of California flash projects in 2017. While our guidance anticipates that we will recognize a significant portion of revenue and earnings on the first stage of California Flats in 2016, the other 2 projects will be recognized entirely in 2017. With this in mind, our net sales range has decreased approximately $100 million to a revised range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion, reflecting the pushout of some projects into 2017. We are raising the low end of our gross margin guidance by 100 basis points to revise range of 17% to 18%. The gross margin improvements as a result of better than originally anticipated module and balance system cost for the year. As a reminder, what the indicated in our December guidance call, the net sale and gross margin guidance does not include the sale of majority interest in the Stateline project, which is accounted for as an equity method investment. We are selling a minority interest in Stateline and expect the profit on the sale to be recognized as and earnings not a tax, not revenue or gross margin. The gross margin guidance range would increase by about 200 basis points if the transaction was treated as a typical sale. 
Operating expenses, operating income and our effective tax rate are unchanged. Earnings per share guidance is also unchanged. As a reminder, our EPS guidance include a gain of approximately $200 million net of tax from the expected sale of our equity method investment in Stateline and First Solar share of 8.3's earnings. These 2 items do not flow through neet income but do impact income and net earnings per share. So much for our previous guidance. The profile of net sales and earnings per share are expected to be approximately 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the second-half. This profile is subject to timing of project sales which could alter this expectation. We have lowered tha expected and it net cash and operating cash flow ranges by $100 million compared to our prior guidance. This corresponds in conjunction with the revenue guidance as proceeds from these projects were not received until 2017. Should be kept in mind that our operating cash flow guidance does not include approximately $450 million from the expected sale of our equity method investment in Stateline, which will be treated as an investing cash flows. Our capital expenditures and shipping guidance remain unchanged. Our drop-down plans or 8.3 next year have changed slightly since or December gardens call. We anticipate 3 assets, KingBird, Stateline and Millwaupee offer, which are all part of row full list of the drop down. Kingbird will be the first half of the year with remaining  Kuyama assets in the second half of the year. Originally planned to achieve COD in 2016, has been pushed out to leverage the benefits of the ITC index given the butter, factors impacting the legal sector, the timing and execution of drop-downs to 8.3 is subject to market conditions. 
Turning to the next slide. I'll summarize our projects in the past year and most recent quarter. First, we delivered outstanding financial results for 2015 and recorded net sales of $3.6 billion. Gross margin of 26% and earnings per share of $5.37. We maintain our 2016 earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.50, even when adjusting some project schedule to capture better value of these projects in 2017. Our technology performance continues its ongoing improvement with the fleet average efficiency now over 16.2% and the best line at 6..4 percent. Our pipeline continues to grow with record bookings of 3.4 gigawatts in 2015 and a growing number of bookings in international regions. Our potential bookings are 20.3 gigawatts have grown 2.9 gigawatts. Our late stage opportunities are also the strongest they have been, with 4.5 gigawatts of projects. 
With this, we've concluded our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

So what you would expect to see the 16 4 trend higher as we exit the year, yes. But obviously, clearly that the order of magnitude that we saw in 2015 which basically represented 160 basis points improvement year on year. But as we said before, we have a very good module right now, in mid-'16 efficiency with the energy yield that we captured through we are very happy with the competitiveness of our module. As it relates to bookings, bookings we'll continue to reflect ourself relative to opportunity in our pipeline, as you identified, we're very happy with the growth we're seeing now with over 20 gigawatts.

The competitive environment has improved a little bit versus, let's say, 18 months ago. So it's a whole variety of factors. It is also a broadening of demand. So we are seeing the utilities express a desire to begin to participate in solar on a broader basis. We've had some very large customers that we dealt with quite a few years now but we're adding to the customers said. And beer getting inbound inquiries and seemed RFPs from other utilities. We are also seeing you developers come in to the marketplace that are in your service territories that we have seen activity before.

We built, over the last several years, but the focus on reining in OpEx and being a very low-cost operation. We've also intentionally structured our operations so that we can leverage growth and future opportunities off of a given level of OpEx. We spent a lot of time the bait, head knocking internally over how do we build an organization and how do we structure the business we're pursuing from the strategic standpoint so that we can leverage against that OpEx level. And the way the organization has been built with the shared service centers, we've built some of our international locations, those resources and those centers can cost effectively support our operations whether they're in the U.S. or whether they're in almost every jurisdiction around the world. And so that gives us greater flexibility and release us of the need to redeploy resources. So we try to centralize certain resources and shared resource centers and centers of excellence that can be deployed anywhere and we have local resources that are focused, and we structured both of those activities so that they can be leveraged against greater opportunities without having to add OpEx. So the proof that our efforts and concepts are working this in the fact that we're been able to shift gears through the sort of changing market cycle without having to retool the organization. And it's given us, it's demonstrated that we built what we intended to build, which is a highly flexible, highly response organization that can adapt to changing markets, to circumstances, very quickly."

I think that the final stories have yet to be told in terms of the resolution of some of the assets in the marketplace and I think we are also taking a very cautious approach to how much risk we're willing to take on board, particularly how much counterparty risk we're willing to take on board. We have a lot of high-quality opportunities, and I think we've quite candidly backed away a little bit from chasing stuff that's going to require us to take a bunch of risk.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2015 was another remarkable year for First Solar, and we finished the year with strong operational and financial results. Slide 4 highlights some of the outstanding achievements from this",1183,"Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2015 was another remarkable year for First Solar, and we finished the year with strong operational and financial results. Slide 4 highlights some of the outstanding achievements from this past year. First, on the strength of our research and development efforts, we have continued to be the driving force in the advancement of CdTe solar technology. In the first half of 2015, we set cell efficiency and module efficiency records of 21.5% and 18.6%, respectively. The cell record at that time represented the eighth substantial update to our record cell road map since 2011, and the record module efficiency placed us in a superior position to the best recorded multicrystalline silicon module. Building on this success, today, we have announced that we have achieved yet another new record cell efficiency of 22.1% as certified by Newport Lab and documented by NREL. At our last analyst day in March 2014, we set a target to reach a 22% research cell efficiency milestone by the end of 2015, and with this announcement, we have delivered on that promise. The accomplishment validates our continued confidence in CdTe as a superior PV material that combines cost effectiveness, reliability and high performance. This achievement is also a testament to our world-class research and development team, which continues to push the boundary of CdTe technology.
Turning back to our 2015 performance. Our full fleet averaged 15.6% for the year, which is 160 basis point improvement from our 2014 average. In percentage terms, our full fleet average module cost per watt decreased by over 15% versus the prior year. Our EPC group also had tremendous execution as we installed more than 1.8 gigawatts of modules in 2015. This brings the total cumulative modules installed by our EPC group to over 6 gigawatts and underscores our tremendous capabilities in providing power plant solutions to our customers. The performance of our global sales team was also outstanding last year as we booked a record 3.4 gigawatts DC. Compared to our shipments of 2.9 gigawatts, we once again exceeded our targeted 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. Our financial results for the full year were equally impressive with new record annual revenue of $3.6 billion, which resulted in earnings per fully diluted share of $5.37. We also closed the year with $1.8 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet, even while ending the year with over $1.3 billion in project-related assets, representing projects on our balance sheet under development and in construction. While I am pleased with these exceptional results for 2015, as an organization, we will not grow complacent but are setting our sights on even greater success as we look at our long-term vision for this company.
Next, let me provide a brief update on our technology performance in the fourth quarter. Relative to the prior quarter, our Q4 fleet average efficiency improved to 16.1% or a 30 basis point improvement. This is the first time our full fleet has averaged above 16% for an entire quarter. Also, as expected, our lead line efficiency held steady at 16.4% as we did not implement any new efficiency process improvements in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 6, I'll review our progress in securing new business since our last earnings call. With our 2015 bookings of 3.4 gigawatts and additional year-to-date 2016 bookings of over 160 megawatts, we have a remaining expected module shipment balance of 4.4 gigawatt as of today's call. Our book-to-bill ratio for 2015 was approximately 1.2, which exceeded our goal of a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. Since our Q3 earnings call, we have booked 420 megawatts DC, with the majority of this volume contracted in international markets, signaling the continued diversification of our business. A prime example of this diversification is in Turkey, where we have recently booked third-party module sales of over 200 megawatts DC. The largest of these deals was a 100-megawatt agreement signed with Zorlu Energy, which adds additional contracted volume to our 2017 shipments. We made further progress in Japan this past quarter with additional contracted bookings which now brings our total development pipeline in the country to nearly 100 megawatts. We see attractive opportunities in this market and continue to pursue additional project pipeline. The remainder of the international volume booked included an EPC project in Australia and third-party module sales or module plus sales in India and Africa. In the U.S., as discussed on our guidance call in December, we signed a 79-megawatt AC 20-year PPA with NV Energy, which was an expansion of a 100-megawatt plant signed earlier in 2015. All power generated by the combined 179-megawatt Switch Station will support Switch's commitment to renewable energy in Nevada.
Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7 billion, as shown on Slide 7. The decrease in revenue from the beginning of the year is due to a combination of our record 2015 revenue recognized assets dropped to 8point3 and also due to a higher mix of module and module plus deals in the bookings for the year.
Turning to Slide 8, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities which have further increased to 20.3 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 2.9 gigawatts from the prior quarter. The sharp increase in potential bookings was primarily driven by a number of new opportunities that we are pursuing in the U.S. With greater certainty now in place related to the ITC, we are seeing an increase in opportunities. Our mid- to late-stage bookings increased another 600 megawatts this past quarter to 4.5 gigawatts DC, which is a new record number of advanced stage opportunities. International opportunities comprised over 75% of these mid- to late-stage bookings. Looking back 1 year ago, to the time when our potential bookings opportunity stood at 13.5 gigawatts, the growth in our opportunity set to now over 20 megawatts is remarkable. It is a testament to our global sales effort as well as the increasing realization in the marketplace of the energy density advantage of First Solar technology.
Moving on to Slide 9, our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography shows a significant increase in U.S. opportunities, as previously indicated. The portion of U.S. opportunities is now over 40% versus 25% in the prior quarter. Besides the U.S., we also saw an increase in potential opportunities in India.
Lastly, we will be holding an analyst day on Tuesday, April 5, in New York City. At this event, we will provide an update on our strategic priorities. This includes the latest developments in our technology and operations road maps, our plans for growth and capacity, progress we are making in key markets and our latest business outlook. There will be a live webcast of the event available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our executive management team looks forward to the opportunity to provide the latest updates on our business and answer your questions.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our fourth quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

I'll begin by discussing our fourth quarter operational performance on Slide 12. In Q4, we produced 760 megawatts DC, an increase of 16% from the prior quarter, due to higher module efficiencies, increased manufacturing capacity and less downtime for technology upgrades. Production was 50% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the restart of certain manufacturing lines, higher efficiencies, improved throughput and the addition of new capacity. For the full year, we produced over 2.5 gigawatts DC, which is a 36% increase compared to 2014. Our factory capacity utilization raised 100% in Q4 which represents an increase of 6 percentage points compared to the third quarter and a 16 percentage point increase versus the same period in 2014. Capacity utilization increased in the fourth quarter due to fewer upgrade activities across the fleet. For the full year, our capacity utilization was 92%, an increase of 11 percentage points as compared to 2014.
Our fourth quarter best line efficiency averaged 16.4%, which, as planned, was unchanged from the prior quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, our lead line efficiency improved by 160 basis points. Our fourth quarter average module conversion efficiency for the entire fleet was 16.1%, an increase of 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 170 basis points higher year-over-year. Since quarter-end, our full fleet efficiency has continued to improve and has averaged 16.2% quarter-to-date with an expectation of 16.3% by the end of Q1. For the full year 2015, our fleet average efficiency was 15.6%, which represents 160 basis points improvement from the prior year.
Continuing on to Slide 13, I'll discuss the P&L results for the fourth quarter. Net sales were $942 million in the quarter compared to our record quarterly revenue of $1.3 billion in Q3. The decrease in sales primarily resulted from lower revenue on the Stateline project, which achieved initial revenue recognition in the prior quarter. Net sales also decreased due to lower third-party module and module plus sales. As Jim indicated, we set a new record for net sales for the year of $3.6 billion, which was on the high end of our guidance range. As a percentage of total quarterly sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, was unchanged from the prior quarter at 95%. Module plus sales are included in our solar power systems revenue and totaled approximately $60 million in Q4. Third party module sales were slightly lower in the fourth quarter with the majority of shipments to India. Gross margin for the quarter was 24.6% compared to 38.1% in the third quarter. The decrease in gross margin percentage is due to both the lower mix of Stateline revenue and a benefit in the third quarter from a reduction in the cost associated with our module collection and recycling program.
Our gross margin for the full year was 25.7% versus 25% at the high end of our projections. Our ongoing improvements in module cost per watt and balance of systems savings across our project portfolio were the major drivers of the gross margin guidance beat. The significant reduction in our fleet average module cost per watt in the fourth quarter and robust competitiveness of our technology is also visible in our component segment gross margin, which reached over 26% in the quarter. Operating expenses increased by $13 million from Q3 to $100 million. The prior quarter operating expenses benefited from reduction in our EOL obligation. In addition, our R&D expenses increased as we continue to invest in our technology. For the full year, our operating expenses were $403 million or slightly below the high end of our guidance. The fourth quarter operating profit was $132 million compared to an operating profit of $398 million in Q3. For 2015, operating profit was $517 million, significantly above the high end of our guidance range of $490 million. The strong performance relative to guidance was primarily driven by favorable cost performance across our portfolio of system projects. In addition, we were able to successfully avoid potential penalties on a couple of projects that had aggressive year-end completion requirements.
We had a tax benefit of approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter resulting from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income. Over the year, the tax rate was a 1% benefit, which included a $28 million net benefit associated with a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority highlighted in Q3. Our quarterly earnings of $1.60 per fully diluted share of net income -- or excuse me, on net income is $164 million. Full year 2015 earnings per share was $5.37. Our full year results exceeded our guidance midpoint by almost $1 per share. Operational improvements accounted for slightly more than half of the upside to our guidance and were primarily due to cost reductions realized across our project portfolio. Our operational strength and ability to scale our module and BoS cost improvements across our large system portfolio continues to be one of our key value drivers.
The remaining beat to the guidance to the midpoint was from the lower-than-expected tax expense, which resulted from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income.
Moving on to Slide 14, I'll now discuss the selected balance sheet items and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities were essentially flat at $1.8 billion. Our net cash position was unchanged at $1.5 billion. Compared to the end of 2014, our cash balance decreased by approximately $160 million. We ended 2015 with over $1.3 billion in project-related assets, both in development and under construction. When taking into account the size of these assets, which increased by approximately $460 million year-on-year, it demonstrates how we have continued to maintain remarkable financial strength while still funding our project development activities. As a reminder, we expect a significant portion of the projects comprised in this balance to be sold by the end of 2016.
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased by $85 million compared to Q3. The increase was driven by higher project asset associated with our Moapa, CA Flats and various other projects under development. Total debt increased slightly from the prior quarter to $289 million. Cash flow from operations was $53 million compared to $21 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow was $20 million compared to a negative $17 million in Q3. Capital expenditures were $27 million, a sequential decrease of $18 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $60 million or $1 million lower than the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 15, I'll now discuss our updated full year 2016 guidance. As we indicated on our guidance call in December, the outlook we provided at that time did not incorporate an extension of the ITC, and that such a change could lead us to extend some project schedules into 2017. The revised guidance now incorporates these updates after reviewing our development portfolio. The adjustments we are making to the development timing of projects benefits our business over the combined 2-year horizon as the schedule adjustments will allow us to achieve a lower installed cost per watt on the construction of these plants. Specifically, we now anticipate achieving COD on our Cuyama, Switch Station and the first phase of California Flats projects in 2017. While our guidance anticipates that we will recognize a significant portion of revenue and earnings on the first phase of California Flats in 2016, the other 2 projects will be recognized entirely in 2017.
With this in mind, our net sales range has decreased approximately $100 million to a revised range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion, reflecting the pushout of some projects into 2017. We are raising the low end of our gross margin guidance by 100 basis points to a revised range of 17% to 18%. The gross margin improvement is a result of better than originally anticipated module and balance system cost for the year. As a reminder of what we indicated in our December guidance call, the net sales and gross margin guidance does not include the sale of minority interest in the Stateline project, which is accounted for as an equity method investment. We are selling a minority interest in Stateline, and we expect the profit on the sale to be recognized in equity and earnings, net of tax, not revenue or gross margin. The gross margin guidance range will increase by about 200 basis points if the transaction was treated as a typical sale.
Operating expenses, operating income and our effective tax rate are unchanged. Earnings per share guidance is also unchanged. As a reminder, our EPS guidance include a gain of approximately $200 million, net of tax, from the expected sale of our equity method investment in Stateline and First Solar share of 8point3's earnings. These 2 items do not flow through operating income but do impact net income and earnings per share. So much for our previous guidance. The profile of net sales and earnings per share are expected to be approximately 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half. This profile is subject to timing of project sales which could alter this expectation. We have lowered the expected ending net cash and operating cash flow ranges by $100 million compared to our prior guidance. This corresponds with the reduction in revenue guidance as the proceeds from these projects will not be received until 2017. It should be kept in mind that our operating cash flow guidance does not include approximately $450 million from the expected sale of our equity method investment in Stateline, which will be treated as investing cash flows. Our capital expenditures and shipping guidance remain unchanged. Our drop-down plans for 8point3 next year have changed slightly since our December guidance call. We anticipate 3 assets, Kingbird, Stateline and Moapa, which are all part of the ROFO list to be dropped down in 2016. Kingbird will be in the first half of the year with the remaining 2 assets in the second half of the year. Cuyama, originally planned to achieve COD in 2016, has been pushed out to leverage the benefits of the ITC extension. Given the broader economic factors impacting the YieldCo sector, the timing and execution of drop-downs to 8point3 is subject to market conditions.
Turning to the next slide. I'll summarize our progress during the past year and most recent quarter. First, we delivered outstanding financial results for 2015 and recorded net sales of $3.6 billion, gross margin of 26% and earnings per share of $5.37. We maintain our 2016 earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.50, even when adjusting some project schedules to capture better value of these projects in 2017. Our technology performance continues its ongoing improvement with the fleet average efficiency now over 16.2% and the best line at 16.4%. Our pipeline continues to grow with record bookings of 3.4 gigawatts in 2015 and a growing number of bookings in international regions. Our potential bookings of 20.3 gigawatts have grown 2.9 gigawatts. Our mid- to late-stage opportunities are also the strongest they have been, with 4.5 gigawatts of projects.

So would we expect to see the 16.4 trend higher as we exit the year? Yes. But obviously, clearly to the order of magnitude that we saw in 2015, which basically represented 160 basis points improvement year on year. But as we said before, we have a very competitive module right now, in mid-16 efficiency with the energy yield that we capture through temperature coefficient and spectral response, we're very happy with the competitiveness of our module. As it relates to bookings, bookings we'll continue to reflect ourself relative to our opportunity in our pipeline, that we've identified. We're very happy with the growth that we've seen.

The resolution of the ITC, I think, more than anything else, it's not any particular outcome with respect to the ITC, but it's removing the overhang of uncertainty and allows people to run their models and be deterministic about what the financial conditions that they're going to be developing projects in. So it's allowed us to advance some of our own projects. It's allowed customers to advance their projects. It's firmed up what the financial environment looks like. The competitive environment has improved a little bit versus, let's say, 18 months ago. So it's a whole variety of factors. It's also a broadening of demand. We are seeing utilities express a desire to begin to participate in solar on a broader basis. We've had some very large customers that we dealt with for quite a few years now, but we're adding to the customer sets. And we're getting inbound inquiries and seeing RFPs from other utilities. We're also seeing new developers come into the marketplace there and new service territories that we'd not seen activity before. So it's the cumulative effect of a fairly broad set of circumstances. It's not one single thing that triggered it. It's very broad and across the board."

We've built, over the last several years, with the focus on reining in OpEx and being a very lean, low-cost operation. We've also intentionally structured our operations so that we can leverage growth and future opportunities off of a given level of OpEx. We've spent a lot of time, debate, head-knocking internally over how do we build an organization and how do we structure our -- the business we're pursuing from a strategic standpoint so that we can leverage against that OpEx level. And the way the organization has been built, with the shared service centers we've built in some of our international locations, those resources and those centers can cost effectively support our operations, whether they're in the U.S. or whether they're in almost any jurisdiction around the world. And so that gives us greater flexibility and relieves us of the need to redeploy resources. So we try to centralize certain resources and shared resource centers and centers of excellence that can be deployed anywhere, and then we have local resources that are focused, and we structure both of those activities so that they can be leveraged against greater opportunities without having to add OpEx. So the proof that our efforts and concepts are working is the fact that we've been able to shift gears through the sort of changing market cycle without having to retool the organization.

I'm not sure the rate of change will be what it was several years ago, but there will continue to be a benefit moving forward.

And then on the mix of that, I don't believe we've ever shared the mix on that opportunity set, so I can't comment on that."

And so we spend a lot of time making sure we're in touch with the market, making sure we're in touch with our customers, making sure we have a sense of what's happening out there, and we certainly recognize it as an exposure if we didn't pay close attention to it. But we feel like, and we've demonstrated over the last several years, that we understand the market, and we know how to price our products so we have the ability to monetize effectively.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2015 was another remarkable year for First Solar, and we finished the year with strong operational and financial results. Slide 4 highlights some of the outstanding achievements from this",1183,"Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2015 was another remarkable year for First Solar, and we finished the year with strong operational and financial results. Slide 4 highlights some of the outstanding achievements from this past year. First, on the strength of our research and development efforts, we have continued to be the driving force in the advancement of CdTe solar technology. In the first half of 2015, we set cell efficiency and module efficiency records of 21.5% and 18.6%, respectively. The cell record at that time represented the eighth substantial update to our record cell road map since 2011, and the record module efficiency placed us in a superior position to the best recorded multicrystalline silicon module. Building on this success, today, we have announced that we have achieved yet another new record cell efficiency of 22.1%, as certified by Newport Lab and documented by NREL. At our last analyst day in March 2014, we set a target to reach a 22% research cell efficiency milestone by the end of 2015, and with this announcement, we have delivered on that promise. The accomplishment validates our continued confidence in CdTe as a superior PV material that combines cost effectiveness, reliability and high performance. This achievement is also a testament to our world-class research and development team, which continues to push the boundaries of CdTe technology.
Turning back to our 2015 performance. Our full fleet averaged 15.6% for the year, which is a 160 basis point improvement from our 2014 average. In percentage terms, our full fleet average module cost per watt decreased by over 15% versus the prior year. Our EPC group also had tremendous execution as we installed more than 1.8 gigawatts of modules in 2015. This brings the total cumulative modules installed by our EPC group to over 6 gigawatts and underscores our tremendous capabilities in providing power plant solutions to our customers. The performance of our global sales team was also outstanding last year as we booked a record 3.4 gigawatts DC. Compared to our shipments of 2.9 gigawatts, we once again exceeded our targeted 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. Our financial results for the full year were equally impressive with new record annual revenue of $3.6 billion, which resulted in earnings per fully diluted share of $5.37. We also closed the year with $1.8 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet, even while ending the year with over $1.3 billion in project-related assets, representing projects on our balance sheet under development and in construction. While I am pleased with these exceptional results for 2015, as an organization, we will not grow complacent but are setting our sights on even greater success as we look at our long-term vision for this company.
Next, let me provide a brief update on our technology performance in the fourth quarter. Relative to the prior quarter, our Q4 fleet average efficiency improved to 16.1% or a 30 basis point improvement. This is the first time our full fleet has averaged above 16% for an entire quarter. Also, as expected, our lead line efficiency held steady at 16.4%, as we did not implement any new efficiency process improvements in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 6, I'll review our progress in securing new business since our last earnings call. With our 2015 bookings of 3.4 gigawatts and additional year-to-date 2016 bookings of over 160 megawatts, we have a remaining expected module shipment balance of 4.4 gigawatt as of today's call. Our book-to-bill ratio for 2015 was approximately 1.2, which exceeded our goal of a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. Since our Q3 earnings call, we have booked 420 megawatts DC, with the majority of this volume contracted in international markets, signaling the continued diversification of our business. A prime example of this diversification is in Turkey, where we have recently booked third-party module sales of over 200 megawatts DC. The largest of these deals was a 100-megawatt agreement signed with Zorlu Energy, which adds additional contracted volume to our 2017 shipments. We made further progress in Japan this past quarter with additional contracted bookings, which now brings our total development pipeline in the country to nearly 100 megawatts. We see attractive opportunities in this market and continue to pursue additional project pipeline. The remainder of the international volume booked included an EPC project in Australia and third-party module sales or Module Plus sales in India and Africa. In the U.S., as discussed on our guidance call in December, we signed a 79-megawatt AC 20-year PPA with NV Energy, which was an expansion of a 100-megawatt plant signed earlier in 2015. All power generated by the combined 179-megawatt Switch Station will support Switch's commitment to renewable energy in Nevada.
Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7 billion, as shown on Slide 7. The decrease in revenue from the beginning of the year is due to a combination of our record 2015 revenue recognized, assets dropped to 8point3, and also due to a higher mix of module and Module Plus deals in the bookings for the year.
Turning to Slide 8, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities which have further increased to 20.3 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 2.9 gigawatts from the prior quarter. The sharp increase in potential bookings was primarily driven by a number of new opportunities that we are pursuing in the U.S. With greater certainty now in place related to the ITC, we are seeing an increase in opportunities. Our mid- to late-stage bookings increased another 600 megawatts this past quarter to 4.5 gigawatts DC, which is a new record number of advanced-stage opportunities. International opportunities comprised over 75% of these mid- to late-stage bookings. Looking back 1 year ago, to the time when our potential bookings opportunity stood at 13.5 gigawatts, the growth in our opportunity set to now over 20 gigawatts is remarkable. It is a testament to our global sales effort as well as the increasing realization in the marketplace of the energy density advantage of First Solar technology.
Moving on to Slide 9, our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography shows a significant increase in U.S. opportunities, as previously indicated. The portion of U.S. opportunities is now over 40% versus 25% in the prior quarter. Besides the U.S., we also saw an increase in potential opportunities in India.
Lastly, we will be holding an Analyst Day on Tuesday, April 5, in New York City. At this event, we will provide an update on our strategic priorities. This includes the latest developments in our technology and operations road maps, our plans for growth and capacity, progress we are making in key markets and our latest business outlook. There will be a live webcast of the event available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our executive management team looks forward to the opportunity to provide the latest updates on our business and answer your questions.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our fourth quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

I'll begin by discussing our fourth quarter operational performance on Slide 12. In Q4, we produced 760 megawatts DC, an increase of 16% from the prior quarter, due to higher module efficiencies, increased manufacturing capacity and less downtime for technology upgrades. Production was 50% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the restart of certain manufacturing lines, higher efficiencies, improved throughput and the addition of new capacity. For the full year, we produced over 2.5 gigawatts DC, which is a 36% increase compared to 2014. Our factory capacity utilization reached 100% in Q4, which represents an increase of 6 percentage points compared to the third quarter and a 16 percentage point increase versus the same period in 2014. Capacity utilization increased in the fourth quarter due to fewer upgrade activities across the fleet. For the full year, our capacity utilization was 92%, an increase of 11 percentage points as compared to 2014.
Our fourth quarter best line efficiency averaged 16.4%, which, as planned, was unchanged from the prior quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, our lead line efficiency improved by 160 basis points. Our fourth quarter average module conversion efficiency for the entire fleet was 16.1%, an increase of 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 170 basis points higher year-over-year. Since quarter-end, our full fleet efficiency has continued to improve and has averaged 16.2% quarter-to-date, with an expectation of 16.3% by the end of Q1. For the full year 2015, our fleet average efficiency was 15.6%, which represents 160 basis points improvement from the prior year.
Continuing on to Slide 13, I'll discuss the P&L results for the fourth quarter. Net sales were $942 million in the quarter compared to our record quarterly revenue of $1.3 billion in Q3. The decrease in sales primarily resulted from lower revenue on the Stateline project, which achieved initial revenue recognition in the prior quarter. Net sales also decreased due to lower third-party module and Module Plus sales. As Jim indicated, we set a new record for net sales for the year of $3.6 billion, which was on the high end of our guidance range. As a percentage of total quarterly sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, was unchanged from the prior quarter at 95%. Module Plus sales are included in our solar power systems revenue and totaled approximately $60 million in Q4. Third-party module sales were slightly lower in the fourth quarter, with the majority of shipments to India. Gross margin for the quarter was 24.6% compared to 38.1% in the third quarter. The decrease in gross margin percentage is due to both the lower mix of Stateline revenue and a benefit in the third quarter from a reduction in the cost associated with our module collection and recycling program.
Our gross margin for the full year was 25.7% versus 25%, at the high end of our projections. Our ongoing improvements in module cost per watt and balance of systems savings across our project portfolio were the major drivers of the gross margin guidance beat. The significant reduction in our fleet average module cost per watt in the fourth quarter and robust competitiveness of our technology is also visible in our component segment gross margin, which reached over 26% in the quarter. Operating expenses increased by $13 million from Q3 to $100 million. The prior-quarter operating expenses benefited from a reduction in our EOL obligation. In addition, our R&D expenses increased as we continue to invest in our technology. For the full year, our operating expenses were $403 million or slightly below the high end of our guidance. The fourth quarter operating profit was $132 million compared to an operating profit of $398 million in Q3. For 2015, operating profit was $517 million, significantly above the high end of our guidance range of $490 million. The strong performance relative to guidance was primarily driven by favorable cost performance across our portfolio of system projects. In addition, we were able to successfully avoid potential penalties on a couple of projects that had aggressive year-end completion requirements.
We had a tax benefit of approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter resulting from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income. For the year, the tax rate was a 1% benefit, which included a $28 million net benefit associated with a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority, highlighted in Q3. Our quarterly earnings of $1.60 per fully diluted share of net income -- or excuse me, on net income of $164 million. Full year 2015 earnings per share was $5.37. Our full year results exceeded our guidance midpoint by almost $1 per share. Operational improvements accounted for slightly more than half of the upside to our guidance and were primarily due to cost reductions realized across our project portfolio. Our operational strength and ability to scale our module and BoS cost improvements across our large system portfolio continues to be one of our key value drivers.
The remaining beat of the guidance to the midpoint was from the lower-than-expected tax expense, which resulted from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income.
Moving on to Slide 14, I'll now discuss the selected balance sheet items and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities were essentially flat at $1.8 billion. Our net cash position was unchanged at $1.5 billion. Compared to the end of 2014, our cash balance decreased by approximately $160 million. We ended 2015 with over $1.3 billion in project-related assets, both in development and under construction. When taking into account the size of these assets, which increased by approximately $460 million year-on-year, it demonstrates how we have continued to maintain remarkable financial strength while still funding our project development activities. As a reminder, we expect a significant portion of the projects comprised in this balance to be sold by the end of 2016.
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased by $85 million compared to Q3. The increase was driven by higher project assets associated with our Moapa, CA Flats and various other projects under development. Total debt increased slightly from the prior quarter to $289 million. Cash flow from operations was $53 million compared to $21 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow was $20 million compared to a negative $17 million in Q3. Capital expenditures were $27 million, a sequential decrease of $18 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $60 million or $1 million lower than the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 15, I'll now discuss our updated full year 2016 guidance. As we indicated on our guidance call in December, the outlook we provided at that time did not incorporate an extension of the ITC, and that such a change could lead us to extend some project schedules into 2017. The revised guidance now incorporates these updates after reviewing our development portfolio. The adjustments we are making to the development timing of projects benefits our business over the combined 2-year horizon, as the schedule adjustments will allow us to achieve a lower installed cost per watt on the construction of these plants. Specifically, we now anticipate achieving COD on our Cuyama, Switch Station and the first phase of California Flats projects in 2017. While our guidance anticipates that we will recognize a significant portion of revenue and earnings on the first phase of California Flats in 2016, the other 2 projects will be recognized entirely in 2017.
With this in mind, our net sales range has decreased approximately $100 million to a revised range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion, reflecting the pushout of some projects into 2017. We are raising the low end of our gross margin guidance by 100 basis points to a revised range of 17% to 18%. The gross margin improvement is a result of better than originally anticipated module and balance system cost for the year. As a reminder of what we indicated in our December guidance call, the net sales and gross margin guidance does not include the sale of minority interest in the Stateline project, which is accounted for as an equity method investment. We are selling our minority interest in Stateline, and we expect the profit on the sale to be recognized in equity and earnings, net of tax, not revenue or gross margin. The gross margin guidance range will increase by about 200 basis points if the transaction was treated as a typical sale.
Operating expenses, operating income and our effective tax rate are unchanged. Earnings per share guidance is also unchanged. As a reminder, our EPS guidance include a gain of approximately $200 million, net of tax, from the expected sale of our equity method investment in Stateline and First Solar's share of 8point3's earnings. These 2 items do not flow through operating income, but do impact net income and earnings per share. Similar to our previous guidance, the profile of net sales and earnings per share are expected to be approximately 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half. This profile is subject to timing of project sales, which could alter this expectation. We have lowered the expected ending net cash and operating cash flow ranges by $100 million compared to our prior guidance. This corresponds with the reduction in revenue guidance, as the proceeds from these projects will not be received until 2017. It should be kept in mind that our operating cash flow guidance does not include approximately $450 million from the expected sale of our equity method investment in Stateline, which will be treated as investing cash flows. Our capital expenditures and shipping guidance remain unchanged. Our drop-down plans for 8point3 next year have changed slightly since our December guidance call. We anticipate 3 assets, Kingbird, Stateline and Moapa, which are all part of the ROFO list, to be dropped down in 2016. Kingbird will be in the first half of the year, with the remaining 2 assets in the second half of the year. Cuyama, originally planned to achieve COD in 2016, has been pushed out to leverage the benefits of the ITC extension. Given the broader economic factors impacting the YieldCo sector, the timing and execution of drop-downs to 8point3 is subject to market conditions.
Turning to the next slide. I'll summarize our progress during the past year and most recent quarter. First, we delivered outstanding financial results for 2015 and recorded net sales of $3.6 billion, gross margin of 26% and earnings per share of $5.37. We maintain our 2016 earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.50, even when adjusting some project schedules to capture better value of these projects in 2017. Our technology performance continues its ongoing improvement with the fleet average efficiency now over 16.2% and the best line at 16.4%. Our pipeline continues to grow with record bookings of 3.4 gigawatts in 2015 and a growing number of bookings in international regions. Our potential bookings of 20.3 gigawatts have grown 2.9 gigawatts. Our mid- to late-stage opportunities are also the strongest they have been, with 4.5 gigawatts of projects.
With this, we've concluded our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

We'll ramp that up as we progress through the year towards our lead line of 16.4%. So as we indicated in prior calls, we are intentionally looking to optimize throughput, and as a result of that, we'll see less impact through our efficiency road map this year. So would we expect to see the 16.4% trend higher as we exit the year? Yes. But obviously, clearly not to the order of magnitude that we saw in 2015, which basically represented 160 basis points improvement year-on-year. But as we said before, we have a very competitive module right now. It's mid-16% efficiency. With the energy yield that we capture through temperature coefficient and spectral response, we're very happy with the competitiveness of our module. As it relates to bookings, bookings will continue to reflect ourself [ph]. And relative to our opportunity in our pipeline that we've identified, we're very happy with the growth that we've seen, now with over 20 gigawatts. We're happy with the 400-or-so megawatts that we booked since the last call, and a very good mix not only between systems and modules, but between U.S. and international. So again, as Jim indicated in his comments, the sales team is doing an outstanding job leveraging the core capabilities and the competitiveness of our technology."

The resolution of the ITC, I think, more than anything else, it's not any particular outcome with respect to the ITC, but it's removing the overhang of uncertainty and allows people to run their models and be deterministic about what -- the financial conditions that they're going to be developing projects in. So it's allowed us to advance some of our own projects. It's allowed customers to advance their projects. It's firmed up what the financial environment looks like. The competitive environment has improved a little bit versus, let's say, 18 months ago. So it's a whole variety of factors. It's also a broadening of demand. We are seeing utilities express a desire to begin to participate in solar on a broader basis. We've had some very large customers that we've dealt with for quite a few years now, but we're adding to the customer sets. And we're getting inbound inquiries and seeing RFPs from other utilities. We're also seeing new developers come into the marketplace. They're in new service territories that we've not seen activity before. So it's the cumulative effect of a fairly broad set of circumstances. It's not one single thing that triggered it. It's very broad and across the board."

We've got lots of opportunities and lots of customers, and it's to going be a case of who gets their stuff over -- their opportunities over the finish line first with economics that look interesting. So it's a large opportunity set chasing a finite volume, so that's kind of the circumstance you want to find yourself in. So I don't -- I think there are some very big opportunities, both in the U.S. and internationally, that could dramatically impact what that mix looks like. And I think it's still a little early for us to have a precise visibility into how those big opportunities are going to play out, both in terms of do they get across the finish line, and then, two, some of them have uncertainty as to timing, whether they would be a '17 impact or potentially a later impact than that.

We've built, over the last several years, with the focus on reining in OpEx and being a very lean, low-cost operation. We've also intentionally structured our operations so that we can leverage growth and future opportunities off of a given level of OpEx. We've spent a lot of time, debate, head-knocking internally over how do we build an organization and how do we structure our -- the business we're pursuing from a strategic standpoint so that we can leverage against that OpEx level. And the way the organization has been built, with the shared service centers we've built in some of our international locations, those resources and those centers can cost-effectively support our operations, whether they're in the U.S. or whether they're in almost any jurisdiction around the world. And so that gives us greater flexibility and relieves us of the need to redeploy resources. So we try to centralize certain resources in shared resource centers and centers of excellence that can be deployed anywhere, and then we have local resources that are focused, and we structure both of those activities so that they can be leveraged against greater opportunities without having to add to OpEx. So the proof that our efforts and concepts are working is the fact that we've been able to shift gears through the sort of changing market cycle without having to retool the organization. And it's given us -- it's demonstrated that we've built what we intended to build, which is a highly flexible, highly responsive organization that can adapt to changing market circumstances very quickly."

I think that the final stories are yet to be told in terms of the resolution of some of the assets in the marketplace.

There's no reason to believe that cost road maps are not going to continue to decrease as we move forward in the future. Now I do think you will see some tendency to asymptote a little bit. I'm not sure the rate of change will be what it was several years ago, but there will continue to be a benefit moving forward. What is harder to predict is where are the capital markets going, what is the required rates of return on the part of investors and lenders going to be, and that's a little more of a crystal ball type of exercise.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2015 was another remarkable year for First Solar, and we finished the year with strong operational and financial results. Slide 4 highlights some of the outstanding achievements from this",1183,"Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2015 was another remarkable year for First Solar, and we finished the year with strong operational and financial results. Slide 4 highlights some of the outstanding achievements from this past year. First, on the strength of our research and development efforts, we have continued to be the driving force in the advancement of CdTe solar technology. In the first half of 2015, we set cell efficiency and module efficiency records of 21.5% and 18.6%, respectively. The cell record at that time represented the eighth substantial update to our record cell road map since 2011, and the record module efficiency placed us in a superior position to the best recorded multicrystalline silicon module. Building on this success, today, we have announced that we have achieved yet another new record cell efficiency of 22.1%, as certified by Newport Lab and documented by NREL. At our last analyst day in March 2014, we set a target to reach a 22% research cell efficiency milestone by the end of 2015, and with this announcement, we have delivered on that promise. The accomplishment validates our continued confidence in CdTe as a superior PV material that combines cost effectiveness, reliability and high performance. This achievement is also a testament to our world-class research and development team, which continues to push the boundaries of CdTe technology.
Turning back to our 2015 performance. Our full fleet averaged 15.6% for the year, which is a 160 basis point improvement from our 2014 average. In percentage terms, our full fleet average module cost per watt decreased by over 15% versus the prior year. Our EPC group also had tremendous execution as we installed more than 1.8 gigawatts of modules in 2015. This brings the total cumulative modules installed by our EPC group to over 6 gigawatts and underscores our tremendous capabilities in providing power plant solutions to our customers. The performance of our global sales team was also outstanding last year as we booked a record 3.4 gigawatts DC. Compared to our shipments of 2.9 gigawatts, we once again exceeded our targeted 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. Our financial results for the full year were equally impressive with new record annual revenue of $3.6 billion, which resulted in earnings per fully diluted share of $5.37. We also closed the year with $1.8 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet, even while ending the year with over $1.3 billion in project-related assets, representing projects on our balance sheet under development and in construction. While I am pleased with these exceptional results for 2015, as an organization, we will not grow complacent but are setting our sights on even greater success as we look at our long-term vision for this company.
Next, let me provide a brief update on our technology performance in the fourth quarter. Relative to the prior quarter, our Q4 fleet average efficiency improved to 16.1% or a 30 basis point improvement. This is the first time our full fleet has averaged above 16% for an entire quarter. Also, as expected, our lead line efficiency held steady at 16.4%, as we did not implement any new efficiency process improvements in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 6, I'll review our progress in securing new business since our last earnings call. With our 2015 bookings of 3.4 gigawatts and additional year-to-date 2016 bookings of over 160 megawatts, we have a remaining expected module shipment balance of 4.4 gigawatt as of today's call. Our book-to-bill ratio for 2015 was approximately 1.2, which exceeded our goal of a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. Since our Q3 earnings call, we have booked 420 megawatts DC, with the majority of this volume contracted in international markets, signaling the continued diversification of our business. A prime example of this diversification is in Turkey, where we have recently booked third-party module sales of over 200 megawatts DC. The largest of these deals was a 100-megawatt agreement signed with Zorlu Energy, which adds additional contracted volume to our 2017 shipments. We made further progress in Japan this past quarter with additional contracted bookings, which now brings our total development pipeline in the country to nearly 100 megawatts. We see attractive opportunities in this market and continue to pursue additional project pipeline. The remainder of the international volume booked included an EPC project in Australia and third-party module sales or Module Plus sales in India and Africa. In the U.S., as discussed on our guidance call in December, we signed a 79-megawatt AC 20-year PPA with NV Energy, which was an expansion of a 100-megawatt plant signed earlier in 2015. All power generated by the combined 179-megawatt Switch Station will support Switch's commitment to renewable energy in Nevada.
Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7 billion, as shown on Slide 7. The decrease in revenue from the beginning of the year is due to a combination of our record 2015 revenue recognized, assets dropped to 8point3, and also due to a higher mix of module and Module Plus deals in the bookings for the year.
Turning to Slide 8, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities which have further increased to 20.3 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 2.9 gigawatts from the prior quarter. The sharp increase in potential bookings was primarily driven by a number of new opportunities that we are pursuing in the U.S. With greater certainty now in place related to the ITC, we are seeing an increase in opportunities. Our mid- to late-stage bookings increased another 600 megawatts this past quarter to 4.5 gigawatts DC, which is a new record number of advanced-stage opportunities. International opportunities comprised over 75% of these mid- to late-stage bookings. Looking back 1 year ago, to the time when our potential bookings opportunity stood at 13.5 gigawatts, the growth in our opportunity set to now over 20 gigawatts is remarkable. It is a testament to our global sales effort as well as the increasing realization in the marketplace of the energy density advantage of First Solar technology.
Moving on to Slide 9, our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography shows a significant increase in U.S. opportunities, as previously indicated. The portion of U.S. opportunities is now over 40% versus 25% in the prior quarter. Besides the U.S., we also saw an increase in potential opportunities in India.
Lastly, we will be holding an Analyst Day on Tuesday, April 5, in New York City. At this event, we will provide an update on our strategic priorities. This includes the latest developments in our technology and operations road maps, our plans for growth and capacity, progress we are making in key markets and our latest business outlook. There will be a live webcast of the event available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our executive management team looks forward to the opportunity to provide the latest updates on our business and answer your questions.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our fourth quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

I'll begin by discussing our fourth quarter operational performance on Slide 12. In Q4, we produced 760 megawatts DC, an increase of 16% from the prior quarter, due to higher module efficiencies, increased manufacturing capacity and less downtime for technology upgrades. Production was 50% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the restart of certain manufacturing lines, higher efficiencies, improved throughput and the addition of new capacity. For the full year, we produced over 2.5 gigawatts DC, which is a 36% increase compared to 2014. Our factory capacity utilization reached 100% in Q4, which represents an increase of 6 percentage points compared to the third quarter and a 16 percentage point increase versus the same period in 2014. Capacity utilization increased in the fourth quarter due to fewer upgrade activities across the fleet. For the full year, our capacity utilization was 92%, an increase of 11 percentage points as compared to 2014.
Our fourth quarter best line efficiency averaged 16.4%, which, as planned, was unchanged from the prior quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, our lead line efficiency improved by 160 basis points. Our fourth quarter average module conversion efficiency for the entire fleet was 16.1%, an increase of 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 170 basis points higher year-over-year. Since quarter-end, our full fleet efficiency has continued to improve and has averaged 16.2% quarter-to-date, with an expectation of 16.3% by the end of Q1. For the full year 2015, our fleet average efficiency was 15.6%, which represents 160 basis points improvement from the prior year.
Continuing on to Slide 13, I'll discuss the P&L results for the fourth quarter. Net sales were $942 million in the quarter compared to our record quarterly revenue of $1.3 billion in Q3. The decrease in sales primarily resulted from lower revenue on the Stateline project, which achieved initial revenue recognition in the prior quarter. Net sales also decreased due to lower third-party module and Module Plus sales. As Jim indicated, we set a new record for net sales for the year of $3.6 billion, which was on the high end of our guidance range. As a percentage of total quarterly sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, was unchanged from the prior quarter at 95%. Module Plus sales are included in our solar power systems revenue and totaled approximately $60 million in Q4. Third-party module sales were slightly lower in the fourth quarter, with the majority of shipments to India. Gross margin for the quarter was 24.6% compared to 38.1% in the third quarter. The decrease in gross margin percentage is due to both the lower mix of Stateline revenue and a benefit in the third quarter from a reduction in the cost associated with our module collection and recycling program.
Our gross margin for the full year was 25.7% versus 25%, at the high end of our projections. Our ongoing improvements in module cost per watt and balance of systems savings across our project portfolio were the major drivers of the gross margin guidance beat. The significant reduction in our fleet average module cost per watt in the fourth quarter and robust competitiveness of our technology is also visible in our component segment gross margin, which reached over 26% in the quarter. Operating expenses increased by $13 million from Q3 to $100 million. The prior-quarter operating expenses benefited from a reduction in our EOL obligation. In addition, our R&D expenses increased as we continue to invest in our technology. For the full year, our operating expenses were $403 million or slightly below the high end of our guidance. The fourth quarter operating profit was $132 million compared to an operating profit of $398 million in Q3. For 2015, operating profit was $517 million, significantly above the high end of our guidance range of $490 million. The strong performance relative to guidance was primarily driven by favorable cost performance across our portfolio of system projects. In addition, we were able to successfully avoid potential penalties on a couple of projects that had aggressive year-end completion requirements.
We had a tax benefit of approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter resulting from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income. For the year, the tax rate was a 1% benefit, which included a $28 million net benefit associated with a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority, highlighted in Q3. Our quarterly earnings of $1.60 per fully diluted share of net income -- or excuse me, on net income of $164 million. Full year 2015 earnings per share was $5.37. Our full year results exceeded our guidance midpoint by almost $1 per share. Operational improvements accounted for slightly more than half of the upside to our guidance and were primarily due to cost reductions realized across our project portfolio. Our operational strength and ability to scale our module and BoS cost improvements across our large system portfolio continues to be one of our key value drivers.
The remaining beat of the guidance to the midpoint was from the lower-than-expected tax expense, which resulted from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income.
Moving on to Slide 14, I'll now discuss the selected balance sheet items and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities were essentially flat at $1.8 billion. Our net cash position was unchanged at $1.5 billion. Compared to the end of 2014, our cash balance decreased by approximately $160 million. We ended 2015 with over $1.3 billion in project-related assets, both in development and under construction. When taking into account the size of these assets, which increased by approximately $460 million year-on-year, it demonstrates how we have continued to maintain remarkable financial strength while still funding our project development activities. As a reminder, we expect a significant portion of the projects comprised in this balance to be sold by the end of 2016.
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased by $85 million compared to Q3. The increase was driven by higher project assets associated with our Moapa, CA Flats and various other projects under development. Total debt increased slightly from the prior quarter to $289 million. Cash flow from operations was $53 million compared to $21 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow was $20 million compared to a negative $17 million in Q3. Capital expenditures were $27 million, a sequential decrease of $18 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $60 million or $1 million lower than the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 15, I'll now discuss our updated full year 2016 guidance. As we indicated on our guidance call in December, the outlook we provided at that time did not incorporate an extension of the ITC, and that such a change could lead us to extend some project schedules into 2017. The revised guidance now incorporates these updates after reviewing our development portfolio. The adjustments we are making to the development timing of projects benefits our business over the combined 2-year horizon, as the schedule adjustments will allow us to achieve a lower installed cost per watt on the construction of these plants. Specifically, we now anticipate achieving COD on our Cuyama, Switch Station and the first phase of California Flats projects in 2017. While our guidance anticipates that we will recognize a significant portion of revenue and earnings on the first phase of California Flats in 2016, the other 2 projects will be recognized entirely in 2017.
With this in mind, our net sales range has decreased approximately $100 million to a revised range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion, reflecting the pushout of some projects into 2017. We are raising the low end of our gross margin guidance by 100 basis points to a revised range of 17% to 18%. The gross margin improvement is a result of better than originally anticipated module and balance system cost for the year. As a reminder of what we indicated in our December guidance call, the net sales and gross margin guidance does not include the sale of minority interest in the Stateline project, which is accounted for as an equity method investment. We are selling our minority interest in Stateline, and we expect the profit on the sale to be recognized in equity and earnings, net of tax, not revenue or gross margin. The gross margin guidance range will increase by about 200 basis points if the transaction was treated as a typical sale.
Operating expenses, operating income and our effective tax rate are unchanged. Earnings per share guidance is also unchanged. As a reminder, our EPS guidance include a gain of approximately $200 million, net of tax, from the expected sale of our equity method investment in Stateline and First Solar's share of 8point3's earnings. These 2 items do not flow through operating income, but do impact net income and earnings per share. Similar to our previous guidance, the profile of net sales and earnings per share are expected to be approximately 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half. This profile is subject to timing of project sales, which could alter this expectation. We have lowered the expected ending net cash and operating cash flow ranges by $100 million compared to our prior guidance. This corresponds with the reduction in revenue guidance, as the proceeds from these projects will not be received until 2017. It should be kept in mind that our operating cash flow guidance does not include approximately $450 million from the expected sale of our equity method investment in Stateline, which will be treated as investing cash flows. Our capital expenditures and shipping guidance remain unchanged. Our drop-down plans for 8point3 next year have changed slightly since our December guidance call. We anticipate 3 assets, Kingbird, Stateline and Moapa, which are all part of the ROFO list, to be dropped down in 2016. Kingbird will be in the first half of the year, with the remaining 2 assets in the second half of the year. Cuyama, originally planned to achieve COD in 2016, has been pushed out to leverage the benefits of the ITC extension. Given the broader economic factors impacting the YieldCo sector, the timing and execution of drop-downs to 8point3 is subject to market conditions.
Turning to the next slide. I'll summarize our progress during the past year and most recent quarter. First, we delivered outstanding financial results for 2015 and recorded net sales of $3.6 billion, gross margin of 26% and earnings per share of $5.37. We maintain our 2016 earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.50, even when adjusting some project schedules to capture better value of these projects in 2017. Our technology performance continues its ongoing improvement with the fleet average efficiency now over 16.2% and the best line at 16.4%. Our pipeline continues to grow with record bookings of 3.4 gigawatts in 2015 and a growing number of bookings in international regions. Our potential bookings of 20.3 gigawatts have grown 2.9 gigawatts. Our mid- to late-stage opportunities are also the strongest they have been, with 4.5 gigawatts of projects.
With this, we've concluded our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

So as we indicated in prior calls, we are intentionally looking to optimize throughput, and as a result of that, we'll see less impact through our efficiency road map this year. So would we expect to see the 16.4% trend higher as we exit the year? Yes. But obviously, clearly not to the order of magnitude that we saw in 2015, which basically represented 160 basis points improvement year-on-year. But as we said before, we have a very competitive module right now. It's mid-16% efficiency. With the energy yield that we capture through temperature coefficient and spectral response, we're very happy with the competitiveness of our module. As it relates to bookings, bookings will continue to reflect ourself [ph]. And relative to our opportunity in our pipeline that we've identified, we're very happy with the growth that we've seen, now with over 20 gigawatts. We're happy with the 400-or-so megawatts that we booked since the last call, and a very good mix not only between systems and modules, but between U.S. and international.

The resolution of the ITC, I think, more than anything else, it's not any particular outcome with respect to the ITC, but it's removing the overhang of uncertainty and allows people to run their models and be deterministic about what -- the financial conditions that they're going to be developing projects in. So it's allowed us to advance some of our own projects. It's allowed customers to advance their projects. It's firmed up what the financial environment looks like. The competitive environment has improved a little bit versus, let's say, 18 months ago. So it's a whole variety of factors. It's also a broadening of demand. We are seeing utilities express a desire to begin to participate in solar on a broader basis. We've had some very large customers that we've dealt with for quite a few years now, but we're adding to the customer sets. And we're getting inbound inquiries and seeing RFPs from other utilities. We're also seeing new developers come into the marketplace. They're in new service territories that we've not seen activity before. So it's the cumulative effect of a fairly broad set of circumstances. It's not one single thing that triggered it. It's very broad and across the board."

We've built, over the last several years, with the focus on reining in OpEx and being a very lean, low-cost operation. We've also intentionally structured our operations so that we can leverage growth and future opportunities off of a given level of OpEx. We've spent a lot of time, debate, head-knocking internally over how do we build an organization and how do we structure our -- the business we're pursuing from a strategic standpoint so that we can leverage against that OpEx level. And the way the organization has been built, with the shared service centers we've built in some of our international locations, those resources and those centers can cost-effectively support our operations, whether they're in the U.S. or whether they're in almost any jurisdiction around the world. And so that gives us greater flexibility and relieves us of the need to redeploy resources. So we try to centralize certain resources in shared resource centers and centers of excellence that can be deployed anywhere, and then we have local resources that are focused, and we structure both of those activities so that they can be leveraged against greater opportunities without having to add to OpEx. So the proof that our efforts and concepts are working is the fact that we've been able to shift gears through the sort of changing market cycle without having to retool the organization. And it's given us -- it's demonstrated that we've built what we intended to build, which is a highly flexible, highly responsive organization that can adapt to changing market circumstances very quickly."

The other is the cost of capital. That's the return demanded by both debt and equity investors in the project. There's no reason to believe that cost road maps are not going to continue to decrease as we move forward in the future. Now I do think you will see some tendency to asymptote a little bit. I'm not sure the rate of change will be what it was several years ago, but there will continue to be a benefit moving forward. What is harder to predict is where are the capital markets going, what is the required rates of return on the part of investors and lenders going to be, and that's a little more of a crystal ball type of exercise.

Before we discuss our first quarter operational and financial results, I want to take a few minutes talk about the leadership transition we announced earlier today. 
As you may have seen in our press release, after 4 years with First Solar as CEO, I have decided that I will step down on June 30 and hand the reigns over to our current Chief Financial Officer, Mark Widmar, who will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer at that time. As part of the transition, I will continue to support the company in an advisory role and as a member of the Board of Directors. 
The Board and I worked jointly on the company's leadership succession plan and Mark was our first and best choice as CEO as First Solar enters its next phase of growth. Mark is a strong, capable leader with an extensive knowledge of our business, having served as First Solar's Chief Financial Officer since 2011 and as First Solar's Chief Accounting Officer from February 2012 through June 2015. Mark and I have worked closely together over the past 4 years, and I expect a seamless transition. I have deep confidence that the company will be in good hands. 
It has been a privilege to lead First Solar, and I am proud of the significant milestones we accomplished as a team. When I joined First Solar in early 2012, the company faced significant challenges from both industry specific and macroeconomic factors. My intent from the start and my commitment to the Board of Directors was to work with First Solar leadership to establish a strategic plan that place the company on a trajectory of sustainable success. 
As our most recent Analyst Day demonstrated, we have accomplished what we set out to do 4 years ago. We not only achieved our goal, but we exceeded expectations. I remain excited about the opportunities ahead for First Solar. 
With that, let's turn to our results. I'll begin by briefly reviewing our first quarter operational and financial performance. First, our 30 manufacturing lines ran at 100% capacity utilization and produced over 770 megawatts of modules in the first quarter. Our Q1 fleet average efficiency continued to improve, climbing to 16.2%. Our lead line efficiency continues to hold steady at 16.4%, as new efficiency process improvements are not slated until later in the year. 
Coming off our recent Analyst Day, where we laid out a highly compelling technology roadmap and potential capacity expansions, this represents an impressive start to 2016 and to achieving the objectives outlined at that meeting. Turning to Slide 4, I'll review our latest comparison of bookings versus year-to-date shipments. 
We ended 2015 with 4.2 gigawatt DC of expected future module shipments. In the first quarter, we shipped over 800 megawatts of modules against this total and have booked approximately 600 megawatts of new volume. Of the 600 megawatts of new bookings, around 400 megawatts were booked since our last earnings call in late February. The largest single booking was the previously announced module supply agreement of over 200 megawatts DC with Silicon Ranch for deliveries to their projects scheduled for construction in 2017 and 2018. 
This agreement is another positive indication of the strength of solar demand in the Southeastern United States beyond 2016. International volume was an important component of our bookings since last earnings call with volume contracted in several different countries. 
In India, we signed module agreements for almost 100 megawatts DC of additional volume. As announced recently, we achieved a major milestone in this market with now over 1 gigawatt of volume sold into India. These new bookings at our strengthen in this lower growing solar market. 
In Honduras, we sent agreement with the Grupo Terra to provide modules and EPC services for a 25-megawatt AC solar projects. This is the second project in Honduras we would have constructed for Grupo Terra and further expands our presence in this region. 
For the balance of the year, we continue to see a number of domestic and international opportunity that would move us closer to a one-to-one book-to-bill ratio. In the U.S, the IPC extension has led to an increase in overall opportunities, but customers continue to work through revisions to project timing, which has led to some temporary delays in new contracted bookings. Potential international opportunities continue to be strong as well, with the decision timing on a number of projects occurring in the second half of the year. 
In addition, while the majority of bookings thus far in 2016 have been primarily module sales, this is timing related, as we are pursuing a number of systems booking opportunities during the balance of the year. 
For example, in our mid- to late-stage potential bookings, we have over 450 megawatts of opportunities with operating ranging from AC Power Block to a full powerplant. In our early stage opportunities, of we focus on the projects with the highest booking probability, there are over 500 megawatts of additional potential systems bookings. In each case, these are projects with 2017 COD and the majority of shipments occurring in that year. 
Note that in addition to the more than 950 megawatts of opportunities discussed, there are a large number of other early stage systems projects with lower probabilities that may materialize as well. 
Our bookings in terms of expected revenue announced at $6.4 billion, as shown on Slide 5. The decrease in expected revenue as a result of the timing of mid bookings thus far in 2016 and the higher mix of module only businesses compared to the revenue recognized in Q4. Now this includes revenue on any module sale or systems project that we have contracted. However, it does not include our contracted O&M revenue. 
Slide 6 provides the updated potential bookings opportunities, which is now over 23 gigawatts, an increase of approximately 3 gigawatts from the prior quarter. Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities are 3.1 gigawatt DC with international opportunities across 20 different countries comprising almost 90% of this number. Moving on to Slide 7. 
Our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography reflect the net increase in opportunities across all regions. The largest increase was in the United States, where new opportunities were identified across multiple regions. But especially in the South and Southeastern part of the country. 
We also had a significant increase in opportunities in the Middle East, India and Asia Pacific region. The growth and opportunities in these regions was the large number of mid-to late-stage international opportunities demonstrates the results of our multiyear effort we have made to diversify into new markets. 
I'll now turn it over to Mark, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

In Q1, we produced 774-megawatt DC, an increase of 2% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and increased throughput. Production was 43% higher compared to the first quarter of 2015, due to higher efficiencies, hip of throughput and the addition of new capacity. Our capacity utilization remained at 100% in Q1 and is 13 percentage points higher versus the same period in 2015. 
The higher year-over-year capacity utilization is due to fewer upgrade activities across the fleet. Our best line conversion efficiency remains unchanged at 16.4% as planned in our technology roadmap. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, our lead line efficiency improved by 80 basis points. 
Average module compares and efficiency in Q1 for our entire fleet was 16.2%, an increase of 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year, our fleet average conversion efficiency increased by 150 basis points. As indicated at the recent Analyst Day, efficiency improvements are expected to pick up later in the year as we are targeting a full year average and lead line efficiency exit of 16.7% and 17%, respectively.
I'll next discuss the P&L results for the quarter on Slide 10. For Q1, net sales were $848 million in the quarter compared to $942 million in Q4. The decrease in the sale resulting primarily from the timing of revenue recognition across multiple projects and the completion during the quarter of our Penasco West and Seville projects. Module plus revenue declined from the prior quarter while third-party module sales increase slightly. Partially offsetting these decreases was the high revenue on our Stateline project with resulted from an amendment to the regional sales agreement with Southern to include an additional 15% interest in the project. This leaves First Solar with the remaining 34% interest, which is expected to be dropped down to 8.3% in the second half of the year. 
As highlighted at the Analyst Day, the sale of the mental interest in Stateline does not impact our full year guidance, but does have the effect of shifting earns out from the second half of the year into the first half. As a percent of total quarterly net sales, or solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, decreased to 93% from 95% in the prior quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 31% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter. The improved margin percentage resulting from the higher mix of Stateline revenue and significant system cost improvements. Our component segment gross margin improved to over 28% in the quarter and benefited from a lower module cost per watt. 
Operating expenses decreased by almost $2 million from Q4 to $98 million. R&D expenses were lower versus the prior quarter, partially offset by higher development staff. First quarter operating profit was $165 million compared to an operating profit of $130 million in the prior quarter. 
Other income and expense was $36 million for the quarter, primarily due to a $38 million gain from the sale and rebalancing of certain restricted investments associated with our module end-of-life program. The transaction was completed in order to better align the currencies of the investments with those of the corresponding collection and recycling obligations. The gain was approximately $20 million net of tax. 
Tax expense for Q1 was $34 million, including the tax on the gains from the sale of our restricted investments. Q1 earnings were $1.66 per fully diluted share on net income of $171 million. This compares to earnings of $1.60 in the prior quarter. 
Overall, it was a strong quarter for earnings in a positive start for 2016. We were able to settle incremental Stateline, which not only strengthens our ongoing relationship with Southern, but also provides greater flexibility for 8.3. Our manufacturing systems operations performing well in the quarter and contributed significantly into Q1 results. 
Turning to Slide 11. I'll now discuss the selected budget items to cash flow summary. Cash and remarkable securities increased by approximately $50 million to $1.9 billion. Our net cash position also increased to $1.6 billion. The improvement was achieved while our project related our asset balance grew to $1.5 billion from $1.3 billion in the prior quarter. 
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased slightly as compared to Q4. The increase in project-related assets was partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable. 
Total debt increased by $10 million from the prior quarter to $299 million, as payments on our tail and debt facility were more than offset by additional financings for international projects. Cash flow from operation was $50 million, slightly lower as compared to Q4. Free cash flow was $30 million compared to $20 million in Q4. 
Capital expenditures were $52 million as compared to $27 million in the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $55 million or approximately $5 million lower than the prior quarter. Continuing to Slide 12, I will now discuss our updated full year 2016 guidance. 
First, note that while the strong Q1 results could be perceived as the catalyst for a more substantial increase in our earnings guidance, it is important to keep in mind the factors that contribute to the revised guidance. 
First, the amendment to the original Stateline sales agreement did not impact full year earnings, rather it affected the timing of the earnings and the income statement presentation. In addition, we feel it's too early in the year to make more substantial updates to the guidance. While we have visibility opportunities during the balance of the year that could result in making an upward provision, we believe a more measured approach at this time is prudent. 
Turning to our guidance on net sales. We're keeping the range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. We are making -- maintaining the range primarily based on expected accounting for the sale of timber project, which we will reflect in our Q2 results. The tax equity structuring for this project sale will result in a partial deferral of revenue. We will provide more information related to this transaction on the Q2 call. But for now, we are highlighting that it's a factor in holding the net sales guidance and change. 
Next, we're increasing our gross margin guidance range by 100 basis points to a revised range of 18% to 19%. The gross margin improvement is a result of the amendment to the regional Stateline project sale was result in movement of profit from equity earnings to gross margin. In addition, the cost improvements in the first quarter have benefited gross margin and are reflected in the updated range. 
It's important to keep in mind that the expected profit on the sale of our remaining 34% interest in Stateline is still reflected in equity and earnings in our guidance. Operating expenses is unchanged and operating income guidance has increased by $40 million, reflecting the improved gross margin. 
The effective tax rate is unchanged at 16% to 18%. We have increased the low end of our guidance per share -- earnings per share guidance to $4.10 and left the high end unchanged at $4.50. As noted on Slide 12, our EPS guidance includes approximately $145 million net of tax from the exec of sale of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar share of 8.3's earnings. 
In addition, approximately $0.20 of other income net of tax is included in the earnings guidance range from the Q1 sale of the restricted investments, \ mentioned. Distribution of earnings for the year is expected to be slightly less than 50% in the first half of there, although it is a subject that's timing certain project sales close. 
Our expected ending net cash balance is unchanged and operating cash flow range have increased by $100 million compared to our prior guidance. The increase in operating cash flow had the net 0 impact to the overall cash balance as it is a movement from investing to operating cash flow. 
With the sale of an incremental 15% interest in Stateline to Southern, the cash associated with this transaction will be treated as operating cash flow rather than the prior expectations of an investing cash flow from the sale of the residual interest in the project to 8.3. Keep in mind that our operating cash flow guidance does not include approximately $320 million from the expected sale of the remaining interest in Stateline to 8.3, which we expect to be treated as investing cash flows. 
Our capital expenditure to shipment guidance remains unchanged. CapEx guidance in the year, it should be noted that included in this number is approximately $130 million related to the launch of our series 5 project, which we introduced recently at our Analyst Day. Our drop-down plans for Kimber, Stateline and more to 8.3 are unchanged however, the actual execution are subject to market conditions. 
Finally, in our recent Analyst Day, some has expressed concerns that we did not provide more specifics around 2017. I wish to reiterate that there are still a number of moving pieces and uncertainties related to 2017, which do not make it meaningful to provide an outlook at this time. They'll reality should not overshadow the significant opportunities and technology advances we have laid out in detail at the event. We feel the company is better position than in any time during the past 5 years from a technology, operational and balance sheet strength standpoint, and we look forward to the many opportunities to come. 
Turning to the next like, I'll summarize our progress during the past quarter. First, we delivered solid financial results for the first quarter with gross margins of 31% and earnings per share of $1.66. We updated our 2016 earnings guidance range from $4.10 to $4.50, which represents a $0.05 increase of our guidance mid-point. 
Our technology performance continues at a strong place with a fleet average efficiency of 16.2% and a best line of 16.4%. We have booked 600-megawatt so far this year, and we continue to see the number of opportunities increase and our potential bookings now stand at over 23 gigawatts. 
With a number of opportunities in the second half of the year, we see anticipated the booking momentum to continue. With this, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

I think you guys mentioned in the prepared remarks that there was 450-megawatt of systems bookings opportunities that you expect to be included in the second half. So based on some of the backlog that you announced, should we think about systems business in the 800 to 900-megawatt range for next year? Is that the starting point? And then, as you think about CapEx for next year, can you just maybe provide what how should we think about either CapEx and capacity then for the remainder of this year and next year?"

So I think what we said is just comments in our late stages, I think it was maybe about 450. But we also indicated that if you look at the earlier stage products , these are the ones that with return higher level probability this another 500 megawatts or so in there. 
So there's a potential about a gigawatt of bookings of that can happen between now and the end of the year that will be systems related. That's also one reason why, as we think about providing guidance for 2017, until we crystallize of those opportunities, it is not meaningful at this point in time to provide guidance for '17. Just want to make sure you kind of [indiscernible]. 
But as it relates to next year's summer in that gigawatt range, the systems level, that's probably about right. We've kind of indicated that we would expect it to be maintained at around that range, at least in the foreseeable future, trending upwards obviously as we start to ramp capacity. So I think that's the right way to look at it. 
CapEx, just really point you back to what we said in the Analyst Day at this point in time. We gave the view of what we see capacity expansion. We gave the view of what the associated CapEx would be for that capacity expansion. We haven't given the street impact to '17, '18 versus '19. But I think the best thing to do is just go back and review the slide that we presented at the Analyst Day. I think that will give you the color that we're looking for."

So I don't expect any sudden change as a result of the final, at least on the North American front had been far less active over probably last 6 to 9 months. Generally, what we're seeing in the North American market is very robust demand. I think we have a lot of customers and a lot of opportunities where customers are having to resort the timing given in the ITC change and try to figure out what they're going to do when and how they are becoming programs are going to be built up such in that conversations are robust and the demand is in there.

So it's really -- it's a rum down of some of our systems Project of been in construction over the last year, and then we don't start to see a ramp-up with the new assets until we start to enter into the July timeframe. So it's just a transitionary period. So we'll see more module only type of and Module Plus type revenue in the second quarter. So you see us like properties associated with that. In terms of capacity, visibility. It's -- as we always said, it's going to be driven by highly reliable predictable demand. And so it's a demand driven poll versus a capacity push. And we're starting to see, obviously, not only here in the U.S. but internationally, a significant increase in demand in our pipe and what's reflected in our pipeline. When you can see there's a lot more international. So it's not necessarily discrete to one, but you do region it's not discrete to module versus systems.

One thing to understand about the systems business is even though the ITC got extended, we had a large number of system projects that were slated for delivery in 2016. And some of those had PPA requirements such that even though the ITC was extended, they still have to the delivered. So we had a, what I call, an unusual alignment of deliveries at the end of 2016. And that leaves a bit of a gap until you can redeploy the workforce, start new projects and get those projects to the finish line. And that's a little bit of what we're seeing.  We're seeing plenty of demand. But normally, our systems business, the project sort of roll off at a steady rate as opposed to all being aligned to a single point in time. So it's a little bit of a historical function of the ITC -- of the ITC follow that never happened because it got extended. So I think that's just an important thing to keep in mind. The other is, one of the things we tried to highlight at the Analyst Day, and I think people need to try to get a greater understanding of this. We've got a number of factors coming together in terms of our production platform. We've got a new product we're rolling out in the form of the series 5. We have a new product under development in the form of the series 6. There's a lot of complicated decisions that we need to make about the production platform related to those. And we are trying to make sure that is we're thoughtful, careful and detailed in our analysis. So it's not as simple as, what's the demand and when do we build the plant to supply it? It's a more complicated equation because we've got new products in the equation. So it's -- we will respond to demand when and where we see it, and we will also communicate to investors when we have a clear view of what our plans going to be. But as we always have been, you're always going to be a little bit conservative and a lipid thoughtful about putting those plans together."

There's generally been an enthusiastic response from customers, especially in the North American circumstance, which is where the economics work the best. There are projects or bidding opportunities out there where we have qualification issues for Series 5. It's not been in existence long enough to qualify. That's not really a challenge for us because we're going to continue to manufacture Series 4 as far as into the future vacancy. And we can also adjust the ratio of Series 4 to series 5 production relatively easily. It's the same basic pressure platform with a different back and added. So there's a great deal with flexibility and shifting production between the Series 4 and series 5. And as we begin to see where the demand is going to be over '17, '18 and '19 and begin to see where the adoption of Series 5 is going to be, we'll be able to tailor sort of the rollout of that and adjust the production of 4 versus 5 fairly easily.

As it relates to other asset sales, there are not any other items in our guidance at this point in time. Are there any other potential asset sales that could happen during the balance of the year? There's a couple -- we still have facilities in Europe and Asia Pacific that we are marketing. There's always potential opportunity. That something like that could happen but is now assume benefit of that included our guidance at this point in time. Look, we're very confident in our ability to extract value from the module and the energy density advantages that we have. And we showed that in the Analyst Day there that advantage will improve over time. And then, with series 5 in particular, when you normalize for subsequently the same form factor as Crystalline silicon. There's advantages, we talked about that in terms of labor costs, the fewer connectors and those types of things that will help drive down the cost of that product as it relates to the overall cost to install. So we're very comfortable in terms of translating our Technology Advantage and ultimately normalizing the 4 factor that, that will translate into Valley. The bookings, yes. The bookings that were reflected in the quarter were primarily modules. And there was -- I'll refer to it as low bin inventory that we sold during the quarter that would be below market expectations around value for the module. So there were some of that. We ended up some. It was around 40 megawatts or so. So that did bring down the average ASP that supplied by the booking. I also will tell you is that there is running at those numbers. So I understand the simple [indiscernible] math is going to tell you that there is around it both ways that will get you to that exact same answer."

So that optionality will play itself out subject to many different variables as we progress through the second half of the year. As it relates to oversupply concerns, we always have kind of a healthy dense and concern of what's going on in the market. And we said before the ITC extension that there was a concern around oversupply as we went into '17. Clearly, I think the ITC extension provides a different view of the horizon beyond '16. We may not have as much resiliency or robustness of the men in '17, but clearly drives more demand into '18, '19 and '20. In particular, we are very -- a very encouraged by where the international markets are trending. A lot of new opportunities happening internationally. But we are obviously, aware of what's going on. In terms of what the additional plans are and the education is relative to demand.

I'd say, at this stage, with respect to the back half of the year and certainly, for next year, we're still in a mode where we are optimizing sales against margin. In other words, we're not chasing every opportunity that presents itself. We have the ability to pick and choose the opportunities that we're chasing in order to maximize the margin on every incremental sales that we achieved. So that is generally indicative of an environmental where I wouldn't say we have pricing power, but we have that ability to optimize.

The equity will perform over time. Now whether that completely happens in time for us to drop-down walk and Stateline, yet to be sure. We'll evaluate that and we have other options if we choose to pursue them. Similar to what we did with the Stateline when we sold a portion of Stateline to Southern we -- and then, inclusive the ROFO by identifying switch, which is a large project that will take the COD at 2017 as a potential drop down to 8point3. So if you make a decision around one of the other assets, it was Stateline, we have more than enough contracted assets that if we chose to, we could replace them in ROFO and put them into the cadence with some more natural drop down to 8point3. As we said in the 8point3 earnings call, we already have with the current assets that have been drop-down with Oprah Henrietta be completed here recently, Hooper and work being completed here recently, we have the ability to grow our dividend through the end of '17.

Before we discuss our first quarter operational and financial results, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the leadership transition we announced earlier today. 
As you may have seen in our press release, after 4 years with First Solar as CEO, I have decided that I will step down on June 30 and hand the reigns over to our current Chief Financial Officer, Mark Widmar, who will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer at that time. As part of the transition, I will continue to support the company in an advisory role and as a member of the Board of Directors. 
The board and I worked jointly on the company's leadership succession plan, and Mark was our first and best choice as CEO as First Solar enters its next phase of growth. Mark is a strong, capable leader with an extensive knowledge of our business, having served as First Solar's Chief Financial Officer since 2011 and as First Solar's Chief Accounting Officer from February 2012 through June 2015. Mark and I have worked closely together over the past 4 years, and I expect a seamless transition. I have deep confidence that the company will be in good hands. 
It has been a privilege to lead First Solar, and I am proud of the significant milestones we accomplished as a team. When I joined First Solar in early 2012, the company faced significant challenges from both industry-specific and macroeconomic factors. My intent from the start and my commitment to the Board of Directors was to work with First Solar leadership to establish a strategic plan that place the company on a trajectory of sustainable success. 
As our most recent Analyst Day demonstrated, we have accomplished what we set out to do 4 years ago. We not only achieved our goals, but we exceeded expectations. I remain excited about the opportunities ahead for First Solar. 
With that, let's turn to our results. I'll begin by briefly reviewing our first quarter operational and financial performance. First, our 30 manufacturing lines ran at 100% capacity utilization and produced over 770 megawatts of modules in the first quarter. Our Q1 fleet average efficiency continued to improve, climbing to 16.2%. Our lead line efficiency continues to hold steady at 16.4% as new efficiency process improvements are not slated until later in the year. Coming off our recent Analyst Day, where we laid out a highly compelling technology roadmap and potential capacity expansions, this represents an impressive start to 2016 and to achieving the objectives outlined at that meeting. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'll review our latest comparison of bookings versus year-to-date shipments. We ended 2015 with 4.2 gigawatt DC of expected future module shipments. In the first quarter, we shipped over 800 megawatts of modules against this total and have booked approximately 600 megawatts of new volume. Of the 600 megawatts of new bookings, around 400 megawatts were booked since our last earnings call in late February. The largest single booking was the previously announced module supply agreement of over 200 megawatts DC with Silicon Ranch for deliveries to their projects scheduled for construction in 2017 and 2018. This agreement is another positive indication of the strength of solar demand in the Southeastern United States beyond 2016. 
International volume was an important component of our bookings since last earnings call, with volume contracted in several different countries. In India, we signed module agreements for almost 100 megawatts DC of additional volume. As announced recently, we achieved a major milestone in this market with now over 1 gigawatt of volume sold into India. These new bookings add to our strength in this growing solar market. 
In Honduras, we signed an agreement with Grupo Terra to provide modules and EPC services for a 25 megawatt AC solar project. This is the second project in Honduras we will have constructed for Grupo Terra and further expands our presence in this region. 
For the balance of the year, we continue to see a number of domestic and international opportunities that would move us closer to a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. In the U.S, the ITC extension has led to an increase in overall opportunities, but customers continue to work through revisions to project timing, which has led to some temporary delays in new contracted bookings. Potential international opportunities continue to be strong as well, with the decision timing on a number of projects occurring in the second half of the year. 
In addition, while the majority of bookings thus far in 2016 have been primarily module sales, this is timing-related as we are pursuing a number of systems booking opportunities during the balance of the year. 
For example, in our mid- to late-stage potential bookings, we have over 450 megawatts of opportunities, with offerings ranging from AC Power Block to a full power plant. In our early-stage opportunities, if we focus on the projects with the highest booking probability, there are over 500 megawatts of additional potential systems bookings. In each case, these are projects with 2017 COD and the majority of shipments occurring in that year. Note that in addition to the more than 950 megawatts of opportunities discussed, there are a large number of other early-stage systems projects with lower probabilities that may materialize as well. 
Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $6.4 billion, as shown on Slide 5. The decrease in expected revenue as a result of the timing of new bookings thus far in 2016 and the higher mix of module-only businesses compared to the revenue recognized in Q1. Now this includes revenue on any module sale or systems project that we have contracted. However, it does not include our contracted O&M revenue. 
Slide 6 provides the updated potential bookings opportunities, which is now over 23 gigawatts, an increase of approximately 3 gigawatts from the prior quarter. Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities are 3.1 gigawatts DC, with new international opportunities across 20 different countries comprising almost 90% of this number. 
Moving on to Slide 7. Our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography reflect the net increase in opportunities across all regions. The largest increase was in the United States, where new opportunities were identified across multiple regions, but especially in the South and Southeastern part of the country. 
We also had a significant increase in opportunities in the Middle East, India and Asia-Pacific regions. The growth in opportunities in these regions plus the large number of mid- to late-stage international opportunities demonstrates the results of our multiyear effort we have made to diversify into new markets. 
I'll now turn it over to Mark, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

Before I delve into the numbers, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to Jim for his leadership and friendship over the past 4 years. First Solar is a strong company it is today, thanks to his guidance and dedication. I look forward to building upon the success in the future. Come July, I will hit the ground running and work with our board, management team and associates to drive First Solar's next phase of growth while continuing to deliver strong results to our shareholders. 
In addition, we announced today that Alex Bradley has been appointed Interim Chief Financial Officer. Alex has served as Vice President of Project Finance since 2012, with responsibilities to the Treasury group added last year. Alex has been with First Solar for 8 years and was instrumental in launching 8point3 Energy Partners last year. I have tremendous confidence in Alex's ability to step into the CFO role until a permanent successor is made. 
Now I'll begin by discussing our first quarter operational performance on Slide 9. In Q1, we produced 774 megawatts DC, an increase of 2% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and increased throughput. Production was 43% higher compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to higher efficiencies, improved throughput and the addition of new capacity. Our capacity utilization remained at 100% in Q1 and is 13 percentage points higher versus the same period in 2015. The higher year-over-year capacity utilization is due to fewer upgrade activities across the fleet. Our best line conversion efficiency remains unchanged at 16.4%, as planned in our technology roadmap. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, our lead line efficiency improved by 80 basis points. 
Average module conversion efficiency in Q1 for our entire fleet was 16.2%, an increase of 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year, our fleet average conversion efficiency increased by 150 basis points. As indicated at the recent Analyst Day, efficiency improvements are expected to pick up later in the year as we are targeting a full year average and lead line efficiency exit of 16.7% and 17%, respectively.
I'll next discuss the P&L results for the quarter on Slide 10. For Q1, net sales were $848 million in the quarter compared to $942 million in Q4. The decrease in sales resulted primarily from the timing of revenue recognition across multiple systems projects and the completion during the quarter of our Tenaska West and Seville projects. Module Plus revenue declined from the prior quarter, while third-party module sales increased slightly. Partially offsetting these decreases was the higher revenue on our Stateline project, which resulted from an amendment to the original sales agreement with Southern to include an additional 15% interest in the project. This leaves First Solar with the remaining 34% interest, which is expected to be dropped down to 8.3% in the second half of the year.  As highlighted at the Analyst Day, the sale of the incremental interest in Stateline does not impact our full year guidance but does have the effect of shifting earnings from the second half of the year into the first half. As a percent of total quarterly net sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, decreased to 93% from 95% in the prior quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 31% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter. The improved margin percentage resulted from the higher mix of Stateline revenue and significant system cost improvements. Our component segment gross margin improved to over 28% in the quarter and benefited from a lower module cost per watt. 
Operating expenses decreased by almost $2 million from Q4 to $98 million. R&D expenses were lower versus the prior quarter, partially offset by higher development spend. First quarter operating profit was $165 million compared to an operating profit of $130 million in the prior quarter. 
Other income and expense was $36 million for the quarter primarily due to a $38 million gain from the sale and rebalancing of certain restricted investments associated with our module end-of-life program. The transaction was completed in order to better align the currencies of the investments with those of the corresponding collection and recycling obligations. The gain was approximately $20 million, net of tax. 
Tax expense for Q1 was $34 million, including the tax on the gains from the sale of our restricted investments. 
Q1 earnings were $1.66 per fully diluted share on net income of $171 million. This compares to earnings of $1.60 in the prior quarter. 
Overall, it was a strong quarter for earnings and a positive start for 2016. We were able to sell an incremental interest in Stateline, which not only strengthens our ongoing relationship with Southern but also provides greater flexibility for 8point3. Our manufacturing systems operations performed extremely well in the quarter and contributed significantly to the Q1 results. 
Turning to Slide 11. I'll now discuss the selected balance sheet items and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased by approximately $50 million to $1.9 billion. Our net cash position also increased to $1.6 billion. The improvement was achieved while our project-related asset balance grew to $1.5 billion from $1.3 billion in the prior quarter. 
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased slightly as compared to Q4. The increase in project-related assets was partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable. 
Total debt increased by $10 million from the prior quarter to $299 million as payments on our KLM debt facility were more than offset by additional financings for international projects. 
Cash flow from operation was $50 million, slightly lower as compared to Q4. Free cash flow was $30 million compared to $20 million in Q4. 
Capital expenditures were $52 million as compared to $27 million in the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $55 million or approximately $5 million lower than the prior quarter.  
Continuing to Slide 12. I will now discuss our updated full year 2016 guidance. First, note that while the strong Q1 results could be perceived as the catalyst for a more substantial increase in our earnings guidance, it is important to keep in mind the factors that contributed to the revised guidance. 
First, the amendment to the original Stateline sales agreement did not impact full year earnings. Rather, it affected the timing of the earnings and the income statement presentation. In addition, we feel it's too early in the year to make more substantial updates to the guidance. While we have visibility to opportunities during the balance of the year that could result in making an upward provision, we believe a more measured approach at this time is prudent. 
Turning to our guidance on net sales. We are keeping the range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. We are making -- maintaining the range primarily based on expected accounting for the sale of Kingbird project, which we will reflect in our Q2 results. The tax equity structuring for this project sale will result in a partial deferral of revenue. We will provide more information related to this transaction on the Q2 call. But for now, we are highlighting that it's a factor in holding the net sales guidance unchanged. 
Next, we are increasing our gross margin guidance range by 100 basis points to a revised range of 18% to 19%. The gross margin improvement is a result of the amendment to the original Stateline project sale, which results in movement of profit from equity and earnings to gross margin. In addition, the cost improvements in the first quarter have benefited gross margin and are reflected in the updated range. It's important to keep in mind that the expected profit on the sale of our remaining 34% interest in Stateline is still reflected in equity and earnings in our guidance. 
Operating expenses is unchanged, and operating income guidance has increased by $40 million, reflecting the improved gross margin. 
The effective tax rate is unchanged at 16% to 18%. We have increased the low end of our guidance per share -- earnings per share guidance to $4.10 and left the high end unchanged at $4.50. As noted on Slide 12, our EPS guidance includes approximately $145 million, net of tax, from the expected sale of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar's share of 8point3's earnings. In addition, approximately $0.20 of other income, net of tax, is included in the earnings guidance range from the Q1 sale of the restricted investments mentioned. 
The distribution of earnings for the year is expected to be slightly less than 50% in the first half of the year, although this is subject to the timing of when certain project sales close. 
Our expected ending net cash balance is unchanged, and operating cash flow range have increased by $100 million compared to our prior guidance. The increase in operating cash flow has a net 0 impact to the overall cash balance as it is a movement from investing to operating cash flow. 
With the sale of an incremental 15% interest in Stateline to Southern, the cash associated with this transaction will be treated as operating cash flow rather than the prior expectations of an investing cash flow from the sale of the residual interest in the project to 8point3. Keep in mind that our operating cash flow guidance does not include approximately $320 million from the expected sale of the remaining interest in Stateline to 8point3, which is expected to be treated as investing cash flows. 
Our capital expenditures and shipment guidance remains unchanged. Related to our CapEx guidance in the year, it should be noted that included in this number is approximately $130 million related to the launch of our series 5 product, which we introduced recently at our Analyst Day. Our drop-down plans for Kingbird, Stateline and Moapa to 8point3 are unchanged. However, the actual execution is subject to market conditions. 
Finally, in our recent Analyst Day, some has expressed concerns that we did not provide more specifics around 2017. I wish to reiterate that there are still a number of moving pieces and uncertainties related to 2017, which do not make it meaningful to provide an outlook at this time. The reality should not overshadow the significant opportunities and technology advances we have laid out in detail at the event. We feel the company is better positioned than at any time during the past 5 years from a technology, operations and balance sheet strength standpoint, and we look forward to the many opportunities to come. 
Turning to the next slide. I'll summarize our progress during the past quarter. First, we delivered solid financial results for the first quarter, with gross margins of 31% and earnings per share of $1.66. We updated our 2016 earnings guidance range from $4.10 to $4.50, which represents a $0.05 increase of our guidance midpoint. Our technology performance continues at a strong pace, with a fleet average efficiency of 16.2% and a best line of 16.4%. We have booked 600 megawatts so far this year, and we continue to see the number of opportunities increase, and our potential bookings now stand at over 23 gigawatts. With the number of opportunities in the second half of the year, we see -- anticipate the bookings momentum to continue. 
With this, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

And Mark, I wanted to just follow up on your comments about 2017. I think you guys mentioned in the prepared remarks that there was 450 megawatts of systems bookings opportunities that you expect to execute in the second half. So based on some of the backlog that you've announced, should we sort of think about systems business in the 800 to 900 megawatt range for next year? Is that a good starting point? And then as you think about CapEx for next year, can you just maybe provide us some updated thoughts on how you think about -- how we should think about CapEx and capacity ramp in the -- for the remainder of this year and next year?"

So I think what we said is just comments that was in our late stage, and I think it was maybe about 450. But we also indicated that if you look at the earlier-stage projects, at least the ones that we've determined with higher level of probability, there's another 500 megawatts or so in there. So there's a potential of about 1 gigawatt of bookings that can happen between now and the end of the year that will be systems-related. That's also one reason why -- as we think about providing guidance for 2017, until we can crystallize those opportunities, it's not meaningful at this point in time to provide guidance for '17. I just want to make sure you kind of connected those dots. But as it relates to next year, somewhere in that 1 gigawatt range at systems level, that's probably about right. We've kind of indicated that we would expect it to be maintained around that range, at least in the foreseeable future, trending upwards, obviously, as we start to ramp capacity. So I think that's the right way to look at it. CapEx, I can just really point you back to what we said in the -- at the Analyst Day at this point in time. And we gave the view of what we see in capacity expansion. We gave the view of what the associated CapEx would be for that capacity expansion. We haven't given The Street impact to '17, '18 versus '19. But I think the best thing to do is just go back and review the slides that we presented at the Analyst Day. I think that will give you the color that you're looking for."

So I don't expect any sudden change as a result of the filing. They, at least on the North American front, had been far less active over probably the last 6 to 9 months. Generally, what we're seeing in the North American market is very robust demand. I think we have a lot of customers and a lot of opportunities where customers are having to resort the timing given the ITC change and try to figure out what they're going to do when and how their procurement programs are going to be built up. But the conversations are robust, and the demand is there. So I think we all feel remarkably positive about the North American market."

Because even when you ex out the Stateline sale and equity gain in Q1, you earned a good dollar of EPS. I was just trying to reconcile there. And then the second question, as you think about potentially adding new capacity, I know that's still up in the air, but how much is really dependent on the visibility of the new project demand and converting pipeline into project wins versus module-only? And would the U.S. be most critical in terms of that visibility? Or is there another reason that you highlighted it as being the biggest factor as you move through the year?"

We haven't sold Moapa, and we're expecting to sell Moapa in the second half of the year. And then we're seeing our Switch Station project start to ramp up in the second half of the year as well. So it's really -- it's a ramp-down of some of our systems projects that have been in construction over the last year, and then we don't start to see a ramp-up with the new assets until we start to enter into the July time frame. So it's just a transitionary period. So we'll see more module-only type of -- and Module Plus-type revenue in the second quarter, so you'll see a slight drop in earnings associated with that. In terms of capacity visibility, it's -- as we've always said, it's going to be driven by highly reliable, predictable demand. And so it's a demand-driven pull versus a capacity push. And we're starting to see, obviously, not only here in the U.S. but internationally, a significant increase in demand in our pipe -- and what's reflected in our pipeline. And you can see there's a lot more international. So it's not necessarily discrete to one particular region. It's not discrete to module versus systems. And so it's a holistic, comprehensive analysis of the global demand expectations across multiple product offerings that will ultimately kind of inform our view around capacity and the right time to add it."

One thing to understand about the systems business is even though the ITC got extended, we had a large number of system projects that were slated for delivery in 2016. And some of those had PPA requirements such that even though the ITC was extended, they still have to be delivered. So we had a what I would call an unusual alignment of deliveries at the end of 2016. And that leaves a bit of a gap until you can redeploy the workforce, start new projects and get those projects to the finish line. And that's a little bit of what we're seeing. We're seeing plenty of demand. But normally, our systems business, the projects sort of roll off at a steady rate as opposed to all being aligned to a single point in time. So it's a little bit a historical function of the ITC falloff that never happened because it got extended. So I think that's just an important thing to keep in mind. The other is -- one of the things we tried to highlight at the Analyst Day, and I think people need to try to get a greater understanding of this, we've got a number of factors coming together in terms of our production platform. We've got a new product we're rolling out in the form of the Series 5. We have a new product under development in the form of the Series 6. There's a lot of complicated decisions that we need to make about the production platform related to those. And we're trying to make sure that we're thoughtful, careful and detailed in our analysis. So it's not as simple as what's the demand and when do we build the plant to supply it. It's a more complicated equation because we've got new products in the equation. So it's -- we will respond to demand when and where we see it, and we will also communicate to investors when we have a clear view of what our plan's going to be. But as we always have been, we're always going to be a little bit conservative and a little bit thoughtful about putting those plans together."

And it's not an easy business task to sort of flow those 2 together and figure it out. As I look at the tasks that Mark and the team are going to take on over the next 4 years, we have a much clearer view as to demand with no big distorting events within the next sort of 4 to 5 year time horizon at least that we know about today. And we have a position of technology leadership that we're going to increase upon as opposed to try to get back to and achieve. So I think it will be a little less lumpy and feel a little more robust than, perhaps, the last 4 years, where we had a lot of challenges to overcome, which we successfully overcame. I think this is less about overcoming challenges and more about capitalizing upon the strong -- the incredible opportunities that are out there for the company."

The bankruptcy court has very broad powers to deal with contracts that SunEdison has entered into. And utilities will not be able to terminate those contracts, even if they have the right to do so, without the approval of the bankruptcy court. So I think what we will see happen is there'll be a long period of uncertainty. I personally don't think we're going to see a lot of progress or a lot of definition around their projects for, certainly, the next 3 to 4 months and probably closer to 6 months. And then as the creditors' committee and the bankruptcy estate works through all of the mechanics of bankruptcy, they have got to figure out everything, and that's going to be challenged as a preference. Everything is going to be challenged as a fraudulent conveyance. And bear in mind the very large transactions that were done in the year prior to the bankruptcy filing, they will have to work through the big pieces of litigation with the yield cos and the failed deals and try to resolve all of that. So as bankruptcies go, there's a lot of big issues that are going to have to be dealt with before, I think, they can get to some of the more mundane, sort of ordinary course of business types of issues. So I think the impact on the market, whether the volumes are going to get built and whether utilities are going to re-procure, I simply think that, that will play out very slowly over the remainder of 2016."

There's generally been an enthusiastic response from customers, especially in the North American circumstance, which is where the economics work the best. There are projects or bidding opportunities out there where we have qualification issues for Series 5. It's not been in existence long enough to qualify. That's not really a challenge for us because we're going to continue to manufacture Series 4 as far into the future as we can see. And we can also adjust the ratio of Series 4 to Series 5 production relatively easily. It's the same basic production platform with a different back end added. So there's a great deal of flexibility in shifting production between Series 4 and Series 5. And as we begin to see where the demand is going to be over '17, '18 and '19 and begin to see where the adoption of Series 5 is going to be, we'll be able to tailor sort of the rollout of that and adjust the production of 4 versus 5 fairly easily. So I don't think we feel like there's a whole lot of challenge in that -- in those issues."

So that happened during the quarter. And as I indicated, it was about $0.20, and yes, that is in our guidance for the full year. As it relates to other asset sales, there are not any other items in our guidance at this point in time. Are there any other potential asset sales that could happen during the balance of the year? There's a couple -- we still have facilities in Europe and Asia-Pacific that we are marketing. There's always potential opportunity that something like that could happen, but there's no assumed benefit of that included our guidance at this point in time. Look, we're very confident in our ability to extract value from the module and the energy density advantages that we have, and we showed that in the Analyst Day, that that advantage will improve over time. And then with Series 5, in particular, when you normalize for effectively the same form factor as crystalline silicon, there's advantages. We talked about that in terms of labor costs, fewer flips and connectors and those types of things that will help drive down the cost of that product as it relates to the overall cost to install. So we're very comfortable in terms of translating our technology advantage and ultimately normalizing the form factor that, that will translate into value. The bookings, yes, the bookings that were reflected in the quarter were primarily modules. And there was -- I'll refer to it as low-bin inventory that we sold during the quarter that would be below market expectations around value for the module. So there were some of that we ended up selling. It was around 40 megawatts or so, so that did bring down the average ASP that's implied by the bookings. What I also will tell you is that there is rounding in those numbers. So I understand the simple average base off the math is going to tell you that there is rounding both ways that won't get you to the exact same answer."

We've taken some organizational steps to prepare for it, some of which the market was aware of. We're transitioning from one strategic plan that we satisfied, and we're embarking upon a second Vision 2020 plan. We have a lot of big fundamental decisions. They're good decisions. How are we going to best capitalize on opportunities?

So that optionality will play itself out, subject to many different variables, as we progress through the second half of the year. As it relates to oversupply concerns, we always have kind of a healthy dense concern of what's going on in the market, and we said before the ITC extension that there was a concern around oversupply as we went into '17. Clearly, I think the ITC extension provides a different view of the horizon beyond '16. We may not have as much resiliency or robustness of demand in '17, but clearly, it drives more demand into '18, '19 and '20, in particular. We are very, though, encouraged by where the international markets are trending, a lot of new opportunities happening internationally. But we are, obviously, aware of what's going on in terms of what the additional capacity plans are and the implications relative to demand. What I will say, though, as well, as we increase the overall competitiveness of our product, especially as we move from Series 4 to 5 and then eventually get into Series 6, we believe we have a very strong, differentiated technology and cost-advantaged technology that will weather those types of potential disruptions around supply and demand."

Oftentimes, that is tied to specific competitive factors related to the technology or customer relationships. Other markets, less so. I'd say at this stage, with respect to the back half of the year and certainly, for next year, we're still in a mode where we are optimizing sales against margin. In other words, we're not chasing every opportunity that presents itself. We have the ability to pick and choose the opportunities that we're chasing in order to maximize the margin on every incremental sale that we achieve. So that is generally indicative of an environment where I wouldn't say we have pricing power, but we have that ability to optimize.

And so you can see different behaviors across regions based off of customers and what they value and ultimately, if they're looked upon to be the long-term owner of the asset or they're looked upon just to be the developer and then sell down of the asset. So all that comes into play as we think about how do we engage the customer and then ultimately, how do we capture the best value for our product. Now as a Jim indicated, because we have optionality that plays to our strength, right, so we will target those types of opportunities that we can capture the highest margin entitlement relative to the product and solutions that we provide to the customer."

We still believe that there's a tremendous value and investment thesis, I guess, is the best way to say it to a shareholder of 8point3. Clearly, there are some market dislocations right now that are impacting that. We believe, over time, the investor will better understand the quality of these assets, the investor-grade off-takers, the relatively low variability around the solar assets. The equity will perform over time. Now whether that completely happens in time for us to drop down Moapa and Stateline is yet to be determined. We'll evaluate that, and we have other options if we choose to pursue them. Similar to what we did with Stateline, when we sold a portion of Stateline to Southern, we went and then increased the ROFO by identifying Switch, which is a large project that will take the COD at 2017 as a potential drop-down to 8point3. So if we make the decision around one of the other assets, whether it's Moapa and Stateline, we have more than enough contracted assets that if we chose to, we could replace them in the ROFO and put them into a cadence with some more natural drop-down to 8point3. As we said in the 8point3 earnings call, we already have with the current assets that have been dropped down now with Hooper and Henrietta being completed here recently -- or excuse me, Hooper and Kingbird being completed here recently, we have the ability to grow our dividend through the end of '17.

Before we discuss our first quarter operational and financial results, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the leadership transition we announced earlier today. 
As you may have seen in our press release, after 4 years with First Solar as CEO, I have decided that I will step down on June 30 and hand the reigns over to our current Chief Financial Officer, Mark Widmar, who will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer at that time. As part of the transition, I will continue to support the company in an advisory role and as a member of the Board of Directors. 
The board and I worked jointly on the company's leadership succession plan, and Mark was our first and best choice as CEO as First Solar enters its next phase of growth. Mark is a strong, capable leader with an extensive knowledge of our business, having served as First Solar's Chief Financial Officer since 2011 and as First Solar's Chief Accounting Officer from February 2012 through June 2015. Mark and I have worked closely together over the past 4 years, and I expect a seamless transition. I have deep confidence that the company will be in good hands. 
It has been a privilege to lead First Solar, and I am proud of the significant milestones we accomplished as a team. When I joined First Solar in early 2012, the company faced significant challenges from both industry-specific and macroeconomic factors. My intent from the start and my commitment to the Board of Directors was to work with First Solar leadership to establish a strategic plan that placed the company on a trajectory of sustainable success. 
As our most recent Analyst Day demonstrated, we have accomplished what we set out to do 4 years ago. We not only achieved our goals, but we exceeded expectations. I remain excited about the opportunities ahead for First Solar. 
With that, let's turn to our results. I'll begin by briefly reviewing our first quarter operational and financial performance. First, our 30 manufacturing lines ran at 100% capacity utilization and produced over 770 megawatts of modules in the first quarter. Our Q1 fleet average efficiency continued to improve, climbing to 16.2%. Our lead line efficiency continues to hold steady at 16.4% as new efficiency process improvements are not slated until later in the year. Coming off our recent Analyst Day, where we laid out a highly compelling technology roadmap and potential capacity expansions, this represents an impressive start to 2016 and to achieving the objectives outlined at that meeting. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'll review our latest comparison of bookings versus year-to-date shipments. We ended 2015 with 4.2 gigawatt DC of expected future module shipments. In the first quarter, we shipped over 800 megawatts of modules against this total and have booked approximately 600 megawatts of new volume. Of the 600 megawatts of new bookings, around 400 megawatts were booked since our last earnings call in late February. The largest single booking was the previously announced module supply agreement of over 200 megawatts DC with Silicon Ranch for deliveries to their projects scheduled for construction in 2017 and 2018. This agreement is another positive indication of the strength of solar demand in the Southeastern United States beyond 2016. 
International volume was an important component of our bookings since last earnings call, with volume contracted in several different countries. In India, we signed module agreements for almost 100 megawatts DC of additional volume. As announced recently, we achieved a major milestone in this market with now over 1 gigawatt of volume sold into India. These new bookings add to our strength in this growing solar market. 
In Honduras, we signed an agreement with Grupo Terra to provide modules and EPC services for a 25 megawatt AC solar project. This is the second project in Honduras we will have constructed for Grupo Terra and further expands our presence in this region. 
For the balance of the year, we continue to see a number of domestic and international opportunities that would move us closer to a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. In the U.S, the ITC extension has led to an increase in overall opportunities, but customers continue to work through revisions to project timing, which has led to some temporary delays in new contracted bookings. Potential international opportunities continue to be strong as well, with the decision timing on a number of projects occurring in the second half of the year. 
In addition, while the majority of bookings thus far in 2016 have been primarily module sales, this is timing-related as we are pursuing a number of systems booking opportunities during the balance of the year. 
For example, in our mid- to late-stage potential bookings, we have over 450 megawatts of opportunities, with offerings ranging from AC Power Block to a full power plant. In our early-stage opportunities, if we focus on the projects with the highest booking probability, there are over 500 megawatts of additional potential systems bookings. In each case, these are projects with 2017 CODs and the majority of shipments occurring in that year. Note that in addition to the more than 950 megawatts of opportunities discussed, there are a large number of other early-stage systems projects with lower probabilities that may materialize as well. 
Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stand at $6.4 billion, as shown on Slide 5. The decrease in expected revenue as a result of the timing of new bookings thus far in 2016 and the higher mix of module-only businesses compared to the revenue recognized in Q1. Note this includes revenue on any module sale or systems project that we have contracted. However, it does not include our contracted O&M revenue. 
Slide 6 provides the updated potential bookings opportunities, which is now over 23 gigawatts, an increase of approximately 3 gigawatts from the prior quarter. Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities are 3.1 gigawatts DC, with new international opportunities across 20 different countries comprising almost 90% of this number. 
Moving on to Slide 7. Our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography reflects a net increase in opportunities across all regions. The largest increase was in the United States, where new opportunities were identified across multiple regions, but especially in the South and Southeastern part of the country. 
We also had a significant increase in opportunities in the Middle East, India and Asia-Pacific regions. The growth in opportunities in these regions plus the large number of mid- to late-stage international opportunities demonstrates the results of our multiyear effort we have made to diversify into new markets. 
I'll now turn it over to Mark, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

Before I delve into the numbers, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to Jim for his leadership and friendship over the past 4 years. First Solar is a strong company it is today, thanks to his guidance and dedication. I look forward to building upon the success in the future. Come July, I will hit the ground running and work with our board, management team and associates to drive First Solar's next phase of growth while continuing to deliver strong results to our shareholders. 
In addition, we announced today that Alex Bradley has been appointed Interim Chief Financial Officer. Alex has served as Vice President of Project Finance since 2012, with responsibilities for the Treasury group added last year. Alex has been with First Solar for 8 years and was instrumental in launching 8point3 Energy Partners last year. I have tremendous confidence in Alex's ability to step into the CFO role until a permanent successor is made. 
Now I'll begin by discussing our first quarter operational performance on Slide 9. In Q1, we produced 774 megawatts DC, an increase of 2% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and increased throughput. Production was 43% higher compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to higher efficiencies, improved throughput and the addition of new capacity. Our capacity utilization remained at 100% in Q1 and is 13 percentage points higher versus the same period in 2015. The higher year-over-year capacity utilization is due to fewer upgrade activities across the fleet. Our best line conversion efficiency remains unchanged at 16.4%, as planned in our technology roadmap. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, our lead line efficiency improved by 80 basis points. 
Average module conversion efficiency in Q1 for our entire fleet was 16.2%, an increase of 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year, our fleet average conversion efficiency increased by 150 basis points. As indicated at the recent Analyst Day, efficiency improvements are expected to pick up later in the year as we are targeting a full year average and lead line efficiency exit of 16.7% and 17%, respectively.
I'll next discuss the P&L results for the quarter on Slide 10. For Q1, net sales were $848 million in the quarter compared to $942 million in Q4. The decrease in sales resulted primarily from the timing of revenue recognition across multiple systems projects and the completion during the quarter of our Tenaska West and Seville projects. Module Plus revenue declined from the prior quarter, while third-party module sales increased slightly. Partially offsetting these decreases was the higher revenue on our Stateline project, which resulted from an amendment to the original sales agreement with Southern to include an additional 15% interest in the project. This leaves First Solar with the remaining 34% interest, which is expected to be dropped down to 8.3% in the second half of the year.  As highlighted at the Analyst Day, the sale of this incremental interest in Stateline does not impact our full year guidance but does have the effect of shifting earnings from the second half of the year into the first half. As a percent of total quarterly net sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, decreased to 93% from 95% in the prior quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 31% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter. The improved margin percentage resulted from the higher mix of Stateline revenue and significant system cost improvements. Our component segment gross margin improved to over 28% in the quarter and benefited from a lower module cost per watt. 
Operating expenses decreased by almost $2 million from Q4 to $98 million. R&D expenses were lower versus the prior quarter, partially offset by higher development spend. First quarter operating profit was $165 million compared to an operating profit of $132 million in the prior quarter. 
Other income and expense was $36 million for the quarter primarily due to a $38 million gain from the sale and rebalancing of certain restricted investments associated with our module end-of-life program. The transaction was completed in order to better align the currencies of the investments with those of the corresponding collection and recycling obligations. The gain was approximately $20 million, net of tax. 
Tax expense for Q1 was $34 million, including the tax on the gain from the sale of our restricted investments. 
Q1 earnings were $1.66 per fully diluted share on net income of $171 million. This compares to earnings of $1.60 in the prior quarter. 
Overall, it was a strong quarter for earnings and a positive start for 2016. We were able to sell an incremental interest in Stateline, which not only strengthens our ongoing relationship with Southern but also provides greater flexibility for 8point3. Our manufacturing systems operations performed extremely well in the quarter and contributed significantly to the Q1 results. 
Turning to Slide 11. I'll now discuss the selected balance sheet items and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased by approximately $50 million to $1.9 billion. Our net cash position also increased to $1.6 billion. The improvement was achieved while our project-related asset balance grew to $1.5 billion from $1.3 billion in the prior quarter. 
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased slightly as compared to Q4. The increase in project-related assets was partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable. 
Total debt increased by $10 million from the prior quarter to $299 million as payments on our KLM debt facility were more than offset by additional financings for international projects. 
Cash flow from operation was $50 million, slightly lower as compared to Q4. Free cash flow was $13 million compared to $20 million in Q4. 
Capital expenditures were $52 million as compared to $27 million in the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $55 million or approximately $5 million lower than the prior quarter.  
Continuing to Slide 12. I will now discuss our updated full year 2016 guidance. First, note that while the strong Q1 results could be perceived as the catalyst for a more substantial increase in our earnings guidance, it is important to keep in mind the factors that contributed to the revised guidance. 
First, the amendment to the original Stateline sales agreement did not impact full year earnings. Rather, it affected the timing of the earnings and the income statement presentation. In addition, we feel it's too early in the year to make more substantial updates to the guidance. While we have visibility to opportunities during the balance of the year that could result in making an upward revision, we believe a more measured approach at this time is prudent. 
Turning to our guidance on net sales. We are keeping the range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. We are making -- maintaining the range primarily based on the expected accounting for the sale of Kingbird project, which we will reflect in our Q2 results. The tax equity structuring for this project sale will result in a partial deferral of revenue. We will provide more information related to this transaction on the Q2 call. But for now, we are highlighting that is a factor in holding the net sales guidance unchanged. 
Next, we are increasing our gross margin guidance range by 100 basis points to a revised range of 18% to 19%. The gross margin improvement is a result of the amendment to the original Stateline project sale, which results in movement of profit from equity and earnings to gross margin. In addition, the cost improvements in the first quarter have benefited gross margin and are reflected in the updated range. It's important to keep in mind that the expected profit on the sale of our remaining 34% interest in Stateline is still reflected in equity and earnings in our guidance. 
Operating expenses is unchanged, and operating income guidance has increased by $40 million, reflecting the improved gross margin. 
The effective tax rate is unchanged at 16% to 18%. We have increased the low end of our guidance per share -- earnings per share guidance to $4.10 and left the high end unchanged at $4.50. As noted on Slide 12, our EPS guidance includes approximately $145 million, net of tax, from the expected sale of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar's share of 8point3's earnings. In addition, approximately $0.20 of other income, net of tax, is included in the earnings guidance range from the Q1 sale of the restricted investments mentioned. 
The distribution of earnings for the year is expected to be slightly less than 50% in the first half of the year, although this is subject to the timing of when certain project sales close. 
Our expected ending net cash balance is unchanged, and operating cash flow range have increased by $100 million compared to our prior guidance. The increase in operating cash flow has a net 0 impact to the overall cash balance as it is a movement from investing to operating cash flow. 
With the sale of an incremental 15% interest in Stateline to Southern, the cash associated with this transaction will be treated as operating cash flow rather than the prior expectations of an investing cash flow from the sale of the residual interest in the project to 8point3. Keep in mind that our operating cash flow guidance does not include approximately $320 million from the expected sale of the remaining interest in Stateline to 8point3, which we expect to be treated as investing cash flows. 
Our capital expenditures and shipment guidance remains unchanged. Related to our CapEx guidance in the year, it should be noted that included in this number is approximately $130 million related to the launch of our Series 5 product, which we introduced recently at our Analyst Day. Our drop-down plans for Kingbird, Stateline and Moapa to 8point3 are unchanged. However, the actual execution is subject to market conditions. 
Following our recent Analyst Day, some have expressed concerns that we did not provide more specifics around 2017. I wish to reiterate that there are still a number of moving pieces and uncertainties related to 2017, which do not make it meaningful to provide an outlook at this time. The reality should not overshadow the significant opportunities and technology advances we have laid out in detail at the event. We feel the company is better positioned than at any time during the past 5 years from a technology, operations and balance sheet strength standpoint, and we look forward to the many opportunities to come. 
Turning to the next slide. I'll summarize our progress during the past quarter. First, we delivered solid financial results for the first quarter, with gross margins of 31% and earnings per share of $1.66. We updated our 2016 earnings guidance range from $4.10 to $4.50, which represents a $0.05 increase of our guidance midpoint. Our technology performance continues at a strong pace, with a fleet average efficiency of 16.2% and a best line of 16.4%. We have booked 600 megawatts so far this year, and we continue to see the number of opportunities increase, and our potential bookings now stand at over 23 gigawatts. With the number of opportunities in the second half of the year, we see -- anticipated the bookings momentum to continue. 
With this, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

And Mark, I wanted to just follow up on your comments about 2017. I think you guys mentioned in the prepared remarks that there were 450 megawatts of systems bookings opportunities that you expect to execute in the second half. So based on some of the backlog that you've announced, should we sort of think about systems business in the 800 to 900 megawatt range for next year? Is that a good starting point? And then as you think about CapEx for next year, can you just maybe provide us some updated thoughts on how you think about -- how we should think about CapEx and capacity ramp in the -- for the remainder of this year and next year?"

So I think what we said is just comments that was in our late stage, and I think it was maybe about 450. But we also indicated that if you look at the earlier-stage projects, at least the ones that we've determined with higher level of probability, there's another 500 megawatts or so in there. So there's a potential of about 1 gigawatt of bookings that can happen between now and the end of the year that will be systems-related. That's also one reason why -- as we think about providing guidance for 2017, until we can crystallize those opportunities, it's not meaningful at this point in time to provide guidance for '17. So I just want to make sure you kind of connected those dots. But as it relates to next year, somewhere in that gigawatt range at systems level, that, that's probably about right. We've kind of indicated that we would expect it to be maintained around that range, at least in the foreseeable future, trending upwards, obviously, as we start to ramp capacity. So I think that's the right way to look at it. CapEx, I can just really point you back to what we said in the Analyst Day at this point in time. I mean, we gave the view of what we see capacity expansion. We gave the view of what the associated CapEx would be for that capacity expansion. We haven't given the Street impact to '17, '18 versus '19. But I think the best thing to do is just go back and review the slides that we presented at the Analyst Day. I think that will give you the color that you're looking for."

So I don't expect any sudden change as a result of the filing. They, at least on the North American front, had been far less active over probably the last 6 to 9 months. Generally, what we're seeing in the North American market is very robust demand. I think we have a lot of customers and a lot of opportunities where customers are having to resort the timing given the ITC change and try to figure out what they're going to do when and how their procurement programs are going to be built up. But the conversations are robust, and the demand is there. So I think we all feel remarkably positive about the North American market."

Because even when you ex out the Stateline sale and equity gain in Q1, you earned a good dollar of EPS. So just trying to reconcile there. And then the second question, as you think about potentially adding new capacity, I know that's still up in the air, but how much is really dependent on the visibility into new project demand and converting pipeline into project wins versus module-only? And would the U.S. be most critical in terms of that visibility? Or is there another reason that you highlight as being the biggest factor as you move through the year?"

We haven't sold Moapa yet, we're expecting to sell Moapa in the second half of the year. And then we're seeing our Switch Station project start to ramp up in the second half of the year as well. So it's really -- it's a ramp-down of some of our systems projects that have been in construction over the last year, and then we don't start to see a ramp-up with the new assets until we start to enter into the July time frame. So it's just a transitionary period. So we'll see more module-only type of -- and Module Plus-type revenue in the second quarter, so you'll see a slight drop in earnings associated with that. In terms of capacity visibility, it's -- as we've always said, it's going to be driven by highly reliable, predictable demand. And so it's a demand-driven pull versus a capacity push. And we're starting to see, obviously, not only here in the U.S. but internationally, a significant increase in demand in our pipe -- it was reflected in our pipeline. And you can see there's a lot more international. So it's not necessarily discrete to one particular region. It's not discrete to module versus systems. And so it's a holistic, comprehensive analysis of the global demand expectations across multiple product offerings that will ultimately kind of inform our view around capacity and the right time to add it."

One thing to understand about the systems business is even though the ITC got extended, we had a large number of system projects that were slated for delivery in 2016. And some of those had PPA requirements such that even though the ITC was extended, they still had to be delivered. So we had a what I would call an unusual alignment of deliveries at the end of 2016. And that leaves a bit of a gap until you can redeploy the workforce, start new projects and get those projects to the finish line. And that's a little bit of what we're seeing. We're seeing plenty of demand. But normally, our systems business, the projects sort of roll off at a steady rate as opposed to all being aligned to a single point in time. So it's a little bit a historical function of the ITC falloff that never happened because it got extended. So I think that's just an important thing to keep in mind. The other is, one of the things we tried to highlight at the Analyst Day, and I think people need to try to get a greater understanding of, is we've got a number of factors coming together in terms of our production platform. We've got a new product we're rolling out in the form of the Series 5. We have a new product under development in the form of the Series 6. There's a lot of complicated decisions that we need to make about the production platform related to those. And we're trying to make sure that we're thoughtful, careful and detailed in our analysis. So it's not as simple as what's the demand and when do we build the plant to supply it. It's a more complicated equation because we've got new products in the equation. So it's -- we will respond to demand when and where we see it, and we will also communicate to investors when we have a clear view of what our plan's going to be. But as we always have been, we're always going to be a little bit conservative and a little bit thoughtful about putting those plans together."

One was, we only wanted to restore cost leadership and substantially improve our technology, and that was an overwhelming sort of focus of what we wanted to do. In addition, you had the potential ITC fall away, which created a very significant distortion in the marketplace, and you were trying to plan around that distortion. And it's not an easy business task to sort of flow those 2 together and figure it out. As I look at the tasks that Mark and the team are going to take on over the next 4 years, we have a much clearer view as to demand with no big distorting events within the next sort of 4 to 5 year time horizon at least that we know about today. And we have a position of technology leadership that we're going to increase upon as opposed to try to get back to and achieve. So I think it will be a little less lumpy and feel a little more robust than perhaps the last 4 years, where we had a lot of challenges to overcome, which we successfully overcame. I think this is less about overcoming challenges and more about capitalizing upon the strong -- the incredible opportunities that are out there for the company."

But what we said, I think, on the international growth side of it is our late-stage opportunities that's in our pipeline, about 90% of that is international. So you got a little over 3 gigawatts, and 90% of that is actually international. It is relatively diverse. It's in a number of markets. I mean, we're seeing a lot of activity, clearly, in India, but we're starting to see more activity across Asia-Pacific, seeing activity through the Mideast. We're starting to see -- we actually just -- are close to signing an agreement in South America for about 40 megawatts. So there's a lot of opportunities, even in parts of South Africa. So it's a very diverse -- and that's what we wanted to see. I mean, over the years, we made a decision to invest in our demand generation and our sales team. And we felt that over time, we would create diversity of the demand profile. And that's starting to show up, and it's reflected in our pipeline. So it's not any one discrete market. It's pretty robust, and that's what we want to see, that type of diversification."

The bankruptcy court has very broad powers to deal with contracts that SunEdison has entered into. And utilities will not be able to terminate those contracts, even if they have the right to do so, without the approval of the bankruptcy court. So I think what we will see happen is there'll be a long period of uncertainty. I personally don't think we're going to see a lot of progress or a lot of definition around their projects for certainly the next 3 to 4 months and probably closer to 6 months. And then as the creditors' committee and the bankruptcy estate works through all of the mechanics of bankruptcy, they've got to figure out everything that's going to be challenged as a preference, everything that's going to be challenged as a fraudulent conveyance. And bear in mind the very large transactions that were done in the year prior to the bankruptcy filing, they'll have to work through the big pieces of litigation with the yield cos and the failed deals and try to resolve all of that. So as bankruptcies go, there's a lot of big issues that are going to have to be dealt with before, I think, they can get to some of the more mundane sort of ordinary course of business types of issues. So I think the impact on the market, whether the volumes are going to get built and whether utilities are going to re-procure, I simply think that, that will play out very slowly over the remainder of 2016."

There are projects or bidding opportunities out there where we have qualification issues for Series 5. It's not been in existence long enough to qualify. That's not really a challenge for us because we're going to continue to manufacture Series 4 as far into the future as we can see. And we can also adjust the ratio of Series 4 to Series 5 production relatively easily. It's the same basic production platform with a different back end added. So there's a great deal of flexibility in shifting production between Series 4 and Series 5. And as we begin to see where the demand is going to be over '17, '18 and '19 and begin to see where the adoption of Series 5 is going to be, we'll be able to tailor sort of the rollout of that and adjust the production of 4 versus 5 fairly easily.

So that happened during the quarter. And as I indicated, it was about $0.20, and yes, that is in our guidance for the full year. As it relates to other asset sales, there are not any other items in our guidance at this point in time. Are there any other potential asset sales that could happen during the balance of the year? There's a couple -- we still have facilities in Europe and Asia-Pacific that we are marketing. There's always potential opportunity that something like that could happen, but there's no assumed benefit of that included our guidance at this point in time. Look, we're very confident in our ability to extract value from the module and the energy density advantages that we have, and we showed that in the Analyst Day, that, that advantage will improve over time. And then with Series 5, in particular, when you normalize for effectively the same form factor as crystalline silicon, there is advantages. We talked about that in terms of labor costs, fewer flips and connectors and those types of things that will help drive down the cost of that product as it relates to the overall cost to install. So we're very comfortable in terms of translating our technology advantage and ultimately normalizing the form factor that, that will translate into value. The bookings, yes, the bookings that were reflected in the quarter were primarily modules. And there was some -- I'll refer to it as low-bin inventory that we sold during the quarter that would be below market expectations around value for the module. So there was some of that we ended up selling. It was around 40 megawatts or so, so that did bring down the average ASP that's implied by the bookings. I also will tell you is that there is rounding in those numbers. So I understand the simple average base off the math is going to tell you that, but there is rounding both ways that won't get you to the exact same answer."

And this -- I would describe this as perhaps slightly accelerated from maybe where we would have thought it was going to be a year ago, but it was clearly a plan that we had in place. We've taken some organizational steps to prepare for it, some of which the market was aware of. We're transitioning from one strategic plan that we satisfied, and we're embarking upon a second, the Vision 2020 plan. We have a lot of big fundamental decisions. They're good decisions. They're how are we going to best capitalize on opportunities? And I think the board and I felt like -- that this was the right time to let a new -- the new management team coalesce around those decisions so that they don't have my heavy hand hanging over them, and they reflect the views, the thoughts and the beliefs of that team because obviously, both I and the board want that team to be accountable for meeting the results that are promised. So just, for a variety of reasons, it felt like the right time. It felt that way to the board. It felt that way to me.

So there could be some issues timing-wise as it relates to that, and we have flexibility if we wanted to, to take Stateline into next year or a portion of Stateline if we chose to do that. So that optionality will play itself out, subject to many different variables, as we progress through the second half of the year. As it relates to oversupply concerns, we always have kind of a healthy, dense concern of what's going on in the market, and we said before the ITC extension that there was a concern around oversupply as we went into '17. Clearly, I think the ITC extension provides a different view of the horizon beyond '16. We may not have as much resiliency or robustness of demand in '17, but clearly, it drives more demand into '18, '19 and '20, in particular. We are very, though, encouraged by where the international markets are trending, a lot of new opportunities happening internationally. But we are, obviously, aware of what's going on in terms of what the additional capacity plans are and the implications relative to demand. What I will say, though, as well, as we increase the overall competitiveness of our product, especially as we move from Series 4 to 5 and then eventually get into Series 6, we believe we have a very strong, differentiated technology and a cost-advantaged technology that will weather those types of potential disruptions around supply and demand."

Oftentimes, that's tied to specific competitive factors related to the technology or customer relationships. Other markets, less so. I'd say at this stage, with respect to the back half of the year and certainly, for next year, we're still in a mode where we are optimizing sales against margin. In other words, we're not chasing every opportunity that presents itself. We have the ability to pick and choose the opportunities that we're chasing in order to maximize the margin on every incremental sale that we achieve. So that is generally indicative of an environment where I wouldn't say we have pricing power, but we have that ability to optimize.

And so you can see different behaviors across regions based off of customers and what they value and ultimately, if they're looked upon to be the long-term owner of the asset or they're looked upon just to be the developer and then sell down of the asset. So all that comes into play as we think about how do we engage a customer and then ultimately, how do we capture the best value for our product. Now as Jim indicated, because we have optionality, that plays to our strength, right, so we will target those types of opportunities that we can capture the highest margin entitlement relative to the product and solutions that we provide to the customer."

We still believe that there's a tremendous value and investment thesis, I guess, is the best way to say it to a shareholder of 8point3. Clearly, there are some market dislocations right now that are impacting that. We believe, over time, the investor will better understand the quality of these assets, the investor-grade off-takers, the relatively low variability around the solar assets. The equity will perform over time. Now whether that completely happens in time for us to drop down Moapa and Stateline is yet to be determined. We'll evaluate that, and we have other options if we choose to pursue them. Similar to what we did with Stateline, when we sold a portion of Stateline to Southern, we went and then increased the ROFO by identifying Switch, which is a large project that will take the COD at 2017 as a potential drop-down to 8point3. So if we make a decision around one of the other assets, whether it's Moapa and Stateline, we have more than enough contracted assets that if we chose to, we could replace them in the ROFO and put them into a cadence with some more natural drop-down to 8point3. As we said in the 8point3 earnings call, we already have with the current assets that have been dropped down now with Hooper and Henrietta being completed here recently -- or excuse me, Hooper and Kingbird being completed here recently, we have the ability to grow our dividend through the end of '17.

In our deci",2490,"Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Before reviewing the results for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on some key strategic priorities and how I intend to lead the organization in my new role as CEO. In our decision making, we will continue to apply the same disciplined approach to long-term strategy that has served us extremely well to date. 
At various times over the last several years, some have questioned our measured approach to key strategic decisions including capacity expansion, asset ownership and balance sheet utilization.  However, we continue to see the benefits of our disciplined strategy and are confident this approach will optimize shareholder value over the long term. This approach also allows us to be nimble and navigate an industry that is cyclical, high growth and dynamic. The updates I will provide today do not constitute any major strategic changes from what we discussed earlier this year at our Analyst Day in April but are further refinements aimed at simplifying and focusing our business. 
The core of our overall strategy continues to be our differentiated CdTe technology and its tremendous potential for further conversion efficiency improvements. Closely aligned to our module efficiency road map is the evolution of our module form factor, which as we indicated in April, will begin next year with the introduction of our Series 5 module. Our Series 4 technology is an outstanding product with a superior temperature coefficient, spectral gain and shading response. Series 4 holds an energy density advantage over multi-crystalline silicon products. 
Series 5 retains the energy density of that as of our CdTe technology, further boosts efficiency and is optimized for cost-effective installations. To put this into perspective, in a typical market, the reduction in Series 5 BoS costs relative to Series 4, will be equivalent to boosting module efficiency by approximately 100 basis points. The combination of these factors make this a powerful new product, which is supported by positive initial feedback from our customers and partners. 
Given the exciting potential of this product, we are now planning to invest in additional efficiency improvements over the next couple of years that will take the Series 5 road map to a 391 module versus the 365-watt module we introduced at the Analyst Day. The competitive position of the Series 5 390-watt module with a similar form factor to crystalline silicon but with the inherent energy advantage of CdTe is very exciting. Moreover, the substantial increase to the Series 5 road map has an extremely compelling return on investment. We estimated $60 million of capital expenditures that we will require to enable this efficiency gain across our current 3 gigawatts of production will result in an anticipated payback time of less than a year. 
The focusing on increasing Series 5 efficiency does not change the priority we are placing on Series 6. We continue to push pace the Series 6 development as fast as possible with power plant production beginning in 2018. It should be noted that we intend to prioritize long-term investment in the production and development of Series 5 and Series 6 technologies over adding new manufacturing capacity in the short term. In light of the current supply demand dynamics in the global silver market, we will continue to evaluate the point in time in which adding the additional capacity makes sense. 
As we eagerly look forward to these exciting technologies, some strategic realignments are necessary to ensure focus and seamless execution. Firstly, as we recently announced, we have decided to discontinue TetraSun production in order to maximize our Series 5 assembly capabilities at our facility in Malaysia. This not only enables a more rapid roll-out of Series 5 product next year, but also allows us to focus more resources and capital on our CdTe road map. Secondly, the new Series 5 form factor will significantly broaden spectrum of third-party structures and tracker technologies available for use with our modules without requiring First Solar specific components. Previously, the different form factor of our Series 4 technology led us to develop optimized in-house solutions. The new interoperability of Series 5 with the broad ecosystem of existing third-party structure products is expected to facilitate increase adoption of our module by new customers and increased market opportunities. The evolution of our module form factor allows us to tap into a broader and deeper supply chain for structures and trackers. And we have therefore decided to discontinue substantial internal development of fixed tilt and tracker structures. This decision allows us to refocus resources towards developing closer relationships with industry-leading structure and tracker technology providers, and at the same time, eliminate some of the channel conflicts that existed in certain situations today. 
Thirdly, the progression of the interoperability of our modules also impacts our strategy as it relates to EPC capabilities. Historically, we have self-performed EPC on the majority of our system projects as well as provide EPC services to third-party developers using First Solar module technology. The evolution of our module form factor, combined with the lower volume of system projects in 2017, implies a reduced need for internal EPC services and requires a reduction in our EPC work force. 
While these decisions are difficult and will impact a number of dedicated associates, this is a necessary step. We will continue to maintain sufficient internal EPC resources to support the construction of our self-developed projects. This allows us to continue to provide comprehensive solutions to our customers and also enables continued development of next-generation BLS technologies such as MVDC, which we introduced at our Analyst Day. 
It should be clear that this decision around EPC can no way impact our product development business and in fact allows us to allocate more capital and focus more resources on this critical aspect of our business model. 
Lastly, as part of our refocusing efforts, we have also decided to explore options for the disposition of skytron energy. Our original intent in acquiring skytron was to expand our global O&M footprint into Europe and supplement our existing capabilities. Over the past 2 years, competition for winning contracts in Europe, combined with the progression of First Solar's internal O&M capability, particularly as it relates to smaller-scale solar plants, has changed how skytron fits into our strategy going forward. 
Altogether, we expect charges of $105 million to $120 million related to TetraSun and the actions we are announcing today. On an annual basis going forward, the total reductions and operating expense and cost of sales is expected to be $60 million to $80 million. Alex will provide more detail on these charges and associated savings. While these decisions are difficult for part of our organization, these actions will best position First Solar to increase its competitive position over the next several years. We are excited about the potential of our Series 5 and Series 6 technologies and are well positioned with the resources and capabilities necessary to execute on our plans. 
With that, let's return -- let's turn to our results. Our financial results for the quarter were strong with net sales of over $930 million and non-GAAP earnings per share excluding restructuring charges of $0.87. These results were underpinned by continuing execution across both our module manufacturing and system project portfolio. 
Our module lead line efficiency is currently running at 16.7% and we continue to lower our cost per watt. We completed our Silver State South and the McCoy projects in Q2 and are nearing completion of the Stateline project. We recognize significant cost savings on these projects in the quarter as a result of our outstanding execution. Alex will discuss the financial results for the quarter in more detail. 
Moving on to Slide 5, I'll provide an update on our latest bookings activity. In the second quarter, we shipped close to 750 megawatts of modules, bringing our year-to-date total as of June 30 to 1.6 gigawatts. Against these shipments, we have booked approximately 1.4 gigawatts year-to-date, including the period up to today's call. 
I'll now provide some more details on the approximate 800 megawatts of bookings since our last earnings call. In the U.S., we have signed PPAs for 2 projects totaling over 100 megawatts DC -- 180 megawatts DC with a leading Western utility. These projects have CODs in 2019 and 2020, which now brings our total projects with executed PPAs with CODs in 2019 or later to over 1.2 gigawatts DC, which are ideally suited for the competitively advantaged Series 5, Series 6 and MVDC. As evidenced by these bookings, we continue to see many encouraging signs for solar demand over the long-term horizon. 
Beyond these project bookings, we continue to have active discussions with both utilities and C&I customers seeking large-scale solar power supply. The interest in C&I customers is particularly strong with these customers typically looking for renewables to meet up to 100% of their energy supply needs. We see this opportunity as a key market focus and have a dedicated team specifically working with these customers to provide comprehensive solutions that meet their needs. 
In the U.S., we are also encouraged by the increasing demand for community solar solutions, a market segment that we continue to view as having tremendous potential to meet residential and customer -- commercial customers' need at a dramatically lower cost than rooftop solar. 
Underscoring the growth potential for community solar, a third-party research firm recently estimated that community solar's addressable market is more than 7x as large as rooftop solar. Thus far in 2016, we have booked over 120 megawatts DC of volume that will supply more the 25 different community solar projects across multiple states. Majority of this volume is with a single customer where we continue to see opportunities to collaborate on future community solar projects. 
An initial 41 megawatts project is underway with M+W as the EPC contractor. To put the 120 megawatts of bookings in perspective, once this volume has been installed, it will effectively double the amount of cumulative community solar installations in the U.S. We are pleased with the recent progress and continue to work with various customers to capture the growing community solar opportunity in the U.S. Elsewhere in the United States, we booked modest supply agreements for over 80 megawatts DC in diverse solar markets such as Idaho and the North Carolina. 
Internationally, we have bookings in India and have been strong with over 280 megawatts DC of new bookings. The volume booked was a combination of both module supply agreements and 60 megawatts AC of PPAs. These latest PPAs bring our current development pipeline in India to 260 megawatts AC. Altogether, we have booked approximately 250 megawatts DC of systems project this quarter with approximately 1/3 of the volume scheduled for 2017 deliveries. 
Relative to our expectations for the 1 gigawatt of systems business in 2017, we have approximately 400 megawatts DC of contracted projects with additional projects added. We have visibility to a number of additional potential booking opportunities that we continue to pursue towards the 1 gigawatt total. As we bid on future PPAs, we will continue to maintain our discipline and leverage our strengths in bidding opportunities. In situations where we engage early in the process with key partners and leverage the strength of our new Series 5 technology into the offering, we feel that we are extremely competitive. 
In addition to the 800 megawatts of bookings in the past quarter, we have also been awarded opportunities of over 410 megawatts DC, which we expect to convert into bookings during the remainder of this year. Firstly, in Zambia, along with our partner NEOEN, we were awarded 53 megawatts DC power plant, which is expected to deliver the lowest-cost solar electricity in sub-Sahara Africa. The energy density advantage of our CdTe module is particularly strong in this type of hot and humid climate and allows us to provide extremely competitive solar solutions. 
The remaining awarded volume of approximately 357 megawatts DC pertains to module supply agreements in France, Israel, India and Thailand.  In France, we were pleased with the results of the most recent tender process where we're awarded over 100 megawatts of volume. As these awarded projects are converted into bookings, we will discuss them in more detail on future earnings call. 
Moving on Slide 6. Our bookings in expected revenue term stands at $6 billion, a decrease of $900 million from the end of last year. The decrease in expected revenue is a result of the higher mix of module-only business booked as compared to a higher mix of system revenue recognized year-to-date. In addition, it's also driven by lower ASPs associated with some of the longer dated PPAs included in our bookings. While ASPs on these longer-dated PPAs are naturally lower than on project we are currently constructing, there is still an expectation of attractive margins on these projects, given our efficiency in cost road maps discussed at our Analyst Day earlier this year. 
Slide 7 provides an update of potential bookings opportunities, which has grown to 24 megawatts DC, an increase of approximately 700 megawatts from the prior quarter. Our mid to late-stage booking opportunities are 1.8 gigawatts with international opportunities, again, comprising close to 90% of this number. Note that over 400 megawatts are awarded but not booked volume discussed earlier in this presentation is included in this 1.8 gigawatts. Also, it is important to note, as the number of third-party modules sales opportunities and our potential bookings number has increased over time, we are beginning to see an increase in the velocity of which these projects can move from early-stage opportunities to confirm booking. For instance, more than half of our bookings during the past quarter were in early-stage opportunities at the time of our Q1 call. 
Turning to Slide 8. While North America remains our largest geography at over 40% of the total, we continue to have a diversified geographic mix of potential booking opportunities. The largest region with no increases since the last call were the United States and India, where we saw significant growth and opportunities from the prior quarter. We are encouraged by the expanding pipeline in both of these regions given our historical win rate, reflective of our energy density and the mix of system and module sales. 
One last point to keep in mind is the timing of bookings can be very uneven. For example, in the first 6 months of the year, our bookings total was only 800 megawatts. However, in the past month alone, we have added close to 600 megawatts. We continue to aggressively pursue new opportunities while working diligently to close those projects nearing the finish line, including the over 400 megawatts AC awarded volume previously mentioned, but the timing of when this occurs can be lumpy. 
I'll now turn it over to Alex, who will provide more detail in our second quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

I'll begin with some highlights of our operational performance during the past quarter. In Q2, we produced 785 megawatts DC, or an increase of 1% from the prior quarter, resulting from higher module efficiencies and increased throughput. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, production was 39% higher as a result of higher efficiencies, improved throughput and the addition of new capacity. 
Our factory capacity utilization was unchanged at 100% in Q2 versus the prior quarter, but increased by 15 percentage points versus the same period in 2015. The higher year-over-year capacity utilization was due to fewer efficiency upgrade activities in Q2 as we focus on maximizing output to meet demand in the first half of the year. 
The fleet average module conversion efficiency in Q2 was 16.2%, which was unchanged from the prior quarter, but increased 80 basis points year-over-year. Our best line conversion efficiency was also unchanged from Q1 at 16.4%, but increased by 20 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. Most recently, our lead line has been running at 16.7% efficiency. And we're encouraged by our progress towards our target of 17% lead line efficiency at the end of the year. 
Turning to Slide 11. I'll discuss P&L results for the second quarter. Net sales are $934 million for the quarter compared to $848 million in Q1. The sales increase resulted from higher third-party module sales, the sale of our Kingbird project and higher revenue recognition across various systems projects. Partially offsetting the higher sales was lower revenue recognized in our Silver State South and Stateline projects, which reached to a near-completion in Q2. The higher module sales were driven by shipments to projects in Dubai and the Southeastern U.S. 
In relation to our Kingbird project, it should be noted that this project sale was structured with a tax equity partner with the residual cash interest sold to 8point3 Energy Partners, which resulted in a different accounting treatment as compared to our historical project sale. As a result of the transaction structure, whereby First Solar provides an indemnity relating to the tax equity structuring, only a portion of the revenue from the transaction was recognized and the entire profit of $20 million has been deferred on the balance sheet. 
If we have been able to recognize the entire transaction in Q2, our gross margin would have improved by approximately 80 basis points and earnings per share would have increased by approximately $0.16. It's important to keep in mind that the underlying economic substance of the transaction was very favorable, but under current real estate accounting, it is not reflected in the current period results. Also, note that all cash related to the project sale both from tax equity and 8point3 was received. 
Continuing on, as a percent to total quarterly net sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, decreased to 83% from 93% in the prior quarter as a result of the higher mix of the module-only sales. Both margin for the quarter was 20% compared to 31% in the first quarter. The decrease in gross margin percentage resulted primarily from the mix of systems projects recognized between the quarters. 
As a reminder, in Q1, we sold an additional interest in the Stateline project, leading to a significantly higher mix of revenues from development projects in Q1. Q2 gross margin was also impacted by an $8.5 million charge associated with the write-down of TetraSun inventory. Adjusted for this item, second quarter gross margin would have improved by approximately 90 basis points. 
Our component segment gross margin decreased slightly to 24% in the second quarter compared to 29% in Q1. The decrease was primarily due to the geographical mix of sales, partially offset by a decrease in our module cost per watt. We're very encouraged by our progress in reducing our module cost per watt through efficiency improvements, increased throughput and bill of material reductions. 
Operating expenses, excluding restructuring asset impairment charges, were $97 million in Q2, a decrease of $1 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due to lower employee-related costs, partially offset by higher R&D expenses for development of our Series 5 technology.  
Restructuring and asset impairment charges totaled $86 million in the quarter, primarily related to TetraSun. As indicated in our recent press release, we anticipate total charges of up to $100 million, substantially all of which is expected to be noncash. We expect operating expense savings of $2 million to $4 million this year and $8 million to $10 million on an annual basis going forward. 
Operating income was $9 million for the second quarter or $94 million adjusted for restructuring. Prior quarter operating income was $165 million.  Other income was $7 million in the second quarter compared to $36 million in Q1. The current quarter income was primarily related to a reversal of outstanding contingent consideration associated with the TetraSun acquisition. Other income in the prior quarter was primarily due to a $38 million gain from the sale of rebalancing certain restricted investments associated with our modular end-of-life program. 
Tax expense for Q2 was $9 million and the effective tax rate was unusually high due to the impact of restructuring. Adjusted for the restructuring and asset impairment charges, the tax rate for the quarter would have been more in line with the full year guidance tax range. Also, note that while not in our Q2 results, during July, we received a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority which will result in a tax benefit of $35 million in our Q3 result.
Q2 earnings were $0.13 to fully diluted share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 from a non-GAAP basis. This compares to earnings of $1.66 in the prior quarter. The non-GAAP EPS does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. Please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS reconciliation.  Nonrecurring charges aside, which were primarily from TetraSun, Q2 was another strong quarter of financial performance, and we're pleased with our progress in the first half of the year. 
Continuing on to Slide 12, I'll discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Cash and marketable securities decreased $213 million to an ending balance of $1.7 billion. Our net cash position also decreased to $1.4 billion. Cash decreased from the prior quarter due to ongoing construction of projects on balance sheet, capital expenditures and debt repayments. 
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, was virtually unchanged. The decrease in project-related assets due to the sale of Kingbird and the reclassification of certain projects in Chile and India to the PV solar power systems was largely offset by an increase in unbilled AR. The Luz del Norte project was reclassified as it has been placed in service, and we anticipate holding the asset for several years, pending transmission upgrades in Chile. The increase in unbilled AR is expected to decline in Q3 as billing milestones are reached. 
Total debt decreased $66 million from the prior quarter, $233 million, primarily due to the $70 million repayment of the remaining balance on our Malaysia debt facilities. The remaining debts outstanding is comprised of $163 million of limited or nonrecourse project level debt and $70 million of recourse project level debt, the majority of which is a short-term VAT loan associated with our Luz del Norte asset. 
Cash flows used in operations were $75 million compared to cash flows from operations of $50 million in the first quarter. Free cash flow is negative $140 million compared to positive free cash flow of $13 million last quarter. Capital expenditures were $78 million as compared to $52 million in the prior quarter, as we increased investments in our Series 5 technology. Depreciation for the quarter was $53 million or approximately $2 million lower than the prior quarter. 
Before turning to our updated guidance for the year, we summarized on Slide 13 the expected impact of restructuring charges and the associated future benefits from these actions. 
Firstly, as indicated, the total expected charges associated with both the TetraSun and other restructuring announcement is between $105 million and $120 million, the majority of which is noncash. Of the $90 million to $100 million of TetraSun charges, we incurred approximately $86 million in Q2 with the remainder expected to be incurred in the second half of 2016. The charges associated with our EPC and skytron restructuring are expected to be in a range of $15 million to $20 million and are expected to occur primarily in the third and fourth quarters. 
Going forward, we expect total annual savings related to these actions of $60 million to $80 million, of which $55 million to $65 million are cash savings. Annualized OpEx savings associated with these actions are expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. Note that due to the timing of the restructuring, we expect limited OpEx savings in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 14, I'll now discuss the updates of our full year 2016 guidance. Overall, the changes to our full year non-GAAP guidance, which excludes restructuring, are relatively minor. While the first half of the year results have been strong, we continue to take a measured approach to guidance for the time being, given uncertainties in the second half of the year. In particular, we anticipate closing the sale of the Moapa asset, our California flat asset and our remaining 34% interest in the Stateline asset. As we progress further into the third quarter, we'll have greater visibility into these various project sales dynamic. 
Relative to Stateline, our guidance assumption continues to anticipate dropping our remaining 34% interest in the project to 8point3, subject to market conditions. To the extent that we do sell all 34% of our interest in 2016, this would likely result in earnings above the midpoint of our guidance. We will also continue to evaluate the potential to sell a portion of our remaining interest in Stateline in 2017, dependent upon developments in our business during the second half of the year, as well as based on market conditions relating to 8point3. 
Turning to our guidance ranges. Our net sales forecast is unchanged at $3.8 billion to $4 billion. We're bringing up the low end of our gross margin guidance to a revised range of 18.5% to 19% compared to the prior range of 18% to 19%. This update is a result of the significant project cost savings achieved in the second quarter. Note that as previously discussed, the net sales range in gross margin guidance include only a portion of the revenue and none of the deferred profit from the Kingbird sale. Our GAAP operating expenses are projected in the range of $485 million to $520 million for the year. This includes the $105 million to $120 million of restructuring associated charges. 
Our non-GAAP operating expense guidance, excluding those restructuring and asset impairment charges, is unchanged at $380 million to $400 million. We're leaving the range unchanged as 2015 OpEx reductions are expected to be limited given the timing of the announced restructuring and are offset by earlier-than-planned production start-up expenses from the Series 5 acceleration and from incremental R&D for Series 6. 
Improvement in the gross margin has been flowed through to the low end of our non-GAAP operating income guidance, which has been raised to $310 million. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 16% to 18%. This projected tax range excludes the impact of all restructuring actions and also excludes the impact of the $35 million tax benefit mentioned previously. 
Moving on to EPS guidance. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings in the range of $3.65 to $3.90. Excluding restructuring charges, the low end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance is range to $4.20, with the upper bound unchanged at $4.50. The impact to EPS from the expected sale of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar share of 8point3's earnings remains unchanged at approximately $145 million net of tax.  
Additionally, approximately $0.20 of other income, net of tax, is included in the earnings guidance range from the previously discussed Q1 sale of the restricted investments. Also, keep in mind that the EPS guidance does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. The distribution of earnings for the remainder of the year is anticipated to be slightly more weighted towards the fourth quarter due to the timing of expected project sales. 
Operating cash flow has been reduced to $500 million to $650 million from the prior range of $500 million to $700 million, reflecting the expected impact of cash restructuring charges. Again, the operating cash flow range does not include approximately $320 million from the expected sale of the remaining interest in Stateline, which we expect to treat as an investing cash flow. 
Our capital expenses guidance has been revised to a range of $275 million to $325 million from the previous range of $300 million to $400 million, reflecting a change in timing of expected spend. Adjustment to timing has no impact in our planned efficiency road map and Series 5 product launch. The net results of these changes leaves our net cash balance unchanged at $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'll now summarize our progress during the past quarter. Firstly, our financial results for the second quarter was strong with revenue of $934 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.87. We updated our 2016 non-GAAP earnings guidance range to $4.20 to $4.50. Our technology performance is progressing towards the goal that we outlined in our April Analyst Day with a best line efficiency currently running at 16.7%. And our year-to-date bookings are now 1.4 gigawatts with over 800 megawatts booked since our last earnings call. The number of potential bookings opportunities continues to grow and is now over 24 gigawatts.

We're still very pleased with the margin realization that we're capturing. We are being very disciplined, though, and engaging and making sure that we're capturing full value of our technology. So if you use India as an example, it's a market that our technology is competitively advantaged. It's a hot, humid climate. We have a superior spectral response and that can command an energy advantage over crystalline silicon. Plus, it's mainly fixed tilt structures in India which is, again, more advantage for our Series 4 product than, say, a tracker solution. Plus, we have a number of self-developed projects in India and the returns of what we're capturing against the sell-down -- our anticipated sell-down of those projects are in line with what we would normally expect, and even in some cases, on the upper end of our expectation. We've been very pleased with the ultimate performance of those assets. Having said that, is the market becoming more competitive? I mean, it clearly is. We're seeing a lot of very aggressive pricing behavior in the market, whether it's at the PPA level or whether it's at the module level. And that's why we have to be disciplined and selective in engaging with customers and developing relationships to ensure we can capture the full value of the offers and the value creation that we provide to our partners and customers. So we are being disciplined in that regard and we're seeing a very more aggressive market environment, there's no doubt about that. And that's what's also informed our view around capacity expansion and why we are being disciplined as we think about when will I add capacity and will -- as we indicated in our prepared remarks, that we'll continue to assess that as we move forward. As it relates to near term, our focus is converting all of our capacity into Series 5. So we want all our Series 4 product into Series 5 as quickly as possible. And our current time line would indicate that that would happen in the end of 2017. We'll continue then also to validate the business case around Series 6. And as we get more and more -- and have a better understanding and realization of the current views around Series 6, we will start to think about how do we add capacity and the associated timing around that. So I would say for now, again, near-term focus moving Series 4 to Series 5. As we get better information and validate Series 6, that will kind of determine the timing around when do we start to add incremental capacity."

I'll let Alex take the question around how we're thinking through timing of activities between '17 and '16. As it relates to margin realization, similarly, I think highlighted in the Analyst Day, and especially when you start looking at our contract pipeline, in particular, the margin profile, it will start on the lower end of the range in '17 and then continue to improve as we move through the balance of this decade, primarily because as we transition into Series 5, it's a much more competitive product. And when we look at right now for Series 5 capacity in 2017, it's probably going to be right around 1 gigawatt, which means we have about 2 gigawatts of Series 4 product that we're going to have to sell through. We also indicated in the comments today that the value of that delta and form factor as it relates to lower labor costs, fewer connectors, better water management through elimination of clips, isn't worth over 100 basis points of equivalent efficiency. So what you should think about is our margin profile in '17 is going to be on the lower end. It's mainly because 2/3 of our production volume is still going to be Series 4. As we transition that into Series 5, and then really get to the position of equivalent form factor and really capturing full value of our energy advantages, you'll see margin expansion as we go into '18 and '19 and '20."

We have about 400 megawatts of systems business already positioned for 2017. We have a pipeline that would move us towards closing that out and getting 2 gigawatt expectation for 2017 for that other 600 megawatts or so. We're still working through those. There are a couple in there that I would say that -- not around the economics, the economics are very compelling. There are some issues around structuring of the PPAs and overall bankability of those PPAs. As you indicated already some of these are international markets where we're just trying to work through in making sure they are clearly financeable and bankable, so there are some challenges in that regard. But what I would say is there's a sufficient pipeline of projects that would enable us to get to our goal of having 1 gigawatt of systems business in 2017. The other aspect that we continue to be very mindful of and very disciplined on is making sure that we get proper return on capital given the risk profile of doing the international development business, right? In some markets, pricing has gotten very aggressive, so we have to be careful in that regard. So we'll be balanced, making sure that the return on capital is just as commensurate with the underlying risk associated with those opportunities. But I would say, in aggregate, we're still very happy with the robustness of our pipeline to get to our goal next year of 1 gigawatt of systems business. On the Stateline discussion, I'll take that one and I'll let Alex take the question on Moapa. When you get the Q, which would be available tomorrow you'll see -- I think it will say effectively 96% or somewhere in the upper 90s as Stateline has been completed through the second quarter. So the vast majority of the revenue that was related to the sale to Southern has now been recognized through Q2. We have about 4% of that left and the project will achieve DOD in the third quarter."

Some of those, I would argue in some cases, it's questionable whether or not they're going to be viable or able to be achieved. But there's a pretty long runway to delivering against some of the assets that go out into 2019, 2020 time frame or potentially later than that. So clearly, PPA prices have come down. I don't know if it's directly related to -- I wouldn't sort of position it as being directly related to our advantages, in our advancements, in our road map, in our form factor and efficiency. The other day, we're competing against crystalline silicon, so it's really relative to the alternative technology that's in the marketplace. And so to the extent that we create separation relative to crystalline silicon, that value should accrete back to First Solar. I would also say that there is a very strong bias in the marketplace for more and more customers and developers and partners coming to First Solar first. We've got a number of parties who historically, over the years, have moved away from First Solar that are coming back to First Solar. And we've also got a number of other partners that are starting to come to discussions with First Solar that we sort of -- we have never had conversations with. And I do think that is related to our road map and our technology and understanding where First Solar is going to go long term with our capability, not only on the module side but as indicated before with MVDC and the advantages of that creates for the balance of system costs and just general learnings around VSO and optimization and wire management and a lot of things that we're doing to drive down a lot of cost. We're getting more and more interest from other parties to want to do more business with First Solar. So clearly a trend lower PPA. But not to the extent that when I look at where the PPA pricing is going, that I'm concerned relative to what we can personally do with our overall cost reduction road map. I just said as a relevant data point, just on the module alone year-on-year, our reduction on our module cost has been in the mid to upper teens. So in the last 12 months, we've taken mid to upper teens type of cost out of our module, which is extremely impactful and competitive, and ultimately creates an opportunity to have robust margins against the contracted pipeline that we've created."

We are still able to command a premium for our technology. That's why we try to focus on markets where we're more significantly advanced. I mean we even referenced in our prepared remarks Zambia, right? So there was an opportunity in Zambia for 50 megawatts. It's a hot, humid climate, which is an advantage for our technology. So what we're doing globally is looking at pockets of strength. We're trying to manage with constraining ourself on available capacity, at least at this point in time, especially as it relates to Series 4.

And clearly, there is -- the positive side there is a clear understanding globally of kind of the demand elasticity around solar and competitiveness of solar in many different markets, and that's driving a demand that obviously is very encouraging. There's also -- the offsetting side of that is there is quite a bit of capacity that is being added -- or plan to be added, maybe is the better way to say that, but that could change very quickly as well. I mean, as people think about the market opportunities and what they're willing to sell through and what ultimately is sustainable, the planned announcements that have been communicated may or may not happen.

Or I would say though is that, we always knew that '17 would be a challenging year especially as we saw margins declined from our more lucrative legacy contract as they rolled off. The ITC extension in 2016 came too late to influence 2017. So that's why we think it's incredibly important that we see both the transition towards higher module business in '17 but also the product from Series 4 to Series 5. The other thing I'd refer you back to is the Analyst Day when we talked about what our long-term contracted pipeline looks like. Back then we'd spoke about having over 2.5 gigawatts of contracted assets after 2017 with north of $1 billion of contracted margin entitlement. But if you look at that, combine that with -- even without capacity expansion another 7 or so gigawatts of modules to sell, I would expect some of that volume to be incremental systems as well as modules. When you combine that with executing on the cost reduction road map and our OpEx coming down, I think we look to see beyond '17 having acceptable and robust margins across the new products. '17 itself is somewhat opaque today and we'll give better guidance around that towards the end of the year."

And some of the announcements that have come out here recently, and now people are thinking about, and especially in the U.S, opportunity to procure in '17 that gets me more encouraging. As I look at some of these international opportunities and especially the challenges, in some cases to these -- some of the PPAs, as I indicated to get them to be financeable, that sort of the sways me the other way. But I would say on balance, we feel that we will get to, whether it's 850 or 900, it's going to be within a ZIP Code that's going to be close to that gigawatt of volume business for next year. So I'd say there's reasonable level of comfort from that standpoint. On the margin guidance, I think the best way to handle this, as Alex already said, we're not going to get into the specifics of that right now. There's still many moving pieces that we would rather wait until we do our guidance call in December. And what I would also continue to point you to is that, whatever that view is and when we communicate that in December, I don't think we should look at it as a discrete data point as indicative of a long-term earnings potential of First Solar. The '17 margin profile, especially as we indicated with Series 4, still being the predominant product in our platform. It's going to drive a little bit of margin pressure, there's no doubt about that. But that's a temporary issue that corrects itself in the second half of '17 and then is completely fixed by the end of '17 where we got form factor that's consistent with crystalline silicon and driving towards a 390 watt panel that -- with all of the energy advantages that we talked about around CdTe. So when you look at -- through that horizon, we feel very confident about what we're going with our technology and ultimately the competitiveness of our products. Around the component gross margin, there's an element of spot and it's also the -- it's an indication of contracted volume, so it's a combination of the 2. As we indicated this quarter, as an example, over half of our bookings that we recorded of our 800 megawatts or so were not in our late-stage development pipeline, which means that those were transaction since the last earnings call that we've gone out and we've negotiated around pricing in a very short period of time and then close those orders. And a high percentage of that volume will shift this year and those margins that will be realized against those shipments will be in line with what we're currently reflecting in our components segments today. And as they also indicated, if you just look at our module cost delta, year-on-year, we've seen high-teens, upper teen cost reduction on our module just in the last 12 months. And the team continues to make tremendous progress in that side of the house. So we're able to, as best we can, sort of manage that price cost battle. But we also do it in a way that we're trying to be selective of where we're selling through and to make sure we're targeting markets so we get the highest value for our products."

Also, we're taking is our existing platform and we're converting it into a different product, right, that is optimized around a lot of management and some other things along those lines. And so it's not really a significant CapEx. We're going to finish this year somewhere around $2 billion of cash as we exit the year. Series 5 in and of itself is not going to drive a significant delta to that number as we deploy that capacity or conversion of product Series 4 into Series 5 product in 2017. I'm not sure I got your last question. Can you repeat your last question?"

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Before reviewing the results for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on some key strategic priorities and how I intend to lead the organization in my new role as CEO. In our deci",2490,"Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Before reviewing the results for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on some key strategic priorities and how I intend to lead the organization in my new role as CEO. In our decision making, we will continue to apply the same disciplined approach to long-term strategy that has served us extremely well to date. 
At various times over the past several years, some have questioned our measured approach to key strategic decisions including capacity expansion, asset ownership and balance sheet utilization.  However, we continue to see the benefits of our disciplined strategy and are confident this approach will optimize shareholder value over the long term. This approach also allows us to be nimble and navigate an industry that is cyclical, high growth and dynamic. The updates I provide today do not constitute any major strategic changes from what we discussed earlier this year at our Analyst Day in April but are further refinements aimed at simplifying and focusing our business. 
The core of our overall strategy continues to be our differentiated cad tel technology and its tremendous potential for further conversion efficiency improvements. Closely aligned to our module efficiency road map is the evolution of our module form factor, which as we indicated in April, will begin next year with the introduction of our Series 5 module. Our Series 4 technology is an outstanding product with a superior temperature coefficient, spectral gain and shading response. Series 4 holds an energy density advantage over multi-crystalline silicon products. 
Series 5 retains the energy density advantage of our cad tel technology, further boosts efficiency and is optimized for cost-effective installations. To put this into perspective, in a typical market, the reduction in Series 5 BoS costs relative to Series 4, will be equivalent to boosting module efficiency by approximately 100 basis points. The combination of these factors make this a powerful new product, which is supported by positive initial feedback from our customers and partners. 
Given the exciting potential of this product, we are now planning to invest in additional efficiency improvements over the next couple of years that will take the Series 5 road map to a 391 module versus the 365-watt module we introduced at the Analyst Day. The competitive position of the Series 5 390-watt module with a similar form factor to crystalline silicon but with the inherent energy advantage of cad tel is very exciting. Moreover, the substantial increase to the Series 5 road map has an extremely compelling return on investment. The estimated $60 million of capital expenditures that we will require to enable this efficiency gain across our current 3 gigawatts of production will result in anticipated payback time of less than a year. 
The focusing on increasing Series 5 efficiency does not change the priority we are placing on Series 6. We continue to push pace the Series 6 development as fast as possible with power plant production beginning in 2018. It should be noted that we intend to prioritize long-term investment in the production and development of Series 5 and Series 6 technologies over adding new manufacturing capacity in the short term. In light of the current supply demand dynamics in the global solar market, we will continue to evaluate the point in time in which adding the additional capacity makes sense. 
As we eagerly look forward to these exciting technologies, some strategic realignments are necessary to ensure focused and seamless execution. Firstly, as we recently announced, we have decided to discontinue TetraSun production in order to maximize our Series 5 assembly capabilities at our facility in Malaysia. This not only enables a more rapid roll-out of Series 5 product next year, but also allows us to focus more resources and capital on our cad tel road map. Secondly, the new Series 5 form factor will significantly broaden spectrum of third-party structures and tracker technologies available for use with our modules without requiring First Solar specific components. Previously, the different form factor of our Series 4 technology led us to develop optimized in-house solutions. The new interoperability of Series 5 with the broad global ecosystem of existing third-party structure products is expected to facilitate increased adoption of our module by new customers and increased market opportunities. The evolution of our module form factor allows us to tap into a broader and deeper supply chain for structures and trackers. And we have therefore decided to discontinue substantial internal development of fixed tilt and tracker structures. This decision allows us to refocus resources towards developing closer relationships with industry-leading structure and tracker technology providers, and at the same time, eliminate some of the channel conflicts that existed in certain situations today. 
Thirdly, the progression of the interoperability of our modules also impacts our strategy as it relates to EPC capabilities. Historically, we have self-performed EPC on the majority of our system projects as well as provide EPC services to third-party developers using First Solar module technology. The evolution of our module form factor, combined with the lower volume of system projects in 2017, implies a reduced need for internal EPC services and requires a reduction in our EPC work force. 
While these decisions are difficult and will impact a number of dedicated associates, this is a necessary step. We will continue to maintain sufficient internal EPC resources to support the construction of our self-developed projects. This allows us to continue to provide comprehensive solutions to our customers and also enables continued development of next-generation BoS technologies such as MVDC, which we introduced at our Analyst Day. 
It should be clear that this decision around EPC can no way impact our product development business and in fact allows us to allocate more capital and focus more resources on this critical aspect of our business model. 
Lastly, as part of our refocusing efforts, we have also decided to explore options for the disposition of skytron energy. Our original intent in acquiring skytron was to expand our global O&M footprint into Europe and supplement our existing capabilities. Over the past 2 years, competition for O&M contracts in Europe, combined with  progression of First Solar's internal O&M capability, particularly as it relates to smaller-scale solar plants, has changed how skytron fits into our strategy going forward. 
Altogether, we expect charges of $105 million to $120 million related to TetraSun and the actions we are announcing today. On an annual basis going forward, the total reductions and operating expense and cost of sales is expected to be $60 million to $80 million. Alex will provide more detail on these charges and associated savings. While these decisions are difficult for part of our organization, these actions will best position First Solar to increase its competitive position over the next several years. We are excited about the potential of our Series 5 and Series 6 technologies and are well positioned with the resources and capabilities necessary to execute on our plans. 
With that, let's return -- let's turn to our results. Our financial results for the quarter were strong with net sales of over $930 million and non-GAAP earnings per share excluding restructuring charges of $0.87. These results were underpinned by continuing execution across both our module manufacturing and system project portfolio. 
Our module lead line efficiency is currently running at 16.7% and we continue to lower our cost per watt. We completed our Silver State South and McCoy projects in Q2 and are nearing completion of the Stateline project. We recognize significant cost savings on these projects in the quarter as a result of our outstanding execution. Alex will discuss the financial results for the quarter in more detail. 
Moving on to Slide 5, I'll provide an update on our latest bookings activity. In the second quarter, we shipped close to 750 megawatts of modules, bringing our year-to-date total as of June 30 to 1.6 gigawatts. Against these shipments, we have booked approximately 1.4 gigawatts year-to-date, including the period up to today's call. 
I'll now provide some more details on the approximate 800 megawatts of bookings since our last earnings call. In the U.S., we have signed PPAs for 2 projects totaling over 100 megawatts DC -- 180 megawatts DC with a leading Western utility. These projects have CODs in 2019 and 2020, which now brings our total projects with executed PPAs with CODs in 2019 or later to over 1.2 gigawatts DC, which are ideally suited for the competitively advantaged Series 5, Series 6 and MVDC. As evidenced by these bookings, we continue to see many encouraging signs for solar demand over the long-term horizon. 
Beyond these project bookings, we continue to have active discussions with both utilities and C&I customers seeking large-scale solar power supply. The interest in C&I customers is particularly strong with these customers typically looking for renewables to meet up to 100% of their energy supply needs. We see this opportunity as a key market focus and have a dedicated team specifically working with these customers to provide comprehensive solutions that meet their needs. 
In the U.S., we are also encouraged by the increasing demand for community solar solutions, a market segment that we continue to view as having tremendous potential to meet residential and customer -- commercial customers' need at a dramatically lower cost than rooftop solar. 
Underscoring the growth potential for community solar, a third-party research firm recently estimated that community solar's addressable market is more than 7x as large as rooftop solar. Thus far in 2016, we have booked over 120 megawatts DC of volume that will supply more the 25 different community solar projects across multiple states. Majority of this volume is with a single customer where we continue to see opportunities to collaborate on future community solar projects. 
An initial 41 megawatts project is underway with M+W as the EPC contractor. To put the 120 megawatts of bookings in perspective, once this volume has been installed, it will effectively double the amount of cumulative community solar installations in the U.S. We are pleased with the recent progress and continue to work with various customers to capture the growing community solar opportunity in the U.S. Elsewhere in the United States, we booked modest supply agreements for over 80 megawatts DC in diverse solar markets such as Idaho and North Carolina. 
Internationally, we have bookings in India and have been strong with over 280 megawatts DC of new bookings. The volume booked was a combination of both module supply agreements and 60 megawatts AC of PPAs. These latest PPAs bring our current development pipeline in India to 260 megawatts AC. Altogether, we have booked approximately 250 megawatts DC of systems project this quarter with approximately 1/3 of the volume scheduled for 2017 deliveries. 
Relative to our expectations for the 1 gigawatt of systems business in 2017, we have approximately 400 megawatts DC of contracted projects with additional projects added. We have visibility to a number of additional potential booking opportunities that we continue to pursue towards the 1 gigawatt total. As we bid on future PPAs, we will continue to maintain our discipline and leverage our strengths in bidding opportunities. In situations where we engage early in the process with key partners and leverage the strength of our new Series 5 technology into the offering, we feel that we are extremely competitive. 
In addition to the 800 megawatts of bookings in the past quarter, we have also been awarded opportunities of over 410 megawatts DC, which we expect to convert into bookings during the remainder of this year. Firstly, in Zambia, along with our partner NEOEN, we were awarded 53 megawatts DC power plant, which is expected to deliver the lowest-cost solar electricity in sub-Sahara Africa. The energy density advantage of our cad tel module is particularly strong in this type of hot and humid climate and allows us to provide extremely competitive solar solutions. 
The remaining awarded volume of approximately 357 megawatts DC pertains to module supply agreements in France, Israel, India and Thailand.  In France, we were pleased with the results of the most recent tender process where we're awarded over 100 megawatts of volume. As these awarded projects are converted into bookings, we will discuss them in more detail on future earnings call. 
Moving on Slide 6. Our bookings in expected revenue term stands at $6 billion, a decrease of $900 million from the end of last year. The decrease in expected revenue is a result of the higher mix of module-only business booked as compared to a higher mix of system revenue recognized year-to-date. In addition, it's also driven by lower ASPs associated with some of the longer dated PPAs included in our bookings. While ASPs on these longer-dated PPAs are naturally lower than on project we are currently constructing, there is still an expectation of attractive margins on these projects, given our efficiency in cost road maps discussed at our Analyst Day earlier this year. 
Slide 7 provides an update of potential bookings opportunities, which has grown to 24 megawatts DC, an increase of approximately 700 megawatts from the prior quarter. Our mid to late-stage booking opportunities are 1.8 gigawatts with international opportunities again comprising close to 9% of this number. Note that over 400 megawatts of awarded but not booked volume discussed earlier in this presentation is included in this 1.8 gigawatts. Also, it is important to note, as the number of third-party modules sales opportunities and our potential bookings number has increased over time, we are beginning to see an increase in the velocity at which these projects can move from early-stage opportunities to confirmed bookings. For instance, more than half of our bookings during the past quarter were in early-stage opportunities at the time of our Q1 call. 
Turning to Slide 8. While North America remains our largest geography at over 40% of the total, we continue to have a diversified geographic mix of potential booking opportunities. The largest region -- no, increases since the last call were in the United States and India, where we saw significant growth and opportunities from the prior quarter. We are encouraged by the expanding pipeline in both of these regions given our historical win rate, reflective of our energy density and the mix of system and module sales. 
One last point to keep in mind is the timing of bookings can be very uneven. For example, in the first 6 months of the year, our bookings total was only 800 megawatts. However, in the past month alone, we have added close to 600 megawatts. We continue to aggressively pursue new opportunities while working diligently to close those projects nearing the finish line, including the over 400 megawatts AC awarded volume previously mentioned, but the timing of when this occurs can be lumpy. 
I'll now turn it over to Alex, who will provide more detail in our second quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

I'll begin with some highlights of our operational performance during the past quarter. In Q2, we produced 785 megawatts DC, or an increase of 1% from the prior quarter, resulting from higher module efficiencies and increased throughput. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, production was 39% higher as a result of higher efficiencies, improved throughput and the addition of new capacity. 
Our factory capacity utilization was unchanged at 100% in Q2 versus the prior quarter, but increased by 15 percentage points versus the same period in 2015. The higher year-over-year capacity utilization was due to fewer efficiency upgrade activities in Q2 as we focused on maximizing output to meet demand in the first half of the year. 
The fleet average module conversion efficiency in Q2 was 16.2%, which was unchanged from the prior quarter, but increased 80 basis points year-over-year. Our best line conversion efficiency was also unchanged from Q1 at 16.4%, but increased by 20 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. Most recently, our lead line has been running at 16.7% efficiency. And we're encouraged by our progress towards our target of 17% lead line efficiency at the end of the year. 
Turning to Slide 11. I'll discuss P&L results for the second quarter. Net sales are $934 million for the quarter compared to $848 million in Q1. The sales increase resulted from higher third-party module sales, the sale of our Kingbird project and higher revenue recognition across various systems projects. Partially offsetting the higher sales was lower revenue recognized in our Silver State South and Stateline projects, which reached to a near-completion in Q2. The higher module sales were driven by shipments to projects in Dubai and the Southeastern U.S. 
In relation to our Kingbird project, it should be noted that this project sale was structured with a tax equity partner with the residual cash interest sold to 8point3 Energy Partners, which resulted in a different accounting treatment as compared to our historical project sales. As a result of the transaction structure, whereby First Solar provides an indemnity relating to the tax equity structuring, only a portion of the revenue from the transaction was recognized and the entire profit of $20 million has been deferred on the balance sheet. 
If we have been able to recognize the entire transaction in Q2, our gross margin would have improved by approximately 80 basis points and earnings per share would have increased by approximately $0.16. It's important to keep in mind that the underlying economic substance of the transaction was very favorable, but under current real estate accounting, it is not reflected in the current period results. Also, note that all cash related to the project sale both from tax equity and 8point3 was received. 
Continuing on, as a percentage of total quarterly net sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, decreased to 83% from 93% in the prior quarter as a result of the higher mix of module-only sales. Gross margin for the quarter was 20% compared to 31% in the first quarter. The decrease in gross margin percentage resulted primarily from the mix of systems projects recognized between the quarters. 
As a reminder, in Q1, we sold an additional interest in the Stateline project, leading to a significantly higher mix of revenues from development projects in Q1. Q2 gross margin was also impacted by an $8.5 million charge associated with the write-down of TetraSun inventory. Adjusted for this item, second quarter gross margin would have improved by approximately 90 basis points. 
Our component segment gross margin decreased slightly to 24% in the second quarter compared to 29% in Q1. The decrease was primarily due to the geographical mix of sales, partially offset by a decrease in our module cost per watt. We're very encouraged by our progress in reducing our module cost per watt through efficiency improvements, increased throughput and bill of material reductions. 
Operating expenses, excluding restructuring asset impairment charges, were $97 million in Q2, a decrease of $1 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due to lower employee-related costs, partially offset by higher R&D expenses for development of our Series 5 technology.  
Restructuring and asset impairment charges totaled $86 million in the quarter, primarily related to TetraSun. As indicated in our recent press release, we anticipate total charges of up to $100 million, substantially all of which is expected to be noncash. We expect operating expense savings of $2 million to $4 million this year and $8 million to $10 million on an annual basis going forward. 
Operating income was $9 million for the second quarter or $94 million adjusted for restructuring. Prior quarter operating income was $165 million.  Other income was $7 million in the second quarter compared to $36 million in Q1. The current quarter income was primarily related to a reversal of outstanding contingent consideration associated with the TetraSun acquisition. Other income in the prior quarter was primarily due to a $38 million gain from the sale of rebalancing certain restricted investments associated with our modular end-of-life program. 
Tax expense for Q2 was $9 million and the effective tax rate was unusually high due to the impact of restructuring. Adjusted for the restructuring and asset impairment charges, the tax rate for the quarter would have been more in line with the full year guidance tax range. Also, note that while not in our Q2 results, during July, we received a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority which will result in a tax benefit of $35 million in our Q3 results.
Q2 earnings were $0.13 to fully diluted share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 on a non-GAAP basis. This compares to earnings of $1.66 in the prior quarter. The non-GAAP EPS does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. Please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS reconciliation.  Nonrecurring charges aside, which were primarily from TetraSun, Q2 was another strong quarter of financial performance, and we're pleased with our progress in the first half of the year. 
Continuing on to Slide 12, I'll discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Cash and marketable securities decreased $213 million to an ending balance of $1.7 billion. Our net cash position also decreased to $1.4 billion. Cash decreased from the prior quarter due to ongoing construction of projects on balance sheet, capital expenditures and debt repayments. 
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, was virtually unchanged. The decrease in project-related assets due to the sale of Kingbird and the reclassification of certain projects in Chile and India to the PV solar power systems was largely offset by an increase in unbilled AR. The Luz del Norte project was reclassified as it has been placed in service, and we anticipate holding the asset for several years, pending transmission upgrades in Chile. The increase in unbilled AR is expected to decline in Q3 as billing milestones are reached. 
Total debt decreased $66 million from the prior quarter to $233 million, primarily due to the $70 million repayment of the remaining balance on our Malaysia debt facilities. The remaining debts outstanding is comprised of $163 million of limited or nonrecourse project level debt and $70 million of recourse project level debt, the majority of which is a short-term VAT loan associated with our Luz del Norte asset. 
Cash flows used in operations were $75 million compared to cash flows from operations of $50 million in the first quarter. Free cash flow is negative $140 million compared to positive free cash flow of $13 million last quarter. Capital expenditures were $78 million as compared to $52 million in the prior quarter, as we increased investments in our Series 5 technology. Depreciation for the quarter was $53 million or approximately $2 million lower than the prior quarter. 
Before turning to our updated guidance for the year, we summarized on Slide 13 the expected impact of restructuring charges and the associated future benefits from these actions. 
Firstly, as indicated, the total expected charges associated with both the TetraSun and other restructuring announcements is between $105 million and $120 million, the majority of which is noncash. Of the $90 million to $100 million of TetraSun charges, we incurred approximately $86 million in Q2 with the remainder expected to be incurred in the second half of 2016. The charges associated with our EPC and skytron restructuring are expected to be in a range of $15 million to $20 million and are expected to occur primarily in the third and fourth quarters. 
Going forward, we expect total annual savings related to these actions of $60 million to $80 million, of which $55 million to $65 million are cash savings. Annualized OpEx savings associated with these actions are expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. Note that due to the timing of the restructuring, we expect limited OpEx savings in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 14, I'll now discuss the updates of our full year 2016 guidance. Overall, the changes to our full year non-GAAP guidance, which excludes restructuring, are relatively minor. While the first half of the year results have been strong, we continue to take a measured approach to guidance for the time being, given uncertainties in the second half of the year. In particular, we anticipate closing the sale of the Moapa asset, our California flat asset and our remaining 34% interest in the Stateline asset. As we progress further into the third quarter, we'll have greater visibility into these various project sales dynamics. 
Relative to Stateline, our guidance assumption continues to anticipate dropping our remaining 34% interest in the project to 8point3, subject to market conditions. To the extent that we do sell all 34% of our interest in 2016, this would likely result in earnings above the midpoint of our guidance. We will also continue to evaluate the potential to sell a portion of our remaining interest in Stateline in 2017, dependent upon developments in our own business during the second half of the year, as well as based on market conditions relating to 8point3. 
Turning to our guidance ranges. Our net sales forecast is unchanged at $3.8 billion to $4 billion. We're bringing up the low end of our gross margin guidance to a revised range of 18.5% to 19% compared to the prior range of 18% to 19%. This update is a result of the significant project cost savings achieved in the second quarter. Note that as previously discussed, the net sales range in gross margin guidance include only a portion of the revenue and none of the deferred profit from the Kingbird sale. Our GAAP operating expenses are projected in the range of $485 million to $520 million for the year. This includes the $105 million to $120 million of restructuring associated charges. 
Our non-GAAP operating expense guidance, excluding those restructuring and asset impairment charges, is unchanged at $380 million to $400 million. We're leaving the range unchanged as 2015 OpEx reductions are expected to be limited given the timing of the announced restructuring and are offset by earlier-than-planned production start-up expenses from the Series 5 acceleration and from incremental R&D for Series 6. 
Improvement in the gross margin has been flowed through to the low end of our non-GAAP operating income guidance, which has been raised to $310 million. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 16% to 18%. This projected tax range excludes the impact of all restructuring actions and also excludes the impact of the $35 million tax benefit mentioned previously. 
Moving on to EPS guidance. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings in the range of $3.65 to $3.90. Excluding restructuring charges, the low end of our non-GAAP EPS guidances range to $4.20, with the upper bound unchanged at $4.50. The impact to EPS from the expected sale of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar share of 8point3's earnings remains unchanged at approximately $145 million net of tax.  
Additionally, approximately $0.20 of other income, net of tax, is included in the earnings guidance range from the previously discussed Q1 sale of the restricted investments. Also, keep in mind that the EPS guidance does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. The distribution of earnings for the remainder of the year is anticipated to be slightly more weighted towards the fourth quarter due to the timing of expected project sales. 
Operating cash flow has been reduced to $500 million to $650 million from the prior range of $500 million to $700 million, reflecting the expected impact of cash restructuring charges. Again, the operating cash flow range does not include approximately $320 million from the expected sale of the remaining interest in Stateline, which we expect to treat as an investing cash flow. 
Our capital expenses guidance has been revised to a range of $275 million to $325 million from the previous range of $300 million to $400 million, reflecting a change in timing of expected spend. Adjustment to timing has no impact on our planned efficiency road map and Series 5 product launch. The net results of these changes leaves our net cash balance guidance unchanged at $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'll now summarize our progress during the past quarter. Firstly, our financial results for the second quarter was strong with revenue of $934 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.87. We updated our 2016 non-GAAP earnings guidance range to $4.20 to $4.50. Our technology performance is progressing towards the goal that we outlined in our April Analyst Day with a best line efficiency currently running at 16.7%. And our year-to-date bookings are now 1.4 gigawatts with over 800 megawatts booked since our last earnings call. The number of potential bookings opportunities continues to grow and is now over 24 gigawatts. 
With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

We're still very pleased with the margin realization that we're capturing. We are being very disciplined, though, and engaging and making sure that we're capturing full value of our technology. So if you use India as an example, it's a market that our technology is competitively advantaged. It's a hot, humid climate. We have a superior spectral response and that can command an energy advantage over crystalline silicon. Plus, it's mainly fixed tilt structures in India which is, again, more advantage for our Series 4 product than, say, a tracker solution. Plus, we have a number of self-developed projects in India and the returns of what we're capturing against the sell-down -- our anticipated sell-down of those projects are in line with what we would normally expect, and even in some cases, on the upper end of our expectation. We've been very pleased with the ultimate performance of those assets. Having said that, is the market becoming more competitive? I mean, it clearly is. We're seeing a lot of very aggressive pricing behavior in the market, whether it's at the PPA level or whether it's at the module level. And that's why we have to be disciplined and selective in engaging with customers and developing relationships to ensure we can capture the full value of the offers and the value creation that we provide to our partners and our customers. So we are being disciplined in that regard and we are seeing a very aggressive market environment, there's no doubt about that. And that's what's also informed our view around capacity expansion and why we are being disciplined as we think about when will I add capacity and will -- as we indicated in our prepared remarks, that we'll continue to assess that as we move forward. As it relates to near term, our focus is converting all of our capacity into Series 5. So we want all our Series 4 product into Series 5 as quickly as possible. And our current timeline would indicate that, that would happen in the end of 2017. We'll continue then also to validate the business case around Series 6. And as we get more informed and have a better understanding and realization of the current views around Series 6, we will start to think about how do we add capacity and the associated timing around that. So I would say for now, again, near-term focus moving Series 4 to Series 5. As we get better information and validate Series 6, that will kind of determine the timing around when do we start to add incremental capacity."

As it relates to margin realization, similarly, I think highlighted in the Analyst Day, and especially when you start looking at our contracted pipeline, in particular, the margin profile, it will start on the lower end of the range in '17 and then continue to improve as we move through the balance of this decade, primarily because as we transition into Series 5, it's a much more competitive product. And when we look at right now for Series 5 capacity in 2017, it's probably going to be right around 1 gigawatt, which means we have about 2 gigawatts of Series 4 product that we're going to have to sell through. We also indicated in the comments today that the value of that delta and form factor as it relates to lower labor costs, fewer connectors, better wire management through elimination of clips, isn't worth over 100 basis points of equivalent efficiency. So what you should think about is our margin profile in '17 is going to be on the lower end. It's mainly because 2/3 of our production volume is still going to be Series 4. As we transition that into Series 5, and then really get to the position of equivalent form factor and really capturing full value of our energy advantages, you'll see margin expansion as we go into '18 and '19 and '20."

I'd say along with both Moapa and Cal Flats, there's still significant uncertainty around the structure and the ultimate value of those sales. So in terms of our guidance, we're remaining conservative as we continue to develop those structures. The Stateline sale is really dependent on the other 2 deals as well as market conditions relating to the yield curve. So we'll make that decision in Q3 or Q4. We do have the flexibility with Stateline to push some of that into '17, if needed."

And then separately, I know you alluded to this, but on Moapa, it sounds like the expectation is that you do sell the project in its entirety this year in Q4, but are you exploring different options of monetization similar to what you've done with Stateline now that you've taken it off the 8point3 ROFO list?"

We have about 400 megawatts of systems business already positioned for 2017. We have a pipeline that would move us towards closing that out and getting to gigawatt expectation for 2017 for that other 600 megawatts or so. We're still working through those. There are a couple in there that I would say that -- not around the economics, the economics are very compelling. There are some issues around structuring of the PPAs and overall bankability of those PPAs. As you indicated already some of these are international markets where we're just trying to work through in making sure they're clearly financeable and bankable, so there are some challenges in that regard. But what I would say is there's a sufficient pipeline of projects that would enable us to get to our goal of having a gigawatt of systems business in 2017. The other aspect that we continue to be very mindful of and very disciplined on is making sure that we get proper return on capital given the risk profile of doing international development business, right? In some markets, pricing has gotten very aggressive, so we have to be careful in that regard. So we'll be balanced, making sure that the return on capital is just as commensurate with the underlying risk associated with those opportunities. But I would say, in aggregate, we're still very happy with the robustness of our pipeline to get to our goal next year of a gigawatt of systems business. On the Stateline discussion, I'll take that one and I'll let Alex take the question on Moapa. When you get the Q, which would be available tomorrow you'll see -- I think it will say effectively 96% or somewhere in the upper 90s as Stateline has been completed through the second quarter. So the vast majority of the revenue that was related to the sale to Southern has now been recognized through Q2. We have about 4% of that left and the project will achieve DOD in the third quarter."

Some of those, I would argue in some cases, is questionable whether or not they're going to be viable or able to be achieved. But there's a pretty long runway to delivering against some of those assets that go out into 2019, 2020 time frame or potentially even later than that. So clearly, PPA prices have come down. I don't know if it's directly related to -- I wouldn't sort of position it as being directly related to our advantages, in our advancements, in our road map, in our form factor and efficiency. The other day, we're competing against crystalline silicon, so it's really relative to the alternative technology that's in the marketplace. And so to the extent that we create separation relative to crystalline silicon, that value should accrete back to First Solar. I would also say that there is a very strong bias in the marketplace for more and more customers and developers and partners coming to First Solar first. We've got a number of parties who historically, over the years, have moved away from First Solar that are coming back to First Solar. And we've also got a number of other partners that are starting to come to discussions with First Solar that we historically have never had conversations with. And I do think that is related to our road map and our technology and understanding where First Solar is going to go long term with our capabilities, it's not only on the module side but as we indicated before with MVDC and the advantages that, that creates for the balance of system costs and just general learnings around BoS and optimization and wire management and a lot of things that we're doing to drive down a lot of cost. We're getting more and more interest from other parties to want to do more business with First Solar. So clearly a trend in lower PPA. But not to the extent that when I look at where the PPA pricing is going, that I'm concerned relative to what we can personally do with our overall cost reduction road map. I just said as a relevant data point, just on the module alone year-on-year, our reduction on our module cost has been in the mid to upper teens. So in the last 12 months, we've taken mid to upper teens type of cost out of our module, which is extremely impactful and competitive, and ultimately creates an opportunity to have robust margins against the contracted pipeline that we've created."

And clearly, there is -- on the positive side, there is a clear understanding globally of kind of the demand elasticity around solar and competitiveness of solar in many different markets, and that's driving a demand profile that obviously is very encouraging. There's also -- the offsetting side of that is there is quite a bit of capacity that is being added -- or plan to be added, maybe is the better way to say that, but that could change very quickly as well.

But if you look at that, combine that with -- even without capacity expansion another 7 or so gigawatts of modules to sell, I would expect some of that volume to be incremental systems as well as modules. When you combine that with executing on the cost reduction road map and our OpEx coming down, I think we look to see beyond '17 having acceptable and robust margins across the new products. '17 itself is somewhat opaque today and we'll give better guidance around that towards the end of the year."

So on the gigawatt for '17, we're 400 megawatts in right now. If you ask me the other 600, there's -- I have really high confidence on 300 and 600. The other 600 -- the other 300, I would say, there's still a number of moving pieces. And some of the",603,"Yes. So on the gigawatt for '17, we're 400 megawatts in right now. If you ask me the other 600, there's -- I have really high confidence on 300 and 600. The other 600 -- the other 300, I would say, there's still a number of moving pieces. And some of the announcements that have come out here recently, and now people are thinking about, and especially in the U.S, opportunity to procure in '17 that gets me more encouraging. As I look at some of these international opportunities and especially the challenges, in some cases to these -- some of the PPAs, as I indicated to get them to be financeable, that sort of sways me the other way. But I would say on balance, we feel that we will get to, whether it's 850 or 900, it's going to be within a ZIP Code that's going to be close to that gigawatt of volume system business for next year. So I'd say there's reasonable level of comfort from that standpoint. On the margin guidance, I think the best way to handle this, as Alex already said, is that we're not going to get into the specifics of that right now. There's still many moving pieces that we would rather wait until we do our guidance call in December. And what I would also continue to point you to is that, whatever that view is and when we communicate that in December, I don't think we should look at it as a discrete data point as indicative of a long-term earnings potential of First Solar. The '17 margin profile, especially as we indicated with Series 4, still being the predominant product in our platform. It's going to drive a little bit of margin pressure, there's no doubt about that. But that's a temporary issue that corrects itself in the second half of '17 and then is completely fixed by the end of '17 where we got a form factor that's consistent with crystalline silicon and driving towards a 390 watt panel that -- with all of the energy advantages that we talked about around cad tel. So when you look at it through that horizon, we feel very confident about where we're going with our technology and ultimately the competitiveness of our products. Around the component gross margin, there's an element at spot and it's also the -- it's an indication of contracted volume, so it's a combination of the 2. As we indicated this quarter, as an example, over half of our bookings that we recorded of our 800 megawatts or so were not in our late-stage development pipeline, which means that those were transactions since the last earnings call that we've gone out and we've negotiated around pricing in a very short period of time and then closed those orders. And a high percentage of that volume will ship this year and those margins that will be realized against those shipments will be in line with what we're currently reflecting in our components segment today. And as they also indicated, if you just look at our module cost delta, year-on-year, we're seeing high-teens, upper teen cost reduction on our module just in the last 12 months. And the team continues to make tremendous progress in that side of the house. So we're able to, as best we can, sort of manage that price cost battle. But we also do it in a way that we're trying to be selective of where we're selling through and to make sure we're targeting markets so we get the highest value for our products."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.

In our deci",2490,"Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Before reviewing the results for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on some key strategic priorities and how I intend to lead the organization in my new role as CEO. In our decision making, we will continue to apply the same disciplined approach to long-term strategy that has served us extremely well to date. 
At various times over the past several years, some have questioned our measured approach to key strategic decisions including capacity expansion, asset ownership and balance sheet utilization.  However, we continue to see the benefits of our disciplined strategy and are confident this approach will optimize shareholder value over the long term. This approach also allows us to be nimble and navigate an industry that is cyclical, high growth and dynamic. The updates I provide today do not constitute any major strategic changes from what we discussed earlier this year at our Analyst Day in April but are further refinements aimed at simplifying and focusing our business. 
The core of our overall strategy continues to be our differentiated cad tel technology and its tremendous potential for further conversion efficiency improvements. Closely aligned to our module efficiency road map is the evolution of our module form factor, which as we indicated in April, will begin next year with the introduction of our Series 5 module. Our Series 4 technology is an outstanding product with a superior temperature coefficient, spectral gain and shading response. Series 4 holds an energy density advantage over multi-crystalline silicon products. 
Series 5 retains the energy density advantage of our cad tel technology, further boosts efficiency and is optimized for cost-effective installations. To put this into perspective, in a typical market, the reduction in Series 5 BoS costs relative to Series 4, will be equivalent to boosting module efficiency by approximately 100 basis points. The combination of these factors make this a powerful new product, which is supported by positive initial feedback from our customers and partners. 
Given the exciting potential of this product, we are now planning to invest in additional efficiency improvements over the next couple of years that will take the Series 5 road map to a 391 module versus the 365-watt module we introduced at the Analyst Day. The competitive position of the Series 5 390-watt module with a similar form factor to crystalline silicon but with the inherent energy advantage of cad tel is very exciting. Moreover, the substantial increase to the Series 5 road map has an extremely compelling return on investment. The estimated $60 million of capital expenditures that we will require to enable this efficiency gain across our current 3 gigawatts of production will result in anticipated payback time of less than a year. 
The focusing on increasing Series 5 efficiency does not change the priority we are placing on Series 6. We continue to push pace the Series 6 development as fast as possible with power plant production beginning in 2018. It should be noted that we intend to prioritize long-term investment in the production and development of Series 5 and Series 6 technologies over adding new manufacturing capacity in the short term. In light of the current supply demand dynamics in the global solar market, we will continue to evaluate the point in time in which adding the additional capacity makes sense. 
As we eagerly look forward to these exciting technologies, some strategic realignments are necessary to ensure focused and seamless execution. Firstly, as we recently announced, we have decided to discontinue TetraSun production in order to maximize our Series 5 assembly capabilities at our facility in Malaysia. This not only enables a more rapid roll-out of Series 5 product next year, but also allows us to focus more resources and capital on our cad tel road map. Secondly, the new Series 5 form factor will significantly broaden spectrum of third-party structures and tracker technologies available for use with our modules without requiring First Solar specific components. Previously, the different form factor of our Series 4 technology led us to develop optimized in-house solutions. The new interoperability of Series 5 with the broad global ecosystem of existing third-party structure products is expected to facilitate increased adoption of our module by new customers and increased market opportunities. The evolution of our module form factor allows us to tap into a broader and deeper supply chain for structures and trackers. And we have therefore decided to discontinue substantial internal development of fixed tilt and tracker structures. This decision allows us to refocus resources towards developing closer relationships with industry-leading structure and tracker technology providers, and at the same time, eliminate some of the channel conflicts that existed in certain situations today. 
Thirdly, the progression of the interoperability of our modules also impacts our strategy as it relates to EPC capabilities. Historically, we have self-performed EPC on the majority of our system projects as well as provide EPC services to third-party developers using First Solar module technology. The evolution of our module form factor, combined with the lower volume of system projects in 2017, implies a reduced need for internal EPC services and requires a reduction in our EPC work force. 
While these decisions are difficult and will impact a number of dedicated associates, this is a necessary step. We will continue to maintain sufficient internal EPC resources to support the construction of our self-developed projects. This allows us to continue to provide comprehensive solutions to our customers and also enables continued development of next-generation BoS technologies such as MVDC, which we introduced at our Analyst Day. 
It should be clear that this decision around EPC can no way impact our product development business and in fact allows us to allocate more capital and focus more resources on this critical aspect of our business model. 
Lastly, as part of our refocusing efforts, we have also decided to explore options for the disposition of skytron energy. Our original intent in acquiring skytron was to expand our global O&M footprint into Europe and supplement our existing capabilities. Over the past 2 years, competition for O&M contracts in Europe, combined with  progression of First Solar's internal O&M capability, particularly as it relates to smaller-scale solar plants, has changed how skytron fits into our strategy going forward. 
Altogether, we expect charges of $105 million to $120 million related to TetraSun and the actions we are announcing today. On an annual basis going forward, the total reductions and operating expense and cost of sales is expected to be $60 million to $80 million. Alex will provide more detail on these charges and associated savings. While these decisions are difficult for part of our organization, these actions will best position First Solar to increase its competitive position over the next several years. We are excited about the potential of our Series 5 and Series 6 technologies and are well positioned with the resources and capabilities necessary to execute on our plans. 
With that, let's return -- let's turn to our results. Our financial results for the quarter were strong with net sales of over $930 million and non-GAAP earnings per share excluding restructuring charges of $0.87. These results were underpinned by continuing execution across both our module manufacturing and system project portfolio. 
Our module lead line efficiency is currently running at 16.7% and we continue to lower our cost per watt. We completed our Silver State South and McCoy projects in Q2 and are nearing completion of the Stateline project. We recognize significant cost savings on these projects in the quarter as a result of our outstanding execution. Alex will discuss the financial results for the quarter in more detail. 
Moving on to Slide 5, I'll provide an update on our latest bookings activity. In the second quarter, we shipped close to 750 megawatts of modules, bringing our year-to-date total as of June 30 to 1.6 gigawatts. Against these shipments, we have booked approximately 1.4 gigawatts year-to-date, including the period up to today's call. 
I'll now provide some more details on the approximate 800 megawatts of bookings since our last earnings call. In the U.S., we have signed PPAs for 2 projects totaling over 100 megawatts DC -- 180 megawatts DC with a leading Western utility. These projects have CODs in 2019 and 2020, which now brings our total projects with executed PPAs with CODs in 2019 or later to over 1.2 gigawatts DC, which are ideally suited for the competitively advantaged Series 5, Series 6 and MVDC. As evidenced by these bookings, we continue to see many encouraging signs for solar demand over the long-term horizon. 
Beyond these project bookings, we continue to have active discussions with both utilities and C&I customers seeking large-scale solar power supply. The interest in C&I customers is particularly strong with these customers typically looking for renewables to meet up to 100% of their energy supply needs. We see this opportunity as a key market focus and have a dedicated team specifically working with these customers to provide comprehensive solutions that meet their needs. 
In the U.S., we are also encouraged by the increasing demand for community solar solutions, a market segment that we continue to view as having tremendous potential to meet residential and customer -- commercial customers' need at a dramatically lower cost than rooftop solar. 
Underscoring the growth potential for community solar, a third-party research firm recently estimated that community solar's addressable market is more than 7x as large as rooftop solar. Thus far in 2016, we have booked over 120 megawatts DC of volume that will supply more the 25 different community solar projects across multiple states. Majority of this volume is with a single customer where we continue to see opportunities to collaborate on future community solar projects. 
An initial 41 megawatts project is underway with M+W as the EPC contractor. To put the 120 megawatts of bookings in perspective, once this volume has been installed, it will effectively double the amount of cumulative community solar installations in the U.S. We are pleased with the recent progress and continue to work with various customers to capture the growing community solar opportunity in the U.S. Elsewhere in the United States, we booked modest supply agreements for over 80 megawatts DC in diverse solar markets such as Idaho and North Carolina. 
Internationally, we have bookings in India and have been strong with over 280 megawatts DC of new bookings. The volume booked was a combination of both module supply agreements and 60 megawatts AC of PPAs. These latest PPAs bring our current development pipeline in India to 260 megawatts AC. Altogether, we have booked approximately 250 megawatts DC of systems project this quarter with approximately 1/3 of the volume scheduled for 2017 deliveries. 
Relative to our expectations for the 1 gigawatt of systems business in 2017, we have approximately 400 megawatts DC of contracted projects with additional projects added. We have visibility to a number of additional potential booking opportunities that we continue to pursue towards the 1 gigawatt total. As we bid on future PPAs, we will continue to maintain our discipline and leverage our strengths in bidding opportunities. In situations where we engage early in the process with key partners and leverage the strength of our new Series 5 technology into the offering, we feel that we are extremely competitive. 
In addition to the 800 megawatts of bookings in the past quarter, we have also been awarded opportunities of over 410 megawatts DC, which we expect to convert into bookings during the remainder of this year. Firstly, in Zambia, along with our partner NEOEN, we were awarded 53 megawatts DC power plant, which is expected to deliver the lowest-cost solar electricity in sub-Sahara Africa. The energy density advantage of our cad tel module is particularly strong in this type of hot and humid climate and allows us to provide extremely competitive solar solutions. 
The remaining awarded volume of approximately 357 megawatts DC pertains to module supply agreements in France, Israel, India and Thailand.  In France, we were pleased with the results of the most recent tender process where we're awarded over 100 megawatts of volume. As these awarded projects are converted into bookings, we will discuss them in more detail on future earnings call. 
Moving on Slide 6. Our bookings in expected revenue term stands at $6 billion, a decrease of $900 million from the end of last year. The decrease in expected revenue is a result of the higher mix of module-only business booked as compared to a higher mix of system revenue recognized year-to-date. In addition, it's also driven by lower ASPs associated with some of the longer dated PPAs included in our bookings. While ASPs on these longer-dated PPAs are naturally lower than on project we are currently constructing, there is still an expectation of attractive margins on these projects, given our efficiency in cost road maps discussed at our Analyst Day earlier this year. 
Slide 7 provides an update of potential bookings opportunities, which has grown to 24 megawatts DC, an increase of approximately 700 megawatts from the prior quarter. Our mid to late-stage booking opportunities are 1.8 gigawatts with international opportunities again comprising close to 9% of this number. Note that over 400 megawatts of awarded but not booked volume discussed earlier in this presentation is included in this 1.8 gigawatts. Also, it is important to note, as the number of third-party modules sales opportunities and our potential bookings number has increased over time, we are beginning to see an increase in the velocity at which these projects can move from early-stage opportunities to confirmed bookings. For instance, more than half of our bookings during the past quarter were in early-stage opportunities at the time of our Q1 call. 
Turning to Slide 8. While North America remains our largest geography at over 40% of the total, we continue to have a diversified geographic mix of potential booking opportunities. The largest region -- no, increases since the last call were in the United States and India, where we saw significant growth and opportunities from the prior quarter. We are encouraged by the expanding pipeline in both of these regions given our historical win rate, reflective of our energy density and the mix of system and module sales. 
One last point to keep in mind is the timing of bookings can be very uneven. For example, in the first 6 months of the year, our bookings total was only 800 megawatts. However, in the past month alone, we have added close to 600 megawatts. We continue to aggressively pursue new opportunities while working diligently to close those projects nearing the finish line, including the over 400 megawatts AC awarded volume previously mentioned, but the timing of when this occurs can be lumpy. 
I'll now turn it over to Alex, who will provide more detail in our second quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

I'll begin with some highlights of our operational performance during the past quarter. In Q2, we produced 785 megawatts DC, or an increase of 1% from the prior quarter, resulting from higher module efficiencies and increased throughput. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, production was 39% higher as a result of higher efficiencies, improved throughput and the addition of new capacity. 
Our factory capacity utilization was unchanged at 100% in Q2 versus the prior quarter, but increased by 15 percentage points versus the same period in 2015. The higher year-over-year capacity utilization was due to fewer efficiency upgrade activities in Q2 as we focused on maximizing output to meet demand in the first half of the year. 
The fleet average module conversion efficiency in Q2 was 16.2%, which was unchanged from the prior quarter, but increased 80 basis points year-over-year. Our best line conversion efficiency was also unchanged from Q1 at 16.4%, but increased by 20 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. Most recently, our lead line has been running at 16.7% efficiency. And we're encouraged by our progress towards our target of 17% lead line efficiency at the end of the year. 
Turning to Slide 11. I'll discuss P&L results for the second quarter. Net sales are $934 million for the quarter compared to $848 million in Q1. The sales increase resulted from higher third-party module sales, the sale of our Kingbird project and higher revenue recognition across various systems projects. Partially offsetting the higher sales was lower revenue recognized in our Silver State South and Stateline projects, which reached to a near-completion in Q2. The higher module sales were driven by shipments to projects in Dubai and the Southeastern U.S. 
In relation to our Kingbird project, it should be noted that this project sale was structured with a tax equity partner with the residual cash interest sold to 8point3 Energy Partners, which resulted in a different accounting treatment as compared to our historical project sales. As a result of the transaction structure, whereby First Solar provides an indemnity relating to the tax equity structuring, only a portion of the revenue from the transaction was recognized and the entire profit of $20 million has been deferred on the balance sheet. 
If we have been able to recognize the entire transaction in Q2, our gross margin would have improved by approximately 80 basis points and earnings per share would have increased by approximately $0.16. It's important to keep in mind that the underlying economic substance of the transaction was very favorable, but under current real estate accounting, it is not reflected in the current period results. Also, note that all cash related to the project sale both from tax equity and 8point3 was received. 
Continuing on, as a percentage of total quarterly net sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, decreased to 83% from 93% in the prior quarter as a result of the higher mix of module-only sales. Gross margin for the quarter was 20% compared to 31% in the first quarter. The decrease in gross margin percentage resulted primarily from the mix of systems projects recognized between the quarters. 
As a reminder, in Q1, we sold an additional interest in the Stateline project, leading to a significantly higher mix of revenues from development projects in Q1. Q2 gross margin was also impacted by an $8.5 million charge associated with the write-down of TetraSun inventory. Adjusted for this item, second quarter gross margin would have improved by approximately 90 basis points. 
Our component segment gross margin decreased slightly to 24% in the second quarter compared to 29% in Q1. The decrease was primarily due to the geographical mix of sales, partially offset by a decrease in our module cost per watt. We're very encouraged by our progress in reducing our module cost per watt through efficiency improvements, increased throughput and bill of material reductions. 
Operating expenses, excluding restructuring asset impairment charges, were $97 million in Q2, a decrease of $1 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due to lower employee-related costs, partially offset by higher R&D expenses for development of our Series 5 technology.  
Restructuring and asset impairment charges totaled $86 million in the quarter, primarily related to TetraSun. As indicated in our recent press release, we anticipate total charges of up to $100 million, substantially all of which is expected to be noncash. We expect operating expense savings of $2 million to $4 million this year and $8 million to $10 million on an annual basis going forward. 
Operating income was $9 million for the second quarter or $94 million adjusted for restructuring. Prior quarter operating income was $165 million.  Other income was $7 million in the second quarter compared to $36 million in Q1. The current quarter income was primarily related to a reversal of outstanding contingent consideration associated with the TetraSun acquisition. Other income in the prior quarter was primarily due to a $38 million gain from the sale of rebalancing certain restricted investments associated with our modular end-of-life program. 
Tax expense for Q2 was $9 million and the effective tax rate was unusually high due to the impact of restructuring. Adjusted for the restructuring and asset impairment charges, the tax rate for the quarter would have been more in line with the full year guidance tax range. Also, note that while not in our Q2 results, during July, we received a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority which will result in a tax benefit of $35 million in our Q3 results.
Q2 earnings were $0.13 to fully diluted share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 on a non-GAAP basis. This compares to earnings of $1.66 in the prior quarter. The non-GAAP EPS does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. Please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS reconciliation.  Nonrecurring charges aside, which were primarily from TetraSun, Q2 was another strong quarter of financial performance, and we're pleased with our progress in the first half of the year. 
Continuing on to Slide 12, I'll discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Cash and marketable securities decreased $213 million to an ending balance of $1.7 billion. Our net cash position also decreased to $1.4 billion. Cash decreased from the prior quarter due to ongoing construction of projects on balance sheet, capital expenditures and debt repayments. 
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, was virtually unchanged. The decrease in project-related assets due to the sale of Kingbird and the reclassification of certain projects in Chile and India to the PV solar power systems was largely offset by an increase in unbilled AR. The Luz del Norte project was reclassified as it has been placed in service, and we anticipate holding the asset for several years, pending transmission upgrades in Chile. The increase in unbilled AR is expected to decline in Q3 as billing milestones are reached. 
Total debt decreased $66 million from the prior quarter to $233 million, primarily due to the $70 million repayment of the remaining balance on our Malaysia debt facilities. The remaining debts outstanding is comprised of $163 million of limited or nonrecourse project level debt and $70 million of recourse project level debt, the majority of which is a short-term VAT loan associated with our Luz del Norte asset. 
Cash flows used in operations were $75 million compared to cash flows from operations of $50 million in the first quarter. Free cash flow is negative $140 million compared to positive free cash flow of $13 million last quarter. Capital expenditures were $78 million as compared to $52 million in the prior quarter, as we increased investments in our Series 5 technology. Depreciation for the quarter was $53 million or approximately $2 million lower than the prior quarter. 
Before turning to our updated guidance for the year, we summarized on Slide 13 the expected impact of restructuring charges and the associated future benefits from these actions. 
Firstly, as indicated, the total expected charges associated with both the TetraSun and other restructuring announcements is between $105 million and $120 million, the majority of which is noncash. Of the $90 million to $100 million of TetraSun charges, we incurred approximately $86 million in Q2 with the remainder expected to be incurred in the second half of 2016. The charges associated with our EPC and skytron restructuring are expected to be in a range of $15 million to $20 million and are expected to occur primarily in the third and fourth quarters. 
Going forward, we expect total annual savings related to these actions of $60 million to $80 million, of which $55 million to $65 million are cash savings. Annualized OpEx savings associated with these actions are expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. Note that due to the timing of the restructuring, we expect limited OpEx savings in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 14, I'll now discuss the updates of our full year 2016 guidance. Overall, the changes to our full year non-GAAP guidance, which excludes restructuring, are relatively minor. While the first half of the year results have been strong, we continue to take a measured approach to guidance for the time being, given uncertainties in the second half of the year. In particular, we anticipate closing the sale of the Moapa asset, our California flat asset and our remaining 34% interest in the Stateline asset. As we progress further into the third quarter, we'll have greater visibility into these various project sales dynamics. 
Relative to Stateline, our guidance assumption continues to anticipate dropping our remaining 34% interest in the project to 8point3, subject to market conditions. To the extent that we do sell all 34% of our interest in 2016, this would likely result in earnings above the midpoint of our guidance. We will also continue to evaluate the potential to sell a portion of our remaining interest in Stateline in 2017, dependent upon developments in our own business during the second half of the year, as well as based on market conditions relating to 8point3. 
Turning to our guidance ranges. Our net sales forecast is unchanged at $3.8 billion to $4 billion. We're bringing up the low end of our gross margin guidance to a revised range of 18.5% to 19% compared to the prior range of 18% to 19%. This update is a result of the significant project cost savings achieved in the second quarter. Note that as previously discussed, the net sales range in gross margin guidance include only a portion of the revenue and none of the deferred profit from the Kingbird sale. Our GAAP operating expenses are projected in the range of $485 million to $520 million for the year. This includes the $105 million to $120 million of restructuring associated charges. 
Our non-GAAP operating expense guidance, excluding those restructuring and asset impairment charges, is unchanged at $380 million to $400 million. We're leaving the range unchanged as 2015 OpEx reductions are expected to be limited given the timing of the announced restructuring and are offset by earlier-than-planned production start-up expenses from the Series 5 acceleration and from incremental R&D for Series 6. 
Improvement in the gross margin has been flowed through to the low end of our non-GAAP operating income guidance, which has been raised to $310 million. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 16% to 18%. This projected tax range excludes the impact of all restructuring actions and also excludes the impact of the $35 million tax benefit mentioned previously. 
Moving on to EPS guidance. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings in the range of $3.65 to $3.90. Excluding restructuring charges, the low end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance’s range to $4.20, with the upper bound unchanged at $4.50. The impact to EPS from the expected sale of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar share of 8point3's earnings remains unchanged at approximately $145 million net of tax.  
Additionally, approximately $0.20 of other income, net of tax, is included in the earnings guidance range from the previously discussed Q1 sale of the restricted investments. Also, keep in mind that the EPS guidance does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. The distribution of earnings for the remainder of the year is anticipated to be slightly more weighted towards the fourth quarter due to the timing of expected project sales. 
Operating cash flow has been reduced to $500 million to $650 million from the prior range of $500 million to $700 million, reflecting the expected impact of cash restructuring charges. Again, the operating cash flow range does not include approximately $320 million from the expected sale of the remaining interest in Stateline, which we expect to treat as an investing cash flow. 
Our capital expenses guidance has been revised to a range of $275 million to $325 million from the previous range of $300 million to $400 million, reflecting a change in timing of expected spend. Adjustment to timing has no impact on our planned efficiency road map and Series 5 product launch. The net results of these changes leaves our net cash balance guidance unchanged at $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'll now summarize our progress during the past quarter. Firstly, our financial results for the second quarter was strong with revenue of $934 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.87. We updated our 2016 non-GAAP earnings guidance range to $4.20 to $4.50. Our technology performance is progressing towards the goal that we outlined in our April Analyst Day with a best line efficiency currently running at 16.7%. And our year-to-date bookings are now 1.4 gigawatts with over 800 megawatts booked since our last earnings call. The number of potential bookings opportunities continues to grow and is now over 24 gigawatts. 
With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

We're still very pleased with the margin realization that we're capturing. We are being very disciplined, though, and engaging and making sure that we're capturing full value of our technology. So if you use India as an example, it's a market that our technology is competitively advantaged. It's a hot, humid climate. We have a superior spectral response and that can command an energy advantage over crystalline silicon. Plus, it's mainly fixed tilt structures in India which is, again, more advantage for our Series 4 product than, say, a tracker solution. Plus, we have a number of self-developed projects in India and the returns of what we're capturing against the sell-down -- our anticipated sell-down of those projects are in line with what we would normally expect, and even in some cases, on the upper end of our expectation. We've been very pleased with the ultimate performance of those assets. Having said that, is the market becoming more competitive? I mean, it clearly is. We're seeing a lot of very aggressive pricing behavior in the market, whether it's at the PPA level or whether it's at the module level. And that's why we have to be disciplined and selective in engaging with customers and developing relationships to ensure we can capture the full value of the offers and the value creation that we provide to our partners and our customers. So we are being disciplined in that regard and we are seeing a very aggressive market environment, there's no doubt about that. And that's what's also informed our view around capacity expansion and why we are being disciplined as we think about when will I add capacity and will -- as we indicated in our prepared remarks, that we'll continue to assess that as we move forward. As it relates to near term, our focus is converting all of our capacity into Series 5. So we want all our Series 4 product into Series 5 as quickly as possible. And our current timeline would indicate that, that would happen in the end of 2017. We'll continue then also to validate the business case around Series 6. And as we get more informed and have a better understanding and realization of the current views around Series 6, we will start to think about how do we add capacity and the associated timing around that. So I would say for now, again, near-term focus moving Series 4 to Series 5. As we get better information and validate Series 6, that will kind of determine the timing around when do we start to add incremental capacity."

I'll let Alex take the question around how we're thinking through timing of activities between '17 and '16. As it relates to margin realization, similarly, I think highlighted in the Analyst Day, and especially when you start looking at our contracted pipeline, in particular, the margin profile, it will start on the lower end of the range in '17 and then continue to improve as we move through the balance of this decade, primarily because as we transition into Series 5, it's a much more competitive product. And when we look at right now for Series 5 capacity in 2017, it's probably going to be right around 1 gigawatt, which means we have about 2 gigawatts of Series 4 product that we're going to have to sell through. We also indicated in the comments today that the value of that delta and form factor as it relates to lower labor costs, fewer connectors, better wire management through elimination of clips, isn't worth over 100 basis points of equivalent efficiency. So what you should think about is our margin profile in '17 is going to be on the lower end. It's mainly because 2/3 of our production volume is still going to be Series 4. As we transition that into Series 5, and then really get to the position of equivalent form factor and really capturing full value of our energy advantages, you'll see margin expansion as we go into '18 and '19 and '20."

We've guided to selling our remaining 34% interest in Stateline this year, and that's still in our base case. I'd say along with both Moapa and Cal Flats, there's still significant uncertainty around the structure and the ultimate value of those sales. So in terms of our guidance, we're remaining conservative as we continue to develop those structures. The Stateline sale is really dependent on the other 2 deals as well as market conditions relating to the yield curve. So we'll make that decision in Q3 or Q4. We do have the flexibility with Stateline to push some of that into '17, if needed."

We have about 400 megawatts of systems business already positioned for 2017. We have a pipeline that would move us towards closing that out and getting to gigawatt expectation for 2017 for that other 600 megawatts or so. We're still working through those. There are a couple in there that I would say that -- not around the economics, the economics are very compelling. There are some issues around structuring of the PPAs and overall bankability of those PPAs. As you indicated already some of these are international markets where we're just trying to work through in making sure they're clearly financeable and bankable, so there are some challenges in that regard. But what I would say is there's a sufficient pipeline of projects that would enable us to get to our goal of having a gigawatt of systems business in 2017. The other aspect that we continue to be very mindful of and very disciplined on is making sure that we get proper return on capital given the risk profile of doing international development business, right? In some markets, pricing has gotten very aggressive, so we have to be careful in that regard. So we'll be balanced, making sure that the return on capital is just as commensurate with the underlying risk associated with those opportunities. But I would say, in aggregate, we're still very happy with the robustness of our pipeline to get to our goal next year of a gigawatt of systems business. On the Stateline discussion, I'll take that one and I'll let Alex take the question on Moapa. When you get the Q, which would be available tomorrow you'll see -- I think it will say effectively 96% or somewhere in the upper 90s as Stateline has been completed through the second quarter. So the vast majority of the revenue that was related to the sale to Southern has now been recognized through Q2. We have about 4% of that left and the project will achieve DOD in the third quarter."

But there's a pretty long runway to delivering against some of those assets that go out into 2019, 2020 time frame or potentially even later than that. So clearly, PPA prices have come down. I don't know if it's directly related to -- I wouldn't sort of position it as being directly related to our advantages, in our advancements, in our road map, in our form factor and efficiency. The other day, we're competing against crystalline silicon, so it's really relative to the alternative technology that's in the marketplace. And so to the extent that we create separation relative to crystalline silicon, that value should accrete back to First Solar. I would also say that there is a very strong bias in the marketplace for more and more customers and developers and partners coming to First Solar first. We've got a number of parties who historically, over the years, have moved away from First Solar that are coming back to First Solar. And we've also got a number of other partners that are starting to come to discussions with First Solar that we historically have never had conversations with. And I do think that is related to our road map and our technology and understanding where First Solar is going to go long term with our capabilities, it's not only on the module side but as we indicated before with MVDC and the advantages that, that creates for the balance of system costs and just general learnings around BoS and optimization and wire management and a lot of things that we're doing to drive down a lot of cost. We're getting more and more interest from other parties to want to do more business with First Solar. So clearly a trend in lower PPA. But not to the extent that when I look at where the PPA pricing is going, that I'm concerned relative to what we can personally do with our overall cost reduction road map. I just said as a relevant data point, just on the module alone year-on-year, our reduction on our module cost has been in the mid to upper teens. So in the last 12 months, we've taken mid to upper teens type of cost out of our module, which is extremely impactful and competitive, and ultimately creates an opportunity to have robust margins against the contracted pipeline that we've created."

So there will still be a meaningful amount of Series 4 product that we've obviously will have to sell through into next year. Some of that is already contracted, but there is more volume that we have to make sure that we sell through in that regard. You're right, module pricing has become more competitive. We are still able to command a premium for our technology. That's why we try to focus on markets where we're more significantly advanced. I mean we even referenced in our prepared remarks Zambia, right? So there was an opportunity in Zambia for 50 megawatts. It's a hot, humid climate, which is an advantage for our technology. So what we're doing globally is looking at pockets of strength. We're trying to manage with constraining ourself on available capacity, at least at this point in time, especially as it relates to Series 4. We're looking for pockets of strength where we can sell through and capture highest margin opportunity entitlement that we have relative to what's going on in the marketplace. But we're very well aware of how aggressive some of the pricing has become."

An event can happen very quickly that it becomes disruptive or undermined or events could happen that become very positive. And clearly, there is -- on the positive side, there is a clear understanding globally of kind of the demand elasticity around solar and competitiveness of solar in many different markets, and that's driving a demand profile that obviously is very encouraging. There's also -- the offsetting side of that is there is quite a bit of capacity that is being added -- or plan to be added, maybe is the better way to say that, but that could change very quickly as well. I mean, as people think about the market opportunities and what they're willing to sell through and what ultimately is sustainable, the planned announcements that have been communicated may or may not happen.

What I would say though is that we always knew that '17 would be a challenging year especially as we saw margins decline from our more lucrative legacy contracts as they rolled off. The ITC extension in 2016 came too late to influence 2017. So that's why we think it's incredibly important that we see both the transition towards higher module business in '17 but also the product from Series 4 to Series 5. The other thing I'd refer you back to is the Analyst Day when we talked about what our long-term contracted pipeline looks like. Back then we'd spoke about having over 2.5 gigawatts of contracted assets after 2017 with north of $1 billion of contracted margin entitlement. But if you look at that, combine that with -- even without capacity expansion another 7 or so gigawatts of modules to sell, I would expect some of that volume to be incremental systems as well as modules. When you combine that with executing on the cost reduction road map and our OpEx coming down, I think we look to see beyond '17 having acceptable and robust margins across the new products. '17 itself is somewhat opaque today and we'll give better guidance around that towards the end of the year."

So on the gigawatt for '17, we're 400 megawatts in right now. If you ask me the other 600, there's -- I have really high confidence on 300 and 600. The other 600 -- the other 300, I would say, there's still a number of moving pieces. And some of the",603,"Yes. So on the gigawatt for '17, we're 400 megawatts in right now. If you ask me the other 600, there's -- I have really high confidence on 300 and 600. The other 600 -- the other 300, I would say, there's still a number of moving pieces. And some of the announcements that have come out here recently, and now people are thinking about, and especially in the U.S, opportunity to procure in '17 that gets me more encouraging. As I look at some of these international opportunities and especially the challenges, in some cases to these -- some of the PPAs, as I indicated to get them to be financeable, that sort of sways me the other way. But I would say on balance, we feel that we will get to, whether it's 850 or 900, it's going to be within a ZIP Code that's going to be close to that gigawatt of volume system business for next year. So I'd say there's reasonable level of comfort from that standpoint. On the margin guidance, I think the best way to handle this, as Alex already said, is that we're not going to get into the specifics of that right now. There's still many moving pieces that we would rather wait until we do our guidance call in December. And what I would also continue to point you to is that, whatever that view is and when we communicate that in December, I don't think we should look at it as a discrete data point as indicative of a long-term earnings potential of First Solar. The '17 margin profile, especially as we indicated with Series 4, still being the predominant product in our platform. It's going to drive a little bit of margin pressure, there's no doubt about that. But that's a temporary issue that corrects itself in the second half of '17 and then is completely fixed by the end of '17 where we got a form factor that's consistent with crystalline silicon and driving towards a 390 watt panel that -- with all of the energy advantages that we talked about around cad tel. So when you look at it through that horizon, we feel very confident about where we're going with our technology and ultimately the competitiveness of our products. Around the component gross margin, there's an element at spot and it's also the -- it's an indication of contracted volume, so it's a combination of the 2. As we indicated this quarter, as an example, over half of our bookings that we recorded of our 800 megawatts or so were not in our late-stage development pipeline, which means that those were transactions since the last earnings call that we've gone out and we've negotiated around pricing in a very short period of time and then closed those orders. And a high percentage of that volume will ship this year and those margins that will be realized against those shipments will be in line with what we're currently reflecting in our components segment today. And as they also indicated, if you just look at our module cost delta, year-on-year, we're seeing high-teens, upper teen cost reduction on our module just in the last 12 months. And the team continues to make tremendous progress in that side of the house. So we're able to, as best we can, sort of manage that price cost battle. But we also do it in a way that we're trying to be selective of where we're selling through and to make sure we're targeting markets so we get the highest value for our products."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.

In our dec",2477,"Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Before reviewing the results for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on some key strategic priorities, and how I intend to lead the organization in my new role as CEO. In our decision-making, we will continue to apply the same disciplined approach to long-term strategy that has served us extremely well today. At various signs over the last several years, some have questioned our measured approach, the key strategic positions including capacity expansion, asset ownership and balance sheet utilization. However, we continue to see the benefits of our discipline strategy and are confident this approach will optimize shareholder value over the long term. This approach also allows us to be nimble and navigate an industry that is cyclical, high growth and dynamic. The updates I will provide today do not constitute any major strategic changes from what we discussed earlier this year at our Analyst Day in April but are for the refinements aimed at simplifying and focusing our business. 
The core of our overall strategy continues to be our differentiated cash cell technology and its tremendous potential for further conversion efficiency improvements. Closely aligned, to our module efficiency road map is the evolution of our module form factor, which as we indicated in April, will begin next year with the introduction of our Series 5 module. Our Series 4 technology is an outstanding product with a superior temperature coefficient, gain and shading response. Series 4 holds an energy density advantage over multi-crystalline silicon products. Series 5 retains the energy density of that cash held technology, further boosts efficiency and is optimized for cost-effective installations. To put into perspective, in a typical market, the reduction in Series 5 OS costs relative Series 4 will be equivalent to boosting module efficiency by approximately 100 basis points. The combination of these factors make this a powerful new product, which is supported by positive initial feedback from our customers and partners. 
Given the exciting potential of this product, we are now planning to invest in additional efficiency improvements over the next couple of years that will take the Series 5 road map to a 391 module versus the 365-watt module were introduced at the Analyst Day. A competitive position of the Series 5 390 watt module with a similar form factor to crystalline silicon but with the inherent energy advantage is very exciting. Moreover, the substantial increase to the Series 5 road map has an extremely comparing them a compelling return on investment. The estimated $60 million of capital expenditures that we will require to enable this efficiency gain across our current 3 gigawatts of production will result in an anticipated payback time of less than a year. 
The focusing on increasing Series 5 efficiency does not change the priority we are placing on Series 6. We continue to push pace Series 6 development as fast as possible with power plant production beginning in 2018. It should be noted that we intend to prioritize long-term investment in the production and development of Series 5 and Series 6 technologies over adding new manufacturing capacity in the short term. In light of the current supply demand dynamics in the global market, we will continue to evaluate the point in time in which adding additional capacity makes sense. 
As we eagerly look forward to the exciting technologies, some strategic realignments are necessary to ensure focus and seamless execution. Firstly, as we recently announced, we have decided to discontinue TetraSun production in order to maximize our Series 5 assembly capabilities at our facility in Malaysia. This not only enables a more rapid roll-out of Series 5 product next year but also allows us to focus more resources and capital on our cad tel road map. Secondly, the new Series 5 form factor would significantly spectrum of third-party structures and tracker technologies available for use with our modules without requiring First Solar specific components. Previously, the different form factor of our Series 4 technology led us to develop optimized in-house solutions. The new interoperability of Series 5 with a broad ecosystem of existing third-party structure products is expected to facilitate increase adoption of our module by new customers and increased market opportunities. 
The evolution of our module form factor allows us to tap into a broader and deeper supply chain for structures and trackers and we have therefore decided to discontinue substantial internal development of flexibility and tracker structures. This position allows us to refocus resources towards developing closer relationships with industry-leading structure and tracker technology providers and, at the same time, eliminate some of the channel conflicts that existed in certain situations today. 
Thirdly, the progression of interoperability of our modules also impacts our strategy as it relates to EPC capabilities. Historically, we have so performed EPC on the majority of our system projects as well as provide EPC services to third-party developers using first solar module technology. The evolution of our module form factor, combined with the lower volume of system projects in 2017, implies a reduced need for internal EPC services and requires a reduction in our EPC work force. While these decisions are difficult and will impact a number of dedicated associates, this is a necessary step. We will continue to maintain sufficient internal EPC resources to support the construction of our self develop projects. This allows us continue to provide comprehensive solutions to our customers and also enables continued development of next-generation BLS technologies, such as NBCC which we introduced at our Analyst Day. 
It should be clear that this position around EPC can no way impacts our product development business and in fact allows us to allocate more capital and focus more resources on this critical aspect of our business model. 
Lastly, as part of our refocusing efforts, we have also decided to explore options for the disposition of sky tron in energy. Our original intent in acquiring sky tron was to expand our global O&M footprint into Europe and supplement our existing capabilities. Over the past 2 years, competition for winning contracts in Europe, combined with progression of First Solar's internal O&M capability, particularly as it relates to smaller-scale solar plants, has changed how [indiscernible] fits into our strategy going forward. 
Altogether, we expect charges of $105 million to $120 million related to TetraSun and the actions we're announcing today. On an annual basis going forward, the total reductions and operating expense and cost of sales is expected to be $60 million to $80 million. Alex will provide more details on these charges and associated savings. 
While this decision -- these decisions are difficult for part of our organization, these actions will best position First Solar to increase its competitive position over the next several years. We are excited about the potential of our Series 5 and Series 6 technologies and are well positioned with the resources and capabilities necessary to execute on our plans. 
With that, let's return -- let's turn to our results. Our financial results for the quarter were strong with net sales of over $930 million and non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges, of $0.87. These results are underpinned by continued execution across both our module manufacturing and system project portfolio. 
Our module [indiscernible] efficiency is currently running at 16.7%, and we continue to lower our cost per watt. We completed our Silver State South and the [indiscernible] projects in Q2 and are nearing completion of the Stateline project. We recognize significant cost savings on these projects in the quarter as a result of our outstanding execution. Alex will discuss the financial results for the quarter in more detail. 
Moving on to Slide 5, I'll provide an update on our latest bookings activity. In the second quarter, we shipped close to 750 megawatts of modules, bringing our year-to-date total, as of June 30, to 1.6 gigawatts. Against these shipments, we have booked approximately 1.4 gigawatts year-to-date, including the period up to today's call. 
I'll now provide some more details on the approximately 800 megawatts of looking since our last earnings call. In the U.S., we have signed PPAs for 2 projects totaling over 100 megawatts DC -- 180 megawatts DC with a leading Western utility. These projects have CODs in 2019 and 2020, which now brings our total projects with executed PPAs with CODs in 2019 or later to over 1.2 gigawatts DC, which is ideally suited for the competitively advantaged Series 5, Series 6 and MVDC. As evidenced by these bookings, we continue to see many encouraging signs for solar demand over the long-term horizon. 
Beyond these project bookings, we continue to have active discussions with both utilities and C&I customers seeking large-scale solar power supply. The interest in C&I customers is particularly strong with these customers typically looking for renewables to meet up to 100% of their energy supply needs. We see this opportunity as a key market focus and have a dedicated team specifically working with these customers to provide comprehensive solutions that meet their needs. 
In the U.S., we are also encouraged with increasing demand for community solar solutions, a market segment that we continue to view as having tremendous potential to meet residential and customer -- commercial customers' needs at a dramatically lower cost than it cost solar. 
[indiscernible] the growth potential of Community Solar, a third-party research firm recently estimated that community Solar's addressable market is more than 7x as large as rooftop solar. Thus far in 2016, we have booked over 120 megawatts DC of volume that will supply more the 25 different community solar projects across multiple states. Majority of this volume is with a single customer where we continue to see opportunities to collaborate on future community solar projects. An initial 41 megawatts project is underway with [indiscernible] contractor. 
To put the 120 megawatt of bookings in perspective, once this volume has been installed, it will effectively double the amount of cumulative community solar installations in the U.S. We are pleased with the recent progress and continue to work with various customers to capture the growing community solar opportunity in the U.S. 
Elsewhere in the United States, we booked modest supply agreements for over 80 megawatts DC in diverse solar markets such as Idaho and the North Carolina. 
Internationally, we have bookings in India and have been strong with over 280 megawatts DC of new bookings. The volume book was a combination of both module supply agreements and 60 [ph] megawatts AC of PPAs. These latest PPAs bring our current development pipeline in India to 260 megawatts AC. Altogether, we have booked approximately 250 megawatts DC of systems project this quarter with approximately 1/3 of the volume scheduled for 2017 deliveries. 
Relative to our expectations for the 1 gigawatt of systems business in 2017, we have approximately 400 megawatts DC of contracted projects with additional projects added. 
We have visibility to a number of additional potential booking opportunities that we continue to pursue towards the 1 gigawatt totaled. As we bid on future PPAs, we will continue to maintain our discipline and leverage our strengths in bidding opportunities. In situations where we engage early in the process with key partners and leverage the strength of our new Series 5 technology into the offering, we feel that we are extremely competitive. 
In addition to the 800 megawatts of bookings in the past quarter, we have also been awarded opportunities of over 410 megawatts DC, which we expect to convert into bookings during the remainder of this year. 
Firstly, in Zambia, along with our partner, we were awarded 53 megawatts DC power plant, which is expected to deliver the lowest-cost solar electricity in sub-Sahara Africa. The energy density advantage of our CdTe modules is particularly strong in this type of hot and humid climate and allows us to provide extremely competitive solar solutions. The remaining awarded volume of approximately 357 megawatts DC pertains to module supply agreements in France, Israel, India and Thailand. 
In France, we were pleased with the results of the most recent tender process where we're awarded over 100 megawatts of volume. As these awarded projects are converted into bookings, we will discuss them in more detail on future earnings call. 
Moving on Slide 6. Our bookings and expected revenue term stands at $6 billion, a decrease of $900 million from the end of last year. The decrease in expected revenue is a result of the higher mix of module-only business book as compared to a higher mix of system revenue recognized year-to-date. In addition, it's also driven by lower ASPs associated with some of the longer dated PPAs included in our bookings. While ASPs on these longer-dated PPAs are naturally lower than project we are currently in construction -- constructing, there's still an expectation of attractive margins on these projects, given our efficiency in cost road maps discussed at our Analyst Day earlier this year. 
Slide 7 provides an update of potential bookings opportunities, which has grown to 24 megawatts DC, an increase of approximately 700 megawatts from the prior quarter. Our mid to late-stage booking opportunities are 1.8 gigawatts with international opportunities again comprising close to 90% of this number. Note that over 400 megawatts are awarded but not booked volume discussed earlier in this presentation is included in this 1.8 gigawatts. Also, it is important, as the number of third-party modules sales opportunities and our potential bookings number has increased over time, we are beginning to see an increase in the velocity at which these projects can move from early-stage opportunities to confirm booking. For instance, more than half of our bookings during the past quarter were in early-stage opportunities at the time of our Q1 call. 
Turning to Slide 8. North America remains our largest geography at over 40% of the total. We continue to have a diversified geographic mix of potential booking opportunities. The largest region with no increases since the last call were the United States and India, where we saw significant growth and opportunities from the prior quarter. We're encouraged with expanding pipeline in both of these regions given our historical win rate, reflective of our energy density and the mix of system and module sales. 
One last point to keep in mind is the timing of bookings can be very uneven. For example, the first 6 months of the year, our bookings total was only 800 megawatts. However, in the past month alone, we have added close to 600 megawatts. We continue to aggressively pursuing opportunities while working diligently to close those projects nearing the finish line, including the over 400 megawatts AC awarded I previously made, but the timing of when this occurs can be lumpy. 
I'll now turn it over to Alex, who will provide more detail in our second quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

I'll begin with some highlights of our operational performance during the past quarter. In Q2, we produced 785 megawatts DC, or an increase of 1% from the prior quarter, resulting from higher margin efficiencies and increased throughput. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, production was 39% higher as a result of higher efficiencies, improved throughput and the addition of new capacity. 
Our [indiscernible] utilization is unchanged at 100% in Q2 versus the prior quarter, but increased by 15 percentage points versus the same period in 2015. The higher year-over-year capacity utilization was due to fewer efficiency upgrade activities in Q2 as we focused on maximizing output to meet demand in the first half of the year. 
The fleet average module conversion efficiency in Q2 was 16.2%, which was unchanged from the prior quarter, but increased 80 basis points year-over-year. Our best line conversion efficiency was also unchanged from Q1 at 16.4%, but increased by 20 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. Most recently, our lead line has been running at 16.7% efficiency. And we're encouraged by our progress towards our target of 17% lead line efficiency at the end of the year. 
Turning to Slide 11. I'll discuss the P&L results for the second quarter. Net sales are $934 million for the quarter compared to $848 million in Q1. The sales increase resulted from higher third-party module sales, the sale of our Kingbird project and higher revenue recognition across various systems projects. Partially offsetting the higher sales was lower revenue recognized in the Silver State South and Stateline project, which reached to a near-completion in Q2. The higher module sales were driven by shipments to projects in Dubai and the Southeastern U.S. 
In relation to our Kingbird project, it should be noted that this project sale was structured with a tax equity partner with the residual cash interest sold to 8point3 Energy Partners, which resulted in a different accounting treatment as compared to our historical project sale. As a result of the transaction structure, whereby First Solar provides an indemnity relating to the tax equity structuring, only a portion of the revenue from the transaction was recognized and the entire profit of $20 million has been deferred on the balance sheet. 
If we have been able to recognize the entire transaction in Q2, our gross margin would have been improved by approximately 80 basis points and earnings per share would have increased by approximately 16%. 
It's important to keep in mind that the underlying economic substance of the transaction was very favorable, but on the current real estate accounting, it is not reflected in the current period results. Also, note that all cash related the project sale both from tax equity and 8point3 was received. 
Continuing on [indiscernible] as a percent to total quarterly net sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and Solar modules use in systems projects, decreased to 83% from 93% in the prior quarter as a result of the higher mix of the module-only sales. Both margin for the quarter was 20% compared to 31% in the first quarter. The decrease in gross margin percentage resulted primarily from the mix of systems projects recognized between the quarters. 
As a reminder, in Q1, we sold an additional interest in the Stateline project, leading to a significantly higher mix of revenues from development projects in Q1. Q2 gross margin was also impacted by an $8.5 million charge associated with the write-down of TetraSun inventory. Adjusted for this item, second quarter gross margin would have improved by approximately 90 basis points. 
Our component segment gross margin decreased slightly to 24% in the second quarter compared to 29% in Q1. The decrease was primarily due to the geographical mix of sales, partially offset by a decrease in our module cost per watt. We're very encouraged by our progress in reducing our module cost per watt through efficiency improvements, increased throughput and bill of material reductions. 
Operating expenses, including restructuring asset impairment charges, were $97 million in Q2, a decrease of $1 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due to lower employee-related cost, partially offset by higher R&D expenses for development of our Series 5 technology. 
Restructuring and asset impairment charges totaled $86 million in the quarter, primarily related to TetraSun. As indicated in our recent press release, we anticipate total charges of up to $100 million, substantially all of which is expected to be noncash. We expect operating expense savings of $2 million to $4 million this year and $8 million to $10 million on an annual basis going forward and with $9 million for the second quarter or $94 million adjusted for restructuring prior quarter operating income was $165 million. 
Other income was $7 million in the second quarter compared to $36 million in Q1. The current quarter income was primarily related to a reversal of outstanding contingent consideration associated with the TetraSun acquisition. 
Other income in the prior quarter was primarily due to a $38 million gain from the sale of rebalancing certain restricted investments associated with our modular end-of-life program. 
Tax expense for Q2 was $9 million and the effective tax rate was unusually high due to the impact of restructuring. Adjusted for the restructuring and asset impairment charges, the tax rate for the quarter would be more in line with the full year guidance tax range. Also note that while not in our Q2 results, during July, we received a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority, which will result in a tax benefit of $35 million in our Q3 results. 
Q2 earnings were $0.13 per fully diluted share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 from a non-GAAP basis. This compares to earnings of $1.66 in the prior quarter. The non-GAAP EPS does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. Please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS reconciliation. 
Nonrecurring charges aside, which were primarily from TetraSun, Q2 was another strong quarter of financial performance, and we're pleased with our progress in the first half of the year. 
Continuing on Slide 12, I'll discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Cash and marketable securities decreased $213 million to an ending balance of $1.7 billion. Our net cash position also decreased to $1.4 billion. Cash decreased from the prior quarter due to ongoing construction of projects on balance sheet, capital expenditures and debt repayments. 
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, was virtually unchanged. The decrease in project-related assets due to the sale of Kingbird and reclassification of certain projects in Chile and India to the Solar power systems was largely offset by an increase in unbilled AR. The Luz del Norte project was reclassified as it is in place and service, and we anticipate holding the asset for several years, pending transmission operators in Chile. The increase in unbilled AR is expected to decline in Q3 as billing milestones are reached. 
Total debt decreased $66 million from the prior quarter, $233 million, primarily due to the $70 million repayment of the remaining balance on our Malaysia debt facilities. The remaining debts outstanding is comprised of $163 million of limited or nonrecourse project level debt and $70 million of recourse project level debt, the majority of which is a short-term VAT loan associated with our Luz del Norte asset. 
Cash flows used in operations was $75 million compared to cash flows from operations of $50 million in the first quarter. Free cash flow is negative $140 million compared to positive free cash flow of $13 million last quarter. Capital expenditures were $78 million as compared to $52 million in the prior quarter, as we increased investments in our Series 5 technology. Depreciation for the quarter was $53 million or approximately $2 million lower than the prior quarter. 
Before turning to our updated guidance for the year, we summarized on Slide 13 the expected impact of restructuring charges and the associated future benefits from these actions. 
Firstly, as indicated, the total expected charges associated with both the TetraSun and other restructuring announcement is between $105 million and $120 million, the majority of which is noncash. Up to $90 million to $100 million of TetraSun charges we incurred approximately $86 million in Q2 with remainder expected to be incurred in the second half of 2016. The charges associated with our EPC and skytron restructuring are expected to be in a range of $15 million to $20 million and expected to occur primarily in the third and fourth quarters. Going forward, we expect total annual savings related to these actions of $60 million to $80 million, of which $55 million to $65 million are cash savings. annualized OpEx savings associated with these actions are expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. Note that due to the timing of restructuring, we expect limited OpEx savings in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 14, I'll now discuss the updates of our full year 2016 guidance. Overall, the changes to our full year non-GAAP guidance, which excludes restructuring, are relatively minor. While the first half of the year results have been strong, we continue to take a measured approach to guidance for the time being, given uncertainties in the second half of the year. In particular, we anticipate closing the sale of the Moapa asset, our California flat asset and our remaining 34% interest in the Stateline asset. As we progress further into the third quarter, we'll have greater visibility into these various projects sales dynamic. 
Relative to Stateline, our guidance assumption continues to anticipate dropping our remaining 34% interest in the project to 8point3, subject to market conditions. To the extent that we do sell all 34% of our interest in 2016, this would likely result in earnings above the midpoint of our guidance. We will also continue to evaluate the potential to sell a portion of our remaining interest in the Stateline in 2017, dependent upon developments in our drilling business in the second half of the year as well as based on market conditions relating to 8point3. 
Turning to our guidance ranges. Our net sales forecast is unchanged at $3.8 billion to $4 billion. We're bringing up the low end of our gross margin guidance to a revised range of 18.5% and 19% compared to the prior range of 18% to 19%. This update is a result of the significant project cost savings achieved in the second quarter. Note that as previously discussed, the net sales range in gross margin guidance include only a portion of the revenue and none of the deferred profit from the Kingbird sale. Our GAAP operating expenses are projected in the range of $485 million to $520 million for the year. This includes the $105 million to $120 million of restructuring associated charges. 
Our non-GAAP operating expense guidance, excluding those restructuring and asset impairment charges, is unchanged at $380 million to $400 million. We're leaving the range unchanged as 2015 OpEx reductions are expected to be limited given the timing of the restructuring and are offset by earlier-than-planned production start-up expenses in the Series 5 acceleration and from the incremental R&D for Series 6. Improvement in the gross margin does not flow through to the low end of our non-GAAP operating income guidance, which has been raised to $310 million. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 16% to 18%. This projected tax range excludes the impact of all restructuring actions and also excludes the impact of the $35 million tax benefit mentioned previously. 
Moving onto EPS guidance. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings in the range of $3.65 to $3.90, excluding restructuring charges, the low end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance is range of $4.20, with the upper bound unchanged at $4.50. The impact to EPS from the expected sale of our remaining interest in Stateline and [indiscernible] share of 8point3's earnings remains unchanged at approximately $145 million, net of tax.  Additionally, approximately $0.20 of other income, net of tax, is included in the earnings guidance range from the previously discussed Q1 sale of the restricted investments. Also, keep in mind that the EPS guidance does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. The distribution of earnings for the remainder of the year is anticipated to be slightly more weighted towards the fourth quarter due to the timing of expected project sales. 
Operating cash flow has been reduced to $500 million to $650 million from the prior range of $500 million to $700 million, reflecting the expected impact of cash restructuring charges. Again, the operating cash flow range does not include approximately $320 million from the expected sale of the remaining interest in Stateline, which we expect to treat as an investing cash flow. 
Our capital expenses guidance has been revised to a range of $275 million to $325 million from the previous range of $300 million to $400 million, reflecting a change in timing of expected spend. Adjustment to timing has no impact in our planned efficiency road map in Series 5 product launch. The net results of these changes leads our net cash balance unchanged at $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'll now summarize our progress during the past quarter. Firstly, our financial results for the second quarter was strong with revenue of $934 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.87. We updated our 2016 non-GAAP earnings guidance range to $4.20 to $4.50. Our technology performance is progressing towards the goal we outlined in our April Analyst Day with a best line efficiently -- efficiency currently running at 16.7%. And our year-to-date bookings are now 1.4 gigawatts with over 800 megawatts booked since our last earnings call. The number of potential bookings opportunities continues to grow and are now over 24 gigawatts.

We're still very pleased with the margin realization that we're capturing. We are being very disciplined, though, engaging and making sure that we're capturing full value of our technology. So if you use India as an example, it's a market that our technology is competitively advantaged. It's a hot, humid climate. We have a superior response in the [indiscernible] and energy advantage over crystalline. Plus, it's mainly [indiscernible] structures in India, which is again more advantaged for our Series 4 product than, say, a tracker solution. Plus, we have a number of self-developed products in India. And the returns of what we're capturing [indiscernible] those projects are in line with probably what we would normally expect, and even in some cases, the upper end of our expectation. We've been very pleased with the out-performance of the asset. Having said that, is the market becoming more competitive? I mean, it clearly is. We're seeing a lot of very aggressive pricing behavior in the market, whether it's at the PPA level or whether it's the module level. And that's why we have to be disciplined and selective in engaging with customers and developing relationships to ensure we can catch the whole value of the offers and the value creation that we provide to our partners and customers. So we are being disciplined in that regard, and we're seeing a very more aggressive market environment. There's no doubt about that. And that's also informed our view around capacity expansion and why we are being disciplined as we think about [indiscernible] capacity and will -- as we communicated in the prepared remarks, that will continue that as we move forward. As it relates to near term, our focus is converting all of our capacity into Series 5. So we want all our Series 4 product into Series 5 as quickly as possible. And our current time line would indicate that that would happen in the end of 2017. We'll continue then also to validate the business case around Series 6. And as we get more and more -- and have a better understanding [indiscernible] of the current views around Series 6, we'll start to think about how to add capacity and the associated timing around that. I would say, for now, again, near-term focus to moving Series 4 to Series 5. As we get better information and validate the Series 6, that will kind of determine the timing when we kind of start adding capacity."

And it will -- what we look at right now for Series 5 capacity in 2017, it's probably going to be right around 1 gigawatt, which means we have about 2 gigawatts of Series 4 product that we're going to have to sell through.

On the Stateline discussion, I'll take that one of [indiscernible] Alex take the question on Moapa. When you get the Q, which will be available tomorrow, see, think we'll see effectively, 96% or somewhere in the upper 90s as the Stateline has been completed through the second quarter. So the vast majority of the revenue that was related to the sale of the [indiscernible] has now been recognized through Q2. We have about 4% of that [indiscernible] and the project will achieve DOD in the third quarter."

It was a lot into 2019, 2020 time frame or potentially later than that. So clearly, PPA prices have come down. I don't know if it's directly related to -- I wouldn't sort of position is being directly related to our advantages in our advancements in our road map and our form factor and efficiency. The other day, we compete against [indiscernible] and so it's really relevant to the alternate technology that's in the marketplace. To the extent that we create separation relative to [indiscernible] silicate, [indiscernible] back to First Solar. I would also say that there is a very strong bias in the marketplace for more and more customers and developers and partners coming to First Solar first. We've got a number of parties who historically, over the years, had moved away from First Solar that are coming back to First Solar. And we've also got a number of other partners that are starting to come to discussions with First Solar that we sort of -- we never had conversations with. And they do think that is related to our road map and our technology and understanding where for sellers going to go long term with our capability, not only on the [indiscernible] as indicated before, with MVDC any advantages that creates for the balance of system costs and its general earnings around optimization and management. A lot of people are looking to drive down a lot of cost. Getting more and more into from other parties want to be doing more business with First Solar. So clearly, the trend is lower PPA. But not to the extent that where they're looking for the PPA pricing is going, that I'm concerned relative to what we can personally do with our overall cost reduction road map. I just said is relevant data point. It's [indiscernible] alone year-on-year, a reduction on our module cost has been in the mid to upper teens. So in the last 12 months, we've taken mid to upper teens type of cost out of our module, which is extremely impactful and competitive and also creates an opportunity to have robust margins against the contracted pipeline that would be great."

That expansion extension in 2016 came too late to influence 2017. That's why we think it's clearly important that we've transition towards higher module business in '17 but also the product from Series 4 to Series 5. Other thing I'd refer you back to is the Analyst Day when we talked about what our long-term contracted pipeline looks like. Back then we spoke about having over 2.5 gigawatts of contracted asses after 2017 with north of $1 billion of contracted margins entitlement. But think if you look at that, combine that with -- even without capacity expansion of another 7 or so gigawatts of modules to sell, would expect some of that volume to be incremental systems as well as modules, you combine that with [indiscernible] production road map OpEx coming down, I think we look to see beyond '17 having acceptable and robust margins across the new products.

The other 600 -- the other 300, I would say, there's still a number of moving pieces and announced a little recently -- our people are thinking about especially in the U.S, opportunity to bring here in '17 gets more encouraging. As look at some of these international opportunities and especially the challenges in some cases to the PPAs are indicated to get them to be finance about. That's sort of the sways the other way. But I would say on balance, we feel that we will get to -- whether it's 850 or 900, it's going to be within a ZIP Code going to be close to that 1 gigawatts of volumes, just for next year. So level of comfort from that standpoint. On the margin guidance, I think the best way to handle it as Alex already said, we're not going to get into the  the specifics of that right now. There's still many moving pieces that we would rather wait until we do our guidance call in December. And what I would offer [indiscernible] point to you is that that we view that we communicate in December, I don't think we should look at it as a discrete data point as indicative of long-term earnings potential for First Solar. '17 margin profile, especially on indicated with Series 4, still being a prominent product in our platform, it's going to drive a little bit of margin pressure. There's no doubt about that. But that's a temporary issue that corrects itself in the second half of '17 and then just completely fixed by the end of '17 where we got form factor that's consistent with [indiscernible] and driving towards a 390-watt panel that with all of the energy advantages that we talked about around CdTe. So when you look at it [indiscernible] and we feel very confident about what we're going with our technology and ultimately the products. Around the component gross margin, there's an element of spot and it's also the -- it's an indication of contracted volume. So it's a combination of the 2. As we indicated this quarter, as an example, over half of our bookings that we recorded of our 800 megawatts or so were not in our late-stage development pipeline, which means that those were transaction since the last earnings call that we've gone out and we've negotiated around pricing in a very short period of time and then close this orders and a high percentage of that volume will shift this year and those margins that will be realized against the shipments will be in line with what were currently reflecting in our components segments today. And as they also indicated, if you just look at our module cost delta, year-on-year, we seen high teens, upper teens cost reduction when our module, just in the last 12 months. And maybe team continues to make tremendous progress in that side of the house. So we're able to as best we can, sort of a manage that price cost battle. But we also doing away with regard to be selective were selling through a to make sure we were targeting market so that we get the highest value of our products."

We had another good quarter of financial results in Q3, with net sales of $688 million and an earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges and a foreign tax benefit, of $1.22. We continue to push forward on our technology road map, with our best line efficiency exiting the third quarter almost touching 17% at 16.9% efficiency. Our project execution was also strong as we continued construction on multiple utility-scale solar projects and continue to realize significant BoS savings. 
Despite the results of the past quarter, the rapidly evolving market pricing environment, as shown on Slide 5 -- 4, excuse me, present significant challenges to the upcoming year. While we will not be discussing our 2017 outlook on today's call, it is important to understand the dramatic pricing declines that the industry is currently experiencing and how we intend to respond. 
As we highlighted on our Q2 earnings call, we saw the module and PPA pricing environment that time as increasingly aggressive and challenging. However, the impact of the lower second half 2016 installs in China were only just becoming evident, and the weeks since that call, we've seen other module manufacturers continue to bring online new capacity in the face of the demand dropoff in China. As a result of the oversupply and growing inventories, module pricing has declined at a dramatic rate in the third quarter. 
Since quarter end, there has been some signs of potential stabilization as wafer and self-spot prices first leveled off then increased slightly. In addition, module AFPs have leveled off, perhaps finding the near-term floor as manufacturers clear inventory. 
As we said consistently and reiterated on our Q1 2016 earnings call, when an oversupply situation exists, our strategy is to take a disciplined approach to the market. This means that we may walk away from module supply opportunity if the economics do not make sense for us. 
During the past quarter, challenging pricing conditions dictated that in certain situations we needed to apply this strategy, which has impacted our near-term booking. But we continue to view the strategy as the most sensible long-term approach. In these types of oversupply situations, we also will look very closely at our module manufacturing capacity. Our goal is not to push supply into a saturated and margin-challenged market, but rather to balance production to meet demand. 
As a result of this strategy in current market conditions, we have begun the process of evaluating our module capacity for next year. Mostly connected to any capacity decisions is the timing of our Series 5 and Series 6 product transitions. In regard to Series 5, we are looking very hard at the cost structure and how to bring the module cost brought down further in this competitive environment. In terms of our Series 6 product, we have dedicated significant resources to focus on how to accelerate the road map and product availability. 
In the current ASP environment, without further cost reduction, Series 4 and Series 5 margins may be challenged. We expect that our Series 6 module would be our most competitive product and enable us to capture greater gross margin per watt. Beyond both pricing and capacity decisions, we are also focused on identifying ways to improve our operating expense profile, which will improve our competitiveness. 
We are progressing in our valuation of each of these initiatives. However, any final decisions are subject to our normal board review process. We will hold a separate call on November 16 to discuss the 2017 outlook and provide further update at that time. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'll provide an update on bookings activity since our last earnings call. As we announced in our recent press release, we have signed a PPA of up to 160 megawatts with MCE, a leading community choice aggregator in California. While we are only including 40 megawatts in our bookings number this quarter, we have an option to expand the project to a total of 160 megawatts, subject to satisfaction of certain PPA contract conditions and based on the load increase high-potential MCE expansion. Construction on the project is anticipated to begin in 2019, with commissioning expected in 2020. 
CCAs are increasingly important providers of electricity to customers, both in California and a growing number of other states. CCAs offer their customers the benefit of local control, competitive power rates and access to a higher mix of renewable energy. MCE provides power to over 250,000 customers in California. And with the addition of other entrants in the CCA market in the coming months, the total CCA customer base in the state is expected to grow to approximately 1 million customers. We're excited to bring this -- to begin a new association with MCE and help make affordable clean power even more accessible. 
The growth of CCAs across the nation also mirrors the growth of community solar that is occurring across the United States. As we've highlighted last quarter, we have booked over 120 megawatts DC of module supply to community solar projects so far this year. These projects are only part of the rapid growth that is continuing in the community solar space across the United States. 
While the initial growth in community solar has been specific to certain states, the momentum continues to build. There are now community solar projects in 24 states, and 20 additional states are in the process of enacting community solar policies. In 2016 alone, 19 new utilities have started community solar programs. We continue to work closely with Clean Energy Collective and other community solar providers to identify new opportunities to facilitate market growth. 
Highlighting the growing scale of community solar projects, South Carolina Electric and Gas recently selected CEC to develop, construct and operate a 60-megawatt portfolio project. With a much lower cost than rooftop solar and the opportunity to rate base projects in certain situations, community solar is a utility-friendly model that is expected to grow substantially in coming years. 
Returning to the current quarter. We had module-only bookings of over 200 megawatts since our last call, bringing the total booking since the last call to nearly 250 megawatts. The largest of these module bookings, approximately 100 megawatts, was to supply our customer-awarded volume under the most recent French tender. Module shipments timing will be late Q4 2016 and into 2017. 
Outside the volume in France, we are seeing increasing geographical diversity in our module-only opportunities. Besides the U.S., we have bookings in Thailand, various countries across Asia and Latin America. 
As we look forward, we continue to see a number of opportunities that we anticipate will lead to growth -- to stronger module bookings in the next several months. 
As highlighted last quarter, there are a number of awarded projects which we have not yet converted to bookings. At this point, we have converted over 160 megawatts of these projects into bookings, and they are reflected in today's number, with additional 105 megawatts DC of opportunities related to projects awarded under the recent ARENA large-scale solar grant in Australia are awarded, but not booked volume, now stands at approximately 270 megawatts. As a highlight, the ARENA volume includes our first self-developed project in Australia. Keep in mind, this awarded volume is not reflected in Slides 5 and 6. 
Also not included in the bookings number are a number of O&M contracts which we have signed this year. 
With over 5 gigawatts of generation capacity in operation and more than 7 gigawatts of contracting capacity, First Solar is the recognized industry leader in providing O&M services for utility-scale solar power plants. With a complete end-to-end solution and a fleet availability of 99.6%, First Solar offers customers the compelling combination of expertise and proven performance. 
Our O&M business continues to grow, not only by securing contracts and projects where we perform the EPC, but also through third-party contracts. Year-to-date, we have signed 930 megawatts of third-party O&M agreements. In addition to signing agreements with existing customers, these recent bookings also include 6 new third-party customers. Beyond these third-party bookings, we have contracted over 540 megawatts of additional volume for projects we have constructed, bringing the total year-to-date O&M bookings to nearly 1.5 gigawatts. 
With additional advance-stage opportunity that is currently under negotiation, bookings could reach over 1.8 gigawatts by year end. 
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making in third-party O&M business and the stable revenue and earnings it provides. 
The lower module and system bookings this past quarter are primarily a result of the current module ASP and PPA pricing environment. Our strategy has been to pursue opportunities in markets where we can best leverage the energy over the advantage of our technology while maintaining discipline around returns. However, the willingness of other module manufacturers to continue ramping capacity and selling modules at very aggressive ASPs presents near-term challenges. The decline in ASP environment also led to some instances where customers have delayed signing agreements in hope of further pricing declines. While achieving a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio this year will be challenging, as we look to the fourth quarter, we have a number of bookings opportunities that we believe we are well positioned despite the current market environment. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll provide an update on our potential bookings opportunities, which has grown to over 25.4 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 1.4 gigawatts from the prior quarter. Our mid-to-late stage bookings opportunities are 1.1 gigawatts with the awarded volume discussed earlier included in this total. Approximately 1/3 of the late-stage opportunities are systems projects with the balance comprised of the module-only sales. The reduction in the mid-to-late stage opportunities since last quarter was approximately 700 megawatts. Of this amount, over 150 megawatts were due to projects that converted in bookings, another 350 megawatts of systems project opportunities were closed in both Egypt and South Africa due to uncertain market conditions in both countries. The remaining decrease was due to projects lost to aggressive pricing terms. In these situations, we chose to remain disciplined and not to match uneconomic pricing. 
The growth in the overall potential bookings opportunities is primarily driven by new project development opportunities, which we expect to be delivered in 2018 and beyond. The long-term demand driver for solar continues to be strong, and we are working actively to position ourselves to meet the long-term demand. 
On Slide 8, we have updated the geographic mix of our potential bookings. The increase in our potential bookings opportunities is primarily driven by new opportunities in the United States. One of the factors driving an increase in the United States potential bookings is the increase from C&I customers. This continues to develop into a promising utility-scale solar market that we feel we are well positioned to be successful in the upcoming years. Corporations globally have announced plans for renewal procurement that collectively total into tens of gigawatts. We currently have more than 2 gigawatts of active offers in progress today with C&I customers. Most of these projects are still early stage and have longer-dated CODs, but they represent another encouraging demand driver for the long-term growth of solar. One of the factors that provides First Solar an advantage in this market space is the sensitivity C&I customers have to reputational risk. They don't want to see a project fail or not be delivered. With our financial strength and our development track record, we are well positioned to meet their needs. 
Lastly, as announced recently, Alex Bradley has been appointed our new Chief Financial Officer. As you're aware, Alex has been serving as our interim CFO since July and has made a seamless transition from his previous responsibility as head of project finance and treasury. During his time at First Solar, Alex has led or supported the financing and sale of almost all of our utility-scale solar projects. The experience and skill Alex brings into this role will be a tremendous benefit to First Solar and its shareholders. Alex will now provide more detail on the third quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

First Solar's unique technology advantages and financial strength position the company for long-term success, and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead for us. 
Turning to the quarter. I'll start on Slide 11 with some operational highlights. We produced 779 megawatts DC in the third quarter, a decrease of 1% from the prior quarter. The slight decrease is due to an increase in upgrade activities across the fleet, partially offset by higher fleet efficiency. Relative to the third quarter of 2015, production was 19% higher as a result of higher module efficiency, increased capacity utilization and the addition of new capacity. 
[indiscernible] utilization was 97% in Q3, a decrease of 3 percentage points from the prior quarter. The lower utilization was also a result of increasing fleet upgrade activities. As compared to third quarter of 2015, capacity utilization increased by 3 percentage points. 
Fleet average module conversion efficiency increased to 16.5%, a 30 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter and a 70 basis point increase year-over-year. Module conversion efficiency on our best line averaged 16.6% [ph] in Q3. As Mark noted, [indiscernible] exited the quarter at 16.9%, highlighting the impact of recent improvement programs [indiscernible] 
Next on Slide 12, I'll discuss the P&L results for the third quarter. Net sales of $688 million, a decrease of $246 million compared to the prior quarter. The sales decrease resulted from lower systems revenue recognition on our Astoria [indiscernible] Kingbird and other projects. The lower systems revenues partially offset by an increase in module-only sales. As a percentage of total cautionary net sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules use in systems projects, decreased to 69% from 83% in the prior quarter as a result of the high mix of module-only sales. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 27% compared to 20% in the second quarter. Improvement in gross margin percentage resulted from a higher mix of third-party module sales as well as improved systems module, resulting from project cost reductions. The gross margin of our component segment was 32% in Q3 compared to 24% in Q2. The increase versus the prior quarter is primarily due to lower module cost per watt, improved efficiency and lower inventory write-downs. 
Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, were $93 million in Q3, a decrease of $4 million from the prior quarter. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower employee-related costs. Restructuring and asset impairment charges of $4 million in the quarter compared to $86 million in Q2. The restructuring charges are related to the actions announced in Q2, including discontinuing our TetraSun product, the disposition of Skytron and EPC reductions. The total charges for all these actions are now expected to be slightly lower in the range of $105 million to $115 million compared to the $105 million to $120 million range we originally anticipated, with most of the impact in 2016. Operating expense savings from these actions is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $45 million per annum. Excluding restructuring-related items, operating income was $93 million for the third quarter compared to $95 million in the prior quarter. The decrease is due to lower revenue, partially offset by higher gross margin percentage and lower operating expenses. 
Other income of $6 million in the third quarter, primarily due to the resolution of outstanding asset with a former customer. Second quarter other income was $7 million, mainly due to reversal of outstanding contingent consideration related to the TetraSun acquisition. 
We had a tax benefit of $51 million in Q3 compared to tax expense of $9 million in the second quarter. As we indicated on our last quarter's call, in July, we received a favorable ruling from the foreign tax authority, which has resulted in a $35 million tax benefit to our Q3 results. Note that for purposes, our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance would exclude this benefit. The third quarter results also include a tax benefit of $13 million associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations on various uncertain tax position. The third quarter earnings were 100 -- $1.49 per fully diluted share on a GAAP basis and $1.22 on non-GAAP basis. This compares to earnings of $0.13 and non-GAAP earnings of $0.87 in the prior quarter. Please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS reconciliation. 
Turning to Slide 13. I'll discuss select balance sheet items and cash flow information. Cash and multiple securities increased $423 million to an ending balance of $2.1 billion. Our net cash position decreased slightly to $1.3 billion from $1.4 billion in the prior quarter as a result of continuing to construct certain projects on balance sheet. The increase in cash resulted primarily from borrowing on our revolving credit facility, with ongoing funding of several substantial projects on the balance sheet, the short-term borrowing on the revolver was necessary to fund domestic requirements while complying with certain statutory funding requirements. As we sell the projects we've been constructing on balance sheet, we expect to pay down the revolver in either Q4 of 2016 or Q1 of 2017. 
For the quarter, net working capital, including change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, decreased by over $430 million, primarily due to the increase in short-term borrowings. Excluding this item, net working capital would have increased primarily due to the growth in project assets. 
Total debt in the third quarter was $787 million, an increase of $554 million from the prior quarter. And as discussed previously, this increase was primarily due to the borrowing on the revolver. 
Cash flows used in operations were $76 million compared to cash flows used in operations of $75 million in Q2. Free cash flow is negative $132 million compared to negative free cash flow of $139 million last quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $46 million compared to $78 million in the prior quarter, and depreciation for the quarter is $52 million or approximately $1 million lower than the prior quarter. 
I'll now discuss the update to our full year 2016 on Slide 14. Firstly, keep in mind that, as Mark mentioned, we are in the process of evaluating certain decisions related to our production capacity, module product transitions and operating expense rationalization. As a result, our current year of 2016 guidance on a GAAP basis could be subject to change, depending upon the outcome of this process. To the extent that there are any changes to 2016 outlook, these will be provided on the 2017 guidance call on November 16. Also, as we've communicated over the course of the year, we constructed our guidance to account for the factors that could impact the timing of the large and complex project sales included in our forecast. As a result of this approach, we've been able to maintain our earnings per share guidance, even while our net sales guidance has been lowered. These rely [indiscernible] on certain project sales. It's important to keep this context in mind as we discuss the updates. 
Our net sales guidance has been revised to $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion from the prior guidance of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. This change is due to project timing as we now expect to complete the sale of our Moapa and California project in 2017. 
Regarding Moapa, we recently closed tax equity financing for project, received a portion of the cash in Q4. The marketing of the remaining cash equities generated considerable interest and expect that sale to close in Q1 of 2017. 
In relation to our Stateline projects, we've offered our remaining 34% interest to 8point3. The project sale is advancing expected to close by year-end. In the guidance that we provided today, we are including only a portion of the remaining 34% interest in the project, pending the final approval and closing the sale. As previously indicated, to the extent that we do sell the entire remaining interest in 2016, this will likely result in an earnings at or above the high end of the guidance range provided today. As a reminder, the profit from the remaining sale to 8point3 will be reflected below operating income and equity and earnings, and not in revenue and gross margin. 
Resulting from the changes in the timing of project sales, we're updating our gross margin guidance to 25.5% to 26% from 18.5% to 19% previously. The increase in the gross margin percentage is a reflection of both the relatively low gross margin associated with the Moapa and California Flats project we've been pushed out and also a lot of project cost savings achieved in Q3. 
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $480 million to $500 million and include $105 million to $115 million of restructuring-related charges. Note that the expected TetraSun charges have been lowered to a range of $90 million to $95 million from the prior range of up to $100 million. 
Non-GAAP guidance for our operating expenses, which excludes restructuring charges, have been reduced to $375 million to $385 million. [ph] We brought down the high end of this range from $400 million, reflecting our ongoing efforts to manage expenses. 
The non-GAAP operating income guidance has been narrowed to a range of $340 million to $370 million, reflecting the updated net sales and gross margin expectations. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate has been revised to a range of 8% to 10%, resulting from more favorable jurisdictional mix of income. And keep in mind that this excludes the impact of all restructuring actions and also excludes the impact of the $35 million tax benefit mentioned earlier. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $3.75 to $3.90. And on a non-GAAP basis, $4.30 to $4.50. As [indiscernible] earlier, we're maintaining the high end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.50 while tightening the low end to $4.30. The increase in the low end reflects the lower operating expenses and lower expected tax rate. The benefit of project cost reduction in Q3 also helps to offset the impact of the lower revenue from project pushouts. Included in the EPS range is expected Q4 sale of a portion of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar share of 8point3 earnings. The equity and earnings amount is approximately $110 million, net of tax. 
Also keep in mind that as mentioned last quarter, the net sales range and gross margin guidance include only a portion of the revenue and none of the deferred profit from the Kingbird sale. Similarly, the EPS guidance provide does not include the $0.16 [indiscernible] Kingbird earnings. Due to the tax equity structure on this project, all earnings have been deferred for the next several years. 
Our operating cash flow guidance provides a range of negative 100 breakeven from prior range of $500 million to $650 million, and the decrease was due to revised sales time in the Moapa and California Flats. 
We're lowering our capital expenditure guidance to revised range of $225 million to $275 million from the prior range of $275 million to $325 million. The timing of certain expenditures have now moved into 2017. 
Net cash guidance has been reduced to $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion as a result of the revised timing of project sales, partially offset by reduction in CapEx. And finally, we're also slightly reducing our shipment guidance for the year based on timing of certain shipments pushing into early 2017. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'll summarize our progress during the third quarter. Our financial results were solid. Revenue of $688 million, GAAP EPS of $1.49 to non-GAAP EPS of $1.22. We maintained the high end of our 2016 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS ranges at $3.90 and $4.50, respectively. Our module efficiency continues to improve steadily and our baseline efficiency exit Q3 running at 16.9%. Our bookings were, of course, lower than expected at approximately 250 megawatts. However, we continue to see growth in a number of potential booking opportunities, including the C&I customers. 
With that, we'll conclude the prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

I mean, our expectation is that a Series 6 product will deliver even better margin. So I wouldn't want to change our view long-term expectations around gross margin for our module-only sales. With our Series 4 product today, given the smaller form factor, it will make even today's pricing environment more challenging to achieve those types of margins, and we would obviously most likely see margins much lower than the 20%. That's what precipitates the need to transition to either Series 5 or 6 to normalize the form factor delta that we have today in the marketplace and generally drives the slightly lower value for the product. As it relates to Q4 and our mix of revenue, there is still some systems revenue in the fourth quarter, but you will see a significantly high portion of it be module-only sales."

With California flats and Moapa slated for '17 now, that brings in more than 500 megawatts of systems to '17. So how should we be thinking about volumes now for '17? Is it more of a 3.5-gigawatt target?"

If you look at the systems business today, we booked approximately 550 megawatts of system shipments in 2017 today. We have about one another 100 megawatts of relatively late-stage opportunities. It takes us to between 600 to 700 megawatts. Beyond that, we have seen some opportunities fall out of the pipeline. So as Mark mentioned in his comments earlier, in Egypt, we've seen some opportunities go by the wayside there based on development issues. And likewise, we passed on opportunities in India and Africa based on pricing where we will chase the pricing if [indiscernible] if it were going to be uneconomic for us. So if you look at 2017 today, I think we're confident in a 600 to 700-megawatt number in terms of the shipments, which is less than we hoped for, but we also continue to have a robust pipeline and continue to look for other opportunities."

So what's happened now with the drop in revenue, that drives a different result in terms of where is the income by jurisdictional mix with each jurisdictional mix has a different tax rate associated with it.

I want to make sure it's clear, is that if we can further cost reduce and then we're looking at ways to do that. The product will be highly competitive. So I don't wanted to be looked upon that it's a direct correlation that the ASPs to decline. And therefore, the product is not -- no longer competitive. It is an advantage product relative to Series 4 because it solves our difference in form factor, which drives -- generally drives the higher balance of plant cost. So it's a very valuable product from that standpoint. The challenge that was getting -- there is some incremental cost that we're adding to the model and in terms of rails and other things along those lines. So it can drive to a higher cost point than Series 4, but the general benefit of the larger form factor is offsetting the impact of that higher cost. What we're trying to find a way is that can we further cost reduce some of the incremental components for Series 5 or just about the material or other ways of driving out cost on Series 5 that we can get it to a position that we feel more comfortable in competing in marketplace and capturing the market risk profile that we would like. The other thing I think it's important to understand is that, if -- when we first embarked on our vision for Series 6, it was a little over a year ago. And we have had tremendous learning around Series 6 that dealt with some of the potential constraints or challenges and/or risk that we had with Series 6 when we first sat down and created the business case. If we had known everything that we know as of now for Series 6, we may have made a decision to go straight to Series 6, okay? So some of it is -- ASPs in this -- in the market decline, that's putting some pressure on Series 5. We've got a further cost reduce it. If we can do that, then we'll continue with the transition. However, we also have an opportunity to meaningfully pull forward Series 6 and getting that product into market faster. Then we just have to compare the trade-offs between the 2 and make a decision on which path we want to go. Series 6 at any price point that we're seeing in the market right now will exceed any of our expectations around margins and what we believe that business -- that entitlement should be. So we're very confident with the Series 6 around its efficiency as well as the cost entitlement, and generate all the energy yield benefits around temperature coefficient, spectral response, diffuse shading, everything you could possibly -- obviously, we've talked about around [indiscernible] technology still resides in Series 6.

We co",2023,"Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. We had another good quarter of financial results in Q3, with net sales of $688 million and an earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges and a foreign tax benefit, of $1.22. We continue to push forward on our technology roadmap, with our best line efficiency exiting the third quarter almost touching 17% at 16.9% efficiency. Our project execution was also strong as we continued construction on multiple utility-scale solar projects and continue to realize significant BoS savings. 
Despite the results of the past quarter, the rapidly evolving market pricing environment, as shown on Slide 5 -- 4, excuse me, present significant challenges to the upcoming year. While we will not be discussing our 2017 outlook on today's call, it is important to understand the dramatic pricing declines that the industry is currently experiencing and how we intend to respond. 
As we highlighted on our Q2 earnings call, we saw the module and PPA pricing environment that time as increasingly aggressive and challenging. However, the impact of the lower second half 2016 installs in China were only just becoming evident, and the weeks since that call, we've seen other module manufacturers continue to bring online new capacity in the face of the demand drop-off in China. As a result of the oversupply and growing inventories, module pricing has declined at a dramatic rate in the third quarter. 
Since quarter end, there has been some signs of potential stabilization as wafer and self-spot prices first leveled off then increased slightly. In addition, module AFPs have leveled off, perhaps finding the near-term floor as manufacturers clear inventory. 
As we said consistently and reiterated on our Q1 2016 earnings call, when an oversupply situation exists, our strategy is to take a disciplined approach to the market. This means that we may walk away from module supply opportunity if the economics do not make sense for us. 
During the past quarter, challenging pricing conditions dictated that in certain situations we needed to apply this strategy, which has impacted our near-term booking. But we continue to view the strategy as the most sensible long-term approach. In these types of oversupply situations, we also will look very closely at our module manufacturing capacity. Our goal is not to push supply into a saturated and margin-challenged market, but rather to balance production to meet demand. 
As a result of this strategy in current market conditions, we have begun the process of evaluating our module capacity for next year. Mostly connected to any capacity decisions is the timing of our Series 5 and Series 6 product transitions. In regard to Series 5, we are looking very hard at the cost structure and how to bring the module cost brought down further in this competitive environment. In terms of our Series 6 product, we have dedicated significant resources to focus on how to accelerate the roadmap and product availability. 
In the current ASP environment, without further cost reduction, Series 4 and Series 5 margins may be challenged. We expect that our Series 6 module would be our most competitive product and enable us to capture greater gross margin per watt. Beyond both pricing and capacity decisions, we are also focused on identifying ways to improve our operating expense profile, which will improve our competitiveness. 
We are progressing in our valuation of each of these initiatives. However, any final decisions are subject to our normal board review process. We will hold a separate call on November 16 to discuss the 2017 outlook and provide further update at that time. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'll provide an update on bookings activity since our last earnings call. As we announced in our recent press release, we have signed a PPA of up to 160 megawatts with MCE, a leading community choice aggregator in California. While we are only including 40 megawatts in our bookings number this quarter, we have an option to expand the project to a total of 160 megawatts, subject to satisfaction of certain PPA contract conditions and based on the load increase high-potential MCE expansion. Construction on the project is anticipated to begin in 2019, with commissioning expected in 2020. 
CCAs are increasingly important providers of electricity to customers, both in California and a growing number of other states. CCAs offer their customers the benefit of local control, competitive power rates and access to a higher mix of renewable energy. MCE provides power to over 250,000 customers in California. And with the addition of other entrants in the CCA market in the coming months, the total CCA customer base in the state is expected to grow to approximately 1 million customers. We're excited to bring this -- to begin a new association with MCE and help make affordable clean power even more accessible. 
The growth of CCAs across the nation also mirrors the growth of community solar that is occurring across the United States. As we've highlighted last quarter, we have booked over 120 megawatts DC of module supply to community solar projects so far this year. These projects are only part of the rapid growth that is continuing in the community solar space across the United States. 
While the initial growth in community solar has been specific to certain states, the momentum continues to build. There are now community solar projects in 24 states, and 20 additional states are in the process of enacting community solar policies. In 2016 alone, 19 new utilities have started community solar programs. We continue to work closely with Clean Energy Collective and other community solar providers to identify new opportunities to facilitate market growth. 
Highlighting the growing scale of community solar projects, South Carolina Electric and Gas recently selected CEC to develop, construct and operate a 60-megawatt portfolio project. With a much lower cost than rooftop solar and the opportunity to rate base projects in certain situations, community solar is a utility-friendly model that is expected to grow substantially in coming years. 
Returning to the current quarter. We had module-only bookings of over 200 megawatts since our last call, bringing the total booking since the last call to nearly 250 megawatts. The largest of these module bookings, approximately 100 megawatts, was to supply our customer-awarded volume under the most recent French tender. Module shipments timing will be late Q4 2016 and into 2017. 
Outside the volume in France, we are seeing increasing geographical diversity in our module-only opportunities. Besides the U.S., we have bookings in Thailand, various countries across Asia and Latin America. 
As we look forward, we continue to see a number of opportunities that we anticipate will lead to growth -- to stronger module bookings in the next several months. 
As highlighted last quarter, there are a number of awarded projects which we have not yet converted to bookings. At this point, we have converted over 160 megawatts of these projects into bookings, and they are reflected in today's number, with additional 105 megawatts DC of opportunities related to projects awarded under the recent ARENA large-scale solar grant in Australia are awarded, but not booked volume, now stands at approximately 270 megawatts. As a highlight, the ARENA volume includes our first self-developed project in Australia. Keep in mind, this awarded volume is not reflected in Slides 5 and 6. 
Also not included in the bookings number are a number of O&M contracts which we have signed this year. 
With over 5 gigawatts of generation capacity in operation and more than 7 gigawatts of contracting capacity, First Solar is the recognized industry leader in providing O&M services for utility-scale solar power plants. With a complete end-to-end solution and a fleet availability of 99.6%, First Solar offers customers the compelling combination of expertise and proven performance. 
Our O&M business continues to grow, not only by securing contracts and projects where we perform the EPC, but also through third-party contracts. Year-to-date, we have signed 930 megawatts of third-party O&M agreements. In addition to signing agreements with existing customers, these recent bookings also include 6 new third-party customers. Beyond these third-party bookings, we have contracted over 540 megawatts of additional volume for projects we have constructed, bringing the total year-to-date O&M bookings to nearly 1.5 gigawatts. 
With additional advance-stage opportunity that is currently under negotiation, bookings could reach over 1.8 gigawatts by year end. 
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making in third-party O&M business and the stable revenue and earnings it provides. 
The lower module and system bookings this past quarter are primarily a result of the current module ASP and PPA pricing environment. Our strategy has been to pursue opportunities in markets where we can best leverage the energy over the advantage of our technology while maintaining discipline around returns. However, the willingness of other module manufacturers to continue ramping capacity and selling modules at very aggressive ASPs presents near-term challenges. The decline in ASP environment has also led to some instances where customers have delayed signing agreements in hope of further pricing declines. 
While achieving a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio, this year will be challenging. As we look to the fourth quarter, we have a number of bookings opportunities that we believe we are well positioned despite the current market environment. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll provide an update on our potential bookings opportunities, which has grown to over 25.4 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 1.4 gigawatts from the prior quarter. 
Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities are 1.1 gigawatts, with the awarded volume discussed earlier included in this total. Approximately 1/3 of the late-stage opportunities are systems projects, with the balance comprised of the module-only sales. The reduction in the mid- to late-stage opportunities since last quarter was approximately 700 megawatts. Of this amount, over 150 megawatts were due to projects that converted into bookings. Another 350 megawatts of systems project opportunities were closed in both Egypt and South Africa due to uncertain market conditions in both countries. The remaining decrease was due to projects lost to aggressive pricing terms. In these situations, we chose to remain disciplined and not to match uneconomic pricing. 
The growth in the overall potential bookings opportunities is primarily driven by new project development opportunities which we expect to be delivered in 2018 and beyond. 
The long-term demand driver for solar continues to be strong, and we are working actively to position ourselves to meet the long-term demand. 
On Slide 8, we have updated the geographic mix of our potential bookings. The increase in our potential bookings opportunities is primarily driven by new opportunities in the United States. One of the factors driving the increase in the United States potential bookings is the increase from C&I customers. This continues to develop into a promising utility-scale solar market that we feel we are well positioned to be successful in, in the upcoming years. Corporations globally have announced plans for renewable procurement that collectively total into tens of gigawatts. We currently have more than 2 gigawatts of active offers in progress today with C&I customers. Most of these projects are still early stage and have longer-dated CODs, but they represent another encouraging demand driver for the long-term growth of solar. One of the factors that provides First Solar an advantage in this market space is the sensitivity C&I customers have to reputational risk. They don't want to see a project fail or not be delivered. With our financial strength and our development track record, we are well positioned to meet their needs. 
Lastly, as announced recently, Alex Bradley has been appointed our new Chief Financial Officer. As you're aware, Alex has been serving as our interim CFO since July and has made a seamless transition from his previous responsibility as Head of Project Finance and Treasury. During his time at First Solar, Alex has led or supported the financing and sale of almost all of our utility-scale solar projects. The experience and skill Alex brings into his role will be a tremendous benefit to First Solar and its shareholders. 
Alex will now provide more detail on the third quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

Before going into the quarter results, I want to express my excitement of the opportunity to take on the role as CFO of First Solar. 
Since I joined the company in 2008, the solar industry has changed enormously and it continues to evolve at a rapid pace. First Solar's unique technology advantages and financial strength position the company for long-term success, and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead for us. 
Turning to the quarter. I'll start on Slide 11 with some operational highlights. We produced 779 megawatts DC in the third quarter, a decrease of 1% from the prior quarter. The slight decrease is due to an increase in upgrade activities across the fleet, partially offset by higher fleet efficiency. Relative to the third quarter of 2015, production was 19% higher as a result of higher module efficiency, increased capacity utilization and the addition of new capacity. 
Factory capacity utilization was 97% in Q3, a decrease of 3 percentage points from the prior quarter. The lower utilization was also a result of increase in fleet upgrade activities. And as compared to third quarter of 2015, capacity utilization increased by 3 percentage points. 
Fleet average module conversion efficiency increased to 16.5%, a 30 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter and a 70 basis point increase year-over-year. Module conversion efficiency on our best line averaged 16.6% in Q3. And as Mark noted, our lead line exited the quarter at 16.9%, highlighting the impact of recent improvement programs deployed.
Next, on Slide 12, I'll discuss the P&L results for the third quarter. Net sales of $688 million, a decrease of $246 million compared to the prior quarter. The sales decrease resulted from lower systems revenue recognition on our Astoria, Silver State South, Kingbird and other projects. The lower systems revenue was partially offset by an increase in module-only sales. 
As a percentage of total cautionary net sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the systems project, decreased to 69% from 83% in the prior quarter as a result of the high mix of module-only sales. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 27% compared to 20% in the second quarter. Improvement in gross margin percentage resulted from a higher mix of third-party module sales as well as improved systems module, resulting from project cost reductions. 
The gross margin of our component segment was 32% in Q3 compared to 24% in Q2. The increase versus the prior quarter was primarily due to lower module cost per watt and improved efficiency, and lower inventory write-downs. 
Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, were $93 million in Q3, a decrease of $4 million from the prior quarter. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower employee-related costs. 
Restructuring and asset impairment charges were $4 million in the quarter compared to $86 million in Q2. The restructuring charges are related to the actions announced in Q2, including discontinuing our TetraSun product, the disposition of skytron and EPC reductions. 
The total charges for all these actions is now expected to be slightly lower in the range of $105 million to $115 million compared to the $105 million to $120 million range originally anticipated, with most of the impact in 2016. 
Operating expense savings from these actions is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $45 million per annum. 
Excluding restructuring-related items, operating income was $93 million for the third quarter compared to $95 million in the prior quarter. The decrease is due to lower revenue, partially offset by higher gross margin percentage and lower operating expenses. 
Other income of $6 million in the third quarter, primarily due to the resolution of an outstanding matter with a former customer. 
Second quarter other income was $7 million, mainly due to reversal of outstanding contingent consideration related to the TetraSun acquisition. 
We had a tax benefit of $51 million in Q3 compared to tax expenses of $9 million in the second quarter. As we indicated on our last quarter's call, in July, we received a favorable ruling from the foreign tax authority, which has resulted in a $35 million tax benefit to our Q3 results. 
Note that for purposes of our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance, we had excluded this benefit. 
The third quarter results also include a tax benefit of $13 million associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations on various uncertain tax position. 
Third quarter earnings were 100 -- $1.49 per fully diluted share on a GAAP basis and $1.22 on non-GAAP basis. This compares to earnings of $0.13 and non-GAAP earnings of $0.87 in the prior quarter. And please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS reconciliation. 
Turning to Slide 13. I'll discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. 
Cash and multiple securities increased $423 million to an ending balance of $2.1 billion. Our net cash position decreased slightly to $1.3 billion from $1.4 billion in the prior quarter as a result of continuing to construct certain projects on balance sheet. The increase in cash resulted primarily from borrowing on our revolving credit facility. With ongoing funding of several substantial projects on the balance sheet, the short-term borrowing on the revolver was necessary to fund domestic requirements while complying with certain statutory funding requirements. As we settle the projects we've been constructing on balance sheet, we expect to pay down the revolver in either Q4 of 2016 or Q1 of 2017. 
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, decreased by over $430 million, primarily due to the increase in short-term borrowings. Excluding this item, net working capital would have increased primarily due to the growth in project assets. 
Total debt in the third quarter was $787 million, an increase of $554 million from the prior quarter. And as discussed previously, this increase was primarily due to the borrowing under the revolver. 
Cash flows used in operations were $76 million compared to cash flows used in operations of $75 million in Q2. 
Free cash flow is negative $132 million compared to negative free cash flow of $139 million last quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $46 million compared to $78 million in the prior quarter, and depreciation for the quarter was $52 million or approximately $1 million lower than the prior quarter. 
I'll now discuss the update to our full year 2016 on Slide 14. Firstly, keep in mind that as Mark mentioned, we are in the process of evaluating certain decisions related to our production capacity, module product transitions and operating expense rationalization. As a result, our current view of 2016 guidance on a GAAP basis could be subject to change, depending upon the outcome of this process. To the extent there are any changes to 2016 outlook, these will be provided on the 2017 guidance call on November 16. 
Also, as we've communicated over the course of the year, we constructed our guidance to account for the factors that could impact the timing of the large and complex project sales included in our forecast. As a result of this approach, we've been able to maintain our earnings per share guidance even while our net sales guidance has been lowered. These rely on timing of certain project sales. It's important to keep this context in mind as we discuss the updates. 
Our net sales guidance has been revised to $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion from the prior guidance of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. This change is due to project timing, as we now expect to complete the sale of our Moapa and California Flats project in 2017. 
Regarding Moapa, we recently closed tax equity financing for the project and received a portion of the cash in Q4. The marketing of the remaining cash equity has generated considerable interest and we expect that sale to close in Q1 of 2017. 
In relation to our Stateline project, we've offered our remaining 34% interest to 8point3. The project sale is advancing and is expected to close by year end. 
In the guidance that we provided today, we are including only a portion of the remaining 34% interest in the project, pending the final approval and closing of the sale. As previously indicated, to the extent that we do sell the entire remaining interest in 2016, this will likely result in earnings at or above the high end of the guidance range provided today. As a reminder, the profit from the remaining sale to 8point3 will be reflected below operating income and equity and earnings, and not in revenue and gross margin. 
Resulting from the changes and the timing of project sales, we're updating our gross margin guidance to 25.5% to 26% from 18.5% to 19% previously. The increase in the gross margin percentage is a reflection of both the relatively low gross margin associated with the Moapa and California Flats project that have been pushed out and also a lot of project cost savings achieved in Q3. 
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $480 million to $500 million and include $105 million to $115 million of restructuring-related charges. 
Note that the expected TetraSun charges have been lowered to a range of $90 million to $95 million from the prior range of up to $100 million. 
Non-GAAP guidance for our operating expenses, which excludes restructuring charges, have been reduced to $375 million to $385 million. We brought down the high end of this range from $400 million, reflecting our ongoing efforts to manage expenses. 
The non-GAAP operating income guidance has been narrowed to a range of $340 million to $370 million, reflecting the updated net sales and gross margin expectations. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate has been revised to a range of 8% to 10%, resulting from a favorable jurisdictional mix of income. And keep in mind that this excludes the impact of all restructuring actions and also excludes the impact of the $35 million tax benefit mentioned earlier. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $3.75 to $3.90. And on a non-GAAP basis, $4.30 to $4.50. As touched upon earlier, we're maintaining the high end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.50 while tightening our low end to $4.30. The increase in the low end reflects the lower operating expenses and lower expected tax rate.  The benefit of project cost reductions in Q3 also helped to offset the impact of the lower revenue from project push-outs. 
Included in the EPS range is the expected Q4 sale of a portion of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar's share of 8point3's earnings. The equity and earnings amount is approximately $110 million, net of tax. 
Also keep in mind that as mentioned last quarter, the net sales range and gross margin guidance include only a portion of the revenue and none of the deferred profit from the Kingbird sale. Similarly, the EPS guidance provided does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. Due to the tax equity structure on this project, all earnings have been deferred for the next several years. 
Our operating cash flow guidance is revised to a range of negative $100 million breakeven from prior range of $500 million to $650 million, and the decrease was due to revised sale timing of Moapa and California Flats. 
We're lowering our capital expenditure guidance to a revised range of $225 million to $275 million from the prior range of $275 million to $325 million. The timing of certain expenditures have now moved into 2017. 
Net cash guidance has been reduced to $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion as a result of the revised timing of project sales, partially offset by a reduction in CapEx. 
And finally, we're also slightly reducing our shipment guidance for the year based on timing of certain shipments pushing into early 2017. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'll summarize our progress during the third quarter. Our financial results were solid. Revenue of $688 million, GAAP EPS of $1.49 to non-GAAP EPS of $1.22. We maintained the high end of our 2016 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS ranges at $3.90 and $4.50, respectively. Our module efficiency continues to improve steadily, and our best line efficiency exited Q3 running at 16.9%. Our bookings this quarter were lower than expected at approximately 250 megawatts. However, we continue to see growth in a number of potential booking opportunities, including with C&I customers. 
With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

So I think NextEra and Southern Company announced that based on how they view the economics and risk reward of solar projects, they are going to perhaps reduce spending in solar and look more to wind. I think that neither has said that they're going to be exiting the solar market. And we clearly have good relationships with both of those 2 counterparties. They'll still be looking for high-quality assets, and I think we're both -- we're well positioned to meet these opportunities. What we have seen, clearly, in the latter half of '16 and going to '17 is there is a somewhat of a scarcity of tax capacity for large utility-scale assets. That being said, given the ITC extension timing, there's also a dearth of assets going into 2017. So we think the 2 have somewhat balanced out, although there may be a little more challenging tax capacity issues with some players. The other thing I would say is that we feel that we bring extremely high-quality projects to the market. And given both the quality of the project, the development and the relationships we have with counterparties in the market, we don't see a significant constraint today for us in finding buyers and tax capacity for assets. It may be that further down the chain, there are some people who are struggling, but we're still not seeing that reflected in our markets today."

Our expectation is that a Series 6 product will deliver even better margin. So I wouldn't want to change our view of the long-term expectations around gross margin for our module-only sales. With our Series 4 product today, given the smaller form factor, it will make it within today's pricing environment more challenging to achieve those types of margins, and we would obviously most likely see margins much lower than the 20%. That's what precipitates the need to transition to either a Series 5 or 6 to normalize the form factor delta that we have today in the marketplace and generally drive a slightly lower value for the product. As it relates to Q4 and our mix of revenue, there is still some systems revenue in the fourth quarter, but you will see a significantly high portion of that being module-only sales."

That takes us to between 600 to 700 megawatts. Beyond that, we have seen some opportunities pull out of the pipeline. So as Mark mentioned in his comments earlier, in Egypt, we've seen some opportunities go by the wayside there based on development issues. And likewise, we passed on some opportunities in India and Africa based on pricing, where we won't chase the pricing bottom and we won't go into deals that are uneconomic for us. So if you look at 2017 today, I think we're confident in a 600- to 700-megawatt number in terms of the shipments, which is less than we'd hoped for, but we also continue to have a robust pipeline and continue to look for other opportunities."

The other piece, the 2 assets we're referencing, both Moapa and Cal Flats, are legacy assets that had some unique challenges to them that made them lower gross margins than you would otherwise see on the on our typical systems business. The Moapa is an asset that we acquired in late-stage development and, therefore, paid a development premium to acquire. On Cal Flats, we have one discrete development issue, which, if resolved, would increase that margin significantly. But that's not currently in the guidance numbers. But those 2 assets have some unique differences from what I would say is a typical development project. If you look out into 2017, we don't have, I think, significant similar challenges on the assets that we have in 2017. And then going out beyond that, the majority of our California pipeline out to 2018 and 2019 is at higher margin levels that we think are more expected and acceptable for our systems development business."

First off, is we highlighted that we had a favorable ruling on an item in an international jurisdiction, which was worth about $35 million or about $0.35. We -- that is in our GAAP numbers, but that's not reflected in our non-GAAP numbers, okay? So that's kind of the primary delta between the 2. The other side of it is relative to our prior outlook on the tax rate, we have a favorable mix of income. So what's happened now with the drop in revenue, that drives a different result in terms of where is the income by jurisdictional mix, which each jurisdictional mix has a different tax rate associated with it. And as you know, we have a tax holiday in Malaysia. So more of the income that's represented in Malaysia as a percent of the total will drive down the overall tax rate. So that's kind of the events that are driving the change in the tax rate both on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis from the prior guidance that we provided in Q2 earnings call. Brian, I'm not really sure how you're getting the $0.80 or so for Moapa and CA Flat. I think Paul had it right when he referenced it, when you look at the revenue delta, which was close to $1 billion and if you look at the gross margin rate increasing. But when you look at the total gross margin dollars not changing significantly, you would look to it and say, ""Well, that would imply that the gross margin on both of those assets is lower than normally expected for a system business."" And I think Alex walked through that as well. So we can take that offline, if you like. We can spend more time with you, but you should not get anywhere close to -- I think you referenced around $0.80 of value for the pushout of those 2 projects. It will be significantly lower than that."

It's a recurring annuity stream, relatively high fixed cost, therefore, a variable line flows through at a very high contribution rate. And the profile on the business, if you look at it over time, the margins can range -- the margin, on average, are above the average for the business. They also will be much higher, let's say, in the first 5 or 6 years of the contract. So if you look at the performance of the plan as well as the warranties that you have with the inverter manufacturers and others, you'll generally realize much higher margins within the first 5 to 7 years. And then as you approach just kind of 10 to 15 years, you may see margins start to drop off a little bit, especially if you had to do overall -- inherent overall maintenance and those types of things. But it's a good margin business, it's one that is really based off of scale, and we are looking to -- we have a strong presence here in the U.S. We're looking to grow it and capture the benefit of the infrastructure through our network operating center and other investments that we've made over the years to monitor plants and try to find other ways to optimize the performance of the plants that there's -- it's a good base business that has great opportunity to continue to grow.

Around Series 5, in particular, is that -- what we are focused on Series 5, and I want to make sure it's clear, is that if we can further cost reduce it, and we're looking at ways to do that, the product will be highly competitive. So I don't want it to be looked upon is that it's a direct correlation that the ASPs have declined and, therefore, the product is not -- no longer competitive. It is an advantage product relative to Series 4 because it solves our difference in form factor, which drives -- generally drives the higher balance of plant cost. So it's a very valuable product from that standpoint. The challenge that was getting -- some are -- there is some incremental costs that we're adding to the module and -- in terms of back rails and other things along those lines. So it can drive to a higher cost point than Series 4, but the general benefits of the larger form factor is offsetting the impact of that higher cost. What we're trying to find a way is that can we further cost reduce some of the incremental components for Series 5 or just about the building material or other ways of driving out cost on Series 5 that we can get it to a position that we feel more comfortable in competing in the marketplace and capturing the market profile that we would like. The other thing I think that's important to understand is that if -- when we first embarked around our vision for Series 6, it was a little over a year ago. And we have had tremendous learnings around Series 6 that have dealt with some of the potential constraints or challenges and/or risk that we had with Series 6 when we first sat down and created the business case. If we had known everything that we know as of now for Series 6, we may have made a decision to go straight to Series 6, okay? So some of it is, look, the ASPs in the market have declined, that's putting some pressure on Series 5. We've got to further cost reduce it. If we can do that, then we'll continue with the transition. However, we also have an opportunity to meaningfully pull forward Series 6 and getting that product into market faster. Then we just have to compare the trade-offs between the 2 and make a decision on which path we want to go. Series 6, at any price point that we're seeing in the market right now, will exceed any of our expectations around margins of what we believe that business -- that entitlement should be. So we're very confident with the Series 6 around its efficiency as well as the cost entitlement, and it generates all of the energy yield benefits around temperature coefficient, spectral response, diffuse shading, everything you could possibly -- obviously, that we've talked about around corridor technology, it still resides in Series 6. We can just have much higher efficiency, much greater energy density at a much lower cost point."

So there is some impact to that as PPA prices, in some markets, have gotten very aggressive, but the inherent energy value is still there. The percent deltas are still there.

We co",2025,"Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. We had another good quarter of financial results in Q3, with net sales of $688 million and an earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges and a foreign tax benefit, of $1.22. We continue to push forward on our technology roadmap, with our best line efficiency exiting the third quarter almost touching 17% at 16.9% efficiency. Our project execution was also strong as we continued construction on multiple utility-scale solar projects and continue to realize significant BoS savings. 
Despite the results of the past quarter, the rapidly evolving market pricing environment, as shown on Slide 5 -- 4, excuse me, present significant challenges to the upcoming year. While we will not be discussing our 2017 outlook on today's call, it is important to understand the dramatic pricing declines that the industry is currently experiencing and how we intend to respond. 
As we highlighted on our Q2 earnings call, we saw the module and PPA pricing environment that time as increasingly aggressive and challenging. However, the impact of the lower second half 2016 installs in China were only just becoming evident, and in the weeks since that call, we've seen other module manufacturers continue to bring online new capacity in the face of the demand drop-off in China. As a result of the oversupply and growing inventories, module pricing has declined at a dramatic rate in the third quarter. 
Since quarter end, there has been some signs of potential stabilization as wafer and sale of [ph] spot prices first leveled off then increased slightly. In addition, module AFPs have leveled off, perhaps finding the near-term floor as manufacturers clear inventory. 
As we said consistently and reiterated on our Q1 2016 earnings call, when an oversupply situation exists, our strategy is to take a disciplined approach to the market. This means that we may walk away from module supply opportunity if the economics do not make sense for us. 
During the past quarter, challenging pricing conditions dictated that in certain situations we needed to apply this strategy, which has impacted our near-term booking. But we continue to view the strategy as the most sensible long-term approach. In these types of oversupply situations, we also will look very closely at our module manufacturing capacity. Our goal is not to push supply into a saturated and margin-challenged market, but rather to balance production to meet demand. 
As a result of this strategy and current market conditions, we have begun the process of evaluating our module capacity for next year. Mostly connected to any capacity decisions is the timing of our Series 5 and Series 6 product transitions. In regard to Series 5, we are looking very hard at the cost structure and how to bring the module cost per watt down further in this competitive environment. In terms of our Series 6 product, we have dedicated significant resources to focus on how to accelerate the roadmap and product availability. 
In the current ASP environment, without further cost reduction, Series 4 and Series 5 margins may be challenged. We expect that our Series 6 module would be our most competitive product and enable us to capture greater gross margin per watt. Beyond both pricing and capacity decisions, we are also focused on identifying ways to improve our operating expense profile, which would improve our competitiveness. 
We are progressing in our evaluation of each of these initiatives. However, any final decisions are subject to our normal board review process. We will hold a separate call on November 16 to discuss the 2017 outlook and provide further update at that time. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'll provide an update on bookings activity since our last earnings call. As we announced in our recent press release, we have signed a PPA of up to 160 megawatts with MCE, a leading community choice aggregator in California. While we are only including 40 megawatts in our bookings number this quarter, we have an option to expand the project to a total of 160 megawatts, subject to satisfaction of certain PPA contract conditions and based on the load increase from potential MCE expansion. Construction on the project is anticipated to begin in 2019, with commissioning expected in 2020. 
CCAs are increasingly important providers of electricity to customers, both in California and a growing number of other states. CCAs offer their customers the benefit of local control, competitive power rates and access to a higher mix of renewable energy. MCE provides power to over 250,000 customers in California. And with the addition of other entrants in the CCA market in the coming months, the total CCA customer base in the state is expected to grow to approximately 1 million customers. We're excited to bring this -- to begin a new association with MCE and help make affordable clean power even more accessible. 
The growth of CCAs across the nation also mirrors the growth of community solar that is occurring across the United States. As we've highlighted last quarter, we have booked over 120 megawatts DC of module supply to community solar projects so far this year. These projects are only part of the rapid growth that is continuing in the community solar space across the United States. 
While the initial growth in community solar has been specific to certain states, the momentum continues to build. There are now community solar projects in 24 states, and 20 additional states are in the process of enacting community solar policies. In 2016 alone, 19 new utilities have started community solar programs. We continue to work closely with Clean Energy Collective and other community solar providers to identify new opportunities to facilitate market growth. 
Highlighting the growing scale of community solar projects, South Carolina Electric and Gas recently selected CEC to develop, construct and operate a 60-megawatt portfolio project. With a much lower cost than rooftop solar and the opportunity to rate base projects in certain situations, community solar is a utility-friendly model that is expected to grow substantially in coming years. 
Returning to the current quarter. We had module-only bookings of over 200 megawatts since our last call, bringing the total booking since the last call to nearly 250 megawatts. The largest of these module bookings, approximately 100 megawatts, was to supply our customer-awarded volume under the most recent French tender. Module shipments timing will be late Q4 2016 and into 2017. 
Outside the volume in France, we are seeing increasing geographical diversity in our module-only opportunities. Besides the U.S., we have bookings in Thailand, various countries across Asia and Latin America. 
As we look forward, we continue to see a number of opportunities that we anticipate will lead to growth -- to stronger module bookings in the next several months. 
As highlighted last quarter, there are a number of awarded projects which we have not yet converted to bookings. At this point, we have converted over 160 megawatts of these projects into bookings, and they are reflected in today's number, with additional 105 megawatts DC of opportunities related to projects awarded under the recent ARENA large-scale solar grant in Australia, our awarded, but not booked volume now stands at approximately 270 megawatts. As a highlight, the ARENA volume includes our first self-developed project in Australia. Keep in mind, this awarded volume is not reflected in Slides 5 and 6. 
Also not included in the bookings number are a number of O&M contracts which we have signed this year. 
With over 5 gigawatts of generation capacity in operation and more than 7 gigawatts of contracting capacity, First Solar is the recognized industry leader in providing O&M services for utility-scale solar power plants. With a complete end-to-end solution and a fleet availability of 99.6%, First Solar offers customers the compelling combination of expertise and proven performance. 
Our O&M business continues to grow, not only by securing contracts on projects where we perform the EPC, but also through third-party contracts. Year-to-date, we have signed 930 megawatts of third-party O&M agreements. In addition to signing agreements with existing customers, these recent bookings also include 6 new third-party customers. Beyond these third-party bookings, we have contracted over 540 megawatts of additional volume for projects we have constructed, bringing the total year-to-date O&M bookings to nearly 1.5 gigawatts. 
With additional advance-stage opportunities currently under negotiation, bookings could reach over 1.8 gigawatts by yearend. 
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making in third-party O&M business and the stable revenue and earnings it provides. 
The lower module and system bookings this past quarter are primarily a result of the current module ASP and PPA pricing environment. Our strategy has been to pursue opportunities in markets where we can best leverage the energy yield advantage of our technology while maintaining discipline around returns. However, the willingness of other module manufacturers to continue ramping capacity and selling modules at very aggressive ASPs presents near-term challenges. The decline in ASP environment has also led to some instances where customers have delayed signing agreements in hope of further pricing declines. 
While achieving a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio, this year will be challenging. As we look to the fourth quarter, we have a number of bookings opportunities that we believe we are well positioned despite the current market environment. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll provide an update on our potential bookings opportunities, which has grown to over 25.4 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 1.4 gigawatts from the prior quarter. 
Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities are 1.1 gigawatts, with the awarded volume discussed earlier included in this total. Approximately 1/3 of the late-stage opportunities are systems projects, with the balance comprised of the module-only sales. The reduction in the mid- to late-stage opportunities since last quarter was approximately 700 megawatts. Of this amount, over 150 megawatts were due to projects that converted into bookings. Another 350 megawatts of systems project opportunities were closed in both Egypt and South Africa due to uncertain market conditions in both countries. The remaining decrease was due to projects lost to aggressive pricing terms. In these situations, we chose to remain disciplined and not to match uneconomic pricing. 
The growth in the overall potential bookings opportunities is primarily driven by new project development opportunities which we expect to be delivered in 2018 and beyond. 
The long-term demand driver for solar continues to be strong, and we are working actively to position ourselves to meet the long-term demand. 
On Slide 8, we have updated the geographic mix of our potential bookings. The increase in our potential bookings opportunities is primarily driven by new opportunities in the United States. One of the factors driving the increase in the United States potential bookings is the increase from C&I customers. This continues to develop into a promising utility-scale solar market that we feel we are well positioned to be successful in, in the upcoming years. Corporations globally have announced plans for renewable procurement that collectively total into tens of gigawatts. 
We currently have more than 2 gigawatts of active offers in progress today with C&I customers. Most of these projects are still early stage and have longer-dated CODs, but they represent another encouraging demand driver for the long-term growth of solar. One of the factors that provides First Solar an advantage in this market space is the sensitivity C&I customers have to reputational risk. They don't want to see a project fail or not be delivered. With our financial strength and our development track record, we are well positioned to meet their needs. 
Lastly, as announced recently, Alex Bradley has been appointed our new Chief Financial Officer. As you're aware, Alex has been serving as our interim CFO since July and has made a seamless transition from his previous responsibility as Head of Project Finance and Treasury. During his time at First Solar, Alex has led or supported the financing and sale of almost all of our utility-scale solar projects. The experience and skill Alex brings into his role will be a tremendous benefit to First Solar and its shareholders. 
Alex will now provide more detail on the third quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

Since I joined the company in 2008, the solar industry has changed enormously and it continues to evolve at a rapid pace. First Solar's unique technology advantages and financial strength position the company for long-term success, and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead for us. 
Turning to the quarter. I'll start on Slide 11 with some operational highlights. We produced 779 megawatts DC in the third quarter, a decrease of 1% from the prior quarter. The slight decrease is due to an increase in upgrade activities across the fleet, partially offset by higher fleet efficiency. Relative to the third quarter of 2015, production was 19% higher as a result of higher module efficiency, increased capacity utilization and the addition of new capacity. 
Factory capacity utilization was 97% in Q3, a decrease of 3 percentage points from the prior quarter. The lower utilization was also a result of increase in fleet upgrade activities. And as compared to third quarter of 2015, capacity utilization increased by 3 percentage points. 
Fleet average module conversion efficiency increased to 16.5%, a 30 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter and a 70 basis point increase year-over-year. Module conversion efficiency on our best line averaged 16.6% in Q3. And as Mark noted, our lead line exited the quarter at 16.9%, highlighting the impact of recent improvement programs deployed.
Next, on Slide 12, I'll discuss the P&L results for the third quarter. Net sales of $688 million, a decrease of $246 million compared to the prior quarter. The sales decrease resulted from lower systems revenue recognition on our Astoria, Silver State South, Kingbird and other projects. The lower systems revenue was partially offset by an increase in module-only sales. 
As a percentage of total cautionary net sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the systems project, decreased to 69% from 83% in the prior quarter as a result of the high mix of module-only sales. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 27% compared to 20% in the second quarter. Improvement in gross margin percentage resulted from a higher mix of third-party module sales as well as improved systems module, resulting from project cost reductions. 
The gross margin of our component segment was 32% in Q3 compared to 24% in Q2. The increase versus the prior quarter was primarily due to lower module cost per watt, from improved efficiency, and lower inventory write-downs. 
Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, were $93 million in Q3, a decrease of $4 million from the prior quarter. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower employee-related costs. 
Restructuring and asset impairment charges were $4 million in the quarter compared to $86 million in Q2. The restructuring charges are related to the actions announced in Q2, including discontinuing our TetraSun product, the disposition of skytron and EPC reductions. 
The total charges for all these actions is now expected to be slightly lower in the range of $105 million to $115 million compared to the $105 million to $120 million range originally anticipated, with most of the impact in 2016. 
Operating expense savings from these actions is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $45 million per annum. 
Excluding restructuring-related items, operating income was $93 million for the third quarter compared to $95 million in the prior quarter. The decrease is due to lower revenue, partially offset by higher gross margin percentage and lower operating expenses. 
Other income of $6 million in the third quarter, primarily due to the resolution of an outstanding matter with a former customer. 
Second quarter other income was $7 million, mainly due to reversal of outstanding contingent consideration related to the TetraSun acquisition. 
We had a tax benefit of $51 million in Q3 compared to tax expenses of $9 million in the second quarter. As we indicated on our last quarter's call, in July, we received a favorable ruling from the foreign tax authority, which has resulted in a $35 million tax benefit to our Q3 results. 
Note that for purposes of our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance, we had excluded this benefit. 
The third quarter results also include a tax benefit of $13 million associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations on various uncertain tax positions. 
Third quarter earnings were 100 -- $1.49 per fully diluted share on a GAAP basis and $1.22 on non-GAAP basis. This compares to earnings of $0.13 and non-GAAP earnings of $0.87 in the prior quarter. And please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS reconciliation. 
Turning to Slide 13. I'll discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. 
Cash and multiple securities increased $423 million to an ending balance of $2.1 billion. Our net cash position decreased slightly to $1.3 billion from $1.4 billion in the prior quarter as a result of continuing to construct certain projects on balance sheet. The increase in cash resulted primarily from borrowing on our revolving credit facility. 
With ongoing funding of several substantial projects on the balance sheet, the short-term borrowing on the revolver was necessary to fund domestic requirements while complying with certain statutory funding requirements. As we settle the projects we've been constructing on balance sheet, we expect to pay down the revolver in either Q4 of 2016 or Q1 of 2017. 
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, decreased by over $430 million, primarily due to the increase in short-term borrowings. Excluding this item, net working capital would have increased primarily due to the growth in project assets. 
Total debt in the third quarter was $787 million, an increase of $554 million from the prior quarter. And as discussed previously, this increase was primarily due to the borrowing under the revolver. 
Cash flows used in operations were $76 million compared to cash flows used in operations of $75 million in Q2. 
Free cash flow is negative $132 million compared to negative free cash flow of $139 million last quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $46 million compared to $78 million in the prior quarter, and depreciation for the quarter was $52 million or approximately $1 million lower than the prior quarter. 
I'll now discuss the update to our full year 2016 on Slide 14. Firstly, keep in mind that as Mark mentioned, we are in the process of evaluating certain decisions related to our production capacity, module product transitions and operating expense rationalization. As a result, our current view of 2016 guidance on a GAAP basis could be subject to change, depending upon the outcome of this process. To the extent there are any changes to 2016 outlook, these will be provided on the 2017 guidance call on November 16. 
Also, as we've communicated over the course of the year, we constructed our guidance to account for the factors that could impact the timing of the large and complex project sales included in our forecast. As a result of this approach, we've been able to maintain our earnings per share guidance even while our net sales guidance has been lowered. These rely on timing of certain project sales. It's important to keep this context in mind as we discuss the updates. 
Our net sales guidance has been revised to $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion from the prior guidance of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. This change is due to project timing, as we now expect to complete the sale of our Moapa and California Flats project in 2017. 
Regarding Moapa, we recently closed tax equity financing for the project and received a portion of the cash in Q4. The marketing of the remaining cash equity has generated considerable interest and we expect that sale to close in Q1 of 2017. 
In relation to our Stateline project, we've offered our remaining 34% interest to 8point3. The project sale is advancing and is expected to close by year end. 
In the guidance that we provided today, we are including only a portion of the remaining 34% interest in the project, pending the final approval and closing of the sale. As previously indicated, to the extent that we do sell the entire remaining interest in 2016, this will likely result in earnings at or above the high end of the guidance range provided today. As a reminder, the profit from the remaining sale to 8point3 will be reflected below operating income and equity and earnings, and not in revenue and gross margin. 
Resulting from the changes and the timing of project sales, we're updating our gross margin guidance to 25.5% to 26% from 18.5% to 19% previously. The increase in the gross margin percentage is a reflection of both the relatively low gross margin associated with the Moapa and California Flats projects that have been pushed out and also a lot of project cost savings achieved in Q3. 
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $480 million to $500 million and include $105 million to $115 million of restructuring-related charges. 
Note that the expected TetraSun charges have been lowered to a range of $90 million to $95 million from the prior range of up to $100 million. 
Non-GAAP guidance for our operating expenses, which excludes restructuring charges, have been reduced to $375 million to $385 million. We brought down the high end of this range from $400 million, reflecting our ongoing efforts to manage expenses. 
The non-GAAP operating income guidance has been narrowed to a range of $340 million to $370 million, reflecting the updated net sales and gross margin expectations. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate has been revised to a range of 8% to 10%, resulting from a favorable jurisdictional mix of income. And keep in mind that this excludes the impact of all restructuring actions and also excludes the impact of the $35 million tax benefit mentioned earlier. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $3.75 to $3.90. And on a non-GAAP basis, $4.30 to $4.50. As touched upon earlier, we're maintaining the high end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.50 while tightening our low end to $4.30. The increase in the low end reflects the lower operating expenses and lower expected tax rate. The benefit of project cost reductions in Q3 also helped to offset the impact of the lower revenue from project push-outs. 
Included in the EPS range is the expected Q4 sale of a portion of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar's share of 8point3's earnings. The equity and earnings amount is approximately $110 million, net of tax. 
Also keep in mind that as mentioned last quarter, the net sales range and gross margin guidance include only a portion of the revenue and none of the deferred profit from the Kingbird sale. Similarly, the EPS guidance provided does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. Due to the tax equity structure on this project, all earnings have been deferred for the next several years. 
Our operating cash flow guidance is revised to a range of negative $100 million breakeven from prior range of $500 million to $650 million, and the decrease was due to revised sale timing of Moapa and California Flats. 
We're lowering our capital expenditure guidance to a revised range of $225 million to $275 million from the prior range of $275 million to $325 million. The timing of certain expenditures have now moved into 2017. 
Net cash guidance has been reduced to $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion as a result of the revised timing of project sales, partially offset by a reduction in CapEx. 
And finally, we're also slightly reducing our shipment guidance for the year based on timing of certain shipments pushing into early 2017. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'll summarize our progress during the third quarter. Our financial results were solid. Revenue of $688 million, GAAP EPS of $1.49 to non-GAAP EPS of $1.22. We maintained the high end of our 2016 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS ranges at $3.90 and $4.50, respectively. Our module efficiency continues to improve steadily, and our best line efficiency exiting [ph] Q3 running at 16.9%. Our bookings this quarter were lower than expected at approximately 250 megawatts. However, we continue to see growth in a number of potential booking opportunities, including with C&I customers. 
With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

So I think NextEra and Southern have both announced that based on how they view the economics and risk/reward of solar projects, they are going to perhaps reduce spending in solar and look more to wind. I think that neither of them have said that they're going to be exiting the solar market. And we clearly have good relationships with both of those 2 counterparties. They'll still be looking for high-quality assets, and I think we're both -- we're well positioned to meet these opportunities. What we have seen, clearly, in the latter half of '16 and going to '17 is there is a somewhat of a scarcity of tax capacity for large utility-scale assets. That being said, given the ITC extension timing, there's also a dearth of assets going into 2017. So we think the 2 have somewhat balanced out, although there may be a little more challenging tax capacity issues with some players. The other thing I would say is that we feel that we bring extremely high-quality projects to the market. And given both the quality of the project, the development and the relationships we have with counterparties in the market, we don't see a significant constraint today for us in finding buyers and tax capacity for all our assets. It may be that further down the chain, there are some people who are struggling, but we're still not seeing that reflected in our markets today."

Our expectation is that a Series 6 product will deliver even better margin than that. So I wouldn't want to change our view of the long-term expectations around gross margin for our module-only sales. With our Series 4 product today, given the smaller form factor, it will make it, within today's pricing environment, more challenging to achieve those types of margins and we would obviously most likely see margins much lower than the 20%. That's what precipitates the need to transition to either a Series 5 or 6 to normalize the form factor delta that we have today in the marketplace and generally drive a slightly lower value for the product. As it relates to Q4 and our mix of revenue, there is still some systems revenue in the fourth quarter, but you will see a significantly high portion of that being module-only sales."

That takes us to between 600 to 700 megawatts. Beyond that, we have seen some opportunities pull out of the pipeline. So as Mark mentioned in his comments earlier, in Egypt, we've seen some opportunities go by the wayside there based on development issues. And likewise, we passed on some opportunities in India and Africa based on pricing, where we won't chase the pricing bottom and we won't go into deals that are uneconomic for us. So if you look at 2017 today, I think we're confident in a 600- to 700-megawatt number in terms of the shipments, which is less than we'd hoped for, but we also continue to have a robust pipeline and continue to look for other opportunities."

The Moapa is an asset that we acquired in late-stage development and, therefore, paid a development premium to acquire. On Cal Flats, we have one discrete development issue, which, if resolved, would increase that margin significantly. But that's not currently in the guidance numbers. But those 2 assets have some unique differences from what I would say is a typical development project. If you look out into 2017, we don't have, I think, significant similar challenges on the assets that we have in 2017. And then going out beyond that, the majority of our California pipeline out to 2018 and 2019 is at higher margin levels that we think are more expected and acceptable for a systems development business."

They had an accordion feature underneath the credit agreement, which -- they expanded that. I think the capacity was around $250 million. They have also recently acquired Henrietta, and so they've used the capacity for that. So what we're trying to do with 8point3 is, there is limited capacity in terms of their ability to acquire the entire interest. Clearly, there is an interest from 8point3 to do that. We are trying to work through structuring around that and see if we can accomplish that. And to the extent that we can, then we'll be able to sell 100% of our remaining interest, which was 34% of Stateline. We have left out of the guidance approximately 25% of the value, which is dependent upon our ability to go above and beyond or find ways to sell 100%, even though there's not, today, presently, sufficient capacity to acquire 100% interest in Stateline, given the available cash and debt capacity that 8point3 has at this point in time. So we're just looking through options. So we've -- in our guidance, we've excluded a portion of the sale, and that's about 25% of the remaining interest."

First off, is we highlighted that we had a favorable ruling on an item in an international jurisdiction, which was worth about $35 million or about $0.35. We -- that is in our GAAP numbers, but that's not reflected in our non-GAAP numbers, okay? So that's kind of the primary delta between the 2. The other side of it is relative to our prior outlook on the tax rate, we have a favorable mix of income. So what's happened now with the drop in revenue, that drives a different result in terms of where is the income by jurisdictional mix, which each jurisdictional mix has a different tax rate associated with it. And as you know, we have a tax holiday in Malaysia. So more of the income that's represented in Malaysia as a percent of the total will drive down the overall tax rate. So that's kind of the events that are driving the change in the tax rate both on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis from the prior guidance that we provided in Q2 earnings call. Brian, I'm not really sure how you're getting the $0.80 or so for Moapa and CA Flat. I think Paul had it right when he referenced it, when you look at the revenue delta, which was close to $1 billion and if you look at the gross margin rate increasing. But when you look at the total gross margin dollars not changing significantly, you would look to it and say, ""Well, that would imply that the gross margin on both of those assets is lower than normally expected for a system business."" And I think Alex walked through that as well. So we can take that offline, if you like. We can spend more time with you, but you should not get anywhere close to -- I think you referenced around $0.80 of value for the pushout of those 2 projects. It will be significantly lower than that."

It's a recurring annuity stream, relatively high fixed cost, therefore, a variable line flows through at a very high contribution rate. And the profile on the business, if you look at it over time, the margins can range -- the margin, on average, are above the average for the business. They also will be much higher, let's say, in the first 5 or 6 years of the contract. So if you look at the performance of the plan as well as the warranties that you have with the inverter manufacturers and others, you'll generally realize much higher margins within the first 5 to 7 years. And then as you approach just kind of 10 to 15 years, you may see margins start to drop off a little bit, especially if you had to do overhaul -- inverter overhaul maintenance and those types of things. But it's a good margin business, it's one that is really based off of scale, and we are looking to -- we have a strong presence here in the U.S. We're looking to grow it and capture the benefit of the infrastructure through our network operating center and other investments that we've made over the years to monitor plants and try to find other ways to optimize the performance of the plants that there's -- it's a good base business that has great opportunity to continue to grow.

Around Series 5, in particular, is that -- what we are focused on Series 5, and I want to make sure it's clear, is that if we can further cost reduce it, and we're looking at ways to do that, the product will be highly competitive. So I don't want it to be looked upon is that it's a direct correlation that the ASPs have declined and, therefore, the product is not -- no longer competitive. It is an advantaged product relative to Series 4 because it solves our difference in form factor, which drives -- generally drives the higher balance of planned [ph] cost. So it's a very valuable product from that standpoint. The challenge, really, is getting -- some of -- there is some incremental costs that we're adding to the module and -- in terms of back rails and other things along those lines. So it can drive to a higher cost point than Series 4, but the general benefits of the larger form factor is offsetting the impact of that higher cost. What we're trying to find a way is that can we further cost reduce some of the incremental components for Series 5 or just the -- the building material or other ways of driving out cost on Series 5 that we can get it to a position that we feel more comfortable in competing in the marketplace and capturing the market profile that we would like. The other thing I think that's important to understand is that if -- when we first embarked around our vision for Series 6, it was a little over a year ago. And we have had tremendous learnings around Series 6 that have dealt with some of the potential constraints or challenges/risks that we had with Series 6 when we first sat down and created the business case. If we had known everything that we know as of now for Series 6, we may have made a decision to go straight to Series 6, okay? So some of it is, look, the ASPs in the market have declined, that's putting some pressure on Series 5. We've got to further cost reduce it. If we can do that, then we'll continue with the transition. However, we also have an opportunity to meaningfully pull forward Series 6 and getting that product into market faster. Then we just have to compare the trade-offs between the 2 and make a decision on which path we want to go. Series 6, at any price point that we're seeing in the market right now, will exceed any of our expectations around margins of what we believe that business -- that entitlement should be. So we're very confident with the Series 6 around its efficiency as well as the cost entitlement, and it generates all of the energy yield benefits around temperature coefficient, spectral response, diffuse shading, everything you could possibly -- obviously, that we've talked about around corridor technology, it still resides in Series 6. We can just have much higher efficiency, much greater energy density at a much lower cost point."

We had another good quarter of financial results in Q3, with net sales of $688 million and an earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges and a foreign tax benefit, of $1.22. We continue to push forward on our technology roadmap, with our best line efficiency exiting the third quarter almost touching 17% at 16.9% efficiency. Our project execution was also strong as we continued construction on multiple utility-scale solar projects and continue to realize significant BoS savings. 
Despite the results of the past quarter, the rapidly evolving market pricing environment, as shown on Slide 5 -- 4, excuse me, present significant challenges to the upcoming year. While we will not be discussing our 2017 outlook on today's call, it is important to understand the dramatic pricing declines that the industry is currently experiencing and how we intend to respond. 
As we highlighted on our Q2 earnings call, we saw the module and PPA pricing environment that time as increasingly aggressive and challenging. However, the impact of the lower second half 2016 installs in China were only just becoming evident, and in the weeks since that call, we've seen other module manufacturers continue to bring online new capacity in the face of the demand drop-off in China. As a result of the oversupply and growing inventories, module pricing has declined at a dramatic rate in the third quarter. 
Since quarter end, there has been some signs of potential stabilization as wafer and sale of [ph] spot prices first leveled off then increased slightly. In addition, module AFPs have leveled off, perhaps finding the near-term floor as manufacturers clear inventory. 
As we said consistently and reiterated on our Q1 2016 earnings call, when an oversupply situation exists, our strategy is to take a disciplined approach to the market. This means that we may walk away from module supply opportunity if the economics do not make sense for us. 
During the past quarter, challenging pricing conditions dictated that in certain situations we needed to apply this strategy, which has impacted our near-term booking. But we continue to view the strategy as the most sensible long-term approach. In these types of oversupply situations, we also will look very closely at our module manufacturing capacity. Our goal is not to push supply into a saturated and margin-challenged market, but rather to balance production to meet demand. 
As a result of this strategy and current market conditions, we have begun the process of evaluating our module capacity for next year. Mostly connected to any capacity decisions is the timing of our Series 5 and Series 6 product transitions. In regard to Series 5, we are looking very hard at the cost structure and how to bring the module cost per watt down further in this competitive environment. In terms of our Series 6 product, we have dedicated significant resources to focus on how to accelerate the roadmap and product availability. 
In the current ASP environment, without further cost reduction, Series 4 and Series 5 margins may be challenged. We expect that our Series 6 module would be our most competitive product and enable us to capture greater gross margin per watt. Beyond both pricing and capacity decisions, we are also focused on identifying ways to improve our operating expense profile, which would improve our competitiveness. 
We are progressing in our evaluation of each of these initiatives. However, any final decisions are subject to our normal board review process. We will hold a separate call on November 16 to discuss the 2017 outlook and provide further update at that time. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'll provide an update on bookings activity since our last earnings call. As we announced in our recent press release, we have signed a PPA of up to 160 megawatts with MCE, a leading community choice aggregator in California. While we are only including 40 megawatts in our bookings number this quarter, we have an option to expand the project to a total of 160 megawatts, subject to satisfaction of certain PPA contract conditions and based on the load increase from potential MCE expansion. Construction on the project is anticipated to begin in 2019, with commissioning expected in 2020. 
CCAs are increasingly important providers of electricity to customers, both in California and a growing number of other states. CCAs offer their customers the benefit of local control, competitive power rates and access to a higher mix of renewable energy. MCE provides power to over 250,000 customers in California. And with the addition of other entrants in the CCA market in the coming months, the total CCA customer base in the state is expected to grow to approximately 1 million customers. We're excited to bring this -- to begin a new association with MCE and help make affordable clean power even more accessible. 
The growth of CCAs across the nation also mirrors the growth of community solar that is occurring across the United States. As we've highlighted last quarter, we have booked over 120 megawatts DC of module supply to community solar projects so far this year. These projects are only part of the rapid growth that is continuing in the community solar space across the United States. 
While the initial growth in community solar has been specific to certain states, the momentum continues to build. There are now community solar projects in 24 states, and 20 additional states are in the process of enacting community solar policies. In 2016 alone, 19 new utilities have started community solar programs. We continue to work closely with Clean Energy Collective and other community solar providers to identify new opportunities to facilitate market growth. 
Highlighting the growing scale of community solar projects, South Carolina Electric and Gas recently selected CEC to develop, construct and operate a 60-megawatt portfolio project. With a much lower cost than rooftop solar and the opportunity to rate base projects in certain situations, community solar is a utility-friendly model that is expected to grow substantially in coming years. 
Returning to the current quarter. We had module-only bookings of over 200 megawatts since our last call, bringing the total booking since the last call to nearly 250 megawatts. The largest of these module bookings, approximately 100 megawatts, was to supply our customer-awarded volume under the most recent French tender. Module shipments timing will be late Q4 2016 and into 2017. 
Outside the volume in France, we are seeing increasing geographical diversity in our module-only opportunities. Besides the U.S., we have bookings in Thailand, various countries across Asia and Latin America. 
As we look forward, we continue to see a number of opportunities that we anticipate will lead to growth -- to stronger module bookings in the next several months. 
As highlighted last quarter, there are a number of awarded projects which we have not yet converted to bookings. At this point, we have converted over 160 megawatts of these projects into bookings, and they are reflected in today's number, with additional 105 megawatts DC of opportunities related to projects awarded under the recent ARENA large-scale solar grant in Australia, our awarded, but not booked volume now stands at approximately 270 megawatts. As a highlight, the ARENA volume includes our first self-developed project in Australia. Keep in mind, this awarded volume is not reflected in Slides 5 and 6. 
Also not included in the bookings number are a number of O&M contracts which we have signed this year. 
With over 5 gigawatts of generation capacity in operation and more than 7 gigawatts of contracting capacity, First Solar is the recognized industry leader in providing O&M services for utility-scale solar power plants. With a complete end-to-end solution and a fleet availability of 99.6%, First Solar offers customers the compelling combination of expertise and proven performance. 
Our O&M business continues to grow, not only by securing contracts on projects where we perform the EPC, but also through third-party contracts. Year-to-date, we have signed 930 megawatts of third-party O&M agreements. In addition to signing agreements with existing customers, these recent bookings also include 6 new third-party customers. Beyond these third-party bookings, we have contracted over 540 megawatts of additional volume for projects we have constructed, bringing the total year-to-date O&M bookings to nearly 1.5 gigawatts. 
With additional advance-stage opportunities currently under negotiation, bookings could reach over 1.8 gigawatts by yearend. 
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making in third-party O&M business and the stable revenue and earnings it provides. 
The lower module and system bookings this past quarter are primarily a result of the current module ASP and PPA pricing environment. Our strategy has been to pursue opportunities in markets where we can best leverage the energy yield advantage of our technology while maintaining discipline around returns. However, the willingness of other module manufacturers to continue ramping capacity and selling modules at very aggressive ASPs presents near-term challenges. The decline in ASP environment has also led to some instances where customers have delayed signing agreements in hope of further pricing declines. 
While achieving a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio, this year will be challenging. As we look to the fourth quarter, we have a number of bookings opportunities that we believe we are well positioned despite the current market environment. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll provide an update on our potential bookings opportunities, which has grown to over 25.4 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 1.4 gigawatts from the prior quarter. 
Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities are 1.1 gigawatts, with the awarded volume discussed earlier included in this total. Approximately 1/3 of the late-stage opportunities are systems projects, with the balance comprised of the module-only sales. The reduction in the mid- to late-stage opportunities since last quarter was approximately 700 megawatts. Of this amount, over 150 megawatts were due to projects that converted into bookings. Another 350 megawatts of systems project opportunities were closed in both Egypt and South Africa due to uncertain market conditions in both countries. The remaining decrease was due to projects lost to aggressive pricing terms. In these situations, we chose to remain disciplined and not to match uneconomic pricing. 
The growth in the overall potential bookings opportunities is primarily driven by new project development opportunities which we expect to be delivered in 2018 and beyond. 
The long-term demand driver for solar continues to be strong, and we are working actively to position ourselves to meet the long-term demand. 
On Slide 8, we have updated the geographic mix of our potential bookings. The increase in our potential bookings opportunities is primarily driven by new opportunities in the United States. One of the factors driving the increase in the United States potential bookings is the increase from C&I customers. This continues to develop into a promising utility-scale solar market that we feel we are well positioned to be successful in, in the upcoming years. Corporations globally have announced plans for renewable procurement that collectively total into tens of gigawatts. 
We currently have more than 2 gigawatts of active offers in progress today with C&I customers. Most of these projects are still early stage and have longer-dated CODs, but they represent another encouraging demand driver for the long-term growth of solar. One of the factors that provides First Solar an advantage in this market space is the sensitivity C&I customers have to reputational risk. They don't want to see a project fail or not be delivered. With our financial strength and our development track record, we are well positioned to meet their needs. 
Lastly, as announced recently, Alex Bradley has been appointed our new Chief Financial Officer. As you're aware, Alex has been serving as our interim CFO since July and has made a seamless transition from his previous responsibility as Head of Project Finance and Treasury. During his time at First Solar, Alex has led or supported the financing and sale of almost all of our utility-scale solar projects. The experience and skill Alex brings into his role will be a tremendous benefit to First Solar and its shareholders. 
Alex will now provide more detail on the third quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016."

Before going into the quarter results, I want to express my excitement of the opportunity to take on the role as CFO of First Solar. 
Since I joined the company in 2008, the solar industry has changed enormously and it continues to evolve at a rapid pace. First Solar's unique technology advantages and financial strength position the company for long-term success, and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead for us. 
Turning to the quarter. I'll start on Slide 11 with some operational highlights. We produced 779 megawatts DC in the third quarter, a decrease of 1% from the prior quarter. The slight decrease is due to an increase in upgrade activities across the fleet, partially offset by higher fleet efficiency. Relative to the third quarter of 2015, production was 19% higher as a result of higher module efficiency, increased capacity utilization and the addition of new capacity. 
Factory capacity utilization was 97% in Q3, a decrease of 3 percentage points from the prior quarter. The lower utilization was also a result of increase in fleet upgrade activities. And as compared to third quarter of 2015, capacity utilization increased by 3 percentage points. 
Fleet average module conversion efficiency increased to 16.5%, a 30 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter and a 70 basis point increase year-over-year. Module conversion efficiency on our best line averaged 16.6% in Q3. And as Mark noted, our lead line exited the quarter at 16.9%, highlighting the impact of recent improvement programs deployed.
Next, on Slide 12, I'll discuss the P&L results for the third quarter. Net sales of $688 million, a decrease of $246 million compared to the prior quarter. The sales decrease resulted from lower systems revenue recognition on our Astoria, Silver State South, Kingbird and other projects. The lower systems revenue was partially offset by an increase in module-only sales. 
As a percentage of total cautionary net sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the systems project, decreased to 69% from 83% in the prior quarter as a result of the high mix of module-only sales. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 27% compared to 20% in the second quarter. Improvement in gross margin percentage resulted from a higher mix of third-party module sales as well as improved systems module, resulting from project cost reductions. 
The gross margin of our component segment was 32% in Q3 compared to 24% in Q2. The increase versus the prior quarter was primarily due to lower module cost per watt, from improved efficiency, and lower inventory write-downs. 
Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, were $93 million in Q3, a decrease of $4 million from the prior quarter. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower employee-related costs. 
Restructuring and asset impairment charges were $4 million in the quarter compared to $86 million in Q2. The restructuring charges are related to the actions announced in Q2, including discontinuing our TetraSun product, the disposition of skytron and EPC reductions. 
The total charges for all these actions is now expected to be slightly lower in the range of $105 million to $115 million compared to the $105 million to $120 million range originally anticipated, with most of the impact in 2016. 
Operating expense savings from these actions is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $45 million per annum. 
Excluding restructuring-related items, operating income was $93 million for the third quarter compared to $95 million in the prior quarter. The decrease is due to lower revenue, partially offset by higher gross margin percentage and lower operating expenses. 
Other income of $6 million in the third quarter, primarily due to the resolution of an outstanding matter with a former customer. 
Second quarter other income was $7 million, mainly due to reversal of outstanding contingent consideration related to the TetraSun acquisition. 
We had a tax benefit of $51 million in Q3 compared to tax expenses of $9 million in the second quarter. As we indicated on our last quarter's call, in July, we received a favorable ruling from the foreign tax authority, which has resulted in a $35 million tax benefit to our Q3 results. 
Note that for purposes of our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance, we had excluded this benefit. 
The third quarter results also include a tax benefit of $13 million associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations on various uncertain tax positions. 
Third quarter earnings were 100 -- $1.49 per fully diluted share on a GAAP basis and $1.22 on non-GAAP basis. This compares to earnings of $0.13 and non-GAAP earnings of $0.87 in the prior quarter. And please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS reconciliation. 
Turning to Slide 13. I'll discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. 
Cash and multiple securities increased $423 million to an ending balance of $2.1 billion. Our net cash position decreased slightly to $1.3 billion from $1.4 billion in the prior quarter as a result of continuing to construct certain projects on balance sheet. The increase in cash resulted primarily from borrowing on our revolving credit facility. 
With ongoing funding of several substantial projects on the balance sheet, the short-term borrowing on the revolver was necessary to fund domestic requirements while complying with certain statutory funding requirements. As we settle the projects we've been constructing on balance sheet, we expect to pay down the revolver in either Q4 of 2016 or Q1 of 2017. 
For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, decreased by over $430 million, primarily due to the increase in short-term borrowings. Excluding this item, net working capital would have increased primarily due to the growth in project assets. 
Total debt in the third quarter was $787 million, an increase of $554 million from the prior quarter. And as discussed previously, this increase was primarily due to the borrowing under the revolver. 
Cash flows used in operations were $76 million compared to cash flows used in operations of $75 million in Q2. 
Free cash flow is negative $132 million compared to negative free cash flow of $139 million last quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $46 million compared to $78 million in the prior quarter, and depreciation for the quarter was $52 million or approximately $1 million lower than the prior quarter. 
I'll now discuss the update to our full year 2016 on Slide 14. Firstly, keep in mind that as Mark mentioned, we are in the process of evaluating certain decisions related to our production capacity, module product transitions and operating expense rationalization. As a result, our current view of 2016 guidance on a GAAP basis could be subject to change, depending upon the outcome of this process. To the extent there are any changes to 2016 outlook, these will be provided on the 2017 guidance call on November 16. 
Also, as we've communicated over the course of the year, we constructed our guidance to account for the factors that could impact the timing of the large and complex project sales included in our forecast. As a result of this approach, we've been able to maintain our earnings per share guidance even while our net sales guidance has been lowered. These rely on timing of certain project sales. It's important to keep this context in mind as we discuss the updates. 
Our net sales guidance has been revised to $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion from the prior guidance of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. This change is due to project timing, as we now expect to complete the sale of our Moapa and California Flats project in 2017. 
Regarding Moapa, we recently closed tax equity financing for the project and received a portion of the cash in Q4. The marketing of the remaining cash equity has generated considerable interest and we expect that sale to close in Q1 of 2017. 
In relation to our Stateline project, we've offered our remaining 34% interest to 8point3. The project sale is advancing and is expected to close by year end. 
In the guidance that we provided today, we are including only a portion of the remaining 34% interest in the project, pending the final approval and closing of the sale. As previously indicated, to the extent that we do sell the entire remaining interest in 2016, this will likely result in earnings at or above the high end of the guidance range provided today. As a reminder, the profit from the remaining sale to 8point3 will be reflected below operating income and equity and earnings, and not in revenue and gross margin. 
Resulting from the changes and the timing of project sales, we're updating our gross margin guidance to 25.5% to 26% from 18.5% to 19% previously. The increase in the gross margin percentage is a reflection of both the relatively low gross margin associated with the Moapa and California Flats projects that have been pushed out and also a lot of project cost savings achieved in Q3. 
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $480 million to $500 million and include $105 million to $115 million of restructuring-related charges. 
Note that the expected TetraSun charges have been lowered to a range of $90 million to $95 million from the prior range of up to $100 million. 
Non-GAAP guidance for our operating expenses, which excludes restructuring charges, have been reduced to $375 million to $385 million. We brought down the high end of this range from $400 million, reflecting our ongoing efforts to manage expenses. 
The non-GAAP operating income guidance has been narrowed to a range of $340 million to $370 million, reflecting the updated net sales and gross margin expectations. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate has been revised to a range of 8% to 10%, resulting from a favorable jurisdictional mix of income. And keep in mind that this excludes the impact of all restructuring actions and also excludes the impact of the $35 million tax benefit mentioned earlier. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $3.75 to $3.90. And on a non-GAAP basis, $4.30 to $4.50. As touched upon earlier, we're maintaining the high end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.50 while tightening our low end to $4.30. The increase in the low end reflects the lower operating expenses and lower expected tax rate. The benefit of project cost reductions in Q3 also helped to offset the impact of the lower revenue from project push-outs. 
Included in the EPS range is the expected Q4 sale of a portion of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar's share of 8point3's earnings. The equity and earnings amount is approximately $110 million, net of tax. 
Also keep in mind that as mentioned last quarter, the net sales range and gross margin guidance include only a portion of the revenue and none of the deferred profit from the Kingbird sale. Similarly, the EPS guidance provided does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. Due to the tax equity structure on this project, all earnings have been deferred for the next several years. 
Our operating cash flow guidance is revised to a range of negative $100 million breakeven from prior range of $500 million to $650 million, and the decrease was due to revised sale timing of Moapa and California Flats. 
We're lowering our capital expenditure guidance to a revised range of $225 million to $275 million from the prior range of $275 million to $325 million. The timing of certain expenditures have now moved into 2017. 
Net cash guidance has been reduced to $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion as a result of the revised timing of project sales, partially offset by a reduction in CapEx. 
And finally, we're also slightly reducing our shipment guidance for the year based on timing of certain shipments pushing into early 2017. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'll summarize our progress during the third quarter. Our financial results were solid. Revenue of $688 million, GAAP EPS of $1.49 to non-GAAP EPS of $1.22. We maintained the high end of our 2016 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS ranges at $3.90 and $4.50, respectively. Our module efficiency continues to improve steadily, and our best line efficiency exiting [ph] Q3 running at 16.9%. Our bookings this quarter were lower than expected at approximately 250 megawatts. However, we continue to see growth in a number of potential booking opportunities, including with C&I customers. 
With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

So I think NextEra and Southern have both announced that based on how they view the economics and risk/reward of solar projects, they are going to perhaps reduce spending in solar and look more to wind. I think that neither of them have said that they're going to be exiting the solar market. And we clearly have good relationships with both of those 2 counterparties. They'll still be looking for high-quality assets, and I think we're both -- we're well positioned to meet these opportunities. What we have seen, clearly, in the latter half of '16 and going to '17 is there is a somewhat of a scarcity of tax capacity for large utility-scale assets. That being said, given the ITC extension timing, there's also a dearth of assets going into 2017. So we think the 2 have somewhat balanced out, although there may be a little more challenging tax capacity issues with some players. The other thing I would say is that we feel that we bring extremely high-quality projects to the market. And given both the quality of the project, the development and the relationships we have with counterparties in the market, we don't see a significant constraint today for us in finding buyers and tax capacity for all our assets. It may be that further down the chain, there are some people who are struggling, but we're still not seeing that reflected in our markets today."

And that's what we're working on trying to get the costs down to a point where we think we'll clear the market and the ASP and still be able to deliver margins that are in that range. Our expectation is that a Series 6 product will deliver even better margin than that. So I wouldn't want to change our view of the long-term expectations around gross margin for our module-only sales. With our Series 4 product today, given the smaller form factor, it will make it, within today's pricing environment, more challenging to achieve those types of margins and we would obviously most likely see margins much lower than the 20%. That's what precipitates the need to transition to either a Series 5 or 6 to normalize the form factor delta that we have today in the marketplace and generally drive a slightly lower value for the product. As it relates to Q4 and our mix of revenue, there is still some systems revenue in the fourth quarter, but you will see a significantly high portion of that being module-only sales."

That takes us to between 600 to 700 megawatts. Beyond that, we have seen some opportunities pull out of the pipeline. So as Mark mentioned in his comments earlier, in Egypt, we've seen some opportunities go by the wayside there based on development issues. And likewise, we passed on some opportunities in India and Africa based on pricing, where we won't chase the pricing bottom and we won't go into deals that are uneconomic for us. So if you look at 2017 today, I think we're confident in a 600- to 700-megawatt number in terms of the shipments, which is less than we'd hoped for, but we also continue to have a robust pipeline and continue to look for other opportunities."

On Cal Flats, we have one discrete development issue, which, if resolved, would increase that margin significantly. But that's not currently in the guidance numbers. But those 2 assets have some unique differences from what I would say is a typical development project.

They had an accordion feature underneath the credit agreement, which -- they expanded that. I think the capacity was around $250 million. They have also recently acquired Henrietta, and so they've used the capacity for that. So what we're trying to do with 8point3 is, there is limited capacity in terms of their ability to acquire the entire interest. Clearly, there is an interest from 8point3 to do that. We are trying to work through structuring around that and see if we can accomplish that. And to the extent that we can, then we'll be able to sell 100% of our remaining interest, which was 34% of Stateline. We have left out of the guidance approximately 25% of the value, which is dependent upon our ability to go above and beyond or find ways to sell 100%, even though there's not, today, presently, sufficient capacity to acquire 100% interest in Stateline, given the available cash and debt capacity that 8point3 has at this point in time. So we're just looking through options. So we've -- in our guidance, we've excluded a portion of the sale, and that's about 25% of the remaining interest."

And would it change now that you're monetizing those assets later? And then just quickly, on the updated guidance for 2016, the non-GAAP tax rate. Could you reconcile what exactly is driving the sort of $0.40 of EPS relative to your prior guidance?"

First off, is we highlighted that we had a favorable ruling on an item in an international jurisdiction, which was worth about $35 million or about $0.35. We -- that is in our GAAP numbers, but that's not reflected in our non-GAAP numbers, okay? So that's kind of the primary delta between the 2. The other side of it is relative to our prior outlook on the tax rate, we have a favorable mix of income. So what's happened now with the drop in revenue, that drives a different result in terms of where is the income by jurisdictional mix, which each jurisdictional mix has a different tax rate associated with it. And as you know, we have a tax holiday in Malaysia. So more of the income that's represented in Malaysia as a percent of the total will drive down the overall tax rate. So that's kind of the events that are driving the change in the tax rate both on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis from the prior guidance that we provided in Q2 earnings call. Brian, I'm not really sure how you're getting the $0.80 or so for Moapa and CA Flat. I think Paul had it right when he referenced it, when you look at the revenue delta, which was close to $1 billion and if you look at the gross margin rate increasing. But when you look at the total gross margin dollars not changing significantly, you would look to it and say, ""Well, that would imply that the gross margin on both of those assets is lower than normally expected for a system business."" And I think Alex walked through that as well. So we can take that offline, if you like. We can spend more time with you, but you should not get anywhere close to -- I think you referenced around $0.80 of value for the pushout of those 2 projects. It will be significantly lower than that."

It's a recurring annuity stream, relatively high fixed cost, therefore, a variable line flows through at a very high contribution rate. And the profile on the business, if you look at it over time, the margins can range -- the margin, on average, are above the average for the business. They also will be much higher, let's say, in the first 5 or 6 years of the contract. So if you look at the performance of the plan as well as the warranties that you have with the inverter manufacturers and others, you'll generally realize much higher margins within the first 5 to 7 years. And then as you approach just kind of 10 to 15 years, you may see margins start to drop off a little bit, especially if you had to do overhaul -- inverter overhaul maintenance and those types of things. But it's a good margin business, it's one that is really based off of scale, and we are looking to -- we have a strong presence here in the U.S. We're looking to grow it and capture the benefit of the infrastructure through our network operating center and other investments that we've made over the years to monitor plants and try to find other ways to optimize the performance of the plants that there's -- it's a good base business that has great opportunity to continue to grow. The revenue dollars won't be sizable, in general, relative to the total, but it can contribute meaningful gross margin and EPS."

Around Series 5, in particular, is that -- what we are focused on Series 5, and I want to make sure it's clear, is that if we can further cost reduce it, and we're looking at ways to do that, the product will be highly competitive. So I don't want it to be looked upon is that it's a direct correlation that the ASPs have declined and, therefore, the product is not -- no longer competitive. It is an advantaged product relative to Series 4 because it solves our difference in form factor, which drives -- generally drives the higher balance of planned [ph] cost. So it's a very valuable product from that standpoint. The challenge, really, is getting -- some of -- there is some incremental costs that we're adding to the module and -- in terms of back rails and other things along those lines. So it can drive to a higher cost point than Series 4, but the general benefits of the larger form factor is offsetting the impact of that higher cost. What we're trying to find a way is that can we further cost reduce some of the incremental components for Series 5 or just the -- the building material or other ways of driving out cost on Series 5 that we can get it to a position that we feel more comfortable in competing in the marketplace and capturing the market profile that we would like. The other thing I think that's important to understand is that if -- when we first embarked around our vision for Series 6, it was a little over a year ago. And we have had tremendous learnings around Series 6 that have dealt with some of the potential constraints or challenges/risks that we had with Series 6 when we first sat down and created the business case. If we had known everything that we know as of now for Series 6, we may have made a decision to go straight to Series 6, okay? So some of it is, look, the ASPs in the market have declined, that's putting some pressure on Series 5. We've got to further cost reduce it. If we can do that, then we'll continue with the transition. However, we also have an opportunity to meaningfully pull forward Series 6 and getting that product into market faster. Then we just have to compare the trade-offs between the 2 and make a decision on which path we want to go. Series 6, at any price point that we're seeing in the market right now, will exceed any of our expectations around margins of what we believe that business -- that entitlement should be. So we're very confident with the Series 6 around its efficiency as well as the cost entitlement, and it generates all of the energy yield benefits around temperature coefficient, spectral response, diffuse shading, everything you could possibly -- obviously, that we've talked about around corridor technology, it still resides in Series 6. We can just have much higher efficiency, much greater energy density at a much lower cost point."

What has some impact, not necessarily around percent energy advantage, but the value of the energy can be impacted with PPA prices. So I mean, it's intuitive. The lower the PPA price, therefore, the lower the value of the energy. So there is some impact to that as PPA prices, in some markets, have gotten very aggressive, but the inherent energy value is still there. The percent deltas are still there. The only real dynamic that can change the equation around what is translated to ASP is what is the underlying PPA? And generally lower PPA means less value in ASP."
