Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions.
Future results may differ materially from our current expectations, based upon a number of important factors, including risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, control costs, successfully execute our transformation initiatives and growth strategies or our ability to achieve intended benefits, cost savings and synergies from the Stuart Weitzman acquisition.
Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a complete list of risks and important factors. Please note that historical trends may not be indicative of future performance.
Also, certain financial information and metrics that will be discussed today will be presented on a non-GAAP basis, which you may identify by the terms non-GAAP, constant currency or excluding charges associated with financing short-term purchase accounting adjustments and contingent payments and integration costs. You may find the corresponding GAAP financial information and metric, as well as the related reconciliation, on our website, www.coach.com/investors, and then viewing the earnings release posted today.
Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Victor Luis will provide an overall summary of our second fiscal quarter 2016 milestones and learnings and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives.

This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Victor will then conclude with some brief summary comments.
I'd now like to introduce Victor Luis, Coach's CEO."

Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. 
As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, which was consistent with our expectations and reflects the most significant progress to date on our transformation plan despite the difficult retail environment globally. 
We drove further sequential improvement in our North America bricks and mortar business, lead, as expected, by our retail stores, while our outlet store channel also strengthened against the backdrop of lower tourist traffic and a highly promotional environment. Our international business has posted strong growth on a constant currency basis, highlighted by double-digit increases in Europe and Mainland China, as well as sales gains in Japan. 
Overall, our results continued to give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will result in the return to top line growth this fiscal year and positive North American comps by our fourth fiscal quarter. 
Importantly, during the holiday period, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies, while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Our broader gifting assortment resonated with our customers globally across all price points and in all channels. We continued to transition more of the fleet into our Modern Luxury concept with the significant increase in remodels prior to holiday, driving results globally and the continued positive comps in the North American retail stores, which have been renovated. Finally, our holiday marketings struck a fine balance between fashion and bolder, more relatable gifting messages. 
We are also excited about Stuart Weitzman's results during the quarter, which exceeded expectations. Boots in particular sold well, notably in domestic retail stores and in spite of the unseasonably warm weather. Stuart Weitzman's strong outperformance against the category clearly reflected the brand's strong development of fashionable, trend right products, as well as its growing relevance with increasing numbers of consumers globally. We are also excited to see Stuart Weitzman continued to gain traction internationally, notably in Asia, where the brand is still nascent, but has significant long-term potential. Importantly, we are effectively integrating Stuart Weitzman into Coach, Inc., while continuing to successfully execute the Coach brand transformation. Since acquisition, we've strengthened the Stuart Weitzman team by bringing in new talent. Specifically, we've recruited a new Chief Merchant, while leveraging Coach leaders in handbags, specialist and product development roles and in senior finance and Human Resources positions. 
Now as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across our 3 key brand pillars of product, stores and marketing. 
Starting with product, where coach is clearly emerging as a house of modern fashion design. During the second quarter, as in Q1, essentially all of our retail stores offering, both men's and women's, were Stuart Vevers designs. Handbags continued to be driven by the family, with the nomad also a key bestseller for the season. Essentials, including the shoulder bag group, the satchel and the Turnlock Tote were also great gifts at key price points, and our gift box program resonated globally. In outlet, we continued to increase the offering of Stuart's designs and updates, representing about 90% of the assortment, with key new styles such as Blake launched in late Q1 and the reimagined Phoebe and Christie groups in women's, as well a strong group of backpacks driving our men's business. 
Our gift box program where we the investments also was very successful. In the wake of our first complete runway show in September, our new Coach 1941 collection received significant attention from top-tier specialty retailers and luxury department stores. The collection will debut next month in fax, Opening Ceremony, breads ago and Jeffrey New York, as well as Collect in Paris, visit the aroma, in Japan, Gallery of and in Greater China. Of course, it will also be available at select Coach retail flagships globally, with all stores receiving the iconic bag, which arrived earlier this month and was the buy now feature of our September fashion show. 
We also just presented at London Collection Men's, the overwhelmingly positive reviews from both the editorial and retail communities. Naturally, we are thrilled by the attention that Stuart's collection are generating and see it as a clear vote of confidence for our strategic and creative direction. 
On stores, we are continuing to establish our new Modern Luxury concept stores globally, renovating and opening over 65 during the quarter, including 24 renovations and 2 new Modern Luxury stores in our directly operated North American business, taking us to about 250 across all channels worldwide. We remain on target to end the year at 40% of our doors in the new format. Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps, which exceeded the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. We've also seen our new retail and outlet Modern Luxury stores meeting or exceeding their targets in aggregate. 
In North American department stores, we completed 6 additional case line conversions, renovated 4 shop-in-shop locations to Modern Luxury in 2Q and added 4 Modern Luxury shops. Finally, we have about 30 shop managers in place today and have seen a significant impact versus balance of chain and expect to hire another 20 by the end of the year. 
On the marketing front, we remain focused on creating desire for our brands and building emotional connections with consumers globally. During the holiday season, we were decidedly more fun and festive in our marketing approach, including our lighthearted holiday film with the tagline #giftcultureus, which aired on network television in the U.S , a first for the brand, and globally, on our brand website and social media platforms, driving over 135 million impressions worldwide. And our popular Coach pups campaign brought smiles to consumers faces. 
Looking forward to the first half of calendar 2016, we will begin to celebrate our 75th anniversary, focusing on our distinctive brand proposition. No other American brand in our space can claim the unique combination of heritage and craftsmanship that is our DNA, fused with modern fashion sensibility of Stuart's vision. 
Next month, we will debut our heritage campaign, featuring Coach icons, and starting with the recently launched saddlebag. The global brand campaign is a key vehicle to communicate our authentic history as America's original house of leather. We are also excited about our Coach vintage initiative, a highly coveted collection of 4 of our most iconic bags that we've, reclaimed masterfully restored and hand-embellished by artisans, modernizing them for today. The collection has been curated for sale in premium channels worldwide, including Colette in Paris and Barnes in New York and Los Angeles. We will also feature installations in Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing, as well as the global online auction. You can learn more about Coach vintage on coach.com, where we have an environment dedicated to several of our 75th anniversary initiatives. 
In the digital arena, we launched e-commerce in the U.K. early in the quarter and drove over 0.5 million visits to the site during the period. In the U.S., we continued to gain traction through mobile devices, which represents over half of our online visits. And for holiday, we launched enhancements to coach.com, with personalized e-gifting where customers send Coach products as digital gifts. And as we increased our positive brand impressions, we continued to reduce the number of EOS events from prior year and are now at our planned sustainable cadence of about 2 events a month or 6 to 7 a quarter. 
As a result of these efforts, we have seen continued progress with consumers in our quarterly North America brand tracking survey fielded in December. Importantly, our overall brand affinities remains strong with consumers. And this quarter, we were particularly pleased to see notable improvement among category drivers in the high quality and unique attributes compared to 6 months ago, which we believe is a direct reflection of the investments we have put into the make of our product. 
So as our plans unfold and we continued to show steady improvement, we are very pleased and extremely proud of all that our team has accomplished during the past 3 seasons to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from an accessible luxury handbag and accessories brand to the one of the most relevant modern luxury brands in fashion. We are excited to see our vision and direction take hold, and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward. 
Turning now to a discussion of category trends. 
Overall, we estimate that the North American premium women's handbag and accessories market was essentially flat in the December quarter, with unit growth still quite positive, offset by lower AURs given the heightened levels of promotional activity. 
Importantly, against this backdrop, Coach's sales of women's bags and accessories, whilst still negative, once again improved sequentially in North America. 
And of course, as a lifestyle and multibrand company, we also participate in categories outside of women's bags and accessories. 
Men's, which represents about 17% of our global net sales, posted strong results in the quarter. We continued to believe it is a growth opportunity for the brand and are still forecasting mid-single-digit growth during FY '16. 
Over our planning horizon, we believe men's remains a billion-dollar opportunity. We also recently brought our men's footwear in-house, including production management, where we were previously only doing design. 
While the business is still in its infancy, we have been very pleased with our initial results. And of course, we also remain focused on building Coach Inc.'s market share within the fragmented men's and women's $27 billion global premium footwear category, which we estimate will grow at mid-single-digit pace over our planning horizon. Looking ahead, we see significant growth opportunities for the Stuart Weitzman and Coach brands in this category. 
While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we want to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. So I'll turn it over to Andre for a discussion of North America."

As you read in our release for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales in North America were down 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Our direct business, excluding wholesale, was also down 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. 
In aggregate, and as targeted, we drove a significant inflection in our business this holiday, led by retail. Comp trends also improved in outlet stores, with record Black Friday weekend sales. Overall, our total store comp was down 3% year-over-year, with high tickets offset by a lower conversion and a decline in traffic, which was in part by the overall weak trends. Our total comp was pressured an additional point by EOS, as we pulled back from 10 events in last year's second quarter to 7 in total. 
Now looking at results sequentially. 
As planned, an improvement in conversion drove the inflation in comp, as our initiatives across product, stores and marketing build momentum. Our in-store traffic trends also improved on a sequential basis despite a significant worsening in overall mall traffic. Against this backdrop of deteriorating traffic, specifically, in the outlet channel, competitive pressures intensified, and we responded with the high level the promotion than expected. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver a positive North American comp by the fourth quarter, again, led by the improvement in our retail stores, with the most significant driver being conversion. 
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on products. 
The above $400 price package rose in penetration saw another positive comp on the sales and unit basis and represented about 35% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year. The increase has showed continued progress of our elevation strategy, with higher price points and more fashion forward products, such as Nomad and Swagger performing strongly. In addition, our gifting offer, covering a broader range of styles and price points, also registered well, driving balance in our assortment, with the below $300 price brackets posting a positive sales and unit comp in the quarter. Our Essentials bags, such as the Turnlock satchel, Satchel and [ph], were important drivers, as was an extended offering of holiday giftables and accessories. 
As has been the case for quite a while, leather continued to outpace Logo across all channels. In the second quarter, Logo across all categories represented less than 5% of North America retail sales, and in outlet, it was under 30%, down year-over-year in both channels. 
Now in stores. As Victor mentioned, we've been very pleased with the performance for our Modern Luxury stores, particularly in the North America retail channel where comps remained positive, with now 66 stores renovated, including 14 added in the first half. In the outlet channel, to date, we've also seen improvement in trend post renovation and relative outperformance versus the balance of outlet stores. As noted, we have not seen the same level of inflection in outlet given the newer store base, notably in men's stand-alones. To-date, we've completed 26 outlet renovations, including 12 in the first half, and opened a total of 5 outlet stores in the new format, 3 in FY '15 and 2 year-to-date. We remain on target to renovate about 60 North American stores this year. 
In terms of elevating our customer experience, our stores in Time Warner Center in New York; in Paris; and Shanghai Hong Kong Plaza, are the latest installations of our concept craftmanship ours. We'll be refining and deploying the concept to select flagship stores globally, providing customization options and leather services, such as monogramming, which harken back to our routes as a leather goods manufacturer. We are also in the process of training dedicated leather services specialists in each craftmanship bar. This is a truly unique and differentiated feature of Coach stores, which is delighting customers across all markets. 
In addition to the Pinnacle craftmanship bar experience, as we reinforce our positioning as America's original house of leather, we're also rolling out 3 core leather services: leather care, monogramming and repairs assessment, in all stores globally. The initial impact of these services has been very positive, driving conversion and repeat purchase. 
Also, in support of the customer experience, we continued to refine our Modern Luxury hosting ceremony and introduced a new store associate uniform globally in October. This is another step towards creating a more consistent Modern Luxury in-store experience, with our staff looking and feeling more stylish and elevated. 
Now turning to event marketing. 
As you know, over the last 18 months, we've changed our approach to customer events in the retail channel, resulting in a significant reduction in promotional activity on a year-over-year basis in FY '15. In terms of learnings, as noted on the last 2 calls, we found that our semiannual open sales, which are also known -- which are now known as the winter sale and the summer sale, has served as recruitment vehicles for new customers. As a result, this year, we are holding 2 shorter duration open sale events over key traffic periods with the intent of attracting new retail customers. The first of these occurred around Black Friday, including a VIP preview with a tiered offer, which we then opened up to the public. We are very pleased with the results, with the events both bringing in new customers and reactivating lapsed ones. Similarly, our winter sale, which started and ended earlier than last year, was also quite successful. At the same time, we have adjusted the cadence and further reduced our closed targeted customer events to 2 a year. The first of which was held as planned in September, with the next expected in March, which will include a single invitation for a friend and our direct mail invitations. As a reminder, the timing of this year's event is consistent with last year. Importantly, we continued to evolve and optimize the timing and type of events. Our goal is to further reduce the number of days on promotion in our retail channel in FY '16. 
Now looking ahead to spring and summer. 
In retail, we just kicked off Coach's 75th anniversary by introducing the saddlebag, an archival glove-tanned leather bag offered in multiple sizes and modernized with an array of colors and . Additional anniversary that were launched in the March quarter included the bag, pouches and small leather goods and an archive ransack in men's. 
As Victor noted, Coach 1941 were launched in conjunction with Spring fashion week in February, with a comprehensive product expression in our top 50 locations, as well as key handbags in all stores. We'll add new styles with our best-selling Swagger family in fun fashion colors and unique novelty Patchwork. Additionally, we are launching new styles in the Nomad Hobo group and a silhouette, the mercy Satchel, in stores since last week. All of these new bags speaking to an important category driver segment. We'll also continue to animate Essentials with the launch of Turnlock, priced at $395, with change straps and Turnlock details, differentiating it from best-selling key item. And we'll add a fun layer of novelty prints spuds and bonnets to play of essentials. The Chelsea gross body, a key under $300 item, will also launch in Q3. 
Our Men's business in the third quarter will be driven by continued momentum in backpacks, our first men's launch and distortion in marketing spend on the category. In-store merchandising will position men's more front and center and will animate the collection with media support and in-store events. 
In outlet, given the response we have historical seen to novelty, we are most excited about peanuts, a key initiative for Q3. Peanuts just launched last week in stores and is off to an exceptionally strong start. As you may remember, Peanuts was introduced in retail last year and drove very strong interest in the brand. As always, we are focused on key high-traffic learnings, including Martin Luther King weekend, just passed, and Presidents Weekend, coming up in February. To this end, the backpack launched just in time for weekend is off to a strong start. Next month, we will relaunch key styles such as Kelsey, Phoebe and Christie and on trend seasonal colors, while our novelty assortment will feature hologram, white floral and stud detailing. In March, we'll introduce, a cool and highly functional shoulder bag showcasing our iconic Turnlock. 
And now turning it back to Victor for International."

Most generally, and similar to North America, we are distorting our focus in developed markets towards maximizing productivity. We are taking a portfolio approach to our store base, investing in our best locations where we'll see the biggest return and culling where appropriate. In developing markets, we are continuing to open stores, taking advantage of real estate opportunities. And in all markets, we are increasing marketing and investing in the Modern Luxury store experience, using elements such as the craftmanship ours we discussed to underscore our heritage and history of authenticity. 
In Greater China, second quarter sales rose 5% in constant currency, in line with our annual target, with double-digit growth on the Mainland and with positive comps offsetting weak results in Hong Kong and Macau. Hong Kong and Macau continued to be impacted by the dramatic slowdown in inbound tourist traffic, notably from the Mainland. At this juncture, with very limited visibility to an evolving macroeconomic environment, we are only updating our previous guidance of $625 million to reflect the renminbi devaluation since our last earnings call, resulting in an updated annual forecast of about $610 million in dollars. Importantly, despite short-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long term, as the drivers we have consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever. It's important to note that we still see the Chinese tourist as an increasingly large part of our business globally and have experienced the strengthening in Chinese tourist spending, notably in Japan and Europe. We are staffing into this trend, increasing the number of Mandarin-speaking store associates in these geographies. 
To that end, and as expected, Japan sales were up 2% on a constant currency basis despite a decrease in square footage, benefiting from increased tourist flows from Mainland Chinese. On a dollar basis, sales declined 3%, reflecting the weaker yen. While Japan is a mature market where we are distorting investment to our high-profile Tokyo stores and flagships while optimizing our fleet, we are continually assessing and leveraging the opportunity with tourists. In addition, the response to our new Modern Luxury stores from Japanese consumers and tourists alike has been quite positive, seen most notably in conversion in these locations. 
In Europe, our brand is continuing to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. Specifically, in the second quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace on a total and comparable sales basis despite the negative impact resulting from the tragic attacks in Paris. Importantly, during the quarter, we opened our Paris flagship on Rue Saint-Honoré, a significant milestone in our brand development and evolution in Europe, raising awareness with domestic consumers, as well as tourists. We will continue to look for other flagship opportunities with the focus on major European cities. 
Overall, we continued to believe that FY '16 will be another year of very strong growth, with sales growing to about $125 million. Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium men's and women's bags and accessories market. 
In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales were up modestly in local currency and declined in dollars. Here, too, we are focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives. 
Finally, I would like to point out that we have seen disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which whilst small, are important to growing brand awareness. In the second quarter, we again saw a strong growth in those distributor-operated locations focused on the domestic consumer, while travel retail has continued to be soft due to volatility of tourist flows globally, notably in Hong Kong and Macau. On a net sales basis, revenue grew significantly in the quarter, driven by shipment timing to ensure appropriate inventory positions for Chinese new year. Generally, we are very pleased with the execution of our brand transformation, as we continued to position the Coach brand for long-term success, while effectively supporting the growth and development of the Stuart Weitzman brand and navigating the volatile global economic trends and currency fluctuations in the intermediate term. 
Now I will turn it over to Jane for details on our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2016."

Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second fiscal quarter results for the consolidated businesses of Coach, Inc , as well as the Coach brand and Stuart Weitzman, ending with our outlook for FY '16. Please note the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results, corresponding GAAP results, as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today. 
Starting with Coach, Inc. 
On a consolidated basis, net sales totaled $1.27 billion for the second fiscal quarter compared with $1.22 billion reported in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 4%. On a constant currency basis, total sales increased 7% for the period. 
Gross profit totaled $859 million versus $841 million a year ago, while gross margin was 67.4% versus 69%. SG&A expenses of $574 million compared to $542 million in the prior year, an increase of 6%. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A totaled 45.1% on a non-GAAP basis compared to 44.4% in the year-ago quarter. 
Operating income for the quarter totaled $285 million compared to $299 million in the prior year, while operating margin was 22.4% versus 24.5%. 
Net interest expense was $6 million in the quarter as compared to net interest income of approximately $400,000 in the year-ago period. 
Net income for the quarter totaled $188 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.68. This included a contribution of $13 million or $0.05 per share from Stuart Weitzman. This compared to net income in the second quarter of FY '15 of $200 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.72. 
Turning now to performance by brand, and starting with the Coach brand. As a reminder, all comments I'm about to make are on a non-GAAP basis. 
Net sales for the Coach brand totaled $1.18 billion for the second fiscal quarter compared with $1.22 billion reported in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 3%. On a constant currency basis, total sales decreased 1% for the period. 
Gross profit totaled $799 million, while gross margin was 67.7%, down 130 basis points overall, including 110 basis points from currency. Our consolidated Coach brand gross margin continued to benefit from channel mix with our international segment outpacing. However, our gross margin in North America declined on a year-over-year basis. Margins was negatively impact by increased promotion in our outlet and wholesale channel in response to heightened discounting activity in those channels, as Andre mentioned. Higher average unit costs also pressured our gross margin in North America, as we continued to invest in product innovation, providing our customers with an elevated product offering at compelling price points. 
International segment gross margins increased from prior year, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency. 
SG&A expenses totaled $536 million, a decrease of 1%. SG&A expenses in the second quarter was somewhat lower than our expectations and reflected lower occupancy costs, as well as a shift in marketing timing. The stronger dollar also was a benefit to expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense totaled 45.4%. 
Operating income was $263 million, while operating margin was 22.3%, in line with expectations. 
Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. 
Stuart Weitzman brand net sales totaled $94 million for the second fiscal quarter, with strengths in boots and domestic retail driving a bit in our sales and margin projections for the quarter. Gross profit for the Stuart Weitzman brand totaled $61 million, resulting in a gross margin of 64.3%. SG&A expenses were $38 million or 40.8% of sales. Operating income was $22 million, representing an operating margin of 23.6%. 
During the second quarter of FY '16, the company recorded charges of $14 million under its multiyear transformation plan. These charges consisted primarily of organizational efficiency costs and accelerated depreciation for store renovations. In addition, the company recorded costs of approximately $10 million associated with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman, which primarily includes charges attributable to integration-related activities, contingent payments and the impact of a limited life purchase accounting. These actions taken together increased the company's SG&A expenses by about $24 million, negatively impacting net income by $18 million after tax or about $0.07 per diluted share in the second quarter. Our total transformation-related charges over the last 7 quarters were about $305 million. We continue to expect to incur the balance of these charges by the end of FY '16, primarily related to global store closures and organizational effectiveness, bringing the total multiyear charge to about $325 million. 
Now moving to global distribution. 
As you know, our overarching focus continues to be replatforming our stores, elevating brand perception, optimizing our store fleet and opening new locations selectively in key markets. During the quarter, and consistent with our annual guidance, there was little change in our global directly operated door count. As we now include a table detailing our openings and closures by geography and brand in our press release, I'll just touch on the highlights. 
In total, we added 1 net new Coach brand location globally in addition to 4 Stuart Weitzman locations in the quarter, 3 in the U.S. and 1 in Europe. 
Looking to the full year, as our overall plans have not changed materially, I'll be brief. 
In FY '16, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to be up low-single digits globally. This guidance continues to assume that Coach brand square footage in North America will be essentially unchanged in FY '16. Internationally, distribution growth will be led by Europe and China, where we are continuing to project double-digit increases in square footage in FY '16. In Japan, we continued to estimate a mid-single-digit decline in square footage, as we take a portfolio approach to optimizing our fleet. And in our directly operated businesses in Asia outside of China and Japan, we continued to focus on developing our current store base and expect only modest square footage growth this fiscal year. 
Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we continue to expect to open approximately 10 new directly operated locations in FY '16. 
Moving to the balance sheet. 
Inventory levels at quarter-end were $438 million, including $29 million of inventory associated with Stuart Weitzman. This compared to ending inventory of $447 million for the Coach brand in the year-ago period. Therefore, inventory declined 2% on a Coach, Inc. consolidated basis and were down 9% for the Coach brand. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to $1.1 billion a year ago. Given our debt issuance in the third quarter of FY '15 and the subsequent closure of the Stuart Weitzman acquisition, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter. As previously shared, we expect to use these proceeds to cover our working capital need in light of the investments in our business and the new corporate headquarters. 
Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $302 million compared to $445 million last year in Q2. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $196 million versus $406 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $106 million versus $39 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Before turning to FY '16 guidance, I did want to provide you with an update on the status of our investment in our new headquarter building at Hudson Yard. 
As you know, we long stated our belief that our investment in Hudson Yards will be monetizeable over time. Given today's real estate market strength and high demand for Hudson Yards, we believe now is the right time to explore selling our interest in the Hudson Yard's joint venture, while securing our future needs for space by entering into a long-term lease fare. We have begun to pursue these options with our partner related company. While it's too early to speculate, it is unlikely that any sale of our interest or other transaction would close until after our fiscal year ends and we move into our new space. 
As noted in our press release, we're maintaining our fiscal 2016 constant currency revenue growth and operating margin guidance for the Coach brand, while raising our consolidated operating income outlook based on second quarter results. 
So turning now to our financial outlook for the Coach brand on a standalone, 52-week, non-GAAP basis in FY '16. 
In sales, we still expect to deliver a low single-digit increase in constant currency in fiscal year 2016. Based on current exchange rates, currency headwinds are now expected to negatively impact our annual revenue growth by 225 to 250 basis points. We are still projecting a low single-digit aggregate comp decline in North America in FY '16. As previously noted, we expect comp to improve throughout the year, driven by product innovation, renovated Modern Luxury stores and our 75th anniversary marketing initiatives. We continue to expect to reach positive comps in the fourth quarter. Operating margin is still projected to be in the mid- to high teens, with some shift between the gross margin and expense ratio from previous guidance. To this end, gross margin for the Coach brand is projected to be in the range of last year's margin or about 69.5% on a constant currency basis, with negative foreign currency FX now expected to impact gross margin by 90 to 100 basis points. SG&A expenses, net of savings, are now expected to grow at a low single-digit rate in constant currency, while growth is expected to be roughly flat in dollars. The lower projected rate of growth is based on favorability realized in the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect at least $50 million in incremental cost savings from our transformation and restructuring initiatives. 
Interest expense for the year is estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. Finally, our tax rate is still expected to be in the area of 28% for the year. The expected rate reduction on a year-over-year basis is primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings, the ongoing benefit of available foreign tax credits, the anticipated closure of certain audits and the expiration of statutes in 2016, which is expected to significantly lower our tax rate in the third quarter. 
In addition, based on Stuart Weitzman's outperformance during the holiday quarter, as noted, we are now forecasting the brand sales to be in the area of $340 million on a dollar basis for fiscal 2016, an increase of about 10% from FY '15, driving Coach, Inc. consolidated revenue growth to high-single digits on a constant currency basis and adding about $0.12 to earnings per diluted share, excluding charges associated with financing, short-term purchase accounting adjustments, contingent payments and integration costs. As a result of the higher sales and margin outlook for the Stuart Weitzman business versus our original expectations, taken together with our projections for the Coach brand, we are raising our operating income outlook for Coach, Inc. for fiscal 2016. This includes an estimated negative impact of about 70 basis points and 20 basis points on a consolidated gross margin and operating margin, respectively, from Stuart Weitzman, a lesser impact than previously anticipated. 
As a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include a 53rd week in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is expected to contribute approximately $75 million to $80 million in incremental revenue and $0.06 in earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. 
We still expect CapEx for FY '16 for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $300 million, excluding the capital costs associated with the new headquarters, which are expected to be approximately $185 million in FY '16. 
There has been no change in our capital allocation policy. And over the next few years, our first priority is to continue to invest in our business as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders. And the third, capital returns. As I've stated before, we're committed to our dividend and expect our dividends to grow at least in line with net income growth as our transformation takes hold. Underpinning all 3 of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively: maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets. 
In closing, we have a clear strategy and a well-articulated implementation plan for FY '16, and we are pleased with our progress to-date. Building on this momentum, we remain confident in our long-term targets. Importantly, we believe that we have the resources to fund our plan, while maintaining our dividend during our heavy investment period. 
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

At the same time, we strongly believe that the consumers are looking for innovation. They are looking for quality, value, and most of all, they are looking for authenticity, and we don't believe there is a brand better position to take advantage of that than us, given our authenticity of heritage and craftsmanship, that's very much our DNA, when blended with Stuart's creative vision and the terrific reviews that we continue to get towards our products, our stores and our marketing, we're incredibly excited by the results that we're driving, by the differentiated positioning that we're driving and a very much seeing those results continue, to your second question, as we enter the third quarter, very much seeing similar trends with the guidance contemplating a return to  North America comps going positive in the fourth quarter per Jane's comments."

In terms of the areas of biggest impacts, Ike, I would say it's a combination of all. It's very difficult to really peel this apart. We're driving total brand impression. We, of course, see the most significant inflection in those stores that have been transformed, as you heard in our prepared notes. The North American full-price stores and aggregates still very much comping very positively, including those very first stores now that we have lapsed that we opened post Black Friday of 2014.

Overall, though, it continues to be the same strategy and focus, which is to continue to give the consumers more value, not only through pricing, of course, and it's important to recognize that outlet is a promotional channel, consumers do go to that channel specifically for deals, but also to what we're doing with experience.

As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, which was consistent with our expectations and reflects the most significant progress to date on our transforma",1710,"Good morning. Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, which was consistent with our expectations and reflects the most significant progress to date on our transformation plan despite the difficult retail environment globally. 
We drove further sequential improvement in our North America bricks and mortar business, lead, as expected, by our retail stores, while our outlet store channel also strengthened against the backdrop of lower tourist traffic and a highly promotional environment. Our international business has posted strong growth on a constant currency basis, highlighted by double-digit increases in Europe and Mainland China as well as sales gains in Japan. 
Overall, our results continued to give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will result in a return to top line growth this fiscal year and positive North American comps by our fourth fiscal quarter. 
Importantly, during the holiday period, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies, while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Our broader gifting assortment resonated with our customers globally across all price points and in all channels. We continued to transition more of the fleet into our modern luxury concept with a significant increase in remodels prior to holiday, driving results globally and the continued positive comps in the North American retail stores, which have been renovated. Finally, our holiday marketing struck a fine balance between fashion and bolder, more relatable gifting messages. 
We are also excited about Stuart Weitzman's results during the quarter, which exceeded expectations. Boots, in particular, sold well, notably in domestic retail stores and in spite of the unseasonably warm weather. Stuart Weitzman's strong outperformance against the category clearly reflected the brand's strong development of fashionable, trend right product as well as its growing relevance with increasing numbers of consumers globally. We are also excited to see Stuart Weitzman continue to gain traction internationally, notably in Asia, where the brand is still nascent, but has significant long-term potential. Importantly, we are effectively integrating Stuart Weitzman into Coach, Inc., while continuing to successfully execute the Coach brand transformation. Since acquisition, we've strengthened the Stuart Weitzman team by bringing in new talent. Specifically, we've recruited a new Chief Merchant, while also leveraging Coach leaders in handbags, specialist and product development roles and in senior finance and Human Resources positions. 
Now as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across our 3 key brand pillars of product, stores and marketing. 
Starting with product, where coach is clearly emerging as a house of modern fashion design. During the second quarter, as in Q1, essentially all of our retail stores offering, both men's and women's, were Stuart Vevers designs. Handbags continued to be driven by the Swagger family, with the Nomad Hobo also a key bestseller for the season. Essentials, including the Edie shoulder bag group, the Prairie Satchel and the Turnlock Tote were also great gifts at key price points, and our gift box program resonated globally. In outlet, we continued to increase the offering of Stuart's designs and updates, representing about 90% of the assortment, with key new styles such as Blake launched in late Q1 and the reimagined Phoebe and Christie groups in women's as well a strong group of backpacks driving our men's business. 
Our gift box program where we distorted investment also was very successful. In the wake of our first complete runway show in September, our new Coach 1941 collection received significant attention from top-tier specialty retailers and luxury department stores. The collection will debut next month in Saks, Nordstrom's, Opening Ceremony, Fred Segal and Jeffrey New York as well as Colette in Paris, Luisa Via Roma,  Umeda Hankyu (sic) [ Hankyu Umeda ] in Japan, Galleria West in Seoul and Lane Crawford in Greater China. Of course, it will also be available at select Coach retail flagships globally, with all stores receiving the iconic satchel bag which arrived earlier this month and was the buy now feature of our September fashion show. 
We also just presented at London Collection Men's, the overwhelmingly positive reviews from both the editorial and retail communities. Naturally, we're thrilled by the attention that Stuart's collections are generating and see it as a clear vote of confidence for our strategic and creative direction. 
On stores, we are continuing to establish our new modern luxury concept stores globally, renovating and opening over 65 during the quarter, including 24 renovations and 2 new modern luxury stores in our directly operated North American business, taking us to about 250 across all channels worldwide. We remain on target to end the year at 40% of our doors in the new format. Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps, which exceeded the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. We've also seen our new retail and outlet modern luxury stores meeting or exceeding their targets in aggregate. 
In North American department stores, we completed 6 additional case line conversions, renovated 4 shop-in-shop locations to modern luxury in 2Q and added 4 modern luxury shops. Finally, we have about 30 shop managers in place today and have seen a significant impact versus balance of chain and expect to hire another 20 by the end of the year. 
On the marketing front, we remain focused on creating desire for our brands and building emotional connections with consumers globally. During the holiday season, we were decidedly more fun and festive in our marketing approach, including our lighthearted holiday film with the tagline #GiveCoachOrElse, which aired on network television in the U.S , a first for the brand, and globally, on our brand website and social media platforms, driving over 135 million impressions worldwide. And our popular #coachpups campaign brought smiles to consumers' faces. 
Looking forward to the first half of calendar 2016, we will begin to celebrate our 75th anniversary, focusing on our distinctive brand proposition. No other American brand in our space can claim the unique combination of heritage and craftsmanship that is our DNA, fused with the modern fashion sensibility of Stuart's vision. 
Next month, we will debut our heritage campaign, featuring Coach icons, and starting with the recently launched saddlebag. The global brand campaign is a key vehicle to communicate our authentic history as America's original house of leather. We are also excited about our Coach vintage initiative, a highly coveted collection of 4 of our most iconic bags that we've reclaimed masterfully restored and hand-embellished by artisans, modernizing them for today. The collection has been curated for sale in premium channels worldwide, including Colette in Paris and Barneys in New York and Los Angeles. We will also feature installations in Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing as well as a global online auction. You can learn more about Coach vintage on coach.com, where we have an environment dedicated to several of our 75th anniversary initiatives. 
In the digital arena, we launched e-commerce in the U.K. early in the quarter and drove over 0.5 million visits to the site during the period. In the U.S., we continued to gain traction through mobile devices, which represents over half of our online visits. And for holiday, we launched enhancements to coach.com, with personalized e-gifting where customers sent Coach products as digital gifts. And as we increased our positive brand impressions, we continued to reduce the number of eOS events from prior year and are now at our planned sustainable cadence of about 2 events a month or 6 to 7 a quarter. 
As a result of these efforts, we have seen continued progress with consumers in our quarterly North America brand tracking survey fielded in December. Importantly, our overall brand affinities remain strong with consumers. And this quarter, we were particularly pleased to see notable improvement among category drivers in the high quality and unique attributes compared to 6 months ago, which we believe is a direct reflection of the investments we have put into the make of our product. 
So as our plans unfold and we continue to show steady improvement, we are very pleased and extremely proud of all that our team has accomplished during the past 3 seasons to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from an accessible luxury handbag and accessories brand to the one of the most relevant modern luxury brands in fashion. We are excited to see our vision and direction take hold, and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward. 
Turning now to a discussion of category trends. Overall, we estimate that the North American premium women's handbag and accessories market was essentially flat in the December quarter, with unit growth still quite positive, offset by lower AURs given the heightened levels of promotional activity. 
Importantly, against this backdrop, Coach's sales of women's bags and accessories, whilst still negative, once again improved sequentially in North America. And of course, as a lifestyle and multi-brand company, we also participate in categories outside of women's bags and accessories. 
Men's, which represents about 17% of our global net sales, posted strong results in the quarter. We continued to believe it as a growth opportunity for the brand and are still forecasting mid-single-digit growth during FY '16. 
Over our planning horizon, we believe men's remains a billion-dollar opportunity. We also recently brought our men's footwear in-house, including production management, where we were previously only doing design. 
While the business is still in its infancy, we have been very pleased with our initial results. And of course, we also remain focused on building Coach Inc.'s market share within the fragmented men's and women's $27 billion global premium footwear category, which we estimate will grow at mid-single-digit pace over our planning horizon. Looking ahead, we see significant growth opportunities for the Stuart Weitzman and Coach brands in this category. 
While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. So I'll turn it over to Andre for a discussion of North America."

As you read in our release for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales in North America were down 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Our direct business, excluding wholesale, was also down 7% as reported and 6% in constant curren",1416,"Thanks, Victor. As you read in our release for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales in North America were down 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Our direct business, excluding wholesale, was also down 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. 
In aggregate, and as targeted, we drove a significant inflection in our business this holiday, led by retail. Comp trends also improved in our outlet stores, with record Black Friday weekend sales. Overall, our total store comp was down 3% year-over-year, with high ticket offset by lower conversion and a decline in traffic, which was hurt in part by the overall weak mall trends. Our total comp was pressured an additional point by eOS, as we pulled back from 10 events in last year's second quarter to 7 in total. 
Now looking at results sequentially. As planned, an improvement in conversion drove the inflection in comp, as our initiatives across product, stores and marketing build momentum. Our in-store traffic trends also improved on a sequential basis despite a significant worsening in overall mall traffic. Against this backdrop of deteriorating traffic, specifically, in the outlet channel, competitive pressures intensified, and we responded with a high level the promotion than expected. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver a positive North American comp by the fourth quarter, again, led by the improvement in our retail stores, with the most significant driver being conversion. 
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product. The above $400 price bracket rose in penetration saw another positive comp on the sales and unit basis and represented about 35% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year. The increase has showed continued progress of our elevation strategy, with higher price points and more fashion forward products, such as Nomad and Swagger performing strongly. In addition, our gifting offer, covering a broader range of styles and price points, also registered well, driving balance in our assortment, with the below $300 price bracket posting a positive sales and unit comp in the quarter. Our essentials bags, such as the Turnlock Satchel, Prairie Satchel and Scout Hobo were important drivers, as was an extended offering of holiday giftables and accessories. 
As has been the case for quite a while, leather continued to outpace Logo across all channels. In the second quarter, Logo, across all categories, represented less than 5% of North America retail sales, and in outlet, it was under 30%, down year-over-year in both channels. 
Now in stores. As Victor mentioned, we've been very pleased with the performance of our modern luxury stores, particularly in the North America retail channel where comps remained positive, with now 66 stores renovated, including 14 added in the first half. In the outlet channel, to date, we've also seen improvement in trend post renovation and relative outperformance versus the balance of outlet stores. As noted, we've not seen the same level of inflection in outlet given the newer store base, notably in men's stand-alones. To-date, we've completed 26 outlet renovations, including 12 in the first half, and opened a total of 5 outlet stores in the new format, 3 in FY '15 and 2 year-to-date. We remain on target to renovate about 60 North American stores this year. 
In terms of elevating our customer experience, our stores in Time Warner Center in New York, Rue Saint-Honore in Paris and Shanghai Hong Kong Plaza, are the latest installations of our concept craftsmanship bars. We'll be refining and deploying the concept to select flagship stores globally, providing customization options and leather services, such as monogramming, which harken back to our routes as a leather goods manufacturer. We're also in the process of training dedicated leather services specialists in each craftsmanship bar. This is a truly unique and differentiating feature of Coach stores, which is delighting customers across all markets. 
In addition to the Pinnacle craftmanship bar experience, as we reinforce our positioning as America's original house of leather, we're also rolling out 3 core leather services: leather care, monogramming and repairs assessment, in all stores globally. The initial impact of these services has been very positive, driving conversion and repeat purchase. 
Also, in support of the customer experience, we continue to refine our modern luxury hosting ceremony and introduced a new store associate uniform globally in October. This is another step towards creating a more consistent modern luxury in-store experience, with our staff looking and feeling more stylish and elevated. 
Now turning to event marketing. As you know, over the last 18 months, we've changed our approach to customer events in the retail channel, resulting in a significant reduction in promotional activity on a year-over-year basis in FY '15. In terms of learnings, as noted on the last 2 calls, we found that our semiannual open sales, which are also known -- which are now known as the winter sale and the summer sale, has served as recruitment vehicles for new customers. As a result, this year, we are holding 2 shorter duration open sale events over key traffic periods with the intent of attracting new retail customers. The first of these occurred around Black Friday, including a VIP preview with a tiered offer, which we then opened up to the public. We were very pleased with the results, with the events both bringing in new customers and reactivating lapsed ones. Similarly, our winter sale, which started and ended earlier than last year, was also quite successful. At the same time, we've adjusted the cadence and further reduced our closed targeted customer events to 2 a year. The first of which was held as planned in September, with the next expected in March, which will include a single pass along invitation for a friend and our direct mail invitations. As a reminder, the timing of this year's event is consistent with last year. Importantly, we continued to evolve and optimize the timing and type of events. Our goal is to further reduce the number of days on promotion in our retail channel in FY '16. 
Now looking ahead to spring and summer. In retail, we just kicked off Coach's 75th anniversary by introducing the saddlebag, an archival glove-tanned leather bag offered in multiple sizes and modernized with an array of colors and trends. Additional anniversary starts that were launched in the March quarter include the dinky bag, pouches and small leather goods, and an archival rucksack in men's. 
As Victor noted, Coach 1941 was launched in conjunction with spring fashion week in February, with a comprehensive product expression in our top 50 locations as well as key handbags in all stores. We'll add new styles with our best-selling Swagger family in fun fashion colors and unique novelty patchwork. Additionally, we are launching new styles in the Nomad Hobo group and a new silhouette, the Marcie [ph] satchel, in stores since last week. All of these new bags speaking to an important category driver segment. We'll also continue to animate essentials with the launch of Turnlock Edie, priced at $395, with chain straps and Turnlock details differentiating it from best-selling key item, Edie. We'll add a fun layer of novelty prints, studs and grommets to play of essentials. The Chelsea cross-body, a key under $300 item, will also launch in Q3. 
Our men's business in the third quarter will be driven by continued momentum in backpacks, our first men's collection launch and distortion in marketing spend on the category. In-store merchandising will position men's more front and center and will animate the collection with media support and in-store events. 
In outlet, given the response we historically seen to novelty, we're most excited about Peanuts, a key initiative for Q3. Peanuts just launched last week in stores and is off to an exceptionally strong start. As you may remember, Peanuts was introduced in retail last year and drove very strong interest in the brand. As always, we are focused on key high-traffic movements, including Martin Luther King weekend, just passed, and President's Weekend, coming up in February. To this end, the Billy Backpack launched just in time for MLK weekend is off to a strong start. Next month, we will relaunch key styles such as Kelsey, Phoebe and Christie and on-trend seasonal colors, while our novelty assortment will feature hologram, white floral and stud detailing. In March, we'll introduce Carlyle, a cool and highly functional shoulder bag showcasing our iconic Turnlock. 
And now turning it back to Victor for International."

Most generally, and similar to North America, we are distorting our focus in developed markets towards maximizing productivity. We are taking a portfolio approach to our store base, investing in our best locations where we'll see the biggest return and culling where appropriate. In developing markets, we are continuing to open stores, taking advantage of real estate opportunities. And in all markets, we are increasing marketing and investing in the modern luxury store experience, using elements such as the craftsmanship bars we discussed to underscore our heritage and history of authenticity. 
In Greater China, second quarter sales rose 5% in constant currency, in line with our annual target, with double-digit growth on the Mainland and with positive comps offsetting weak results in Hong Kong and Macau. Hong Kong and Macau continued to be impacted by the dramatic slowdown in inbound tourist traffic, notably from the Mainland. At this juncture, with very limited visibility to an evolving macroeconomic environment, we are only updating our previous guidance of $625 million to reflect the renminbi devaluation since our last earnings call, resulting in an updated annual forecast of about $610 million in dollars. Importantly, despite short-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long term, as the drivers we have consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever. It's important to note that we still see the Chinese tourist as an increasingly large part of our business globally and have experienced the strengthening in Chinese tourist spending, notably in Japan and Europe. We are staffing into this trend, increasing the number of Mandarin-speaking store associates in these geographies. 
To that end, and as expected, Japan sales were up 2% on a constant currency basis despite a decrease in square footage, benefiting from increased tourist flows from Mainland Chinese. On a dollar basis, sales declined 3%, reflecting the weaker yen. While Japan is a mature market where we are distorting investment to our high-profile Tokyo stores and flagships while optimizing our fleet, we are continually assessing and leveraging the opportunity with tourists. In addition, the response to our new modern luxury stores from Japanese consumers and tourists alike has been quite positive, seen most notably in conversion in these locations. 
In Europe, our brand is continuing to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. Specifically, in the second quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace on a total and comparable store sales basis despite the negative impact resulting from the tragic attacks in Paris. Importantly, during the quarter, we opened our Paris flagship on Rue Saint-Honoré, a significant milestone in our brand development and evolution in Europe, raising awareness with domestic consumers as well as tourists. We will continue to look for other flagship opportunities with the focus on major European cities. 
Overall, we continue to believe that FY '16 will be another year of very strong growth, with sales growing to about $125 million. Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium men's and women's bag and accessories market. 
In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales were up modestly in local currency and declined in dollars. Here, too, we are focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives. 
Finally, I would like to point out that we have seen disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which whilst small, are important to growing brand awareness. In the second quarter, we again saw a strong growth in those distributor-operated locations focused on the domestic consumer, while travel retail has continued to be soft due to volatility of tourist flows globally, notably in Hong Kong and Macau. On a net sales basis, revenue grew significantly in the quarter, driven by shipment timing to ensure appropriate inventory positions for Chinese New Year. Generally, we are very pleased with the execution of our brand transformation, as we continue to position the Coach brand for long-term success, while effectively supporting the growth and development of the Stuart Weitzman brand and navigating the volatile global economic trends and currency fluctuations in the intermediate term. 
Now I will turn it over to Jane for details on our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2016."

Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second fiscal quarter results for the consolidated businesses of Coach, Inc. as well as",2167,"Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second fiscal quarter results for the consolidated businesses of Coach, Inc. as well as the Coach brand and Stuart Weitzman, ending with our outlook for FY '16. Please note the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results, corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today. 
Starting with Coach, Inc. On a consolidated basis, net sales totaled $1.27 billion for the second fiscal quarter compared with $1.22 billion reported in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 4%. On a constant currency basis, total sales increased 7% for the period. 
Gross profit totaled $859 million versus $841 million a year ago, while gross margin was 67.4% versus 69%. SG&A expenses of $574 million compared to $542 million in the prior year, an increase of 6%. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A totaled 45.1% on a non-GAAP basis compared to 44.4% in the year ago quarter. 
Operating income for the quarter totaled $285 million compared to $299 million in the prior year, while operating margin was 22.4% versus 24.5%. 
Net interest expense was $6 million in the quarter as compared to net interest income of approximately $400,000 in the year ago period. 
Net income for the quarter totaled $188 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.68. This included a contribution of $13 million or $0.05 per share from Stuart Weitzman. This compared to net income in the second quarter of FY '15 of $200 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.72. 
Turning now to performance by brand, and starting with the Coach brand. As a reminder, all comments I'm about to make are on a non-GAAP basis. 
Net sales for the Coach brand totaled $1.18 billion for the second fiscal quarter compared with $1.22 billion reported in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 3%. On a constant currency basis, total sales decreased 1% for the period. 
Gross profit totaled $799 million, while gross margin was 67.7%, down 130 basis points overall, including 110 basis points from currency. Our consolidated Coach brand gross margin continued to benefit from channel mix with our international segment outpacing. However, our gross margin in North America declined on a year-over-year basis. Margins was negatively impact by increased promotion in our outlet and wholesale channel in response to heightened discounting activity in those channels, as Andre mentioned. Higher average unit costs also pressured our gross margin in North America, as we continued to invest in product innovation, providing our customers with an elevated product offering at compelling price points. 
International segment gross margins increased from prior year, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency. 
SG&A expenses totaled $536 million, a decrease of 1%. SG&A expenses in the second quarter was somewhat lower than our expectations and reflected lower occupancy costs as well as a shift in marketing timing. The stronger dollar also was a benefit to expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense totaled 45.4%. Operating income was $263 million, while operating margin was 22.3%, in line with expectations. 
Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. Stuart Weitzman brand net sales totaled $94 million for the second fiscal quarter, with strengths in boots and domestic retail driving a bit in our sales and margin projections for the quarter. Gross profit for the Stuart Weitzman brand totaled $61 million, resulting in a gross margin of 64.3%. SG&A expenses were $38 million or 40.8% of sales. Operating income was $22 million, representing an operating margin of 23.6%. 
During the second quarter of FY '16, the company recorded charges of $14 million under its multiyear transformation plan. These charges consisted primarily of organizational efficiency costs and accelerated depreciation for store renovations. In addition, the company recorded costs of approximately $10 million associated with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman, which primarily includes charges attributable to integration-related activities, contingent payments and the impact of limited life purchase accounting. These actions taken together increased the company's SG&A expenses by about $24 million, negatively impacting net income by $18 million after tax or about $0.07 per diluted share in the second quarter. Our total transformation-related charges over the last 7 quarters were about $305 million. We continue to expect to incur the balance of these charges by the end of FY '16, primarily related to global store closures and organizational effectiveness, bringing the total multiyear charge to about $325 million. 
Now moving to global distribution. As you know, our overarching focus continues to be replatforming our stores, elevating brand perception, optimizing our store fleet and opening new locations selectively in key markets. During the quarter, and consistent with our annual guidance, there was little change in our global directly operated door count. As we now include a table detailing our openings and closures by geography and brand in our press release, I'll just touch on the highlights. 
In total, we added 1 net new Coach brand location globally in addition to 4 Stuart Weitzman locations in the quarter, 3 in the U.S. and 1 in Europe. 
Looking to the full year, as our overall plans have not changed materially, I'll be brief. 
In FY '16, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to be up low single digits globally. This guidance continues to assume that Coach brand square footage in North America will be essentially unchanged in FY '16. Internationally, distribution growth will be led by Europe and China, where we are continuing to project double-digit increases in square footage in FY '16. In Japan, we continued to estimate a mid-single-digit decline in square footage, as we take a portfolio approach to optimizing our fleet. And in our directly-operated businesses in Asia, outside of China and Japan, we continued to focus on developing our current store base and expect only modest square footage growth this fiscal year. 
Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we continue to expect to open approximately 10 new directly operated locations in FY '16. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter-end were $438 million, including $29 million of inventory associated with Stuart Weitzman. This compared to ending inventory of $447 million for the Coach brand in the year ago period. Therefore, inventory declined 2% on a Coach, Inc. consolidated basis and was down 9% for the Coach brand. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to $1.1 billion a year ago. Given our debt issuance in the third quarter of FY '15 and the subsequent closure of the Stuart Weitzman acquisition, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter. As previously shared, we expect to use these proceeds to cover our working capital needs in light of the investments in our business and the new corporate headquarters. 
Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $302 million compared to $445 million last year in Q2. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $196 million versus $406 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $106 million versus $39 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Before turning to FY '16 guidance, I did want to provide you with an update on the status of our investment in our new headquarter building at Hudson Yard. 
As you know, we've long stated our belief that our investment in Hudson Yards would be monetizeable over time. Given today's real estate market strength and high demand for Hudson Yards, we believe now is the right time to explore selling our interest in the Hudson Yards joint venture, while securing our future needs for space by entering into a long-term lease fare. We have begun to pursue these options with our partner related companies. While it's too early to speculate, it is unlikely that any sale of our interest or other transaction would close until after our fiscal year ends and we move into our new space. 
As noted in our press release, we're maintaining our fiscal 2016 constant currency revenue growth and operating margin guidance for the Coach brand, while raising our consolidated operating income outlook based on second quarter results. 
So turning now to our financial outlook for the Coach brand on a standalone, 52-week, non-GAAP basis in FY '16. In sales, we still expect to deliver a low single-digit increase in constant currency in fiscal year 2016. Based on current exchange rates, currency headwinds are now expected to negatively impact our annual revenue growth by 225 to 250 basis points. We are still projecting a low single-digit aggregate comp decline in North America in FY '16. As previously noted, we expect comp to improve throughout the year, driven by product innovation, renovated modern luxury stores and our 75th anniversary marketing initiatives. We continue to expect to reach positive comps in the fourth quarter. Operating margin is still projected to be in the mid- to high teens, with some shift between the gross margin and expense ratio from previous guidance. To this end, gross margin for the Coach brand is projected to be in the range of last year's margin or about 69.5% on a constant currency basis, with negative foreign currency FX now expected to impact gross margin by 90 to 100 basis points. SG&A expenses, net of savings, are now expected to grow at a low single-digit rate in constant currency, while growth is expected to be roughly flat in dollars. The lower projected rate of growth is based on favorability realized in the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect at least $50 million in incremental cost savings from our transformation and restructuring initiatives. 
Interest expense for the year is estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. Finally, our tax rate is still expected to be in the area of 28% for the year. The expected rate reduction on a year-over-year basis is primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings, the ongoing benefit of available foreign tax credits, the anticipated closure of certain audits and the expiration of statutes in 2016, which is expected to significantly lower our tax rate in the third quarter. 
In addition, based on Stuart Weitzman's outperformance during the holiday quarter, as noted, we are now forecasting the brand sales to be in the area of $340 million on a dollar basis for fiscal 2016, an increase of about 10% from FY '15, driving Coach, Inc. consolidated revenue growth to high single digits on a constant currency basis and adding about $0.12 to earnings per diluted share, excluding charges associated with financing, short-term purchase accounting adjustments, contingent payments and integration costs. As a result of the higher sales and margin outlook for the Stuart Weitzman business versus our original expectations, taken together with our projections for the Coach brand, we are raising our operating income outlook for Coach, Inc. for fiscal 2016. This includes an estimated negative impact of about 70 basis points and 20 basis points on a consolidated gross margin and operating margin, respectively, from Stuart Weitzman, a lesser impact than previously anticipated. 
As a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include a 53rd week in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is expected to contribute approximately $75 million to $80 million in incremental revenue and $0.06 in earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. 
We still expect CapEx for FY '16 for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $300 million, excluding the capital costs associated with the new headquarters, which are expected to be approximately $185 million in FY '16. 
There has been no change in our capital allocation policy. And over the next few years, our first priority is to continue to invest in our business as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. 
Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders. 
And third, capital returns. As I've stated before, we're committed to our dividend and expect our dividend to grow at least in line with net income growth as our transformation takes hold. Underpinning all 3 of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively: maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets. 
In closing, we have a clear strategy and a well-articulated implementation plan for FY '16, and we're pleased with our progress to-date. Building on this momentum, we remain confident in our long-term targets. Importantly, we believe that we have the resources to fund our plan, while maintaining our dividend during our heavy investment period. 
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

In terms of the category, Bob, there is no doubt in our mind that the secular shift from apparel to accessories definitely continues, and that there isn't a better space to be in the fashion space than handbags and accessories. In the short term, however, there is some volatility, driven by macro issues and, of course, the extreme exchange rate volatility that we have seen, which is impacting tourists. At the same time, we strongly believe that the consumers are looking for innovation. They are looking for quality, value, and most of all, they are looking for authenticity, and we don't believe there is a brand better positioned to take advantage of that than us, given our authenticity of heritage and craftsmanship, that's very much our DNA, when blended with Stuart's creative vision and the terrific reviews that we continue to get towards our product, our stores and our marketing. We're incredibly excited by the results that we're driving, by the differentiated positioning that we're driving and very much seeing those results continue, to your second question, as we enter the third quarter, very much seeing similar trends with guidance contemplating a return to  North America comps going positive in the fourth quarter per Jane's comments."

And we're also seeing some lapse consumers come back, and that is very exciting given the 75th anniversary plans that we have ahead of us, and our continued reinforcement of what's true to Coach, which is really a focus on glove-tanned leather and all that of the activities that Andre discussed as it relates to the customer service experience that we're driving in our stores with the craftsmanship bars as well as the marketing activities. In terms of the areas of biggest impacts, Ike, I would say it's a combination of all. It's very difficult to really peel this apart. We're driving total brand impression. We, of course, see the most significant inflection in those stores that have been transformed, as you heard in our prepared notes. The North American full-price stores in aggregate is still very much comping positively, including those very first stores now that we have lapsed that we opened post Black Friday of 2014. So really excited by the continued performance in those locations and excited by what we're seeing not only here in North America, but also globally, where the pre post on those locations is very much outpacing the rest of the fleet."

Overall, though, it continues to be the same strategy and focus, which is to continue to give the consumers more value, not only through pricing, of course, and it's important to recognize that outlet is a promotional channel and consumers do go to that channel specifically for deals, but also to what we're doing with experience. Those of you who have had the opportunity to visit our modern luxury outlet stores, I think see and feel that, and that continues to be a major program for us as we also continue to put make into the product and give consumers value across all of our channels."

You've seen us put a lot of emphasis on bringing innovation to coach.com as a full-price vehicle as well as to everything that we're doing, of course, digitally through social media, gaming, very, very quick relevance for the brand, especially through Instagram, which has been a major focus for Coach. Internationally, you've heard during our prepared remarks today that we have just opened a new e-commerce site in Europe, having started with the U.K., our plans will be to roll that out across Europe over the next 12 months. While we also continue to gain traction in Asia, I'm happy to report that our teams in Asia have, in many ways, been leading the way in those markets for the entire category in Japan. We've made great progress getting on to line. And in China, not only seen a way above where we've -- one of the leading -- I believe is still the leading fashion brand in terms of number of followers, but also on WeChat, where we've also been leading the way.

In the case of Stuart Weitzman, what we're seeing is really an affirmation of all the due diligence that we've done. It's a terrific brand with amazing fit, amazing quality, superb supply chain, truly a leader in this space in the U.S. And in a season where boots were not selling, given the unseasonably warm weather, they were the top performer across all channels, whether it be here in top-tiered department stores in the U.S., Europe and in China, where they're gaining increasing relevance, which is very exciting for us. And it's not only the products, they're doing an amazing job engaging with consumers. We talked about what Coach is doing, of course, online, but what the Stuart Weitzman team has been doing with their marketing is a great example for us at Coach and indeed for the entire industry as they engage with more youthful consumers online. In terms of longer-term, it's very much consistent with what we have shared. We will, of course, be leveraging the Coach team to support Stuart Weitzman in the development of their handbag and accessories business. We discussed already the talent that is already working on that project and by the end of this calendar year, beginning of next, we should begin to see some of that product hit the Stuart Weitzman stores. In addition, the Stuart Weitzman team will be supporting Coach with the footwear supply chain opportunities that exist when it comes to fit, and certainly, comfort, and potentially, longer-term in a more meaningful way as well. And with supporting the Stuart Weitzman brand already in some significant ways with real estate and we've talked about Regent Street where we will be opening the first Stuart Weitzman flagship in the U.K. next to the Coach flagship there later this year."

Future results may differ materially from our current expectations, based upon a number of important factors, including risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, control costs, successfully execute our transformation initiatives and growth strategies or our ability to achieve intended benefits, cost savings and synergies from the Stuart Weitzman acquisition.

As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, which was consistent with our expectations and reflects the most significant progress to date on our transformation plan despite the difficult retail environment globally. 
We drove further sequential improvement in our North America bricks and mortar business, lead, as expected, by our retail stores, while our outlet store channel also strengthened against the backdrop of lower tourist traffic and a highly promotional environment. Our international business has posted strong growth on a constant currency basis, highlighted by double-digit increases in Europe and Mainland China as well as sales gains in Japan. 
Overall, our results continue to give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will result in a return to top line growth this fiscal year and positive North American comps by our fourth fiscal quarter. 
Importantly, during the holiday period, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies, while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Our broader gifting assortment resonated with our customers globally across all price points and in all channels. We continued to transition more of the fleet into our modern luxury concept with a significant increase in remodels prior to holiday, driving results globally and the continued positive comps in the North American retail stores, which have been renovated. Finally, our holiday marketing struck a fine balance between fashion and bolder, more relatable gifting messages. 
We are also excited about Stuart Weitzman's results during the quarter, which exceeded expectations. Boots, in particular, sold well, notably in domestic retail stores and in spite of the unseasonably warm weather. Stuart Weitzman's strong outperformance against the category clearly reflected the brand's strong development of fashionable, trend-right product as well as its growing relevance with increasing numbers of consumers globally. We are also excited to see Stuart Weitzman continue to gain traction internationally, notably in Asia, where the brand is still nascent, but has significant long-term potential. Importantly, we are effectively integrating Stuart Weitzman into Coach, Inc., while continuing to successfully execute the Coach brand transformation. Since acquisition, we've strengthened the Stuart Weitzman team by bringing in new talent. Specifically, we've recruited a new Chief Merchant, while also leveraging Coach leaders in handbags, specialist and product development roles and in senior finance and Human Resources positions. 
Now as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across our 3 key brand pillars of product, stores and marketing. 
Starting with product, where coach is clearly emerging as a house of modern fashion design. During the second quarter, as in Q1, essentially all of our retail stores offering, both men's and women's, were Stuart Vevers designs. Handbags continued to be driven by the Swagger family, with the Nomad Hobo also a key bestseller for the season. Essentials, including the Edie shoulder bag group, the Prairie Satchel and the Turnlock Tote were also great gifts at key price points, and our gift box program resonated globally. In outlet, we continued to increase the offering of Stuart's designs and updates, representing about 90% of the assortment, with key new styles such as Blake launched in late Q1 and the re-imagined Phoebe and Christie groups in women's as well a strong group of backpacks driving our men's business. 
Our gift box program where we distorted investment also was very successful. In the wake of our first complete runway show in September, our new Coach 1941 collection received significant attention from top-tier specialty retailers and luxury department stores. The collection will debut next month in Saks, Nordstrom's, Opening Ceremony, Fred Segal and Jeffrey New York as well as Colette in Paris, Luisa Via Roma, Umeda Hankyu (sic) [ Hankyu Umeda ] in Japan, Galleria West in Seoul and Lane Crawford in Greater China. Of course, it will also be available at select Coach retail flagships globally, with all stores receiving the iconic saddle bag; which arrived earlier this month and was the buy now feature of our September fashion show. 
We also just presented at London Collection Men's to overwhelmingly positive reviews from both the editorial and retail communities. Naturally, we're thrilled by the attention that Stuart's collections are generating and see it as a clear vote of confidence for our strategic and creative direction. 
On stores, we are continuing to establish our new modern luxury concept stores globally, renovating and opening over 65 during the quarter, including 24 renovations and 2 new modern luxury stores in our directly operated North American business, taking us to about 250 across all channels worldwide. We remain on target to end the year at 40% of our doors in the new format. Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps, which exceeded the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. We've also seen our new retail and outlet modern luxury stores meeting or exceeding their targets in aggregate. 
In North American department stores, we completed 6 additional case line conversions, renovated 4 shop-in-shop locations to modern luxury in 2Q and added 4 modern luxury shops. Finally, we have about 30 shop managers in place today and have seen a significant impact versus balance of chain and expect to hire another 20 by the end of the year. 
On the marketing front, we remain focused on creating desire for our brands and building emotional connections with consumers globally. During the holiday season, we were decidedly more fun and festive in our marketing approach, including our lighthearted holiday film with the tagline #GiveCoachOrElse, which aired on network television in the U.S , a first for the brand, and globally, on our brand websites and social media platforms, driving over 135 million impressions worldwide. And our popular #coachpups campaign brought smiles to consumers' faces. 
Looking forward to the first half of calendar 2016, we will begin to celebrate our 75th anniversary, focusing on our distinctive brand proposition. No other American brand in our space can claim the unique combination of heritage and craftsmanship that is our DNA, fused with the modern fashion sensibility of Stuart's vision. 
Next month, we will debut our heritage campaign, featuring Coach icons, and starting with the recently launched saddle bag. The global brand campaign is a key vehicle to communicate our authentic history as America's original house of leather. We are also excited about our Coach vintage initiative, a highly coveted collection of 4 of our most iconic bags that we've reclaimed, masterfully restored and hand-embellished by artisans, modernizing them for today. The collection has been curated for sale in premium channels worldwide, including Colette in Paris and Barneys in New York and Los Angeles. We will also feature installations in Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing as well as a global online auction. You can learn more about Coach vintage on coach.com, where we have an environment dedicated to several of our 75th anniversary initiatives. 
In the digital arena, we launched e-commerce in the U.K. early in the quarter and drove over 0.5 million visits to the site during the period. In the U.S., we continued to gain traction through mobile devices, which represents over half of our online visits. And for holiday, we launched enhancements to coach.com, with personalized e-gifting where customers sent Coach products as digital gifts. And as we increased our positive brand impressions, we continued to reduce the number of eOS events from prior year and are now at our planned sustainable cadence of about 2 events a month or 6 to 7 a quarter. 
As a result of these efforts, we have seen continued progress with consumers in our quarterly North America brand tracking survey, fielded in December. Importantly, our overall brand affinities remain strong with consumers. And this quarter, we were particularly pleased to see notable improvement among category drivers in the high quality and unique attributes compared to 6 months ago, which we believe is a direct reflection of the investments we have put into the make of our product. 
So as our plans unfold and we continue to show steady improvement, we are very pleased and extremely proud of all that our team has accomplished during the past 3 seasons to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from an accessible luxury handbag and accessories brand to the one of the most relevant modern luxury brands in fashion. We are excited to see our vision and direction take hold, and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward. 
Turning now to a discussion of category trends. Overall, we estimate that the North American premium women's handbag and accessories market was essentially flat in the December quarter, with unit growth still quite positive, offset by lower AURs given the heightened levels of promotional activity. 
Importantly, against this backdrop, Coach's sales of women's bags and accessories, whilst still negative, once again improved sequentially in North America. And of course, as a lifestyle and multi-brand company, we also participate in categories outside of women's bags and accessories. 
Men's, which represents about 17% of our global net sales, posted strong results in the quarter. We continue to believe it is a growth opportunity for the brand and are still forecasting mid-single-digit growth during FY '16. 
Over our planning horizon, we believe Men's remains a billion-dollar opportunity. We also recently brought our Men's footwear in-house, including production management, where we were previously only doing design. 
While the business is still in its infancy, we have been very pleased with our initial results. And of course, we also remain focused on building Coach Inc.'s market share within the fragmented men's and women's $27 billion global premium footwear category, which we estimate will grow at mid-single-digit pace over our planning horizon. Looking ahead, we see significant growth opportunities for the Stuart Weitzman and Coach brands in this category. 
While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. So I'll turn it over to Andre for a discussion of North America."

As you read in our release for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales in North America were down 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Our direct business, excluding wholesale, was also down 7% as reported and 6% in constant curren",1415,"Thanks, Victor. As you read in our release for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales in North America were down 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Our direct business, excluding wholesale, was also down 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. 
In aggregate, and as targeted, we drove a significant inflection in our business this holiday, led by Retail. Comp trends also improved in our outlet stores, with record Black Friday weekend sales. Overall, our total store comp was down 3% year-over-year, with high ticket offset by low conversion and a decline in traffic, which was hurt in part by the overall weak mall trends. Our total comp was pressured an additional point by eOS, as we pulled back from 10 events in last year's second quarter to 7 in total. 
Now looking at results sequentially. As planned, an improvement in conversion drove the inflection in comp, as our initiatives across product, stores and marketing built momentum. Our in-store traffic trends also improved on a sequential basis despite a significant worsening in overall mall traffic. Against this backdrop of deteriorating traffic, specifically, in the outlet channel, competitive pressures intensified, and we responded with a higher level of promotion than expected. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver a positive North American comp by the fourth quarter, again, led by the improvement in our retail stores, with the most significant driver being conversion. 
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on products. The above $400 price bracket rose in penetration, saw another positive comp on the sales and unit basis, and represented about 35% of handbag sales; up from about 30% last year. The increases showed continued progress of our elevation strategy, with higher price points and more fashion forward products, such as Nomad and Swagger performing strongly. In addition, our gifting offer, covering a broader range of styles and price points, also registered well, driving balance in our assortment, with the below $300 price bracket posting a positive sales and unit comp in the quarter. Our essentials bags, such as the Turnlock Satchel, Prairie Satchel and Scout Hobo were important drivers, as was an extended offering of holiday giftables and accessories. 
As has been the case for quite a while, leather continued to outpace Logo across all channels. In the second quarter, Logo, across all categories, represented less than 5% of North American retail sales, and in outlet, it was under 30%, down year-over-year in both channels. 
Now in stores. As Victor mentioned, we've been very pleased with the performance of our modern luxury stores, particularly in the North American retail channel where comps remained positive, with now 66 stores renovated, including 14 added in the first half. In the outlet channel, to date, we've also seen improvement in trend, post renovation and relative outperformance versus the balance of outlet stores. As noted, we've not seen the same level of inflection in outlet given the newer store base, notably in men's stand-alones. To-date, we've completed 26 outlet renovations, including 12 in the first half, and opened a total of 5 outlet stores in the new format, 3 in FY '15 and 2 year-to-date. We remain on target to renovate about 60 North American stores this year. 
In terms of elevating our customer experience, our stores in Time Warner Center in New York, Rue Saint-Honore in Paris and Shanghai, Hong Kong Plaza, are the latest installations of our concept craftsmanship bars. We'll be refining and deploying the concept to select flagship stores globally, providing customization options and leather services, such as monogramming, which harkens back to our roots as a leather goods manufacturer. We're also in the process of training dedicated leather services specialists in each craftsmanship bar. This is a truly unique and differentiating feature of Coach stores, which is delighting customers across all markets. 
In addition to the Pinnacle craftsmanship bar experience, as we reinforce our positioning as America's original house of leather, we're also rolling out 3 core leather services: leather care, monogramming and repairs assessment, in all stores globally. The initial impact of these services has been very positive, driving conversion and repeat purchase. 
Also, in support of the customer experience, we continue to refine our modern luxury hosting ceremony and introduced a new store associate uniform globally in October. This is another step towards creating a more consistent modern luxury in-store experience, with our staff looking and feeling more stylish and elevated. 
Now turning to event marketing. As you know, over the last 18 months, we've changed our approach to customer events in the retail channel, resulting in a significant reduction in promotional activity on a year-over-year basis in FY '15. In terms of learnings, as noted on the last 2 calls, we found that our semiannual open sales, which are also known -- which are now known as the winter sale and the summer sale, have served as recruitment vehicles for new customers. As a result, this year, we are holding 2 shorter duration open sale events over key traffic periods with the intent of attracting new retail customers. The first of these occurred around Black Friday, including a VIP preview with a tiered offer, which we then opened up to the public. We're very pleased with the results, with the events both bringing in new customers and reactivating lapsed ones. Similarly, our winter sale, which started and ended earlier than last year, was also quite successful. At the same time, we've adjusted the cadence and further reduced our closed targeted customer events to 2 a year. The first of which was held as planned in September, with the next expected in March, which will include a single pass along invitation for a friend in our direct mail invitations. As a reminder, the timing of this year's event is consistent with last year. Importantly, we continued to evolve and optimize the timing and type of events. Our goal is to further reduce the number of days on promotion in our retail channel in FY '16. 
Now looking ahead to spring and summer. In retail, we just kicked off Coach's 75th anniversary by introducing the saddle bag, an archival glovetanned leather bag offered in multiple sizes and modernized with an array of colors and trims. Additional anniversary starts that were launched in the March quarter include the dinky bag, pouches and small leather goods, and an archival rucksack in men's. 
As Victor noted, Coach 1941 was launched in conjunction with spring fashion week in February, with a comprehensive product expression in our top 50 locations as well as key handbags in all stores. We'll add new styles with our best-selling Swagger family in fun fashion colors and unique novelty patchwork. Additionally, we are launching new styles in the Nomad Hobo group and a new silhouette, the Mercer satchel, in stores since last week. All of these new bags, speaking to our important category driver segment. We'll also continue to animate essentials with the launch of Turnlock Edie, priced at $395, with chain straps and Turnlock details differentiating it from best-selling key item, Edie. We'll add a fun layer of novelty prints, studs and grommets to play up essentials. The Chelsea cross-body, a key under $300 item, will also launch in Q3. 
Our men's business in the third quarter will be driven by continued momentum in backpacks, our first men's collection launch and distortion in marketing spend on the category. In-store merchandising will position men's more front and center and will animate the collection with media support and in-store events. 
In outlet, given the response we've historically seen to novelty, we're most excited about Peanuts, a key initiative for Q3. Peanuts just launched last week in stores and is off to an exceptionally strong start. As you may remember, Peanuts was introduced in retail last year and drove very strong interest in the brand. As always, we are focused on key high-traffic movements, including Martin Luther King weekend -- just passed, and President's Weekend, coming up in February. To this end, the Billy Backpack launched just in time for MLK weekend is off to a strong start. Next month, we will relaunch key styles such as Kelsey, Phoebe and Christie in on-trend seasonal colors, while our novelty assortment will feature hologram, white floral and stud detailing. In March, we'll introduce Carlyle, a cool and highly functional shoulder bag showcasing our iconic Turnlock. 
And now turning it back to Victor for International."

Most generally, and similar to North America, we are distorting our focus in developed markets towards maximizing productivity. We are taking a portfolio approach to our store base, investing in our best locations where we'll see the biggest return and culling where appropriate. In developing markets, we are continuing to open stores, taking advantage of real estate opportunities. And in all markets, we are increasing marketing and investing in the modern luxury store experience, using elements such as the craftsmanship bars we discussed, to underscore our heritage and history of authenticity. 
In Greater China, second quarter sales rose 5% in constant currency, in line with our annual target, with double-digit growth on the Mainland and with positive comps offsetting weak results in Hong Kong and Macau. Hong Kong and Macau continued to be impacted by the dramatic slowdown in inbound tourist traffic, notably from the Mainland. At this juncture, with very limited visibility to an evolving macroeconomic environment, we are only updating our previous guidance of $625 million to reflect the Renminbi devaluation since our last earnings call, resulting in an updated annual forecast of about $610 million in dollars. Importantly, despite short-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long term, as the drivers we have consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever. It's important to note that we still see the Chinese tourist as an increasingly large part of our business globally, and have experienced a strengthening in Chinese tourist spending, notably in Japan and Europe. We are staffing into this trend, increasing the number of Mandarin-speaking store associates in these geographies. 
To that end, and as expected, Japan sales were up 2% on a constant currency basis despite a decrease in square footage, benefiting from increased tourist flows from Mainland Chinese. On a dollar basis, sales declined 3%, reflecting the weaker yen. While Japan is a mature market where we are distorting investment to our high-profile Tokyo stores and flagships while optimizing our fleet, we are continually assessing and leveraging the opportunity with tourists. In addition, the response to our new modern luxury stores from Japanese consumers and tourists alike has been quite positive, seen most notably in conversion in these locations. 
In Europe, our brand is continuing to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. Specifically, in the second quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace on a total and comparable store sales basis; despite the negative impact resulting from the tragic attacks in Paris. Importantly, during the quarter, we opened our Paris flagship on Rue Saint-Honoré, a significant milestone in our brand development and evolution in Europe, raising awareness with domestic consumers as well as tourists. We will continue to look for other flagship opportunities with the focus on major European cities. 
Overall, we continue to believe that FY '16 will be another year of very strong growth, with sales growing to about $125 million. Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium men's and women's bag and accessories market. 
In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales were up modestly in local currency and declined in dollars. Here, too, we are focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives. 
Finally, I would like to point out that we have seen disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which while small, are important to growing brand awareness. In the second quarter, we again saw a strong growth in those distributor-operated locations focused on the domestic consumer, while travel retail has continued to be soft due to volatility of tourist flows globally, notably in Hong Kong and Macau. On a net sales basis, revenue grew significantly in the quarter, driven by shipment timing to ensure appropriate inventory positions for Chinese New Year. Generally, we are very pleased with the execution of our brand transformation, as we continue to position the Coach brand for long-term success, while effectively supporting the growth and development of the Stuart Weitzman brand and navigating the volatile global economic trends and currency fluctuations in the intermediate term. 
Now I will turn it over to Jane for details on our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2016."

Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second fiscal quarter results for the consolidated businesses of Coach, Inc. as well as",2166,"Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second fiscal quarter results for the consolidated businesses of Coach, Inc. as well as the Coach brand and Stuart Weitzman, ending with our outlook for FY '16. Please note the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results, corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today. 
Starting with Coach, Inc. On a consolidated basis, net sales totaled $1.27 billion for the second fiscal quarter compared with $1.22 billion reported in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 4%. On a constant currency basis, total sales increased 7% for the period. 
Gross profit totaled $859 million versus $841 million a year ago, while gross margin was 67.4% versus 69%. SG&A expenses of $574 million compared to $542 million in the prior year, an increase of 6%. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A totaled 45.1% on a non-GAAP basis compared to 44.4% in the year ago quarter. 
Operating income for the quarter totaled $285 million compared to $299 million in the prior year, while operating margin was 22.4% versus 24.5%. 
Net interest expense was $6 million in the quarter as compared to net interest income of approximately $400,000 in the year ago period. 
Net income for the quarter totaled $188 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.68. This included a contribution of $13 million or $0.05 per share from Stuart Weitzman. This compared to net income in the second quarter of FY '15 of $200 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.72. 
Turning now to performance by brand, and starting with the Coach brand. As a reminder, all comments I'm about to make are on a non-GAAP basis. 
Net sales for the Coach brand totaled $1.18 billion for the second fiscal quarter compared with $1.22 billion reported in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 3%. On a constant currency basis, total sales decreased 1% for the period. 
Gross profit totaled $799 million, while gross margin was 67.7%, down 130 basis points overall, including 110 basis points from currency. Our consolidated Coach brand gross margin continued to benefit from channel mix with our international segment outpacing. However, our gross margin in North America declined on a year-over-year basis. Margin was negatively impacted by increased promotion in our outlet and wholesale channel in response to heightened discounting activity in those channels, as Andre mentioned. Higher average unit costs also pressured our gross margin in North America, as we continued to invest in product innovation, providing our customers with an elevated product offering at compelling price points. 
International segment gross margins increased from prior year, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency. 
SG&A expenses totaled $536 million, a decrease of 1%. SG&A expenses in the second quarter were somewhat lower than our expectations and reflected lower occupancy costs as well as a shift in marketing timing. The stronger dollar also was a benefit to expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense totaled 45.4%. Operating income was $263 million, while operating margin was 22.3%, in line with expectations. 
Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. Stuart Weitzman brand net sales totaled $94 million for the second fiscal quarter, with strengths in boots and domestic retail driving a beat in our sales and margin projections for the quarter. Gross profit for the Stuart Weitzman brand totaled $61 million, resulting in a gross margin of 64.3%. SG&A expenses were $38 million or 40.8% of sales. Operating income was $22 million, representing an operating margin of 23.6%. 
During the second quarter of FY '16, the company recorded charges of $14 million under its multiyear transformation plan. These charges consisted primarily of organizational efficiency costs and accelerated depreciation for store renovations. In addition, the company recorded costs of approximately $10 million associated with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman, which primarily includes charges attributable to integration-related activities, contingent payments and the impact of limited life purchase accounting. These actions taken together increased the company's SG&A expenses by about $24 million, negatively impacting net income by $18 million after tax or about $0.07 per diluted share in the second quarter. Our total transformation-related charges over the last 7 quarters were about $305 million. We continue to expect to incur the balance of these charges by the end of FY '16, primarily related to global store closures and organizational effectiveness, bringing the total multiyear charge to about $325 million. 
Now moving to global distribution. As you know, our overarching focus continues to be replatforming our stores, elevating brand perceptions, optimizing our store fleet and opening new locations selectively in key markets. During the quarter, and consistent with our annual guidance, there was little change in our global directly operated door count. As we now include a table detailing our openings and closures by geography and brand in our press release, I'll just touch on the highlights. 
In total, we added 1 net-new Coach brand location globally in addition to 4 Stuart Weitzman locations in the quarter, 3 in the U.S. and 1 in Europe. 
Looking to the full year, as our overall plans have not changed materially, I'll be brief. 
In FY '16, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to be up low single digits globally. This guidance continues to assume that Coach brand square footage in North America will be essentially unchanged in FY '16. Internationally, distribution growth will be led by Europe and China, where we are continuing to project double-digit increases in square footage in FY '16. In Japan, we continued to estimate a mid-single-digit decline in square footage, as we take a portfolio approach to optimizing our fleet. And in our directly-operated businesses in Asia, outside of China and Japan, we continue to focus on developing our current store base and expect only modest square footage growth this fiscal year. 
Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we continue to expect to open approximately 10 new directly operated locations in FY '16. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter-end were $438 million, including $29 million of inventory associated with Stuart Weitzman. This compared to ending inventory of $447 million for the Coach brand in the year ago period. Therefore, inventory declined 2% on a Coach, Inc. consolidated basis and was down 9% for the Coach brand. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to $1.1 billion a year ago. Given our debt issuance in the third quarter of FY '15 and the subsequent closure of the Stuart Weitzman acquisition, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter. As previously shared, we expect to use these proceeds to cover our working capital needs in light of investments in our business and the new corporate headquarters. 
Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $302 million compared to $445 million last year in Q2. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $196 million versus $406 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $106 million versus $39 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Before turning to FY '16 guidance, I did want to provide you with an update on the status of our investment in our new headquarter building at Hudson Yards.
As you know, we've long stated our belief that our investment in Hudson Yards would be monetizeable over time. Given today's real estate market strength and high demand for Hudson Yards, we believe now is the right time to explore selling our interest in the Hudson Yards joint venture, while securing our future needs for space by entering into a long-term lease there. We have begun to pursue these options with our partner related companies. While it's too early to speculate, it is unlikely that any sale of our interest or other transaction would close until after our fiscal year ends and we move into our new space. 
As noted in our press release, we're maintaining our fiscal 2016 constant currency revenue growth and operating margin guidance for the Coach brand, while raising our consolidated operating income outlook based on second quarter results. 
So turning now to our financial outlook for the Coach brand on a standalone, 52-week, non-GAAP basis in FY '16. In sales, we still expect to deliver a low single-digit increase in constant currency in fiscal year 2016. Based on current exchange rates, currency headwinds are now expected to negatively impact our annual revenue growth by 225 to 250 basis points. We are still projecting a low single-digit aggregate comp decline in North America in FY '16. As previously noted, we expect comp to improve throughout the year, driven by product innovation, renovated modern luxury stores and our 75th anniversary marketing initiatives. We continue to expect to reach positive comps in the fourth quarter. Operating margin is still projected to be in the mid- to high teens, with some shift between the gross margin and expense ratio from previous guidance. To this end, gross margin for the Coach brand is projected to be in the range of last year's margin or about 69.5% on a constant currency basis, with negative foreign currency FX now expected to impact gross margin by 90 to 100 basis points. SG&A expenses, net of savings, are now expected to grow at a low single-digit rate in constant currency, while growth is expected to be roughly flat in dollars. The lower projected rate of growth is based on favorability realized in the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect at least $50 million in incremental cost savings from our transformation and restructuring initiatives. 
Interest expense for the year is estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. Finally, our tax rate is still expected to be in the area of 28% for the year. The expected rate reduction on a year-over-year basis is primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings, the ongoing benefit of available foreign tax credits, the anticipated closure of certain audits and the expiration of statutes in 2016, which is expected to significantly lower our tax rate in the third quarter. 
In addition, based on Stuart Weitzman's outperformance during the holiday quarter, as noted, we are now forecasting the brand sales to be in the area of $340 million on a dollar basis for fiscal 2016, an increase of about 10% from FY '15, driving Coach, Inc. consolidated revenue growth to high single digits on a constant currency basis and adding about $0.12 to earnings per diluted share, excluding charges associated with financing, short-term purchase accounting adjustments, contingent payments and integration costs. As a result of the higher sales and margin outlook for the Stuart Weitzman business versus our original expectations, taken together with our projections for the Coach brand, we are raising our operating income outlook for Coach, Inc. for fiscal 2016. This includes an estimated negative impact of about 70 basis points and 20 basis points on a consolidated gross margin and operating margin, respectively, from Stuart Weitzman, a lesser impact than previously anticipated. 
As a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include a 53rd week in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is expected to contribute approximately $75 million to $80 million in incremental revenue and $0.06 in earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. 
We still expect CapEx for FY '16 for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $300 million, excluding the capital costs associated with the new headquarters, which are expected to be approximately $185 million in FY '16. 
There has been no change in our capital allocation policy. And over the next few years, our first priority is to continue to invest in our business as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. 
Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders. 
And third, capital returns. As I've stated before, we are committed to our dividend and expect our dividend to grow at least in line with net income growth as our transformation takes hold. Underpinning all 3 of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively: maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets. 
In closing, we have a clear strategy and a well-articulated implementation plan for FY '16, and we're pleased with our progress to-date. Building on this momentum, we remain confident in our long-term targets. Importantly, we believe that we have the resources to fund our plan, while maintaining our dividend during our heavy investment period. 
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

In terms of the category, Bob, there is no doubt in our mind that the secular shift from apparel to accessories definitely continues, and that there isn't a better space to be in the fashion space than handbags and accessories. In the short term, however, there is some volatility, driven by macro issues and, of course, the extreme exchange rate volatility that we have seen, which is impacting tourists. At the same time, we strongly believe that the consumers are looking for innovation. They are looking for quality, value, and most of all, they are looking for authenticity, and we don't believe there is a brand better positioned to take advantage of that than us, given our authenticity of heritage in craftsmanship, that's very much our DNA, when blended with Stuart's creative vision and the terrific reviews that we continue to get towards our product, our stores and our marketing. We're incredibly excited by the results that we're driving, by the differentiated positioning that we're driving. And very much seeing those results continue; to your second question, as we enter the third quarter, very much seeing similar trends with guidance contemplating a return to  North America comps going positive in the fourth quarter per Jane's comments."

In terms of the areas of biggest impacts, Ike, I would say it's a combination of all. It's very difficult to really peel this apart. We're driving total brand impression. We, of course, see the most significant inflection in those stores that have been transformed, as you heard in our prepared notes. The North American full-price stores in aggregate is still very much comping positively, including those very first stores now that we have lapsed that we opened post Black Friday of 2014.

Overall, though, it continues to be the same strategy and focus, which is to continue to give the consumers more value. Not only through pricing, of course, and it's important to recognize that outlet is a promotional channel and consumers do go to that channel specifically for deals, but also to what we're doing with experience. Those of you who have had the opportunity to visit our modern luxury outlet stores, I think see and feel that, and that continues to be a major program for us as we also continue to put make into the product and give consumers value across all of our channels."

Internationally, you've heard during our prepared remarks today that we have just opened a new e-commerce site in Europe, having started with the U.K., our plans will be to roll that out across Europe over the next 12 months. While we also continue to gain traction in Asia, I'm happy to report that our teams in Asia have, in many ways, been leading the way in those markets for the entire category. In Japan, we've made great progress getting on to line. And in China, not only seen a way bow [ph] where we've -- one of the leading -- I believe is still the leading fashion brand in terms of number of followers, but also on WeChat, where we've also been leading the way.

We know that it's about the content and there we're incredibly pleased with the work that Stuart is doing with the reviews that we're getting from the editorial community and from the bloggers that, of course, influence the millennial consumers.

In the case of Stuart Weitzman, what we're seeing is really an affirmation of all the due diligence that we've done. It's a terrific brand with amazing fit, amazing quality, superb supply chain; truly a leader in this space in the U.S. And in a season where boots were not selling, given the unseasonably warm weather, they were the top performer across all channels, whether it be here in top-tiered department stores in the U.S., Europe and in China, where they're gaining increasing relevance, which is very exciting for us. And it's not only the products, they're doing an amazing job engaging with consumers. We talked about what Coach is doing, of course, online, but what the Stuart Weitzman team has been doing with their marketing is a great example for us at Coach and indeed for the entire industry as they engage with more youthful consumers online. In terms of longer-term, it's very much consistent with what we have shared. We will, of course, be leveraging the Coach team to support Stuart Weitzman in the development of their handbag and accessories business. We discussed already the talent that is already working on that project and by the end of this calendar year, beginning of next, we should begin to see some of that product hit the Stuart Weitzman stores. In addition, the Stuart Weitzman team will be supporting Coach with the footwear supply chain opportunities that exist when it comes to fit, and certainly, comfort, and potentially, longer-term in a more meaningful way as well. And we're supporting the Stuart Weitzman brand already in some significant ways with real estate and we've talked about Regent Street where we will be opening the first Stuart Weitzman flagship in the U.K. next to the Coach flagship there later this year."

Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance, which was consistent with our expectations and reflects the return of growth for Coach across the key financial metrics of sales, operating profit and EPS. We drove further sequential improvement in our North America direct business, with both channels strengthening similarly while the Internet also contributed to results this quarter. Our international businesses posted strong growth on a constant currency basis, highlighted by double-digit increases in Mainland China and Europe as well as sales gain in Japan and other Asian countries. We were especially gratified by our ability to drive this inflection for the brand against the backdrop of macroeconomic and promotional headwinds and amid volatile tourist flows globally. Overall, our results continue to give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will continue to drive top line growth this fiscal year and positive North American comps in the fourth fiscal quarter.
Importantly, during the third quarter, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Our elevated Coach 1941 assortment resonated in our retail stores globally as well as in key new specialty retail accounts, having debuted in Nordstrom, Saks, Opening Ceremony, Fred Segal and Jeffrey New York as well as Colette in Paris, Luisa Via Roma, in Japan, Galleria West in Seoul and Lang Crawford and Greater China. 
In outlet, our Snoopy fashion was particularly well received, and we will continue to surprise and delight the consumer in this channel with increased levels of innovation. We continue to transition the fleet into our modern luxury concept, driving comp improvement. 
Finally, our new heritage marketing campaign focused on originality and authenticity highlights Coach's key competitive differences, separating us from the landscape of both legacy European luxury and American accessible brands.
We are also pleased by Stuart Weitzman's results this quarter. As noted in our press release, we expect to close on the acquisition of the brands Canadian distributor in the fourth quarter. Longer-term, we continue to believe that Stuart Weitzman has significant potential and the integration to date reflects our ability to operate as a multibrand company. And as Jane will discuss in more detail, we also announced an operational efficiency plan today, focusing on creating a more agile, streamlined corporate structure, enabling us to be more responsive to rapidly changing business conditions. The plan includes the elimination of over 300 positions worldwide, representing about a 10% decrease in global corporate staff or about a 2% reduction in our total workforce. These actions will allow us to emerge as a global brand-led company, with fewer layers, largest of responsibility and a consistent global voice across merchandising and marketing. To this end, we are promoting 2 seasoned Coach executives: Andre Drake And Todd Andre is being promoted to President, North America and Global Marketing, having North America wholesale as well as global marketing, customer experience and digital to his responsibility. Todd is being promoted to President, Chief Administrative Officer and Secretary, and will expand his scope to include IT, supply chain, global environments and procurement. They are both proven leaders with experience across many aspects of Coach's global business and are well-prepared to address the opportunities ahead of us as we continue to transform. Most importantly, they have consistently delivered results for our brand and company in their respective 8-year tenures. In addition, has assumed the role of Global Head of merchandising for the Coach brand. In this new role, Diane will oversee merchandising for the entire Coach portfolio, including women's, men's and licensed categories.
With these changes, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David , President, Global Marketing, Digital and Customer Experience, will be leaving Coach. I want to take this opportunity to thank both and David for their important contributions to the company. notably for his work on the successful integration of Stuart Weitzman's over the last year, and most recently for his leadership in our restructuring and efficiency initiatives. And David, who has made significant contributions to Coach over his 18-year tenure and spanning North America merchandising, e-commerce and digital and global marketing. It was a key player in building Coach into a leading global lifestyle brand, establishing our digital footprint, and most recently, in our brand transformation. The entire Coach team has great admiration and respect for and David significant accomplishments, and we wish them the best.
Now as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across the 3 Coach brand pillars of product, stores and marketing.
Starting with product, where Coach is clearly emerging as the house of modern fashion design. 
During the third quarter, as in the first half of the year, essentially all of our retail channel assortment, both men's and women's, were Stuart Vevers designs. It was, however, the first quarter that included Coach 1941 and emphasized our elevation strategy. This was a pivot from holiday where we distorted the under $300 price point in our gifting assortment. The rogue, saddle in dinky, have all performed well with price points up to $800 and above. The Swagger family, which anniversary-ed its original launch in February 2015, comped the comp, with a numerous of satchel also contributed to results. Essentials, while deemphasize were highlighted by the introductions of Edie 31 and Prairie. In outlet, the offering of stores designs and updates represented over 90% of the assortment with key new styles in women's such as the Sierra satchel, the city code and a mini Bennett performing well, along with the reimagined and Kristi groups. On the men's side, a strong group of bags and backpacks drove our business. We also had an exceptional response to the Snoopy fashion vignette as mentioned, proving that this customer will respond to innovation and novelty.
After the success of our first complete runway show in September and the Coach 1941 launch, we followed up in February at New York Fashion Week, introducing our 1941 fall collection. Once again, it received a significant attention from the fashion press as well as top-tier specialty retailers and luxury department stores. 
On stores, we're continuing to establish our new modern luxury concept stores globally, renovating and opening 40 during the quarter, including 6 renovations and 2 new modern luxury stores in our directly operated North America business, taking us to about 290 across all channels worldwide. We remain on target to end the year at over 400 of our doors, including wholesale in the new format. Consistent with plans, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps which exceed the balance of fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. We are specially excited about the ongoing positive comps we are driving in our renovated North America retail stores, including those stores that have now anniversary-ed their remodels. In the North American department stores, we renovated 8 shop-in-shop locations to modern luxury in the third quarter. Finally, we have about 35 shop managers in place to date and have seen a significant impact versus the balance of doors and expected to hire another 15 by the end of the year.
On the marketing front, we remained focused on creating desire for our brand, amplifying our fashion position in our number 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality, building emotional connections with consumers globally. 
In February, we debuted our heritage campaign, featuring Coach icons and starting with the saddle bag followed by the Dinky bag in March. This global brand campaign is a key vehicle to communicate our authentic history as America's original house of leather, with tag lines such as, ""We got our heritage deals fashion way, we inherited it."" Setting us apart from the direct competitors who are often inspired by our archives. Also positioned to amplify our brand heritage, we are very pleased with the response to our Coach Vintage Initiative, a collection of highly coveted backs from the 1970s and '80s that we reclaimed masterfully restored and hand embellished by Coach artisans, modernizing them for today and making each a one-of-a-kind. The collection was a big hit during its debut launch at Colette in Paris in December and later saw success at Barneys New York. Our next installations will be available in premium locations in Beijing, Tokyo and Hong Kong, with a global online auction completing the initiative later this fall, further amplifying our story of heritage and fashion credibility to a cool audience.
Our fashion advertising campaigns supported the launch of Coach 1941, focused on the saddle bag and shot by photographers Steve and Maisel, to capture the attention of consumers worldwide to our bold positioning in social, out-of-home and prints. And resonating with our broad audience and primarily positioned through the digital channels, and continue to be the faces of our celebrity campaign. 
Once again, our runway shows were highly engaged and amplified through social media with our London men show in January, garnering over 150 million impressions and our February New York fashion week show, driving over 700 million impressions and ranked #3 of the top mentioned hashtags by WWD by the New York fashion weeks, increasing vibrancy of our brands. And our online instashop for runaway initiative, featuring the road bag sold out within an hour. On coach.com, we're further enhancing our emotional bonds to our visitors through our personalization initiatives, including the recent introduction of our customizable story patch. We've also involved our suite of monogramming initiatives and introduced a feature that allows for adding a charm to bags to making them even more personal. 
Looking forward to the balance of calendar 2016, we will continue to amplify our fashion positioning while celebrating our 75th anniversary, focusing on our distinctive brand proposition. No other American brand in our space can claim the unique combination of heritage and craftsmanship that is our DNA, fused with a modern fashion sensitivity of Stuart's vision. As a result of these efforts, we're seeing continued progress with consumers. Importantly, in our quarterly North America brand tracking survey fielded in March, we saw an in category drivers as a percentage of Coach consumers and strength in our overall brand affinities. So as our plans unfold and the momentum builds, we are delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from its specialty retailer and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design, defining modern luxury. We are excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction, and we'll continue to update you on vision -- on these initiatives as they move -- a quarterly survey also showed a higher handbag purchase among a broad premium purchasers versus 6 months ago. Importantly, Coach's sales of women's bags and accessories once again improved sequentially in North America. And of course, as a lifestyle and multibrand category -- company, we also participate in categories outside of women's bags and accessories. 
Men's, which represents about 17% of global net sales on an annual basis, posted strong results in the quarter. We continue to believe that it is a growth opportunity for the brand and is still forecasting mid-single-digit growth during FY '16. Over our planning horizon, we believe Men's remains a $1 billion opportunity. In North America, we have tested and intensified Men's focus in key stores, which entailed increased marketing support and enhanced assortment in the more prominent location in stores. With a strong response from consumers, we will be expanding our Men's presence in the fourth quarter, and specifically, we will be rolling out men's to over 25 more retail and 40 more outlet doors. And of course, we also remain focused on building Coach, Inc.'s market share within the fragmented Men's and Women's $27 billion global premium footwear category, which we estimate will grow at a mid-single-digit pace over our planning horizon. Looking ahead, we see significant growth opportunities for the Stuart Weitzman and Coach brand's in this category. 
While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market, starting with North America. As you read in our release for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales and direct business in North America were up both 1% as reported in 2% in constant currency. In aggregate, we drove another significant improvement in our direct businesses in the third quarter. Comp trends in both retail and outlet stores accelerated while the Internet contributed to aggregate comp as well. Overall, our comp was flat, led has expected by retail, including the slightly positive impact of our e-commerce business, which contributed less than 1 percentage point. Higher ticket and higher conversion were offset by a decline in traffic, which was hurt in part by the overall weak mall trends. As a reminder, we have now fully anniversary-ed the pullback in eOS and in preferred customer events, which impacted both our coach.com and retail businesses. Therefore, going forward, we would expect our online business to move at least in line with our store trends. 
Now looking at result sequentially. As planned, improvements in both conversion and traffic from the second quarter drove results with tickets still positive. While the Easter shift -- excuse me, while Easter contributed to our comp, this was offset by a shorter winter sale period, which ended about 10 days earlier than last year. Importantly, our performance underscores our confidence in delivering a positive North America comp by the fourth quarter.
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product. The above $400 price bracket rose in penetration saw another positive comp in sales in unit basis and reported about 40% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year. The increases showed continued progress of our elevation strategy, driving our handbag AUR to over $300 in the quarter for the first time since FY '09. As planned, we deemphasized the entry-price-point gifting assortment coming out of holiday, therefore, saw a decline in the $300 and below handbag priced segment. And after several years of decline in local penetration and gains and leather, our North America Logo business has stabilized at less than 5% in retail and about 25% in our outlet channel, similar to the prior year. We will continue to monitor consumer preferences and fine tune this balance as needed.
Now on stores. As mentioned, we've been very pleased with the performance of our modern luxury stores, particularly in the North America retail channel where comps remained positive with now 67 stores renovated, including 15 added in the last 9 months. As noted, we are especially excited about the ongoing positive comps we're driving in those stores that have now anniversary-ed their remodels. In the outlet channel, as noted previously, our results have been more mixed, and we have not seen the same level of inflection given the newer store base, notably, in Men's standalones. To date, we have completed 31 outlet renovations, including 17 in FY '16 and opened a total of 7 outlet stores in the new format, 3 in FY '15 and 4 year-to-date. We remain on target to renovate about 60 North American stores this year. In terms of elevating our customer experience, this quarter, we made significant progress and leveraging our leather services to differentiate the Coach experience and to drive conversion while opening 3 new craftsmanship bars globally. Young Dempo, Japan and King of Prussia in Philadelphia. 
Turning to event marketing. In FY '16, we've continued to evolve and optimize our events, with the goal of further reducing the number of days on promotion. And as previously mentioned, our plan included 2 closed or targeted events this fiscal year, the first of which was held in September; and the second of which occurred in March, consistent with prior year's timing. We'll also run 2 shorter duration open sales events over key traffic periods, Black Friday and Mother's Day. We've been encouraged by the behavior of new customers acquired during sales events will subsequently engage in full price purchasing at the same rate as new customers acquired during the non-promotional periods. 
Looking ahead to spring and summer. In retail, we're excited about introducing our first ever pre-fall collection rounded in handbags and ready-to-wear, with new animations and sizes of the best-selling Road and new novelty platform in the iconic Coach Dinky and saddlebags. We will continue to implement our elevation and fashion strategy in all doors with additions to the popular Swagger family in a rainbow of fun fashion colors and unique colorful exotics. 
Additionally, we have SKU adds in the satchel and market tote coming in May. Men's trends strength continues into the fourth quarter, driven by ongoing traction in leather goods, ready-to-wear and footwear, with enhanced store placement and marketing distortions. 
And in June, we will be celebrating our 75th anniversary with a special collaboration with another storied American brand to be announced later this spring.
In outlet, we are heading into Mother's Day, which will feature elevated floral novelty via leather details and print. Our gift offering is robust, including boxed sets, colored small bags and small leather goods and newness in jewelry. In May, we've launched a rainbow color story aligned with our retail stores featuring some of her strongest new styles that launched into third quarter, including the satchel. Just in time for Memorial Day, we will reintroduce our reversible tote, which was the bestseller during the holiday season. In June, we tell an Americana story, featuring updates best-selling brand in totes and small bags, which are important key drivers for the summer season. And we're also excited to roll out Men's to all outlet locations, anchored by backpacks, messenger bags and an assortment of wallets and belts. 
And now moving onto international. In Greater China, our third quarter sales rose 2% in constant currency, driven by double-digit growth and positive comps on the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macau -- on the Mainland, excuse me. Hong Kong and Macau remained weak and continues to be impacted by a dramatic slowdown in inbound tourist traffic, notably from the Mainland. At this juncture, with very limited visibility to an evolving macroeconomic environment and tourist spending flows, we are updating our annual forecast to be in the area of $600 million to reflect continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau. Importantly, and despite near-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long-term, as the drivers we have consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever. It's important to note that we see the Chinese consumers an increasing part of our total business. During the third quarter, our global business with the Chinese continue to grow. The clients and travel flows into North America and Europe, notably France, along with continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau, were more than offset by strong domestic spending and growth in Chinese tourists spend and other key travel destinations, including Japan, Korea and South East Asia. To that end, sales in Japan were up 7% on constant currency basis and 8% on a dollar basis, reflecting the strong yen, despite a decrease in square footage. Sales again benefited from increased PRC tourist flows and a positive response to our new modern luxury stores from Japanese consumers and tourists alike seen most notably in conversion in these locations. We would expect some slowdown in the constant currency growth of our Japan business in the fourth quarter as we anniversary the dramatic increase in Chinese tourists last spring. 
In Europe, our brand is continuing to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. Our overarching focus continues to be building the brand awareness with both local domestic consumers as well as tourists. In the third quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace, driven by both distribution and comparable store sales. As many brands have referenced, we did experience relative softness in France in the quarter due to weaker tourist traffic following the tragic terrorist attacks. Overall, and despite these headwinds, we are maintaining our FY '16 sales outlook of about $125 million. Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium Men's and Women's bag and accessory market. 
In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales growth was solid across the entire region in local currency but declined in dollars. Hereto, we are focused in driving productivity through our transformation initiatives. Finally, I would like to point out that we're seeing results in our international wholesale businesses which while small, are important to growing brand awareness. In the third quarter, our overall sales at POS increased moderately, driven by strong growth in those distributor-operated locations focused on the domestic consumer while travel retail grow up was relatively weaker due volatility of tourist spending flows globally. 
On a net sales basis, revenue grew modestly in the quarter, driven by shipment timing with the second quarter. In closing, we are encouraged with the momentum of our business across all of our regions and the return to growth for the company. Most importantly, we are proud of the progress we have among our transformation journey in the evolving perception of the Coach brand and Coach, Inc. as we move from a specialty retailer to a house of modern luxury brands. Now I will turn it over to Jane for details of our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2016. Jane?"
526573,331404891,962578,"Coach, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Victor, and good morning. Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategy. Let me now take you through some of the important financial detail. Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results, corresponding G",2005,"Thanks, Victor, and good morning. Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategy. Let me now take you through some of the important financial detail. Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results, corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliations can be found in earnings release posted on our website today. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter, which marks a return to growth for the company, with an inflection across the key metrics of sale, operating profit and earnings. These results clearly reflect the positive impact of our transformation strategy, augmented by the Stuart Weitzman business.
Consolidated net sales totaled $1.03 billion for the third fiscal quarter, an increase of 11% versus prior year. 
On a constant currency basis, total sales increased 13% for the period. 
Net sales for the Coach brand rose 3% in dollars and 4% on a constant currency basis, with both the North America and international segments up on a year-over-year basis.
Stuart Weitzman brand sales were $79 million in the quarter. Total gross profit was $713 million, an increase of 7% compared to the year-ago quarter period. While gross margins was 69% versus 71.6% last year, negatively impacted by foreign currency and the inclusion of Stuart Weitzman in this year's margin.
Coach brand gross margin was 69.9% and included approximately 110 basis points of pressure from currency. In terms of trends by segment, North America gross margin declined on a year-over-year basis but to a lesser extent than in the first half of the year as planned. Margin continued to be negatively impacted by increased promotions in the outlet and wholesale channels in response to heightened discounting activity. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of an improved mix of elevated product sales and higher initial markups, primarily in our outlet stores. International segment gross margin increased from prior year, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency. 
Stuart Weitzman brand gross margin was 58.2% in the quarter and pressured overall consolidated gross margin by 90 basis points as expected. Consolidated SG&A expenses were $561 million, an increase of 8% versus prior year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A totaled 54.3% compared to 55.8% in the year-ago quarter. Coach brand SG&A expenses increased 1%, consistent with expectations and totaled 54.8% as a percentage of sales. Stuart Weitzman SG&A expenses were $39 million or 48.9% of sales. Total operating income for the quarter increased 4% from last year to $152 million while operating margin was 14.7% versus 15.8%. Operating margins for the Coach brand was 15.1% in the quarter. Importantly, we are pleased with our margin results in Q3 and are confident in our path to operating margin expansion beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Operating margin for the Stuart Weitzman brand was 9.3% and pressured Coach, Inc.'s consolidated operating margin by 40 basis points in the quarter. Net interest expense was $7 million in the quarter as compared to $1 million in the year-ago period. Net income for the quarter totaled $124 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.44, up 24% and 23% versus prior year, respectively. This included a contribution of $5 million or $0.02 per share from Stuart Weitzman. The charges under our previously announced transformation plan have totaled $313 million to date, including $9 million in the third quarter as outlined in detail in this morning's press release. We continue to expect to incur the balance of these charges by the end of FY '16, primarily related to global store closures and organizational effectiveness, bringing the total multiyear charge to about $325 million.
Now moving to global distribution. As you know, our overarching focus continues to be re-platforming our stores, elevating Brand perception, optimizing our store fleet and opening new locations selectively in key markets. In total, we closed 9 net Coach brand locations globally, primarily related to store closures in North America as planned. In addition, we opened 1 Stuart Weitzman directly operated location in the quarter. 
Looking to the full year, in FY '16, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to be up low single digits globally. This guidance continues to assume that Coach brand square footage in North America will be essentially unchanged. Internationally, distribution of growth will be led by Europe and China, where we continue to project double-digit increases in square footage. 
In Japan, we continue to estimate a mid-single-digit decline in square footage as we take a portfolio approach to optimizing our fleet. And in our directly operated businesses in Asia, outside of China and Japan, we continue to focus on developing our current store base and expect only modest square footage growth this fiscal year. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution. We continue to expect to open approximately 10 new directly operated locations in FY '16.
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter end were $464 million, including $27 million of inventory associated with Stuart Weitzman. This compared to ending inventories of $457 million for the Coach brand in the year-ago period. Therefore, inventory rose 2% on a Coach, Inc. consolidated basis best but was down 4% for the Coach brand. Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to $2.0 billion 1 year ago. Given our debt issuance in the third quarter of FY '15 and the subsequent closure of the Stuart Weitzman acquisition, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter. As previously shared, we expect to use this proceeds to cover our working capital needs in light of investments in our business and the new corporate headquarters. 
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $199 million compared to $167 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $98 million versus $122 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $101 million versus $45 million versus in the same quarter a year ago.
Now turning to our outlook. As noted in our press release, we are maintaining our overall fiscal 2016 guidance for both the Coach and Stuart Weitzman brands. 
Starting with our outlook for the Coach brand on a standalone 52-week non-GAAP basis for FY '16. Coach brand sales are still expected to increase at a low single-digit rate in constant currency in fiscal year 2016. Based on current exchange rates, currency headwinds are expected to negatively impact annual revenue growth by 225 to 250 basis points. We are still projecting a low single-digit aggregate comp decline in North America in FY '16 while reaching positive comps in the fourth quarter. Gross margins for the Coach brand is still projected to be in the range of last year's margin of about 69.5% on a constant currency basis, with negative foreign currency FX expected to impact was margin by 90 to 100 basis points. SG&A expenses, net of savings, are still expected to grow at a low single-digit rate in constant currency. While growth is expected to be roughly flat in dollars. We continue to expect at least $50 million in incremental cost savings from our previously announced transformation initiative. This guidance also include the expected small positive impact from savings related to the operational efficiency as outlined in today's press release. 
Taken together, operating margin is still projected to be in the mid- to high-teens. Interest expense for the year is estimated to be in the area of $30 million. 
And finally, our tax rate is still expected to be in the area of 28% for the year. The expected weight reduction on a year-over-year basis is primarily attributable to the geographical mix of earnings, the ongoing benefit of available foreign tax credit, the anticipated closure of certain audits and the expiration of [indiscernible] in 2015.
In addition, we are continuing to forecast Stuart Weitzman brand sales to be in the area of $340 million on a dollar basis for fiscal 2016, an increase of about 10% from FY '15, driving Coach, Inc.'s consolidated revenue growth to high single digits on a constant currency basis, and adding about $0.12 to earnings per diluted share, excluding charges associated with financing, short-term purchase accounting adjustments, contingent payments and integration costs. Keep in mind that we continue to project a negative impact of about 70 basis points and 20 basis points on a consolidated gross margin and operating margin, respectively, from the inclusion of Stuart Weitzman, given the margin profile of the business. As mentioned, we are also excited to announce the purchase of Stuart Weitzman's Canadian distributor, which is expected to close in Q4 and have an immaterial impact on this year's results. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include a 53rd week in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is expected to contribute approximately $75 million to $80 million incremental revenue and $0.06 in earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. We expect CapEx for FY '16 for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $250 million excluding the capital cost associated with the new headquarters, which are expected to be approximately $175 million in FY '16.
Before concluding, I did want to provide you with an update on the status of our investment in our new headquarters building at Hudson Yards. As you know, together with our partner-related company, we are exploring options to sell our interest in the Hudson Yards joint venture while securing our future needs for space by entering into a long-term lease there. It remains unlikely that any sale of our interest or other transactions would close prior to our fiscal year-end. Importantly, our capital allocation policy remains unchanged. And over the next few years, our first priority is to continue to invest in our business as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. Our second priority, strategic acquisitions is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders. 
And third, capital returns. As I've stated before, we are committed to our dividend and expect our dividends to grow at least in line with net income growth as our transformation takes hold. Underpinning all 3 of these priorities, are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital market.
In closing, we are very pleased with our progress to date. Our third quarter results marked the return to top line operating profit and earnings growth, and underscore our ability to drive sustainable growth for the Coach brand and the Coach, Inc. To this end, we continue to expect FY '17 to be the year when Coach brand returns to growth across all financial metrics, leveraging top line growth that is expected to be in line with the category. We remain committed to driving process improvements to be a more agile, focused and effective organization while also creating the flexibility to pursue our creative vision and drive growth across our brands.
In support of this goal and as Viktor mentioned, today, we announced a series of operational efficiency initiatives focused on creating an agile and scalable business model. In aggregate, we expect to incur pretax charges associated with these actions of approximately $65 million to $80 million, which will be reflected beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, and will be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2017. The significant majority of these charges will be recorded in SG&A expenses. Importantly, combined with other key measures previously implemented under our transformation plan, these initiatives are expected to enable us to reach our previously stated goal of about a 20% operating margin for the Coach brand in fiscal year 2017, despite increased category and macroeconomic uncertainty and while continuing to invest in our growth strategy. With that, I'd like to open it up to Q&A."

So I would not be surprised if it hits growing up slightly faster pace than the store network from here on out, now that we have comps all of the people back. In terms of the Chinese consumer and the excitement. Look, first and foremost, the long-term opportunity with the Chinese consumer is as present as ever. I could not be more excited about what we're seeing in terms of even government policy still focused on domestic consumption. The infrastructure continues to develop in the Mainland, which is obviously, helping domestic consumption as well as the continued traction that our team is driving for the brand there. And it's absolutely vital, of course, because relevance on the Mainland will mean relevance whenever the Chinese consumer chooses to shop as they travel globally. Today, what we are seeing most recently, as I mentioned, earlier is, of course, the impact of the terrorist attacks in France and specifically in Paris, having a direct negative impact on Chinese tourist flows there. We're seeing slightly negative flows here into the U.S. as well, of course, as continued negative flows into Hong Kong and Macau. That is one area where we thought in the fourth quarter, we would have seen ourselves comping the fall from last year, and we have  not. And in fact, that's more than being offset by the very strong growth that we continue to see in Japan, Korea, and increasingly, in Southeast Asia. Although many of those markets are distributor-ran, we're very excited about what we've seen in Thailand and in Australia as well."

So we're pleased with the performance, both in retail and in outlets. We've always said the retail was going to lead, so the retail performance in absolute terms is slightly ahead of outlet. Basically, a couple of main areas we've been working on in outlet specifically: One is design and innovation. We realized through the vignette that Victor mentioned in his prepared remarks on Snoopy that when you got real innovation and price, it was successful and it was something that we're planning to replicate over the next few quarters, both in terms of these one-offs so we call them concept and more generally, in terms of more design and innovation in the outlet channel. In terms of the modern innovations, they've not been as successful as in retail. We've not moved the needle that much. That said, we've got a number of learnings that we are currently addressing. They've used our web or a commons store as a pilot where we've done things such as moving product, more products we the floor. We realize that there's too much product on the wall nothing open the floor, it impacts conversion. We fragmented the stores too much so you don't get a sort of 360 view when you enter the store, et cetera. So loads of small operation improvements. The positive news is that it would be what we started these tweaks about 2 or 3 months ago. We have seen an improvement in the controllable metrics, conversion and ADT. So good learnings, and we're going to keep implementing them throughout the chain."

We're investing in the shop manager program for the top 50 locations by the end of this fiscal year. And in both of those cases, we are seeing an inflection versus the rest of the fleet. In addition, of course, we have made very significant progress in our penetration with the Tier 1 department stores with 1941 while also pulling back on those Coach-specific promotional days. Irrespective of all of that, the absolute number of chain-wide sales days continues to be an issue in that channel. And we continue, as a team, talk discussions with our partners about a couple of areas: One, first and foremost, the potential for the pullback on our promotion, which would include our exclusion and cooperation with our partners from the bulk of storewide events; and quite frankly, we're also looking at potentially exiting lower volume stores going forward.

We drove further sequential improvement in our North America direct business, with both channels strengthening similarly, while the Internet also contributed to results this quarter. Our international businesses posted strong growth on a constant currency basis, highlighted by double-digit increases in Mainland China and Europe as well as sales gains in Japan and other Asian countries.
We were especially gratified by our ability to drive this inflection for the brand against the backdrop of macroeconomic and promotional headwinds and amid volatile tourist flows globally. Overall, our results continue to give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will continue to drive top line growth this fiscal year and positive North American comps in the fourth fiscal quarter.

Our elevated Coach 1941 assortment resonated in our retail stores globally as well as in key new specialty retail accounts having debuted in Nordstrom, Saks, Opening Ceremony, Fred Segal and Jeffrey New York as well as Colette in Paris, Luisa Via Roma, Umeda Hankyu in Japan, Galleria West in Seoul and Lane Crawford in Greater China.
In outlet, our Snoopy fashion vignette was particularly well received, and we will continue to surprise and delight the consumer in this channel with increased levels of innovation. We continue to transition the fleet into our modern luxury concept, driving comp improvement.
Finally, our new heritage marketing campaign focused on originality and authenticity highlights Coach's key competitive differences, separating us from the landscape of both legacy European luxury and American accessible brands.
We are also pleased by Stuart Weitzman's results this quarter. As noted in our press release, we expect to close on the acquisition of the brand's Canadian distributor in the fourth quarter. Longer term, we continue to believe that Stuart Weitzman has significant potential, and the integration to date reflects our ability to operate as a multibrand company.
And as Jane will discuss in more detail, we also announced an operational efficiency plan today, focusing on creating a more agile, streamlined corporate structure, enabling us to be more responsive to rapidly changing business conditions. The plan includes the elimination of over 300 positions worldwide, representing about a 10% decrease in global corporate staff or about a 2% reduction in our total workforce. These actions will allow us to emerge as a global brand-led company with fewer layers, larger spans of responsibility and a consistent global voice across merchandising and marketing.
To this end, we are promoting 2 seasoned Coach executives: Andre Cohen and Todd Kahn. Andre is being promoted to President, North America and Global Marketing, adding North America wholesale as well as global marketing, customer experience and digital to his responsibilities. Todd is being promoted to President, Chief Administrative Officer and Secretary and will expand his scope to include IT, supply chain, global environments and procurement.
They are both proven leaders with experience across many aspects of Coach's global business and are well-prepared to address the opportunities ahead of us as we continue to transform. Most importantly, they have consistently delivered results for our brand and company in their respective 8-year tenures. In addition, Diane Mahady has assumed the role of Global Head of Merchandising for the Coach brand. In this new role, Diane will oversee merchandising for the entire Coach portfolio, including women's, men's and licensed categories.
With these changes, Gebhard Rainer, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Duplantis , President, Global Marketing, Digital and Customer Experience, will be leaving Coach. I want to take this opportunity to thank both Gebhard and David for their important contributions to the company, Gebhard notably for his work on the successful integration of Stuart Weitzman over the last year and most recently, for his leadership in our restructuring and efficiency initiatives; and David, who had made significant contributions to Coach over his 18-year tenure in roles spanning North America merchandising, e-commerce and digital and global marketing. He was a key player in building Coach into a leading global lifestyle brand, establishing our digital footprint and most recently, in our brand transformation. The entire Coach team has great admiration and respect for Gebhard and David's significant accomplishments and we wish them the best.
Now as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across the 3 Coach brand pillars of product, stores and marketing, starting with product, where Coach is clearly emerging as the house of modern fashion design.
During the third quarter, as in the first half of the year, essentially all of our retail channel assortment, both men's and women's, were Stuart Vevers designs. It was, however, the first quarter that included Coach 1941 and emphasized our elevation strategy. This was a pivot from holiday where we distorted the under-$300 price point in our gifting assortment. The Rogue, Saddle and Dinky have all performed well with price points up to $800 and above.
The Swagger family, which anniversary-ed its original launch in February 2015, comped the comp, with the new Mercer Satchel also contributing to results. Essentials, while deemphasized, were highlighted by the introductions of the Turnlock Edie, Edie 31 and Prairie.
In outlet, the offering of Stuart's designs and updates represented over 90% of the assortment with key new styles in women's such as the Sierra Satchel, the City Zip Tote and the MINI Bennett performing well, along with the reimagined Phoebe and Christie groups. On the men's side, a strong group of bags and backpacks drove our business. We also had an exceptional response to the Snoopy fashion vignette as mentioned, proving that this customer will respond to innovation and novelty.
After the success of our first complete runway show in September and the Coach 1941 launch, we followed up in February at New York Fashion Week, introducing our 1941 fall collection. Once again, it received significant attention from the fashion press as well as top-tier specialty retailers and luxury department stores.
On stores, we're continuing to establish our new modern luxury concept stores globally, renovating and opening 40 during the quarter, including 6 renovations and 2 new modern luxury stores in our directly operated North America business, taking us to about 290 across all channels worldwide. We remain on target to end the year at over 400 of our doors, including wholesale in the new format. Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps which exceed the balance of fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world.
We're especially excited about the ongoing positive comps we are driving in our renovated North America retail stores, including those stores that have now anniversary-ed their remodels. In North American department stores, we renovated 8 shop-in-shop locations to modern luxury in the third quarter. Finally, we have about 35 shop managers in place to date and have seen a significant impact versus the balance of doors and expect to hire another 15 by the end of the year.
On the marketing front, we remained focused on creating desire for our brand, amplifying our fashion positioning in our 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality, building emotional connections with consumers globally.
In February, we debuted our heritage campaign, featuring Coach icons and starting with the Saddle bag followed by the Dinky bag in March. This global brand campaign is a key vehicle to communicate our authentic history as America's original house of leather, with tag lines such as, ""We got our heritage the old fashion way. We inherited it,"" setting us apart from the direct competitors who are often inspired by our archives.
Also positioned to amplify our brand heritage, we are very pleased with the response to our Coach vintage initiative, a collection of highly coveted bags from the 1970s and '80s that we reclaimed, masterfully restored and hand embellished by Coach artisans, modernizing them for today and making each a one-of-a-kind. The collection was a big hit during its debut launch at Colette in Paris in December and later saw success at Barneys New York. Our next installations will be available in premium locations in Beijing, Tokyo and Hong Kong, with a global online auction completing the initiative later this fall, further amplifying our story of heritage and fashion credibility to a cool audience.
Our fashion advertising campaign supported the launch of Coach 1941, focused on the Saddle bag and shot by photographer Steven Meisel. He has captured the attention of consumers worldwide to our bold positioning in social, out-of-home and prints. And resonating with our broad audience and primarily positioned through the digital channels, Chloë Grace Moretz and Kid Cudi continued to be the faces of our celebrity campaign.
Once again, our runway shows were highly engaged and amplified through social media with our London men's show in January, garnering over 150 million impressions, and our February New York Fashion Week show, driving over 700 million impressions and ranked #3 of the top-mentioned hashtags by WWD during New York Fashion Week, reflecting the increasing vibrancy of our brand. And our online Instashop for Runway [ph] initiative featuring the Rogue bag sold out within an hour.
On coach.com, we're further enhancing our emotional bonds with our visitors through a series of personalization initiatives, including the recent introduction of our customizable story patch. We've also involved our suite of monogramming initiatives and introduced a feature that allows for adding a charm to bags to making them even more personal.
Looking forward to the balance of calendar 2016, we will continue to amplify our fashion positioning while celebrating our 75th anniversary, focusing on our distinctive brand proposition. No other American brand in our space can claim the unique combination of heritage and craftsmanship that is our DNA, fused with the modern fashion sensibility of Stuart's vision.
As a result of these efforts, we're seeing continued progress with consumers. Importantly, in our quarterly North America brand tracking survey fielded in March, we saw an increase in category drivers as a percentage of Coach consumers and strength in our overall brand affinities.
So as our plans unfold and the momentum builds, we are delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty retailer and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design, defining modern luxury.
We are excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction, and we'll continue to update you on vision -- on these initiatives as we move forward.
Turning now to a discussion of category trends. Overall, we estimate that the North America premium women's handbag and accessories market grew at a low single-digit rate in the March quarter. Our quarterly survey also showed a higher handbag purchase intent among the broad premium purchasers versus 6 months ago. Importantly, Coach's sales of women's bags and accessories once again improved sequentially in North America. And of course, as a lifestyle and multibrand category -- company, we also participate in categories outside of women's bags and accessories.
Men's, which represents about 17% of global net sales on an annual basis, posted strong results in the quarter. We continue to believe it is a growth opportunity for the brand and is still forecasting mid-single-digit growth during FY '16. Over our planning horizon, we believe men's remains a $1 billion opportunity. In North America, we have tested and intensified men's focus in key stores, which entailed increased marketing support and enhanced assortment in the more prominent location in store. With the strong response from consumers, we will be expanding our men's presence in the fourth quarter and specifically, we'll be rolling out men's to over 25 more retail and 40 more outlet doors.
And of course, we also remain focused on building Coach, Inc.'s market share within the fragmented men's and women's $27 billion global premium footwear category, which we estimate will grow at a mid-single-digit pace over our planning horizon. Looking ahead, we see significant growth opportunities for the Stuart Weitzman and Coach brands in this category.
While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market, starting with North America. As you read in our release for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales and direct business in North America were up both 1% as reported in 2% in constant currency. In aggregate, we drove another significant improvement in our direct businesses in the third quarter. Comp trends in both retail and outlet stores accelerated, while the Internet contributed to aggregate comp as well. Overall, our comp was flat, led, as expected, by retail, including the slightly positive impact of our e-commerce business, which contributed less than 1 percentage point.
Higher ticket and higher conversion were offset by a decline in traffic, which was hurt in part by the overall weak mall trends. As a reminder, we have now fully anniversary-ed the pullback in eOS and in preferred customer events, which impacted both our coach.com and retail businesses. Therefore, going forward, we would expect our online business to move at least in line with our store trends.
Now looking at results sequentially. As planned, improvements in both conversion and traffic from the second quarter drove results with tickets still positive. While the Easter shift -- excuse me, while Easter contributed to our comp, this was offset by a shorter winter sale period, which ended about 10 days earlier than last year. Importantly, our performance underscores our confidence in delivering a positive North America comp by the fourth quarter.
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product. The above-$400 price bracket rose in penetration, saw another positive comp on a sales and unit basis and reported about 40% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year. The increases showed continued progress of our elevation strategy, driving our handbag AUR to over $300 in the quarter for the first time since FY '09.
As planned, we deemphasized the entry price point gifting assortment coming out of holiday and therefore, saw a decline in the $300 and below handbag price segment. And after several years of decline in logo penetration and gains in leather, our North America Logo business has stabilized at less than 5% in retail and about 25% in our outlet channel, similar to the prior year. We will continue to monitor consumer preferences and fine-tune this balance as needed.
Now on stores. As mentioned, we've been very pleased with the performance of our modern luxury stores, particularly in the North America retail channel where comps remained positive with now 67 stores renovated, including 15 added in the last 9 months. As noted, we are especially excited about the ongoing positive comps we're driving in those stores that have now anniversary-ed their remodels.
In the outlet channel, as noted previously, our results have been more mixed, and we have not seen the same level of inflection given the newer store base, notably in men's standalones. To date, we have completed 31 outlet renovations, including 17 in FY '16 and opened a total of 7 outlet stores in the new format, 3 in FY '15 and 4 year-to-date. We remain on target to renovate about 60 North American stores this year.
In terms of elevating our customer experience, this quarter, we made significant progress in leveraging our leather services to differentiate the Coach experience and to drive conversion while opening 3 new Craftsmanship Bars globally, at the Shinsegae Yeongdeungpo; Sendai, Japan; and King of Prussia in Philadelphia.
Turning to event marketing. In FY '16, we've continued to evolve and optimize our events with the goal of further reducing the number of days on promotion. And as previously mentioned, our plan included 2 closed or targeted events this fiscal year, the first of which was held in September and the second of which occurred in March, consistent with prior year's timing. We will also run 2 shorter duration open sales events over key traffic periods, Black Friday and Mother's Day. We've been encouraged by the behavior of new customers acquired during sales events who subsequently engage in full price purchasing at the same rate as new customers acquired during the nonpromotional periods.
Looking ahead to spring and summer. In retail, we're excited about introducing our first ever pre-fall collection rounded in handbags and ready-to-wear, with new animations and sizes of the best-selling Rogue and new novelty platforms in the iconic Coach Dinky and Saddle bags. We will continue to implement our elevation and fashion strategy in all doors with additions to the popular Swagger family in a rainbow of fun fashion colors and unique colorful exotics. Additionally, we have SKU adds in the Mercer Satchel and Market Tote coming in May.
Men's trends strength continues into the fourth quarter, driven by ongoing traction in leather goods, ready-to-wear and footwear, with enhanced store placement and marketing distortions.
And in June, we will be celebrating our 75th anniversary with a special collaboration with another storied American brand to be announced later this spring.
In outlet, we are heading into Mother's Day, which will feature elevated floral novelty via leather appliqué details and print. Our gift offering is robust, including boxed sets, color breadth in small bags and small leather goods and newness in jewelry. In May, we've launched a rainbow color story aligned with our retail stores, featuring some of her strongest new styles that launched in the third quarter, including the Ciara Satchel. [ph]
Just in time for Memorial Day, we will reintroduce our reversible tote, which was a bestseller during the holiday season. In June, we tell an Americana story, featuring an update to our best-selling Babylons [ph] print in totes and small bags, which are important key drivers for the summer season. And we're also excited to roll out men's to all outlet locations, anchored by leather backpacks, messenger bags and an assortment of wallets and belts.
And now moving on to international. In Greater China, our third quarter sales rose 2% in constant currency, driven by double-digit growth and positive comps on the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macau -- on the Mainland, excuse me. Hong Kong and Macau remained weak and continues to be impacted by a dramatic slowdown in inbound tourist traffic, notably from the Mainland.
At this juncture, with very limited visibility to an evolving macroeconomic environment and tourist spending flows, we are updating our annual forecast to be in the area of $600 million to reflect continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau. Importantly, and despite near-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long term as the drivers we have consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever.
It's important to note that we see the Chinese consumers an increasing part of our total business. During the third quarter, our global business with the Chinese continued to grow. The clients and travel flows into North America and Europe, notably France, along with continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau, were more than offset by strong domestic spending and growth in Chinese tourist spend in other key travel destinations, including Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia.
To that end, sales in Japan were up 7% on constant currency basis and 8% on a dollar basis, reflecting the strong yen, despite a decrease in square footage. Sales again benefited from increased PRC tourist flows and the positive response to our new modern luxury stores from Japanese consumers and tourists alike seen most notably in conversion in these locations. We would expect some slowdown in the constant currency growth of our Japan business in the fourth quarter as we anniversary the dramatic increase in Chinese tourists last spring.
In Europe, our brand is continuing to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. Our overarching focus continues to be building the brand awareness with both local domestic consumers as well as tourists.
In the third quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace, driven by both distribution and comparable store sales. As many brands have referenced, we did experience relative softness in France in the quarter due to weaker tourist traffic following the tragic terrorist attacks. Overall and despite these headwinds, we are maintaining our FY '16 sales outlook of about $125 million. Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium men's and women's bag and accessory market.
In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales growth was solid across the entire region in local currency but declined in dollars. Hereto, we are focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives.
Finally, I would like to point out that we're seeing disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which, while small, are important to growing brand awareness. In the third quarter, our overall sales at POS increased moderately, driven by strong growth in those distributor-operated locations focused on the domestic consumer, while travel retail, though up, was relatively weaker due volatility of tourist spending flows globally. On a net sales basis, revenue grew modestly in the quarter, driven by shipment timing with the second quarter.
In closing, we are encouraged with the momentum of our business across all of our regions and the return to growth for the company. Most importantly, we are proud of the progress we have made along our transformation journey in the evolving perception of the Coach brand and Coach, Inc. as we move from a specialty retailer to a house of modern luxury brands.
Now I will turn it over to Jane for details of our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2016. Jane?"

Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial detail.Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Correspondin",2006,"Thanks, Victor, and good morning. Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial detail.
Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in earnings release posted on our website today.
Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter, which marks a return to growth for the company with an inflection across the key metrics of sale, operating profit and earnings. These results clearly reflect the positive impact of our transformation strategy, augmented by the Stuart Weitzman business.
Consolidated net sales totaled $1.03 billion for the third fiscal quarter, an increase of 11% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis, total sales increased 13% for the period. Net sales for the Coach brand rose 3% in dollars and 4% on a constant currency basis with both the North America and international segments up on a year-over-year basis.
Stuart Weitzman brand sales were $79 million in the quarter. Total gross profit was $713 million, an increase of 7% compared to the year ago period, while gross margins were 69% versus 71.6% last year, negatively impacted by foreign currency and the inclusion of Stuart Weitzman in this year's margin.
Coach brand gross margin was 69.9% and included approximately 110 basis points of pressure from currency. In terms of trends by segment, North America gross margin declined on a year-over-year basis but to a lesser extent than in the first half of the year as planned. Margin continued to be negatively impacted by increased promotions in the outlet and wholesale channels in response to heightened discounting activity. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of an improved mix of elevated product sales and higher initial markups, primarily in our outlet stores. International segment gross margin increased from prior year, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency. Stuart Weitzman brand gross margin was 58.2% in the quarter and pressured overall consolidated gross margin by 90 basis points as expected.
Consolidated SG&A expenses were $561 million, an increase of 8% versus prior year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A totaled 54.3% compared to 55.8% in the year ago quarter. Coach brand SG&A expenses increased 1%, consistent with expectations and totaled 54.8% as a percentage of sales. Stuart Weitzman SG&A expenses were $39 million or 48.9% of sales. Total operating income for the quarter increased 4% from last year to $152 million while operating margin was 14.7% versus 15.8%.
Operating margin for the Coach brand was 15.1% in the quarter. Importantly, we were pleased with our margin results in Q3 and are confident in our path to operating margin expansion, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Operating margin for the Stuart Weitzman brand was 9.3% and pressured Coach, Inc.'s consolidated operating margin by 40 basis points in the quarter.
Net interest expense was $7 million in the quarter as compared to $1 million in the year ago period. Net income for the quarter totaled $124 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.44, up 24% and 23% versus prior year, respectively. This included a contribution of $5 million or $0.02 per share from Stuart Weitzman.
The charges under our previously announced transformation plan have totaled $313 million to date, including $9 million in the third quarter as outlined in detail in this morning's press release. We continue to expect to incur the balance of these charges by the end of FY '16, primarily related to global store closures and organizational effectiveness, bringing the total multiyear charge to about $325 million.
Now moving to global distribution. As you know, our overarching focus continues to be replatforming our stores, elevating brand perception, optimizing our store fleet and opening new locations selectively in key markets. In total, we closed 9 net Coach brand locations globally, primarily related to store closures in North America as planned. In addition, we opened one Stuart Weitzman directly operated location in the quarter.
Looking to the full year, in FY '16, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to be up low single digits globally. This guidance continues to assume that Coach brand square footage in North America will be essentially unchanged. Internationally, distribution of growth will be led by Europe and China, where we continue to project double-digit increases in square footage.
In Japan, we continue to estimate a mid-single-digit decline in square footage as we take a portfolio approach to optimizing our fleet. And in our directly operated businesses in Asia, outside of China and Japan, we continue to focus on developing our current store base and expect only modest square footage growth this fiscal year. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we continue to expect to open approximately 10 new directly operated locations in FY '16.
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter end were $464 million, including $27 million of inventory associated with Stuart Weitzman. This compared to ending inventory of $457 million for the Coach brand in the year ago period. Therefore, inventory rose 2% on a Coach, Inc. consolidated basis, but was down 4% for the Coach brand.
Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to $2.0 billion a year ago. Given our debt issuance in the third quarter of FY '15 and the subsequent closure of the Stuart Weitzman acquisition, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter. As previously shared, we expect to use this proceeds to cover our working capital needs in light of investments in our business and the new corporate headquarters.
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $199 million compared to $167 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $98 million versus $122 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $101 million versus $45 million versus in the same quarter a year ago.
Now turning to our outlook. As noted in our press release, we're maintaining our overall fiscal 2016 guidance for both the Coach and Stuart Weitzman brands. Starting with our outlook for the Coach brand on a standalone 52-week non-GAAP basis for FY '16. Coach brand sales are still expected to increase at a low single-digit rate in constant currency in fiscal year 2016. Based on current exchange rates, currency headwinds are expected to negatively impact annual revenue growth by 225 to 250 basis points. We are still projecting a low single-digit aggregate comp decline in North America in FY '16 while reaching positive comps in the fourth quarter.
Gross margin for the Coach brand is still projected to be in the range of last year's margin of about 69.5% on a constant currency basis, with negative foreign currency effects expected to impact gross margin by 90 to 100 basis points. SG&A expenses, net of savings, are still expected to grow at a low single-digit rate in constant currency while growth is expected to be roughly flat in dollars.
We continue to expect at least $50 million in incremental cost savings from our previously announced transformation initiatives. This guidance also includes the expected small positive impact from savings related to the operational efficiency initiative as outlined in today's press release. Taken together, operating margin is still projected to be in the mid- to high-teens. Interest expense for the year is estimated to be in the area of $30 million.
And finally, our tax rate is still expected to be in the area of 28% for the year. The expected weight reduction on a year-over-year basis is primarily attributable to the geographical mix of earnings, the ongoing benefit of available foreign tax credits, the anticipated closure of certain audits and the expiration of statutes in 2016.
In addition, we are continuing to forecast Stuart Weitzman brand sales to be in the area of $340 million on a dollar basis for fiscal 2016, an increase of about 10% from FY '15, driving Coach, Inc.'s consolidated revenue growth to high single digits on a constant currency basis and adding about $0.12 to earnings per diluted share, excluding charges associated with financing, short-term purchase accounting adjustments, contingent payments and integration costs. Keep in mind, we continue to project a negative impact of about 70 basis points and 20 basis points on a consolidated gross margin and operating margin, respectively, from the inclusion of Stuart Weitzman given the margin profile of the business.
As mentioned, we are also excited to announce the purchase of Stuart Weitzman's Canadian distributor, which is expected to close in Q4 and have an immaterial impact on this year's results. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include a 53rd week in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is expected to contribute approximately $75 million to $80 million incremental revenue and $0.06 in earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. We expect CapEx for FY '16 for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $250 million, excluding the capital cost associated with the new headquarters, which are expected to be approximately $175 million in FY '16.
Before concluding, I did want to provide you with an update on the status of our investment in our new headquarters building at Hudson Yards. As you know, together with our partner-related companies, we are exploring options to sell our interest in the Hudson Yards joint venture while securing our future need for space by entering into a long-term lease there. It remains unlikely that any sale of our interest or other transactions would close prior to our fiscal year-end. 
Importantly, our capital allocation policy remains unchanged. And over the next few years, our first priority is to continue to invest in our business as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. Our second priority, strategic acquisitions is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders.
And third, capital returns. As I've stated before, we are committed to our dividend and expect our dividend to grow at least in line with net income growth as our transformation takes hold. Underpinning all 3 of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets.
In closing, we are very pleased with our progress to date. Our third quarter results mark the return to top line operating profit and earnings growth and underscore our ability to drive sustainable growth for the Coach brand and the Coach, Inc. To this end, we continue to expect FY '17 to be the year when Coach brand returns to growth across all financial metrics, leveraging top line growth that is expected to be in line with the category. We remain committed to driving process improvements to be a more agile, focused and effective organization while also creating the flexibility to pursue our creative vision and drive growth across our brands.
In support of this goal and as Viktor mentioned, today, we announced a series of operational efficiency initiatives focused on creating an agile and scalable business model. In aggregate, we expect to incur pretax charges associated with these actions of approximately $65 million to $80 million, which will be reflected beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and will be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2017. The significant majority of these charges will be recorded in SG&A expenses.
Importantly, combined with other key measures previously implemented under our transformation plan, these initiatives are expected to enable us to reach our previously stated goal of about a 20% operating margin for the Coach brand in fiscal year 2017 despite increased category and macroeconomic uncertainty and while continuing to invest in our growth strategies.
With that, I'd like to open it up to Q&A."

So I would not be surprised if it is growing at a slightly faster pace than the store network from here on out, now that we have comped all of the pullback. In terms of the Chinese consumer and the excitement. Look, first and foremost, the long-term opportunity with the Chinese consumer is as present as ever. I could not be more excited about what we're seeing in terms of -- even government policy is still focused on domestic consumption. The infrastructure continues to develop in the Mainland, which is obviously helping domestic consumption as well, as well as the continued traction that our team is driving for the brand there. And it's absolutely vital, of course, because relevance on the Mainland will mean relevance wherever the Chinese consumer chooses to shop as they travel globally. Today, what we are seeing most recently, as I mentioned earlier, is, of course, the impact of the terrorist attacks in France and specifically in Paris, having a direct negative impact on Chinese tourist flows there. We're seeing slightly negative flows here into the U.S. as well, of course, as continued negative flows into Hong Kong and Macau. That is one area where we thought, in the fourth quarter, we would have seen ourselves comping the fall from last year and we have  not. And -- but that's more than being offset by the very strong growth that we've continued to see in Japan, Korea, and increasingly, in Southeast Asia. And although many of those markets are distributor-run, we're very excited by what we're seeing in Thailand and in Australia as well."

So we're pleased with the performance, both in retail and in outlets. We'd always said that retail was going to lead, so the retail performance in absolute terms is slightly ahead of outlet. Basically, a couple of main areas we've been working on in outlet specifically: One is design and innovation. We've realized, through the vignette, I think, Victor mentioned in his prepared remarks on Snoopy, that when you got real innovation and emotion, it trumps price. It was successful and it's something that we're trying to replicate over the next few quarters, both in terms of these one-offs so that we call them play concept and more generally, in terms of putting more design and innovation in the outlet channel. In terms of the modern -- actually, innovations, they've not been as successful as in retail. We've not moved the needle that much. That said, we've got a number of learnings that we're currently addressing. We've used our Woodbury Common store as a pilot where we've done things such as moving product, more products to the floor. We realize that when there's too much product on the wall and not enough on the floor, it affects the piece [ph] conversion. We've fragmented the stores a bit too much so you don't get a sort of 360 view when you enter the store, et cetera. So loads of small operation improvements. The positive news is that, in Woodbury, where we started these tweaks about 2 to 3 months ago, we have seen an improvement in the controllable metrics, conversion and ADT. So good learnings, and we're going to keep implementing them throughout the chain."

And I would say that we're in the very early innings there of our transformation. As many of you know, we've invested now, and I just mentioned in my prepared remarks, in 12 locations in the new concept. That's out of 1,000 that we have across North America. We're investing in the shop manager program for the top 50 locations by the end of this fiscal year. And in both of those cases, we are seeing an inflection versus the rest of the fleet. In addition, of course, we have made very significant progress in our penetration with the Tier 1 department stores with 1941 while also pulling back on those Coach-specific promotional days. Irrespective of all of that, the absolute number of chain-wide sale days continues to be an issue in that channel. And we continue, as a team, to have discussions with our partners about a couple of areas: One, first and foremost, the potential for the pullback on our promotion, which would include our exclusion and cooperation with our partners from the bulk of storewide events. And quite frankly, we're also looking at potentially exiting lower-volume doors going forward. So these are considerations that we're taking right now."

Our international businesses posted strong growth on a constant currency basis, highlighted by double-digit increases in Mainland China and Europe as well as sales gains in Japan and other Asian countries.
We were especially gratified by our ability to drive this inflection for the brand against the backdrop of macroeconomic and promotional headwinds and amid volatile tourist flows globally. Overall, our results continue to give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will continue to drive top line growth this fiscal year and positive North American comps in the fourth fiscal quarter.
Importantly, during the third quarter, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Our elevated Coach 1941 assortment resonated in our retail stores globally as well as in key new specialty retail accounts having debuted in Nordstrom, Saks, Opening Ceremony, Fred Segal and Jeffrey New York as well as Colette in Paris, Luisa Via Roma, Umeda Hankyu in Japan, Galleria West in Seoul and Lane Crawford in Greater China.
In outlet, our Snoopy fashion vignette was particularly well received, and we will continue to surprise and delight the consumer in this channel with increased levels of innovation. We continue to transition the fleet into our modern luxury concept, driving comp improvement.
Finally, our new heritage marketing campaign, focused on originality and authenticity, highlights Coach's key competitive differences, separating us from the landscape of both legacy European luxury and American accessible brands.
We are also pleased by Stuart Weitzman's results this quarter. As noted in our press release, we expect to close on the acquisition of the brand's Canadian distributor in the fourth quarter. Longer term, we continue to believe that Stuart Weitzman has significant potential, and the integration to date reflects our ability to operate as a multibrand company.
And as Jane will discuss in more detail, we also announced an operational efficiency plan today, focusing on creating a more agile, streamlined corporate structure, enabling us to be more responsive to rapidly changing business conditions. The plan includes the elimination of over 300 positions worldwide, representing about a 10% decrease in global corporate staff or about a 2% reduction in our total workforce. These actions will allow us to emerge as a global brand-led company with fewer layers, larger spans of responsibility and a consistent global voice across merchandising and marketing.
To this end, we are promoting 2 seasoned Coach executives: Andre Cohen and Todd Kahn. Andre is being promoted to President, North America and Global Marketing, adding North America wholesale as well as global marketing, customer experience and digital to his responsibilities. Todd is being promoted to President, Chief Administrative Officer and Secretary and will expand his scope to include IT, supply chain, global environments and procurement.
They are both proven leaders with experience across many aspects of Coach's global business and are well-prepared to address the opportunities ahead of us as we continue to transform. Most importantly, they have consistently delivered results for our brand and company in their respective 8-year tenures. In addition, Diane Mahady has assumed the role of Global Head of Merchandising for the Coach brand. In this new role, Diane will oversee merchandising for the entire Coach portfolio, including women's, men's and licensed categories.
With these changes, Gebhard Rainer, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Duplantis, President, Global Marketing, Digital and Customer Experience, will be leaving Coach. I want to take this opportunity to thank both Gebhard and David for their important contributions to the company; Gebhard, notably for his work on the successful integration of Stuart Weitzman over the last year and most recently, for his leadership in our restructuring and efficiency initiatives; and David, who had made significant contributions to Coach over his 18-year tenure in roles spanning North America merchandising, e-commerce and digital and global marketing. He was a key player in building Coach into a leading global lifestyle brand, establishing our digital footprint and most recently, in our brand transformation. The entire Coach team has great admiration and respect for Gebhard's and David's significant accomplishments and we wish them the best.
Now as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across the 3 Coach brand pillars of product, stores and marketing, starting with product, where Coach is clearly emerging as the house of modern fashion design.
During the third quarter, as in the first half of the year, essentially all of our retail channel assortment, both men's and women's, were Stuart Vevers designs. It was, however, the first quarter that included Coach 1941 and emphasized our elevation strategy. This was a pivot from holiday where we distorted the under-$300 price point in our gifting assortment. The Rogue, Saddle and Dinky have all performed well with price points up to $800 and above.
The Swagger family, which anniversary-ed its original launch in February 2015, comped the comp, with the new Mercer Satchel also contributing to results. Essentials, while deemphasized, were highlighted by the introductions of the Turnlock Edie, Edie 31 and Prairie.
In outlet, the offering of Stuart's designs and updates represented over 90% of the assortment with key new styles in women's such as the Sierra Satchel, the City Zip Tote and the MINI Bennett performing well, along with the reimagined Phoebe and Christie groups. On the men's side, a strong group of bags and backpacks drove our business. We also had an exceptional response to the Snoopy fashion vignette as mentioned, proving that this customer will respond to innovation and novelty.
After the success of our first complete runway show in September and the Coach 1941 launch, we followed up in February at New York Fashion Week, introducing our 1941 fall collection. Once again, it received significant attention from the fashion press as well as top-tier specialty retailers and luxury department stores.
On stores, we're continuing to establish our new modern luxury concept stores globally, renovating and opening 40 during the quarter, including 6 renovations and 2 new modern luxury stores in our directly operated North America business, taking us to about 290 across all channels worldwide. We remain on target to end the year at over 400 of our doors, including wholesale in the new format. Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps which exceed the balance of fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world.
We're especially excited about the ongoing positive comps we are driving in our renovated North America retail stores, including those stores that have now anniversary-ed their remodels. In North American department stores, we renovated 8 shop-in-shop locations to modern luxury in the third quarter. Finally, we have about 35 shop managers in place today and have seen a significant impact versus the balance of doors and expect to hire another 15 by the end of the year.
On the marketing front, we remained focused on creating desire for our brand, amplifying our fashion positioning in our 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality, building emotional connections with consumers globally.
In February, we debuted our heritage campaign, featuring Coach icons and starting with the Saddle bag followed by the Dinky bag in March. This global brand campaign is a key vehicle to communicate our authentic history as America's original house of leather, with tag lines such as, ""We got our heritage the old fashion way. We inherited it,"" setting us apart from the direct competitors who are often inspired by our archives.
Also positioned to amplify our brand heritage, we are very pleased with the response to our Coach vintage initiative, a collection of highly coveted bags from the 1970s and '80s that we reclaimed, masterfully restored and hand embellished by Coach artisans, modernizing them for today and making each a one-of-a-kind. The collection was a big hit during its debut launch at Colette in Paris in December and later saw success at Barneys New York. Our next installations will be available in premium locations in Beijing, Tokyo and Hong Kong, with a global online auction completing the initiative later this fall, further amplifying our storied heritage and fashion credibility to a cool audience.
Our fashion advertising campaign supported the launch of Coach 1941, focused on the Saddle bag and shot by photographer Steven Meisel. He has captured the attention of consumers worldwide to our bold positioning in social, out-of-home and prints. And resonating with our broad audience and primarily positioned through the digital channels, Chloë Grace Moretz and Kid Cudi continued to be the faces of our celebrity campaign.
Once again, our runway shows were highly engaged and amplified through social media with our London men's show in January, garnering over 150 million impressions, and our February New York Fashion Week show, driving over 700 million impressions and ranked #3 of the top-mentioned hashtags by WWD during New York Fashion Week, reflecting the increasing vibrancy of our brand. And our online Insta Shop the runway initiative featuring the Rogue bag sold out within an hour.
On coach.com, we're further enhancing our emotional bonds with our visitors through a series of personalization initiatives, including the recent introduction of our customizable story patch. We've also evolved our suite of monogramming initiatives and introduced a feature that allows for adding a charm to bags to making them even more personal.
Looking forward to the balance of calendar 2016, we will continue to amplify our fashion positioning while celebrating our 75th anniversary, focusing on our distinctive brand proposition. No other American brand in our space can claim the unique combination of heritage and craftsmanship that is our DNA, fused with the modern fashion sensibility of Stuart's vision.
As a result of these efforts, we're seeing continued progress with consumers. Importantly, in our quarterly North America brand tracking survey fielded in March, we saw an increase in category drivers as a percentage of Coach consumers and strength in our overall brand affinities.
So as our plans unfold and the momentum builds, we are delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty retailer and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design, defining modern luxury.
We are excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction, and we'll continue to update you on vision -- on these initiatives as we move forward.
Turning now to a discussion of category trends. Overall, we estimate that the North America premium women's handbag and accessories market grew at a low single-digit rate in the March quarter. Our quarterly survey also showed a higher handbag purchase intent among the broad premium purchasers versus 6 months ago. Importantly, Coach's sales of women's bags and accessories once again improved sequentially in North America. And of course, as a lifestyle and multibrand category -- company, we also participate in categories outside of women's bags and accessories.
Men's, which represents about 17% of global net sales on an annual basis, posted strong results in the quarter. We continue to believe it is a growth opportunity for the brand and are still forecasting mid-single-digit growth during FY '16. Over our planning horizon, we believe men's remains a $1 billion opportunity. In North America, we have tested and intensified men's focus in key stores, which entailed increased marketing support and enhanced assortment and a more prominent location in store. With the strong response from consumers, we will be expanding our men's presence in the fourth quarter and specifically, we'll be rolling out men's to over 25 more retail and 40 more outlet doors.
And of course, we also remain focused on building Coach, Inc.'s market share within the fragmented men's and women's $27 billion global premium footwear category, which we estimate will grow at a mid-single-digit pace over our planning horizon. Looking ahead, we see significant growth opportunities for the Stuart Weitzman and Coach brands in this category.
While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market, starting with North America. As you read in our release for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales and direct business in North America were up both 1% as reported in 2% in constant currency. In aggregate, we drove another significant improvement in our direct businesses in the third quarter. Comp trends in both retail and outlet stores accelerated, while the Internet contributed to aggregate comp as well. Overall, our comp was flat, led, as expected, by retail, including the slightly positive impact of our e-commerce business, which contributed less than 1 percentage point.
Higher ticket and higher conversion were offset by a decline in traffic, which was hurt in part by the overall weak mall trends. As a reminder, we have now fully anniversary-ed the pullback in eOS and in preferred customer events, which impacted both our coach.com and retail businesses. Therefore, going forward, we would expect our online business to move at least in line with our store trends.
Now looking at results sequentially. As planned, improvements in both conversion and traffic from the second quarter drove results with tickets still positive. While the Easter shift -- excuse me, while Easter contributed to our comp, this was offset by a shorter winter sale period, which ended about 10 days earlier than last year. Importantly, our performance underscores our confidence in delivering a positive North America comp by the fourth quarter.
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product. The above-$400 price bracket rose in penetration, saw another positive comp on a sales and unit basis and reported about 40% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year. The increases showed continued progress of our elevation strategy, driving our handbag AUR to over $300 in the quarter for the first time since FY '09.
As planned, we deemphasized the entry price point gifting assortment coming out of holiday and therefore, saw a decline in the $300 and below handbag price segment. And after several years of decline in logo penetration and gains in leather, our North America Logo business has stabilized at less than 5% in retail and about 25% in our outlet channel, similar to the prior year. We will continue to monitor consumer preferences and fine-tune this balance as needed.
Now on stores. As mentioned, we've been very pleased with the performance of our modern luxury stores, particularly in the North America retail channel where comps remained positive with now 67 stores renovated, including 15 added in the last 9 months. As noted, we are especially excited about the ongoing positive comps we're driving in those stores that have now anniversary-ed their remodels.
In the outlet channel, as noted previously, our results have been more mixed, and we have not seen the same level of inflection given the newer store base, notably in men's standalones. To date, we have completed 31 outlet renovations, including 17 in FY '16 and opened a total of 7 outlet stores in the new format, 3 in FY '15 and 4 year-to-date. We remain on target to renovate about 60 North American stores this year.
In terms of elevating our customer experience, this quarter, we made significant progress in leveraging our leather services to differentiate the Coach experience and to drive conversion while opening 3 new Craftsmanship Bars globally, at the Shinsegae Yeongdeungpo; Sendai, Japan; and King of Prussia in Philadelphia.
Turning to event marketing. In FY '16, we've continued to evolve and optimize our events with the goal of further reducing the number of days on promotion. And as previously mentioned, our plan included 2 closed or targeted events this fiscal year, the first of which was held in September and the second of which occurred in March, consistent with prior year's timing. We will also run 2 shorter duration open sales events over key traffic periods, Black Friday and Mother's Day. We've been encouraged by the behavior of new customers acquired during sales events who subsequently engage in full price purchasing at the same rate as new customers acquired during the nonpromotional periods.
Looking ahead to spring and summer. In retail, we're excited about introducing our first ever pre-fall collection rounded in handbags and ready-to-wear, with new animations and sizes of the best-selling Rogue and new novelty platforms in the iconic Coach Dinky and Saddle bags. We will continue to implement our elevation and fashion strategy in all doors with additions to the popular Swagger family in a rainbow of fun fashion colors and unique colorful exotics. Additionally, we have SKU adds in the Mercer Satchel and Market Tote coming in May.
Men's trends strength continues into the fourth quarter, driven by ongoing traction in leather goods, ready-to-wear and footwear, with enhanced store placement and marketing distortions.
And in June, we will be celebrating our 75th anniversary with a special collaboration with another storied American brand to be announced later this spring.
In outlet, we are heading into Mother's Day, which will feature elevated floral novelty via leather appliqué details and print. Our gift offering is robust, including boxed sets, color breadth in small bags and small leather goods and newness in jewelry. In May, we've launched a rainbow color story aligned with our retail stores, featuring some of her strongest new styles that launched in the third quarter, including the Sierra Satchel.
Just in time for Memorial Day, we will reintroduce our reversible tote, which was a bestseller during the holiday season. In June, we tell an Americana story, featuring an update to our best-selling Badlands print in totes and small bags, which are important key drivers for the summer season. And we're also excited to roll out men's to all outlet locations, anchored by leather backpacks, messenger bags and an assortment of wallets and belts.
And now moving on to international. In Greater China, our third quarter sales rose 2% in constant currency, driven by double-digit growth and positive comps on the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macau -- on the Mainland, excuse me. Hong Kong and Macau remained weak and continues to be impacted by a dramatic slowdown in inbound tourist traffic, notably from the Mainland.
At this juncture, with very limited visibility to an evolving macroeconomic environment and tourist spending flows, we are updating our annual forecast to be in the area of $600 million to reflect continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau. Importantly, and despite near-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long term as the drivers we have consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever.
It's important to note that we see the Chinese consumers an increasing part of our total business. During the third quarter, our global business with the Chinese continued to grow. Declines in travel flows into North America and Europe, notably France, along with continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau, were more than offset by strong domestic spending and growth in Chinese tourist spend in other key travel destinations, including Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia.
To that end, sales in Japan were up 7% on constant currency basis and 8% on a dollar basis, reflecting the strong yen, despite a decrease in square footage. Sales again benefited from increased PRC tourist flows and the positive response to our new modern luxury stores from Japanese consumers and tourists alike seen most notably in conversion in these locations. We would expect some slowdown in the constant currency growth of our Japan business in the fourth quarter as we anniversary the dramatic increase in Chinese tourists last spring.
In Europe, our brand is continuing to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. Our overarching focus continues to be building the brand awareness with both local domestic consumers as well as tourists.
In the third quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace, driven by both distribution and comparable store sales. As many brands have referenced, we did experience relative softness in France in the quarter due to weaker tourist traffic following the tragic terrorist attacks. Overall and despite these headwinds, we are maintaining our FY '16 sales outlook of about $125 million. Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium men's and women's bag and accessory market.
In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales growth was solid across the entire region in local currency but declined in dollars. Hereto, we are focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives.
Finally, I would like to point out that we're seeing disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which, while small, are important to growing brand awareness. In the third quarter, our overall sales at POS increased moderately, driven by strong growth in those distributor-operated locations focused on the domestic consumer, while travel retail, though up, was relatively weaker due volatility of tourist spending flows globally. On a net sales basis, revenue grew modestly in the quarter, driven by shipment timing with the second quarter.
In closing, we are encouraged with the momentum of our business across all of our regions and the return to growth for the company. Most importantly, we are proud of the progress we have made along our transformation journey in the evolving perception of the Coach brand and Coach, Inc. as we move from a specialty retailer to a house of modern luxury brands.
Now I will turn it over to Jane for details of our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2016. Jane?"

Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial detail.Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Correspondin",2006,"Thanks, Victor, and good morning. Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial detail.
Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in earnings release posted on our website today.
Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter, which marks a return to growth for the company with an inflection across the key metrics of sale, operating profit and earnings. These results clearly reflect the positive impact of our transformation strategy, augmented by the Stuart Weitzman business.
Consolidated net sales totaled $1.03 billion for the third fiscal quarter, an increase of 11% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis, total sales increased 13% for the period. Net sales for the Coach brand rose 3% in dollars and 4% on a constant currency basis with both the North America and international segments up on a year-over-year basis.
Stuart Weitzman brand sales were $79 million in the quarter. Total gross profit was $713 million, an increase of 7% compared to the year ago period, while gross margins were 69% versus 71.6% last year, negatively impacted by foreign currency and the inclusion of Stuart Weitzman in this year's margin.
Coach brand gross margin was 69.9% and included approximately 110 basis points of pressure from currency. In terms of trends by segment, North America gross margin declined on a year-over-year basis but to a lesser extent than in the first half of the year as planned. Margin continued to be negatively impacted by increased promotions in the outlet and wholesale channels in response to heightened discounting activity. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of an improved mix of elevated product sales and higher initial markups, primarily in our outlet stores. International segment gross margin increased from prior year, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency. Stuart Weitzman brand gross margin was 58.2% in the quarter and pressured overall consolidated gross margin by 90 basis points as expected.
Consolidated SG&A expenses were $561 million, an increase of 8% versus prior year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A totaled 54.3% compared to 55.8% in the year ago quarter. Coach brand SG&A expenses increased 1%, consistent with expectations and totaled 54.8% as a percentage of sales. Stuart Weitzman SG&A expenses were $39 million or 48.9% of sales. Total operating income for the quarter increased 4% from last year to $152 million while operating margin was 14.7% versus 15.8%.
Operating margin for the Coach brand was 15.1% in the quarter. Importantly, we were pleased with our margin results in Q3 and are confident in our path to operating margin expansion, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Operating margin for the Stuart Weitzman brand was 9.3% and pressured Coach, Inc.'s consolidated operating margin by 40 basis points in the quarter.
Net interest expense was $7 million in the quarter as compared to $1 million in the year ago period. Net income for the quarter totaled $124 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.44, up 24% and 23% versus prior year, respectively. This included a contribution of $5 million or $0.02 per share from Stuart Weitzman.
The charges under our previously announced transformation plan have totaled $313 million to date, including $9 million in the third quarter as outlined in detail in this morning's press release. We continue to expect to incur the balance of these charges by the end of FY '16, primarily related to global store closures and organizational effectiveness, bringing the total multiyear charge to about $325 million.
Now moving to global distribution. As you know, our overarching focus continues to be replatforming our stores, elevating brand perception, optimizing our store fleet and opening new locations selectively in key markets. In total, we closed 9 net Coach brand locations globally, primarily related to store closures in North America as planned. In addition, we opened one Stuart Weitzman directly operated location in the quarter.
Looking to the full year, in FY '16, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to be up low single digits globally. This guidance continues to assume that Coach brand square footage in North America will be essentially unchanged. Internationally, distribution of growth will be led by Europe and China, where we continue to project double-digit increases in square footage.
In Japan, we continue to estimate a mid-single-digit decline in square footage as we take a portfolio approach to optimizing our fleet. And in our directly operated businesses in Asia, outside of China and Japan, we continue to focus on developing our current store base and expect only modest square footage growth this fiscal year. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we continue to expect to open approximately 10 new directly operated locations in FY '16.
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter end were $464 million, including $27 million of inventory associated with Stuart Weitzman. This compared to ending inventory of $457 million for the Coach brand in the year ago period. Therefore, inventory rose 2% on a Coach, Inc. consolidated basis, but was down 4% for the Coach brand.
Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to $2.0 billion a year ago. Given our debt issuance in the third quarter of FY '15 and the subsequent closure of the Stuart Weitzman acquisition, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter. As previously shared, we expect to use these proceeds to cover our working capital needs in light of investments in our business and the new corporate headquarters.
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $199 million compared to $167 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $98 million versus $122 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $101 million versus $45 million versus in the same quarter a year ago.
Now turning to our outlook. As noted in our press release, we're maintaining our overall fiscal 2016 guidance for both the Coach and Stuart Weitzman brands. Starting with our outlook for the Coach brand on a standalone 52-week non-GAAP basis for FY '16. Coach brand sales are still expected to increase at a low single-digit rate in constant currency in fiscal year 2016. Based on current exchange rates, currency headwinds are expected to negatively impact annual revenue growth by 225 to 250 basis points. We are still projecting a low single-digit aggregate comp decline in North America in FY '16 while reaching positive comps in the fourth quarter.
Gross margin for the Coach brand is still projected to be in the range of last year's margin of about 69.5% on a constant currency basis, with negative foreign currency effects expected to impact gross margin by 90 to 100 basis points. SG&A expenses, net of savings, are still expected to grow at a low single-digit rate in constant currency while growth is expected to be roughly flat in dollars.
We continue to expect at least $50 million in incremental cost savings from our previously announced transformation initiatives. This guidance also includes the expected small positive impact from savings related to the operational efficiency initiative as outlined in today's press release. Taken together, operating margin is still projected to be in the mid- to high-teens. Interest expense for the year is estimated to be in the area of $30 million.
And finally, our tax rate is still expected to be in the area of 28% for the year. The expected weight reduction on a year-over-year basis is primarily attributable to the geographical mix of earnings, the ongoing benefit of available foreign tax credits, the anticipated closure of certain audits and the expiration of statutes in 2016.
In addition, we are continuing to forecast Stuart Weitzman brand sales to be in the area of $340 million on a dollar basis for fiscal 2016, an increase of about 10% from FY '15, driving Coach, Inc.'s consolidated revenue growth to high single digits on a constant currency basis and adding about $0.12 to earnings per diluted share, excluding charges associated with financing, short-term purchase accounting adjustments, contingent payments and integration costs. Keep in mind, we continue to project a negative impact of about 70 basis points and 20 basis points on a consolidated gross margin and operating margin, respectively, from the inclusion of Stuart Weitzman given the margin profile of the business.
As mentioned, we are also excited to announce the purchase of Stuart Weitzman's Canadian distributor, which is expected to close in Q4 and have an immaterial impact on this year's results. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include a 53rd week in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is expected to contribute approximately $75 million to $80 million incremental revenue and $0.06 in earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. We expect CapEx for FY '16 for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $250 million, excluding the capital cost associated with the new headquarters, which are expected to be approximately $175 million in FY '16.
Before concluding, I did want to provide you with an update on the status of our investment in our new headquarters building at Hudson Yards. As you know, together with our partner-related companies, we are exploring options to sell our interest in the Hudson Yards joint venture while securing our future need for space by entering into a long-term lease there. It remains unlikely that any sale of our interest or other transactions would close prior to our fiscal year-end. 
Importantly, our capital allocation policy remains unchanged. And over the next few years, our first priority is to continue to invest in our business as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders.
And third, capital returns. As I've stated before, we are committed to our dividend and expect our dividend to grow at least in line with net income growth as our transformation takes hold. Underpinning all 3 of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets.
In closing, we are very pleased with our progress to date. Our third quarter results mark the return to top line operating profit and earnings growth and underscore our ability to drive sustainable growth for the Coach brand and the Coach, Inc. To this end, we continue to expect FY '17 to be the year when Coach brand returns to growth across all financial metrics, leveraging top line growth that is expected to be in line with the category. We remain committed to driving process improvements to be a more agile, focused and effective organization while also creating the flexibility to pursue our creative vision and drive growth across our brands.
In support of this goal and as Viktor mentioned, today, we announced a series of operational efficiency initiatives focused on creating an agile and scalable business model. In aggregate, we expect to incur pretax charges associated with these actions of approximately $65 million to $80 million, which will be reflected beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and will be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2017. The significant majority of these charges will be recorded in SG&A expenses.
Importantly, combined with other key measures previously implemented under our transformation plan, these initiatives are expected to enable us to reach our previously stated goal of about a 20% operating margin for the Coach brand in fiscal year 2017 despite increased category and macroeconomic uncertainty and while continuing to invest in our growth strategies.
With that, I'd like to open it up to Q&A."

So I would not be surprised if it is growing at a slightly faster pace than the store network from here on out, now that we have comped all of the pullback. In terms of the Chinese consumer and the excitement. Look, first and foremost, the long-term opportunity with the Chinese consumer is as present as ever. I could not be more excited about what we're seeing in terms of -- even government policy still focused on domestic consumption. The infrastructure continues to develop in the Mainland, which is obviously helping domestic consumption as well, as well as the continued traction that our team is driving for the brand there. And it's absolutely vital, of course, because relevance on the Mainland will mean relevance wherever the Chinese consumer chooses to shop as they travel globally. Today, what we are seeing most recently, as I mentioned earlier, is, of course, the impact of the terrorist attacks in France and specifically in Paris, having a direct negative impact on Chinese tourist flows there. We're seeing slightly negative flows here into the U.S. as well, of course, as continued negative flows into Hong Kong and Macau. That is one area where we thought, in the fourth quarter, we would have seen ourselves comping the fall from last year and we have not. And -- but that's more than being offset by the very strong growth that we've continued to see in Japan, Korea, and increasingly, in Southeast Asia. And although many of those markets are distributor-run, we're very excited by what we're seeing in Thailand and in Australia as well."

So we're pleased with the performance, both in retail and in outlets. We'd always said that retail was going to lead, so the retail performance in absolute terms is slightly ahead of outlet. Basically, a couple of main areas we've been working on in outlet specifically: One is design and innovation. We've realized, through the vignette, I think, Victor mentioned in his prepared remarks on Snoopy, that when you got real innovation and emotion, it trumps price. It was successful and it's something that we're trying to replicate over the next few quarters, both in terms of these one-off, sort of, we call them play concepts and more generally, in terms of putting more design and innovation in the outlet channel. In terms of the modern actual renovations, they've not been as successful as in retail. We've not moved the needle that much. That said, we've got a number of learnings that we're currently addressing. We've used our Woodbury Common store as a pilot where we've done things such as moving product, more products to the floor. We realize that when there's too much product on the wall and not enough on the floor, it, in fact, impedes conversion. We've fragmented the store a bit too much so you don't get a sort of 360 view when you enter the store, et cetera. So loads of small operation improvements. The positive news is that, in Woodbury, where we started these tweaks about 2 to 3 months ago, we have seen an improvement in the controllable metrics, conversion and ADT. So good learnings, and we're going to keep implementing them throughout the chain."

And I would say that we're in the very early innings there of our transformation. As many of you know, we've invested now in, and I just mentioned in my prepared remarks, in 12 locations in the new concept. That's out of 1,000 that we have across North America. We're investing in the shop manager program for the top 50 locations by the end of this fiscal year. And in both of those cases, we are seeing an inflection versus the rest of the fleet. In addition, of course, we have made very significant progress in our penetration with the Tier 1 department stores with 1941 while also pulling back on those Coach-specific promotional days. Irrespective of all of that, the absolute number of chain-wide sale days continues to be an issue in that channel. And we continue, as a team, to have discussions with our partners about a couple of areas: One, first and foremost, the potential for the pullback on our promotion, which would include our exclusion and cooperation with our partners from the bulk of storewide events. And quite frankly, we're also looking at potentially exiting lower-volume doors going forward. So these are considerations that we're taking right now."

We will start with my remarks and then proceed to Jane, and we will extend time at the end for Q&A. Again, apologies for the technical difficulties. I think we're up and running here again.
Let me just first thank you, Andrea, again, and welcome, everyone, to our call. As noted in our press release, we are delighted with our strong fourth quarter performance in which we achieve positive North America comps for the first time in over 3 years and drove increases across key financial metrics. 
These results cap the year where we return the Coach brand to growth while elevating brand perception globally, thereby reaching an important milestone in the transformation journey we laid out over 2 years ago. Indeed, I could not be more pleased with and proud of our team's execution of the Transformation Plan over the last 2 years as we track to our goals, in spite of the significant and unanticipated volatility in tourist spending flows as well as the range of macroeconomic, geopolitical and promotional headwinds. 
In the quarter, our North American direct business has accelerated while we continue to implement the strategic actions to elevate our positioning and streamline our distribution in the very promotional department store channel. 
Our international business has continued to generate growth, highlighted by double-digit increases in Mainland China and Europe as well as sales gains in our directly operated businesses in Southeast Asia. Most importantly, we achieved the expected inflection and profitability as we leverage our expenses in the growth in our business. Overall, our results give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will continue to drive top and bottom line growth as we enter the new fiscal year. 
Looking ahead for fiscal 2017, our strategic priorities for the Coach brand include: Reenergizing our brand and category by continuing to innovate and establish our unique modern luxury positioning. We will continue the brand's elevation to a fuller expression of Coach 1941 in stores and online, while driving our men's business even further across all channels. 
In addition, we will focus on raising brand awareness and relevance globally through the rollout of flagships in key fashion capitals while continuing to renovate our existing store base. And in marketing, we will continue to differentiate Coach through a combination of fashion and heritage, distorting investments to key regions and ensuring the message is relevant and increasingly aspirational for the broader market. This will include the relaunch of Coach fragrance with our partner, Interparfums, starting this fall. 
And for Stuart Weitzman, we will drive our leadership position in fashion boots during the key winter selling season. Continue to diversify our offering outside of boots by developing iconic styles and pumps, sandals and flats. 
Drive global awareness and brand relevance through impactful marketing and the launch of New York and London flagships. And leverage our new leadership to bring the Stuart Weitzman brand into its next chapter of growth as a multi-category player. 
Now moving to our results. During the fourth quarter, as in the preceding quarters of fiscal year '16, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of products, stores and marketing. 
Most generally, we elevated our retail offering globally with a Coach 1941 assortment resonating in our retail stores and top-tier specialty stores, highlighted by iconic silhouettes, such as the saddle bag and Dinky add new icons, such as the rouge. 
Also in retail, our Mickey collaboration launched worldwide in June was particularly well-received, driving significant brand interest and buzz. We continue to transition the fleet into our modern luxury concept, driving comp improvement. 
Finally, our heritage marketing campaign focused on originality and authenticity, highlighted Coach's key competitive differences, separating us from the landscape of both legacy European luxury and American accessible brands. 
We are also pleased by Stuart Weitzman's performance this quarter, which drove annual results for the brand exceeding our original estimates. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of the brand's Canadian distributor, including 14 retail stores, which transitions to direct. We also announced the appointment of Wendy Kahn as brand President and CEO, who will join Stuart Weitzman from Valentino next month, succeeding Wayne [ph], who will remain as consultant supporting our corporate strategic agenda in footwear. 
And just today, Stuart Weitzman announced that Giovanni Murali, currently leather goods design director of men's and women's nonapparel categories from [ph] will be joining the brand next May, succeeding Founder and Executive Chairman of Stuart Weitzman, who will become Chairman at that time. Giovanni will be reporting to Wendy and brings to the brand new wealth of experience and accessories in footwear design, having worked extensively at Mark Jacobs and [ph]. 
Giovanni's unique attention to detail, craft and quality with his global modern sensibility will drive the Stuart Weitzman brands leadership and footwear design while bringing his rich and varied experience in leather, luxury goods to the brands language. 
Now as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across the 3 key brand pillars of product, stores and marketing. Starting with product, where Coach is clearly emerging as a house of modern fashion design. 
During the fourth quarter, as in the first 9 months of the year, virtually all of our retail channel assortment, both men's and women's, were Stuart Vevers' designs. It was the second quarter that included Coach 1941 and emphasized emphasized our elevation strategy. 
Overall, women's and retail was driven by leather goods and growth in 1941 silhouettes. In our fashion families, the Swagger comped the comp, growing in both sales and productivity and Mercer also contributed to results. 
We are now focused on 2 product lines for global retail: Coach New York, our broadest assortment, which includes essentials and our fashion families; and Coach 1941, our collection runway Line, which includes our most elevated handbags as well as ready-to-wear, footwear and other categories. 
Given success of the collection and consumers embrace of higher price points, we expect to significantly expand it across our directly operated store network. And by holiday, all of our retail stores will offer a range of 1941 handbags. 
The key retail strategies we are implementing include: The continued elevation of the assortment with a further rebalancing between essentials, fashion families and 1941, and a move from 12 to 8 deliveries in our retail channel. First, to better align with the fashion calendar, notably with higher-end specialty retail and also to drive improved productivity in each delivery. This will allow our families to work harder for us for longer. 
We are also excited to launch our women's fragrance line with Inter Parfums, the coming weeks and months across Coach retail stores as well as in major department stores, specialty stores and duty-free shops worldwide. 
The launch will be supported by an extensive integrated marketing and communications campaign, including television spots in September, featuring Chloë Grace Moretz. 
In outlet, Q4 marked the introduction of a new Stuart design silhouette in 2 sizes, the Harley, which is performing very well. In addition, Stuart introduced an expanded a breath of novelty prints and styles like the reversible tote and MINI Bennett. These prints clearly signaled summer and delivered strong storytelling in our stores. 
Also in the fourth quarter, the consumer response to the men's product expansion to all outlet centers was exceptional. While backpacks continue to be a top performer, we were especially pleased by the performance of men's novelty prints, which underscored that our men's customer is willing to invest in fashion pieces as well as modern classics. 
Looking ahead in outlet, you will also note a product and pricing architecture similar to retail. Starting with our value product, such as the reversible tote, essential such as Phoebe and fashion, including collaborations and sophisticated handbags, such as Blake. 
Pinnacle product also continues to be very important as our most elevated offering with the highest amount of novelty. In FY '17, you will see some standalone disruptive outlet collaborations unique to this channel, such as Pac-Man this fall. 
Finally, men's is going to be a major focus in outlet, and we expect it to be over 20% of the business by the end of the fiscal year. 
On stores. We're continuing to establish our modern luxury concept globally, renovating and opening approximately 165 during the quarter, including 45 renovations and 1 new modern luxury store in our directly operated North America business. 
In total, we renovated and opened about 300 modern luxury locations worldwide in FY '16, taking us to just over 450 modern luxury locations globally across all channels. This is very much in line with our target to end the year with over 400 doors and the new format. Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps, which exceed the balance of the fleet and the vast majority of stores around the world. 
We're especially excited about the ongoing positive comps we're driving in our renovated North America retail stores, including those stores that have now anniversary-ed their remodel. 
Of course, transforming our stores is more than just the physical design, it's the experience our store teams provide each and every single day. I am so proud that our mystery shopper scores are key metrics that demonstrate how well we deliver our unique modern luxury experience, surpassed 80% this quarter. 
In addition, it's a great to see how customers are responding to our new leather services, such as monogramming and leather conditioning with new services to be introduced throughout 2017. 
In North American department stores, we renovated over 35 shop-in-shop locations to modern luxury in the fourth quarter. Finally, we have about 40 shop managers in place today and have seen a significant impact versus balance of doors. 
Separately, and as noted in our release, one of our key strategic initiatives in the year ahead will be elevating the Coach brand in the North America wholesale channel. As discussed previously through 1941, we have already started adding new locations and top-tier specialty in North America and globally. 
In FY '17, we will also be rationalizing our department store distribution, taking our door count down by about 25% or by over 250 locations as well as reducing markdown allowances to the channel, given the high level of promotions. 
While we understand that consumers may use department stores for trial and shopping across brands, the high level of promotional impressions created negatively impact our long-term brand health while generating confusion across channels. 
As we look towards FY '17, the last year of our heavy lifting phase, we will focus on renovating the balance of our targeted store base. By year-end, modern luxury doors will in aggregate represent the vast majority of our traffic. 
I should also note that we are very excited about our global flagship focus in FY '17. Stores, which we view very much as key retail and marketing investment for the Coach brand. These flagships include our Coach house on Fifth Avenue and our Regent Street flagship, both opening in time for holiday. 
We are also excited to announce our first flagship in Italy, opening in Milan by the end of the calendar year on the prestigious via Montana [ph] . 
On the marketing front, in the fourth quarter, Mickey was the big news with a range of impactful and creative executions globally, generating over 950 million impressions. The launch created substantial buzz with both the most fashion-engaged fans and Coach lapsed customers who are -- with our messaging of cool fashion and quality glove-tanned leather. 
More generally during the quarter, we remained focused on creating desire for our brands, amplifying our fashion positioning and our 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality. 
In FY '17, we want to enhance brand perception and make the category exciting for her with a singular message that cuts through, Coach's unique modern luxury proposition, focusing on leathercraft and Stuart's vision of Coach New York cool, familiar Americana interpreted with a twist from New York's original house of leather design. 
We will leverage the opening of Coach house on Fifth Avenue as a global anchoring moment and will amplify regionally via openings on Regent Street in London, Via MonteNapoleone in Milan and China world in Beijing. 
As a result of these efforts across all customer touch points, we're seeing continued progress with customers. Importantly, in our North America brand tracking survey fielded in June, we a saw strength in our overall brand affinities while the percentage of customers who viewed Coach as ubiquitous declined versus a year ago. 
So as our plans unfold and the momentum builds, we're delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty retailer and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design, defining modern luxury. 
We're excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction and will continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward. Turning now to a discussion on category trends. As we look ahead to FY '17, there is no doubt that the challenges that are existing today affecting the category in specific and consumer spending in general will persist. 
The macroeconomic environment is uncertain, currency crosswinds are affecting tourist flows and the recent geopolitical events and tragic terrorist attacks are negatively impacting sentiment. As a result, visibility into category growth is limited as the landscape continues to rapidly shift. This volatility was evidenced throughout FY '16 and notably in the most recent quarter as you've seen in some of the varied results already reported by several brands in our space. 
Overall, we estimate that the North American premium women's handbag and accessory market grew at a low single-digit in the June quarter, resulting in slight growth for the year. 
And while men's growth was somewhat faster, given its relatively small penetration to the total, the premium men's and women's handbags and accessories category also grew at a low single-digit rate for the year. 
Coach's share of the combined market was 16% in FY '16. While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. 
Starting with North America. As you read in our release, for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales rose 9% and our direct business, 10% on the dollar basis and 11% in constant currency. 
Excluding the additional week, total North America sales rose 1%, reflecting the pullback in wholesale shipments while direct sales rose 2%, driven by the 2% increase in comparable store sales on a 13-week versus 13-week basis. Comp trends in both retail and outlet stores accelerated while the Internet contributed approximately 1 percentage point to aggregate comp this quarter. 
Overall, our aggregate comp was up 2%, lead, as expected, by retail, while outlet comp was essentially flat. Higher ticket drove overall comp while very slight changes in traffic and conversion netted to a flat overall number of transactions. 
We are especially pleased by the results we are seeing at coach.com, with our fashion launches and unique collaboration, such as Mickey, pointing to increased engagement with the most fashion-engaged online customer. 
Most importantly, the fourth quarter mark a return to positive North America comp for the first time since the third quarter of '13, and the seventh sequential improvement since our transformation began 2 years ago, representing 26% comp swing since the first quarter of FY '15. 
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on products. The above $400 price bracket rose in penetration, saw another positive comp on the sales and unit basis and represented about 40% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year. 
As planned, and as discussed back in April, we deemphasized the entry price gifting assortment since coming out of holiday and therefore, saw a decline in the $300 and below handbag price segment. 
Turning to event marketing. In FY '16, we continued to evolve and optimize our events with the goal of further reducing the number of days on promotion. Exiting this year, we are comfortable with the cadence and types of events we're hosting and don't expect a significant change in that year ahead. 
Naturally, there may be some tweaks to the dates, type or duration but the overall day should be fairly stable with our first preferred customer event for September, anniversary-ing the prior year. 
And now moving on to international. In the fourth quarter, international Coach brand sales rose 15% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis. For the year, Coach brand international sales increased 5% in dollars and 9% in constant currency. 
As noted in our release, the additional week of sales in FY '16 added approximately $32 million to  overall international segment sales. Therefore, excluding the additional week, fourth quarter sales rose 6% in dollars and 5% in constant currency while full year sales increased 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. 
Turning to details by geography. And please note the comments I'll make will be on the 13-week and 52-week basis. Greater China sales increased 5% in dollars in the quarter, with double-digit growth and positive comparable store sales on the Mainland, offset in part by continued weakness in Hong Kong and Macau. 
On a constant currency basis, sales increased 10%. For the year, sales increased 2% in dollars and 5% in constant currency to approximately $605 million, slightly ahead of our most recent guidance of approximately $600 million, despite a further devaluation in the renminbi since our last earnings call. 
Notably, our constant currency sales growth for the year was consistent with our original expectations provided last August. Despite the evolving macroeconomic environment and tourist spending flows as well as sustain softness in Hong Kong and Macau. 
Importantly, and despite near-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long term as the drivers we've consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever and as our China team continues to do an excellent job of building our brand equity in that market. 
It's important to note that we still see the Chinese consumer as an increasing part of our total business. During the fourth quarter, our global business with the Chinese continued to grow. In addition to strong domestic spending, we experienced growth in other key destinations, including Southeast Asia. This growth was partially offset by declines in travel flows into North America and Europe, notably France, along with continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau. 
In addition, and, as expected, we also saw a decline in Chinese tourist flows into Japan, impacted by currency fluctuations and the anniversary of the dramatic increase in Chinese tourists last spring. 
To that end, in the fourth quarter, Japan sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis but rose 7% on a dollar basis, reflecting the stronger yen. For the year, sales rose 2% in constant currency and were essentially even with the prior year in dollars, benefiting overall from an increase in PRC tourist flows on an annual basis and the positive response to our new modern luxury positioning from Japanese consumers and tourists alike. 
In Europe, our brands continues to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. Our overarching focus is to build brand awareness with both domestic consumers as well as tourists. In the fourth quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace, driven by both distribution and comparable store sales. 
We experienced relative softness in France in the quarter, impacted by weak tourist traffic, as mentioned. Overall, and despite these headwinds, our sales rose 50% to $135 million in fiscal 2016 and exceeded our guidance of $125 million. 
Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium women's and men's bag and accessories market. 
In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales growth in the fourth quarter was solid across the entire region in local currency and rose at a low single-digit rate in dollars. 
For the year, sales increased high single digits in constant currency but declined slightly in dollars. Hereto, we remain focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives. 
Finally, I would point out that we're seeing disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which while small, are important to growing brand awareness. For the quarter, our overall sales at POS increased moderately, driven by strong growth in those distributor-operated locations focused on the domestic consumer while travel retail was relatively weak due to the volatility of tourist spending flows globally. 
On a net sales basis, revenue was down in the quarter due to  shipment timing. For the year, both POS and net sales of declined slightly, as softness in travel retail offset growth to distributor run locations targeting domestic customers. 
In closing, we are encouraged with the momentum of our business and proud of the progress we've made along our transformation journey, elevating the perception of the Coach brand and Coach, Inc. as we've earned increasing acceptance as a house of modern luxury brands. 
Before handing over to Jane for details of our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2017, I would like to touch on our CFO transition. First, as you know, we announced Jane Nielsen's departure in June, which will become effective later this month following the filing of our 10-K. 
This will be Jane's last earnings call with Coach. Jane has played an important role as a terrific partner to me and the Coach executive team as we have executed our brand transformation. I speak for the entire team and thanking her and in wishing her every success in her future. 
At the same time, I could not be prouder of the bench that we have across finance, and especially the leadership role that Andrea Shaw Resnick will play as our Interim CFO until we appoint a permanent successor. 
You all know Andrea well, she's been an important partner to me and the business in crafting and the communication of our strategies and will ensure we don't miss a beat in their execution. 
I would now like to pass on to Jane. Jane?"

For those kind words and for the privilege of working at this outstanding company. Victor has taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details. 
Please note the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results, corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today. 
We are extremely pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, as we drove increases across the key metrics of sales, operating profits and earnings. We achieved positive comps in North America while continuing to grow our business internationally, and we leverage this growth with significant improvement in our operating margins for the quarter. 
The strong fourth quarter cap the year of important financial milestones. In fiscal 2016, we generated overall top line growth for Coach, Inc, while tightly controlling our inventory. We drove a sequential improvement in our North America comps throughout the year while achieving our revenue targets for Europe and Greater China against a volatile macro backdrop. 
We continue to invest in our brands while still leaving our margin targets for FY '16, ending the year with an operating margin of over 17%, in line with guidance of high teens, including a Coach brand gross margin slightly above higher year, excluding the impact of currency. 
In addition, we successfully integrated the Stuart Weitzman business, which outperformed our original revenue and earnings per share projections for the year. 
Turning now to the detail. Before I begin, please note that the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively, while the same periods in fiscal 2015 included 13 and 52 weeks, respectively. The 53rd week contributed $84 million to 2016 fourth quarter and fiscal year sales, including $77 million in Coach brand revenue and $7 million associated with Stuart Weitzman. The additional week added $0.07 to earnings per share -- earnings per diluted share. 
The following discussion of performance for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2016 includes the 53rd week. 
Focusing on Coach, Inc. Net sales totaled $1.15 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter, an increase of 15% on both a reported and constant currency basis. For the year, net sales totaled $4.49 billion, an increase of 7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis from fiscal 2015. 
Gross profit in the fourth quarter totaled $783 million, an increase of 13%. While gross margin for the quarter was 67.8% compared to 69.0% last year. Gross profit for the year totaled $3.05 billion, an increase of 5% while gross margin was 68.0% percent compared to 69.6% in FY '15. 
SG&A expense totaled $608 million in Q4, an increase of 7%, or 52.7% of sales as compared to $566 million or 56.4% in the year-ago period. For the year, SG&A expenses were $2.28 billion, an increase of 7% and represented 50.7% of sales as compared with 50.8% a year ago. 
Operating income for the quarter was $175 million, an increase of 39% while operating margin was 15.1% versus 12.6%. Operating income totaled $777 million in FY '16, a decrease of 2%, while operating margin was 17.3% versus 18.8% a year ago. 
Net interest expense was $7 million in the quarter as compared to $6 million in the year-ago period. Net interest expense was $27 million in FY '16 as compared to $6 million in FY '15. Net income for the quarter totaled $126 million compared to $85 million a year ago, with earnings per diluted share of $0.45, up 47% versus prior year. 
Net income for the full year totaled $552 million, an increase of 4% with earnings per diluted share of $1.98, including a $0.12 contribution from Stuart Weitzman. 
Now, moving to global distribution. In total, we closed 11 net Coach brand locations globally in the fourth quarter to end the year with 954 directly operated locations worldwide. In addition, we finished FY '16 with 75 directly operated Stuart Weitzman stores, including 14 locations associated with the acquisition of the Canadian distributor, which closed in the fourth quarter. 
Overall and consistent with our plan, our global Coach brand directly operated square footage rose low single digits for the year with North America square footage essentially even with prior year and international up mid-single digits. 
In FY '17, we expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to be up low single digits globally. This guidance assumes that Coach brand directly operated square footage in North America will decline slightly with continued net store closures. 
Internationally, we expect distribution growth to again be led by Europe, where we are planning another year of a significant square footage growth, driven by new stores, including our flagship on Regent Street. 
In Greater China, we are projecting a mid-single-digit increase in square footage, driven by net new stores openings on the Mainland, partially offset by a modest decline in units in Hong Kong and Macau. 
In our directly operated businesses in Southeast Asia, we expect litlle change in both units and square footage while in Japan, we are planning for additional store closures resulting in a mid-single-digit decline in square footage. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we expect 5 to 10 net new directly operated locations in FY '17. 
Moving on. Inventory levels at the quarter end were $459 million compared to ending inventory of $485 million a year ago, a decrease of 5%. 
Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $249 million compared to $186 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $129 million versus $111 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $120 million versus $75 million. 
For the full fiscal year 2016, net cash from operating activity was $759 million compared to $937 million a year ago. Free cash flow in the fiscal year '16 was an inflow of $362 million versus $738 million in the fiscal year '15. 
CapEx spending totaled $396 million for the year, including approximately $145 million of CapEx associated with the new headquarters compared to total CapEx of $199 million in FY '15. 
At the end of the fiscal year, cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to  $1.5 billion a year ago and our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter. 
Turning to Hudson Yard and a discussion of our capital allocation policy. Last week, we completed the sale of our interest in 10 Hudson Yards in New York City, resulting in a gain of approximately $30 million. 
At the same time, we entered into 20-year lease for the headquarter space at approximately $65 a square foot for the first 5 years. This transaction is leverage neutral and increases the flexibility of our balance sheet, while at the same time securing a long-term lease for our company with minimal net impact to our P&L. 
As planned, following the sale, we paid down approximately $300 million of our term loan with no prepayment penalty. In addition, we will receive net proceeds of approximately $125 million later this fiscal year related to the sale of our previous headquarter building on 34th Street. 
We should receive the proceeds within 45 days of vacating the buildings and therefore expect to receive during or by the end of the second fiscal quarter. Overall, we are very pleased to monetize our investment in Hudson Yards, where our commitment was key to kicking off the project. Our new headquarters brings both our brands, Coach and Stuart Weitzman, together under 1 roof. In a modern workspace, very much reflective of Coach's value and sensibility. The transaction was long planned for and there is no resulting change in our capital allocation policy. 
Our first priority is to continue to invest in our business as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. 
Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act, if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders. 
And third, capital returns. As I've stated before, we are committed to our dividend and expect our dividend to grow at least in line with the prior year year's operational net income growth as our transformation gains momentum. Through this end, as noted, in our press release, the board declared a quarterly dividend, cash dividend of 33 and 3/4 cents [ph] per common share payable in early October, maintaining our annual rate of $1.35. Underpinning all of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets. 
Now, turning to our outlook for fiscal 2017 on a non-GAAP 52-week versus 52-week basis. We expect total revenues for Coach, Inc. in fiscal 2017 to increase by low to mid-single digits, including the expected benefit from foreign currency of approximately 100 to 150 basis points based on current foreign exchange rates. This continues to assume a positive low single digits comp for the Coach brand in North America for the year. 
In addition, we are initiating an operating margin forecast for Coach, Inc. of between 18.5% and 19% for fiscal 2017. This guidance incorporates the negative impact of both Stuart Weitzman and the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North America wholesale channel, including the closure of about 25% of doors and reduction in markdown allowances. Excluding this impact, Coach brand operating margin will be in the area of 20% for fiscal 2017, consistent with prior guidance. 
Interest expense is expected to be in the area of $25 million for the year, which incorporates the benefit associated with the paydown of the term loan as announced. The full year fiscal 2017 tax rate is projected to be about 28%. We expect our weighted average diluted share count of shares outstanding for the year to be in the area of $283 million million. 
Taken together, we are projecting double-digit growth in both net income and earnings per diluted share for the year, and we expect CapEx for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $325 million in FY '17. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our progress to-date. We have a clear strategy and a well-articulated implementation plan for FY '17, building on the successes we have achieved in our first 2 years of transformation. 
Importantly, we expect FY '17 to be the year when we return to growth across all financials, leveraging top line growth and supported by our operational efficiency initiatives, which have allowed us to become a more nimble organization.

While there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the global environment and the category in the short term, I remain incredibly optimistic about the long-term opportunities in our categories, not only handbags but increasingly footwear and now that we're in both developed and developing markets and the prospects that exist for the world's middle-classes. Most of all, I have tremendous faith in our teams and our brands as we design -- define a new vision for luxury that is based on quality, craftsmanship and modern fashion sensibility that is both approachable, optimistic and inclusive and represents the best of our New York and American values that resonates so well across the world.

Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon a number of important factors, including risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, control costs, successfully execute our transformation and operational efficiency initiatives and growth strategies or our ability to achieve intended benefits, cost savings and synergies from the Stuart Weitzman acquisition.

We will start with my remarks and then proceed to Jane, and we will extend time at the end for Q&A. Again, apologies for the technical difficulties. I think we're up and running here again.
Let me just first thank you, Andrea, again, and welcome, everyone, to our call. As noted in our press release, we are delighted with our strong fourth quarter performance in which we achieved positive North America comps for the first time in over 3 years and drove increases across key financial metrics.
These results capped a year where we returned the Coach brand to growth while elevating brand perception globally, thereby reaching an important milestone in the transformation journey we laid out over 2 years ago. Indeed, I could not be more pleased with and proud of our team's execution of the transformation plan over the last 2 years as we track to our goals, in spite of the significant and unanticipated volatility in tourist-spending flows as well as the range of macroeconomic, geopolitical and promotional headwinds.
In the quarter, our North American direct business has accelerated while we continued to implement strategic actions to elevate our positioning and streamline our distribution in the very promotional department store channel.
Our international business has continued to generate growth, highlighted by double-digit increases in Mainland China and Europe as well as sales gains in our directly operated businesses in Southeast Asia. Most importantly, we achieved the expected inflection and profitability as we leveraged our expenses in the growth in our business. Overall, our results give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will continue to drive top and bottom line growth as we enter the new fiscal year.
Looking ahead for fiscal 2017, our strategic priorities for the Coach brand include: Reenergizing our brand in category by continuing to innovate and establish our unique modern luxury positioning. We will continue the brand's elevation through a fuller expression of Coach 1941 in stores and online, while driving our men's business even further across all channels.
In addition, we will focus on raising brand awareness and relevance globally through the rollout of flagships in key fashion capitals while continuing to renovate our existing store base. And in marketing, we will continue to differentiate Coach through a combination of fashion and heritage, distorting investments to key regions and ensuring the message is relevant and increasingly aspirational for the broader market. This will include the relaunch of Coach fragrance with our partner, Interparfums, starting this fall.
And for Stuart Weitzman, we will drive our leadership position in fashion boots during the key winter selling season; continue to diversify our offering outside of boots by developing iconic styles and pumps, sandals and flats; drive global awareness and brand relevance through impactful marketing and the launch of New York and London flagships; and leverage our new leadership to bring the Stuart Weitzman brand into its next chapter of growth as a multi-category player.
Now moving to our results. During the fourth quarter, as in the preceding quarters of fiscal year '16, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing.
Most generally, we elevated our retail offering globally with the Coach 1941 assortment resonating in our retail stores and top-tier specialty stores, highlighted by iconic silhouettes, such as the Saddle Bag and Dinky, and new icons, such as the Rouge.
Also in retail, our Mickey collaboration launched worldwide in June was particularly well received, driving significant brand interest and buzz. We continued to transition the fleet into our modern luxury concept, driving comp improvement.
Finally, our heritage marketing campaign focused on originality and authenticity, highlighted Coach's key competitive differences, separating us from the landscape of both legacy European luxury and American accessible brands.
We are also pleased by Stuart Weitzman's performance this quarter, which drove annual results for the brand exceeding our original estimates. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of the brand's Canadian distributor, including 14 retail stores which transitioned to direct. We also announced the appointment of Wendy Kahn as brand President and CEO, who will join Stuart Weitzman from Valentino next month, succeeding Wayne Kulkin, who will remain as a consultant supporting our corporate strategic agenda in footwear.
And just today, Stuart Weitzman announced that Giovanni Morelli, currently leather goods design director of men's and women's nonapparel categories for Loewe, will be joining the brand next May, succeeding Founder and Executive Chairman, Stuart Weitzman, who will become Chairman at that time. Giovanni will be reporting to Wendy and brings to the brand a wealth of experience in accessories and footwear design, having worked extensively at Marc Jacobs, Chloé and now Loewe. Giovanni's unique attention to detail, craft and quality with his global modern sensibility will drive the Stuart Weitzman brands leadership in footwear design while bringing his rich and varied experience in leather, luxury goods to the brands language.
Now as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across the 3 key brand pillars of product, stores and marketing.
Starting with product, where Coach is clearly emerging as a house of modern fashion design.
During the fourth quarter, as in the first 9 months of the year, virtually all of our retail channel assortment, both men's and women's, were Stuart Vevers' designs. It was the second quarter that included Coach 1941 and emphasized our elevation strategy.
Overall, women's in retail was driven by leather goods and growth in 1941 silhouettes. In our fashion families, the Swagger comped the comp, growing in both sales and productivity and Mercer also contributed to results.
We are now focused on 2 product lines for global retail: Coach New York, our broadest assortment, which includes essentials and our fashion families; and Coach 1941, our collection runway Line, which includes our most elevated handbags as well as ready-to-wear footwear and other categories.
Given success of the collection and consumers embrace of higher price points, we expect to significantly expand it across our directly operated store network. And by holiday, all of our retail stores will offer a range of 1941 handbags.
The key retail strategies we are implementing include: The continued elevation of the assortment with further rebalancing between essentials, fashion families and 1941; and a move from 12 to 8 deliveries in our retail channel. First, to better align with the fashion calendar, notably with higher-end specialty retail and also to drive improved productivity in each delivery. This will allow our families to work harder for us for longer.
We are also excited to launch our women's fragrance line with Interparfums in the coming weeks and months across Coach retail stores as well as in major department stores, specialty stores and duty-free shops worldwide.
The launch will be supported by an extensive integrated marketing and communications campaign, including television spots in September, featuring Chloë Grace Moretz.
In outlet, Q4 marked the introduction of a new Stuart-designed silhouette in 2 sizes, the Harley [ph], which is performing very well. In addition, Stuart introduced an expanded breadth of novelty prints and styles like the reversible tote and MINI Bennett. These prints clearly signaled summer and delivered strong storytelling in our stores.
Also in the fourth quarter, the consumer response to the men's product expansion to all outlet centers was exceptional. While backpacks continued to be a top performer, we were especially pleased by the performance of men's novelty prints, which underscored that our men's customer is willing to invest in fashion pieces as well as modern classics.
Looking ahead in outlet, you will also note a product and pricing architecture similar to retail. Starting with our value product, such as the reversible tote; essentials, such as Phoebe; and fashion, including collaborations and sophisticated handbags, such as Blake.
Pinnacle product also continues to be very important as our most elevated offering with the highest amounts of novelty. In FY '17, you will see some standalone disruptive outlet collaborations unique to this channel, such as Pac-Man this fall.
Finally, men's is going to be a major focus in outlet, and we expect it to be over 20% of the business by the end of the fiscal year.
On stores. We're continuing to establish our modern luxury concept globally, renovating and opening approximately 165 during the quarter, including 45 renovations and 1 new modern luxury store in our directly operated North America business. In total, we renovated and opened about 300 modern luxury locations worldwide in FY '16, taking us to just over 450 modern luxury locations globally across all channels. This is very much in line with our target to end the year with over 400 doors in the new format. Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps, which exceed the balance of the fleet and the vast majority of stores around the world.
We're especially excited about the ongoing positive comps we're driving in our renovated North America retail stores, including those stores that have now anniversary-ed their remodel.
Of course, transforming our stores is more than just the physical design, it's the experience our store teams provide each and every single day. I am so proud that our mystery shopper scores are key metrics that demonstrate how well we deliver our unique modern luxury experience, surpassed 80% this quarter.
In addition, it's great to see how customers are responding to our new leather services, such as monogramming and leather conditioning with new services to be introduced throughout 2017.
In North American department stores, we renovated over 35 shop-in-shop locations to modern luxury in the fourth quarter. Finally, we have about 40 shop managers in place today and have seen a significant impact versus balance of doors.
Separately, and as noted in our release, one of our key strategic initiatives in the year ahead will be elevating the Coach brand in the North America wholesale channel. As discussed previously through 1941, we have already started adding new locations and top-tier specialty in North America and globally.
In FY '17, we will also be rationalizing our department store distribution, taking our door count down by about 25% or by over 250 locations as well as reducing markdown allowances to the channel, given the high level of promotions.
While we understand that consumers may use department stores for trial and shopping across brands, the high level of promotional impressions created negatively impact our long-term brand health while generating confusion across channels.
As we look towards FY '17, the last year of our heavy lifting phase, we will focus on renovating the balance of our targeted store base. By year-end, modern luxury doors will in aggregate represent the vast majority of our traffic.
I should also note that we're very excited about our global flagship focus in FY '17: stores, which we view very much as key retail and marketing investments for the Coach brand. These flagships include our Coach House on Fifth Avenue and our Regent Street flagship, both opening in time for holiday.
We are also excited to announce our first flagship in Italy, opening in Milan by the end of the calendar year on the prestigious Via Montenapoleone.
On the marketing front, in the fourth quarter, Mickey was the big news with a range of impactful and creative executions globally, generating over 950 million impressions. The launch created substantial buzz with both the most fashion-engaged fans and Coach-lapsed customers who are -- with our messaging of cool fashion and quality glove-tanned leather.
More generally during the quarter, we remained focused on creating desire for our brands, amplifying our fashion positioning into our 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality.
In FY '17, we want to enhance brand perception and make the category exciting for her with a singular message that cuts through, Coach's unique modern luxury proposition, focusing on leather craft and Stuart's vision of Coach New York Cool [ph], familiar Americana interpreted with a twist from New York's original house of leather design.
We will leverage the opening of Coach House on Fifth Avenue as a global anchoring moment and will amplify regionally via openings on Regent Street in London, Via Montenapoleone in Milan and China World in Beijing.
As a result of these efforts across all customer touch points, we're seeing continued progress with customers. Importantly, in our North America brand-tracking survey fielded in June, we saw a strength in our overall brand affinities while the percentage of customers who viewed Coach as ubiquitous declined versus a year ago.
So as our plans unfold and the momentum builds, we're delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty retailer and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design, defining modern luxury.
We're excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction, and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.
Turning now to a discussion on category trends. As we look ahead to FY '17, there is no doubt that the challenges that are existing today affecting the category in specific and consumer spending in general will persist. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain, currency crosswinds are affecting tourist flows and the recent geopolitical events and tragic terrorist attacks are negatively impacting sentiment. As a result, visibility into category growth is limited as the landscape continues to rapidly shift. This volatility was evidenced throughout FY '16 and notably in the most recent quarter as you've seen in some of the varied results already reported by several brands in our space.
Overall, we estimate that the North American premium women's handbag and accessory market grew at a low single-digit in the June quarter, resulting in slight growth for the year. And while men's growth was somewhat faster, given its relatively small penetration to the total, the premium men's and women's handbag and accessories category also grew at a low single-digit rate for the year. Coach's share of the combined market was 16% in FY '16.
While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market.
Starting with North America. As you read in our release, for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales rose 9% in our direct business, 10% on a dollar basis and 11% in constant currency.
Excluding the additional week, total North America sales rose 1%, reflecting the pullback in wholesale shipments while direct sales rose 2%, driven by the 2% increase in comparable store sales on a 13-week versus 13-week basis.
Comp trends in both retail and outlet stores accelerated while the Internet contributed approximately 1 percentage point to aggregate comp this quarter. Overall, our aggregate comp was up 2%, lead, as expected, by retail, while outlet comp was essentially flat. Higher ticket drove overall comp while very slight changes in traffic and conversion netted to a flat overall number of transactions.
We are especially pleased by the results we are seeing on coach.com, with our fashion launches and unique collaborations, such as Mickey, pointing to increased engagement with the most fashion-engaged online customers.
Most importantly, the fourth quarter marked a return to positive North America comp for the first time since the third quarter of '13, and the seventh sequential improvement since our transformation began 2 years ago, representing a 26% comp swing since the first quarter of FY '15.
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on products. The above $400 price bracket rose in penetration saw another positive comp on the sales and unit basis and represented about 40% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year.
As planned and as discussed back in April, we deemphasized the entry price gifting assortment since coming out of holiday and, therefore, saw a decline in the $300 and below handbag price segment. 
Turning to event marketing. In FY '16, we continued to evolve and optimize our events with the goal of further reducing the number of days on promotion. Exiting this year, we are comfortable with the cadence and type of events we're hosting and don't expect a significant change in the year ahead.
Naturally, there may be some tweaks to the dates, type or duration but the overall date should be fairly stable with our first preferred customer event for September, anniversary-ing the prior year.
And now moving on to international. In the fourth quarter, international Coach brand sales rose 15% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis. For the year, Coach brand international sales increased 5% in dollars and 9% in constant currency.
As noted in our release, the additional week of sales in FY '16 added approximately $32 million to overall international segment sales. Therefore, excluding the additional week, fourth quarter sales rose 6% in dollars and 5% in constant currency while full-year sales increased 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency.
Turning to details by geography. And please note the comments I'll make will be on the 13-week and 52-week basis. Greater China sales increased 5% in dollars in the quarter with double-digit growth and positive comparable store sales on the Mainland, offset in part by continued weakness in Hong Kong and Macau.
On a constant currency basis, sales increased 10%. For the year, sales increased 2% in dollars and 5% in constant currency to approximately $605 million, slightly ahead of our most recent guidance of approximately $600 million, despite a further devaluation in the renminbi since our last earnings call.
Notably, our constant currency sales growth for the year was consistent with our original expectations provided last August, despite the evolving macroeconomic environment and tourist-spending flows as well as sustained softness in Hong Kong and Macau.
Importantly, and despite near-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long term as the drivers we've consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever and as our China team continues to do an excellent job of building our brand equity in that market.
It's important to note that we still see the Chinese consumer as an increasing part of our total business. During the fourth quarter, our global business with the Chinese continued to grow. In addition to strong domestic spending, we experienced growth in other key destinations, including Southeast Asia. This growth was partially offset by declines in travel flows into North America and Europe, notably France, along with continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau.
In addition, and, as expected, we also saw a decline in Chinese tourist flows into Japan, impacted by currency fluctuations and the anniversary of the dramatic increase in Chinese tourists last spring.
To that end, in the fourth quarter, Japan sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis but rose 7% on a dollar basis, reflecting the stronger yen. For the year, sales rose 2% in constant currency and were essentially even with the prior year in dollars, benefiting overall from an increase in PRC tourist flows on an annual basis and the positive response to our new modern luxury positioning from Japanese consumers and tourists alike.
In Europe, our brand continues to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. Our overarching focus is to build brand awareness with both domestic consumers as well as tourists. In the fourth quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace, driven by both distribution and comparable store sales.
We experienced relative softness in France in the quarter, impacted by weak tourist traffic, as mentioned. Overall, and despite these headwinds, our sales rose 50% to $135 million in fiscal 2016 and exceeded our guidance of $125 million.
Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium women's and men's bag and accessories market.
In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales growth in the fourth quarter was solid across the entire region in local currency and rose at a low single-digit rate in dollars.
For the year, sales increased high single digits in constant currency, but declined slightly in dollars. Hereto, we remained focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives.
Finally, I would point out that we're seeing disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which, while small, are important to growing brand awareness. For the quarter, our overall sales at POS increased modestly, driven by strong growth in those distributor-operated locations focused on the domestic consumer, while travel retail was relatively weak due to the volatility of tourist-spending flows globally.
On a net sales basis, revenue was down in the quarter due to shipment timing. For the year, both POS and net sales declined slightly, as softness in travel retail offset growth in distributor-run locations targeting domestic customers.
In closing, we are encouraged with the momentum of our business and proud of the progress we've made along our transformation journey, elevating the perception of the Coach brand and Coach, Inc. as we've earned increasing acceptance as a house of modern luxury brands.
Before handing over to Jane for details of our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2017, I would like to touch on our CFO transition. First, as you know, we announced Jane Nielsen's departure in June, which will become effective later this month following the filing of our 10-K. This will be Jane's last earnings call with Coach. Jane has played an important role as a terrific partner to me and the Coach executive team as we have executed our brand transformation. I speak for the entire team in thanking her and in wishing her every success in her future.
At the same time, I could not be prouder of the bench that we have across finance, and especially the leadership role that Andrea Shaw Resnick will play as our interim CFO until we appoint a permanent successor. You all know Andrea well, she's been an important partner to me and our business in crafting and the communication of our strategies and will ensure we don't miss a beat in their execution.
I would now like to pass on to Jane. Jane?"

Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details.
Please note the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today.
We are extremely pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, as we drove increases across the key metrics of sales, operating profits and earnings. We achieved positive comps in North America while continuing to grow our business internationally, and we leveraged this growth with significant improvement in our operating margin for the quarter.
The strong fourth quarter capped the year of important financial milestones. In fiscal 2016, we generated overall top line growth for Coach, Inc., while tightly controlling our inventory. We drove a sequential improvement in our North America comps throughout the year while achieving our revenue targets for Europe and Greater China against a volatile macro backdrop.
We continued to invest in our brands while delevering our margin target for FY '16, ending the year with an operating margin of over 17%, in line with guidance of high teens, including a Coach brand gross margin slightly above prior year, excluding the impact of currency.
In addition, we successfully integrated the Stuart Weitzman business, which outperformed our original revenue and earnings per share projections for the year.
Turning now to the detail. Before I begin, please note that the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively, while the same periods in fiscal 2015 included 13 and 52 weeks, respectively. The 53rd week contributed $84 million to 2016 fourth quarter and fiscal year sales, including $77 million in Coach brand revenue and $7 million associated with Stuart Weitzman. The additional week added $0.07 to earnings per share -- earnings per diluted share. The following discussion of performance for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2016 includes the 53rd week.
Focusing on Coach, Inc. Net sales totaled $1.15 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter, an increase of 15% on both a reported and constant currency basis. For the year, net sales totaled $4.49 billion, an increase of 7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis from fiscal 2015.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter totaled $783 million, an increase of 13%, while gross margin for the quarter was 67.8% compared to 69.0% last year. Gross profit for the year totaled $3.05 billion, an increase of 5%, while gross margin was 68.0% compared to 69.6% in FY '15.
SG&A expense totaled $608 million in Q4, an increase of 7% or 52.7% of sales as compared to $566 million or 56.4% in the year ago period. For the year, SG&A expenses were $2.28 billion, an increase of 7% and represented 50.7% of sales as compared with 50.8% a year ago.
Operating income for the quarter was $175 million, an increase of 39%, while operating margin was 15.1% versus 12.6%. Operating income totaled $777 million in FY '16, a decrease of 2%, while operating margin was 17.3% versus 18.8% a year ago.
Net interest expense was $7 million in the quarter as compared to $6 million in the year ago period. Net interest expense was $27 million in FY '16 as compared to $6 million in FY '15.
Net income for the quarter totaled $126 million compared to $85 million a year ago, with earnings per diluted share of $0.45, up 47% versus prior year. Net income for the full year totaled $552 million, an increase of 4% with earnings per diluted share of $1.98, including a $0.12 contribution from Stuart Weitzman.
Now moving to global distribution. In total, we closed 11 net Coach brand locations globally in the fourth quarter to end the year with 954 directly operated locations worldwide. In addition, we finished FY '16 with 75 directly operated Stuart Weitzman stores, including 14 locations associated with the acquisition of the Canadian distributor, which closed in the fourth quarter.
Overall and consistent with our plan, our global Coach brand directly operated square footage rose low single digits for the year with North America square footage essentially even with prior year and international up mid-single digits.
In FY '17, we expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to be up low single digits globally. This guidance assumes that Coach brand directly operated square footage in North America will decline slightly with continued net store closures.
Internationally, we expect distribution growth to again be led by Europe, where we are planning another year of significant square footage growth, driven by new stores, including our flagship on Regent Street.
In Greater China, we are projecting a mid-single-digit increase in square footage, driven by net new stores openings on the Mainland, partially offset by a modest decline in units in Hong Kong and Macau.
In our directly operated businesses in Southeast Asia, we expect little change in both units and square footage, while in Japan, we are planning for additional store closures resulting in a mid-single-digit decline in square footage. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we expect 5 to 10 net new directly operated locations in FY '17.
Moving on. Inventory levels at the quarter end were $459 million compared to ending inventory of $485 million a year ago, a decrease of 5%.
Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $249 million compared to $186 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $129 million versus $111 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $120 million versus $75 million.
For the full fiscal year 2016, net cash from operating activities was $759 million compared to $937 million a year ago. Free cash flow in the fiscal year '16 was an inflow of $362 million versus $738 million in the fiscal year '15.
CapEx spending totaled $396 million for the year, including approximately $145 million of CapEx associated with the new headquarters compared to total CapEx of $199 million in FY '15.
At the end of the fiscal year, cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to $1.5 billion a year ago, and our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter.
Turning to Hudson Yards and a discussion of our capital allocation policy. Last week, we completed the sale of our interest in 10 Hudson Yards in New York City, resulting in a gain of approximately $30 million.
At the same time, we entered into a 20-year lease for the headquarter space at approximately $65 a square foot for the first 5 years. This transaction is leveraged neutral and increases the flexibility of our balance sheet, while at the same time securing a long-term lease for our company with minimal net impact to our P&L.
As planned, following the sale, we paid down approximately $300 million of our term loan with no prepayment penalty. In addition, we will receive net proceeds of approximately $125 million later this fiscal year related to the sale of our previous headquarters building on 34th Street. We should receive the proceeds within 45 days of vacating the building and, therefore, expect to receive during or by the end of the second fiscal quarter.
Overall, we are very pleased to monetize our investment in Hudson Yards, where our commitment was key to kicking off the project. Our new headquarters brings both our brands, Coach and Stuart Weitzman, together under 1 roof, in a modern workspace, very much reflective of Coach's value and sensibility. The transaction was long planned for and there is no resulting change in our capital allocation policy.
Our first priority is to continue to invest in our business as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity.
Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act, if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders.
And third, capital returns. As I've stated before, we are committed to our dividend and expect our dividend to grow at least in line with the prior year's operational net income growth as our transformation gains momentum. To this end, as noted in our press release, the board declared a quarterly dividend -- cash dividend of $0.3375 per common share payable in early October, maintaining our annual rate of $1.35. Underpinning all of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively: maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets.
Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2017 on a non-GAAP 52-week versus 52-week basis. We expect total revenues for Coach, Inc. in fiscal 2017 to increase by low to mid-single digits, including the expected benefit from foreign currency of approximately 100 to 150 basis points based on current foreign exchange rates. This continues to assume a positive low-single-digit comp for the Coach brand in North America for the year.
In addition, we are initiating an operating margin forecast for Coach, Inc. of between 18.5% and 19% for fiscal 2017. This guidance incorporates the negative impact of both Stuart Weitzman and the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North America wholesale channel, including the closure of about 25% of doors and reduction in markdown allowances. Excluding this impact, Coach brand operating margin will be in the area of 20% for fiscal 2017, consistent with prior guidance.
Interest expense is expected to be in the area of $25 million for the year, which incorporates the benefit associated with the paydown of the term loan as announced. The full year fiscal 2017 tax rate is projected to be about 28%. We expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year to be in the area of 283 million.
Taken together, we are projecting double-digit growth in both net income and earnings per diluted share for the year, and we expect CapEx for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $325 million in FY '17.
In closing, we are very pleased with our progress to date. We have a clear strategy and a well-articulated implementation plan for FY '17, building on the successes we have achieved in our first 2 years of transformation.
Importantly, we expect FY '17 to be the year when we return to growth across all financials, leveraging top line growth and supported by our operational efficiency initiatives, which have allowed us to become a more nimble organization. Overall, the strength of our brands, the clarity of our vision and the dedication and proven execution capabilities of our team gives us continued confidence in our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth for Coach, Inc. over the long term.
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

And that is the case, of course, in most of our mature markets quite different, of course, in developing markets, like Europe, where we're starting with 1941, as the true first impression that these consumers have of Coach in an increasing way. In terms of how we see the balance, and we discussed in our prepared remarks the balancing of the assortment between, if you will, the essentials, fashion and 1941, we are increasing the presence of 1941 to the whole network, as I discussed. I think that during gifting periods, as has been the case in the past, you will see us, of course, increase that assortment with lower price points, taking a larger share of the mix, which would be our plan for this holiday as well.

And the perfect example of that could be collection, such as Mickey, which in the case of Japan, is today, still very much being rolled out through special events with key department stores in that market.

Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions.
Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon a number of important factors, including risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, control costs, successfully execute our transformation and operational efficiency initiatives and growth strategies or our ability to achieve intended benefits, cost savings and synergies from the Stuart Weitzman acquisition.
Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a complete list of risks and important factors. Please note that historical trends may not be indicative of future performance.
Also, certain financial information and metrics that will be discussed today will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items related to our transformation plan, operational efficiency plan and Stuart Weitzman acquisition-related charges as well as the impact of foreign currency fluctuations where noted. The company's sales and earnings per diluted share results have also been presented both including and excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. You may identify non-GAAP measures by the terms non-GAAP, constant currency, excluding the impact of foreign currency or excluding the additional week.

We will start with my remarks and then proceed to Jane, and we will extend time at the end for Q&A. Again, apologies for the technical difficulties. I think we're up and running here again.
Let me just first thank you, Andrea, again, and welcome, everyone, to our call. As noted in our press release, we are delighted with our strong fourth quarter performance in which we achieved positive North America comps for the first time in over 3 years and drove increases across key financial metrics.
These results capped a year where we returned the Coach brand to growth while elevating brand perception globally, thereby reaching an important milestone in the transformation journey we laid out over 2 years ago. Indeed, I could not be more pleased with and proud of our team's execution of the transformation plan over the last 2 years as we track to our goals, in spite of the significant and unanticipated volatility in tourist-spending flows as well as the range of macroeconomic, geopolitical and promotional headwinds.
In the quarter, our North American direct businesses accelerated, while we continued to implement strategic actions to elevate our positioning and streamline our distribution in the very promotional department store channel.
Our international business has continued to generate growth, highlighted by double-digit increases in Mainland China and Europe as well as sales gains in our directly operated businesses in Southeast Asia. Most importantly, we achieved the expected inflection in profitability as we leveraged our expenses and the growth in our business. Overall, our results give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will continue to drive top and bottom line growth as we enter the new fiscal year.
Looking ahead for fiscal 2017, our strategic priorities for the Coach brand include: Reenergizing our brand and category by continuing to innovate and establish our unique modern luxury positioning. We will continue the brand's elevation through a fuller expression of Coach 1941 in stores and online, while driving our men's business even further across all channels.
In addition, we will focus on raising brand awareness and relevance globally through the rollout of flagships in key fashion capitals while continuing to renovate our existing store base. And in marketing, we will continue to differentiate Coach through a combination of fashion and heritage, distorting investments to key regions and ensuring the message is relevant and increasingly aspirational for the broader market. This will include the relaunch of Coach fragrance with our partner, Interparfums, starting this fall.
And for Stuart Weitzman, we will drive our leadership position in fashion boots during the key winter selling season; continue to diversify our offering outside of boots by developing iconic styles in pumps, sandals and flats; drive global awareness and brand relevance through impactful marketing and the launch of New York and London flagships; and leverage our new leadership to bring the Stuart Weitzman brand into its next chapter of growth as a multi-category player.
Now moving to our results. During the fourth quarter, as in the preceding quarters of fiscal year '16, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing.
Most generally, we elevated our retail offering globally with the Coach 1941 assortment resonating in our retail stores and top-tier specialty stores, highlighted by iconic silhouettes, such as the Saddle Bag and Dinky, and new icons, such as the Rogue.
Also in retail, our Mickey collaboration, launched worldwide in June, was particularly well received, driving significant brand interest and buzz. We continued to transition the fleet into our modern luxury concept, driving comp improvement.
Finally, our heritage marketing campaign, focused on originality and authenticity, highlighted Coach's key competitive differences, separating us from the landscape of both legacy European luxury and American accessible brands.
We are also pleased by Stuart Weitzman's performance this quarter, which drove annual results for the brand exceeding our original estimates. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of the brand's Canadian distributor, including 14 retail stores which transitioned to direct. We also announced the appointment of Wendy Kahn as brand President and CEO, who will join Stuart Weitzman from Valentino next month, succeeding Wayne Kulkin, who will remain as a consultant supporting our corporate strategic agenda in footwear.
And just today, Stuart Weitzman announced that Giovanni Morelli, currently leather goods design director of men's and women's non-apparel categories for Loewe, will be joining the brand next May, succeeding Founder and Executive Chairman, Stuart Weitzman, who will become Chairman at that time. Giovanni will be reporting to Wendy and brings to the brand a wealth of experience in accessories and footwear design, having worked extensively at Marc Jacobs, Chloé and now Loewe. Giovanni's unique attention to detail, craft and quality with his global modern sensibility will drive the Stuart Weitzman brand's leadership in footwear design while bringing his rich and varied experience in leather luxury goods to the brand's language.
Now as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across the 3 key brand pillars of product, stores and marketing.
Starting with product, where Coach is clearly emerging as a house of modern fashion design.
During the fourth quarter, as in the first 9 months of the year, virtually all of our retail channel assortment, both men's and women's, were Stuart Vevers' designs. It was the second quarter that included Coach 1941 and emphasized our elevation strategy.
Overall, women's and retail was driven by leather goods and growth in 1941 silhouettes. In our fashion families, the Swagger comped the comp, growing in both sales and productivity and Mercer also contributed to results.
We are now focused on 2 product lines for global retail: Coach New York, our broadest assortment, which includes essentials and our fashion families; and Coach 1941, our collection runway Line, which includes our most elevated handbags as well as ready-to-wear footwear and other categories.
Given success of the collection and consumers embrace of higher price points, we expect to significantly expand it across our directly operated store network. And by holiday, all of our retail stores will offer a range of 1941 handbags.
The key retail strategies we are implementing include: The continued elevation of the assortment with a further rebalancing between essentials, fashion families and 1941; and a move from 12 to 8 deliveries in our retail channel. First, to better align with the fashion calendar, notably with higher-end specialty retail, and also to drive improved productivity in each delivery. This will allow our families to work harder for us for longer.
We are also excited to launch our women's fragrance line with Interparfums in the coming weeks and months across Coach retail stores as well as in major department stores, specialty stores and duty-free shops worldwide.
The launch will be supported by an extensive integrated marketing and communications campaign, including television spots in September, featuring Chloë Grace Moretz.
In outlet, Q4 marked the introduction of a new Stuart-designed silhouette in 2 sizes, the Harley, which is performing very well. In addition, Stuart introduced an expanded breadth of novelty prints and styles like the reversible tote and MINI Bennett. These prints clearly signaled summer and delivered strong storytelling in our stores.
Also in the fourth quarter, the consumer response to the men's product expansion to all outlet centers was exceptional. While backpacks continued to be a top performer, we were especially pleased by the performance of men's novelty prints, which underscored that our men's customer is willing to invest in fashion pieces as well as modern classics.
Looking ahead in outlet, you will also note a product and pricing architecture similar to retail. Starting with our value product, such as the reversible tote; essentials, such as Phoebe; and fashion, including collaborations and sophisticated handbags, such as Blake.
Pinnacle product also continues to be very important as our most elevated offering with the highest amounts of novelty. In FY '17, you will see some standalone disruptive outlet collaborations unique to this channel, such as Pac-Man this fall.
Finally, men's is going to be a major focus in outlet, and we expect it to be over 20% of the business by the end of the fiscal year.
On stores. We're continuing to establish our modern luxury concept globally, renovating and opening approximately 165 during the quarter, including 45 renovations and 1 new modern luxury store in our directly operated North America business. In total, we renovated and opened about 300 modern luxury locations worldwide in FY '16, taking us to just over 450 modern luxury locations globally across all channels. This is very much in line with our target to end the year with over 400 doors in the new format. Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps which exceed the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world.
We're especially excited about the ongoing positive comps we're driving in our renovated North America retail stores, including those stores that have now anniversary-ed their remodel.
Of course, transforming our stores is more than just the physical design, it's the experience our store teams provide each and every single day. I am so proud that our mystery shopper scores, our key metrics that demonstrate how well we deliver our unique modern luxury experience, surpassed 80% this quarter.
In addition, it's great to see how customers are responding to our new leather services, such as monogramming and leather conditioning with new services to be introduced throughout 2017.
In North American department stores, we renovated over 35 shop-in-shop locations to modern luxury in the fourth quarter. Finally, we have about 40 shop managers in place today and have seen a significant impact versus balance of doors.
Separately, and as noted in our release, one of our key strategic initiatives in the year ahead will be elevating the Coach brand in the North America wholesale channel. As discussed previously, through 1941, we have already started adding new locations and top-tier specialty in North America and globally.
In FY '17, we will also be rationalizing our department store distribution, taking our door count down by about 25% or by over 250 locations as well as reducing markdown allowances to the channel, given the high level of promotions.
While we understand that consumers may use department stores for trial and shopping across brands, the high level of promotional impressions created negatively impact our long-term brand health while generating confusion across channels.
As we look towards FY '17, the last year of our heavy lifting phase, we will focus on renovating the balance of our targeted store base. By year-end, modern luxury doors will, in aggregate, represent the vast majority of our traffic.
I should also note that we're very excited about our global flagship focus in FY '17: stores, which we view very much as key retail and marketing investments for the Coach brand. These flagships include our Coach House on Fifth Avenue and our Regent Street flagship, both opening in time for holiday.
We are also excited to announce our first flagship in Italy, opening in Milan by the end of the calendar year on the prestigious Via Montenapoleone.
On the marketing front, in the fourth quarter, Mickey was the big news with a range of impactful and creative executions globally, generating over 950 million impressions. The launch created substantial buzz with both the most fashion-engaged fans and Coach-lapsed customers who are -- with our messaging of cool fashion and quality glove-tanned leather.
More generally during the quarter, we remained focused on creating desire for our brand, amplifying our fashion positioning into our 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality.
In FY '17, we want to enhance brand perception and make the category exciting for her with a singular message that cuts through, Coach's unique modern luxury proposition, focusing on leather craft and Stuart's vision of Coach New York Cool, familiar Americana interpreted with a twist from New York's original house of leather design.
We will leverage the opening of Coach House on Fifth Avenue as a global anchoring moment and will amplify regionally via openings on Regent Street in London, Via Montenapoleone in Milan and China World in Beijing.
As a result of these efforts across all customer touch points, we're seeing continued progress with customers. Importantly, in our North America brand-tracking survey fielded in June, we saw strength in our overall brand affinities, while the percentage of customers who viewed Coach as ubiquitous declined versus a year ago.
So as our plans unfold and the momentum builds, we're delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty retailer and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design, defining modern luxury.
We're excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction, and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.
Turning now to a discussion on category trends. As we look ahead to FY '17, there is no doubt that the challenges that are existing today, affecting the category in specific and consumer spending in general, will persist. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain, currency crosswinds are affecting tourist flows and the recent geopolitical events and tragic terrorist attacks are negatively impacting sentiment. As a result, visibility into category growth is limited as the landscape continues to rapidly shift. This volatility was evidenced throughout FY '16 and notably in the most recent quarter as you've seen in some of the varied results already reported by several brands in our space.
Overall, we estimate that the North American premium women's handbag and accessory market grew at a low single-digit in the June quarter, resulting in slight growth for the year. And while men's growth was somewhat faster, given its relatively small penetration to the total, the premium men's and women's handbag and accessories category also grew at a low single-digit rate for the year. Coach's share of the combined market was 16% in FY '16.
While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market.
Starting with North America. As you read in our release, for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales rose 9% in our direct business, 10% on a dollar basis and 11% in constant currency.
Excluding the additional week, total North America sales rose 1%, reflecting the pullback in wholesale shipments while direct sales rose 2%, driven by the 2% increase in comparable store sales on a 13-week versus 13-week basis.
Comp trends in both retail and outlet stores accelerated while the Internet contributed approximately 1 percentage point to aggregate comp this quarter. Overall, our aggregate comp was up 2%, lead, as expected, by retail, while outlet comp was essentially flat. Higher ticket drove overall comp while very slight changes in traffic and conversion netted to a flat overall number of transactions.
We are especially pleased by the results we are seeing on coach.com, with our fashion launches and unique collaborations, such as Mickey, pointing to increased engagement with the most fashion-engaged online customers.
Most importantly, the fourth quarter marked a return to positive North America comp for the first time since the third quarter of '13, and the seventh sequential improvement since our transformation began 2 years ago, representing a 26% comp swing since the first quarter of FY '15.
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on products. The above $400 price bracket rose in penetration, saw another positive comp on a sales and unit basis and represented about 40% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year.
As planned and as discussed back in April, we deemphasized the entry price gifting assortment since coming out of holiday and, therefore, saw a decline in the $300 and below handbag price segment. 
Turning to event marketing. In FY '16, we continued to evolve and optimize our events with the goal of further reducing the number of days on promotion. Exiting this year, we are comfortable with the cadence and type of events we're hosting and don't expect a significant change in the year ahead.
Naturally, there may be some tweaks to the dates, type or duration, but the overall days should be fairly stable with our first preferred customer event for September anniversary-ing the prior year.
And now moving on to international. In the fourth quarter, international Coach brand sales rose 15% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis. For the year, Coach brand international sales increased 5% in dollars and 9% in constant currency.
As noted in our release, the additional week of sales in FY '16 added approximately $32 million to overall international segment sales. Therefore, excluding the additional week, fourth quarter sales rose 6% in dollars and 5% in constant currency, while full-year sales increased 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency.
Turning to details by geography. And please note the comments I'll make will be on a 13-week and 52-week basis. Greater China sales increased 5% in dollars in the quarter with double-digit growth and positive comparable store sales on the Mainland, offset in part by continued weakness in Hong Kong and Macau.
On a constant currency basis, sales increased 10%. For the year, sales increased 2% in dollars and 5% in constant currency to approximately $605 million, slightly ahead of our most recent guidance of approximately $600 million, despite a further devaluation in the renminbi since our last earnings call.
Notably, our constant currency sales growth for the year was consistent with our original expectations provided last August, despite the evolving macroeconomic environment and tourist-spending flows as well as sustained softness in Hong Kong and Macau.
Importantly, and despite near-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long term as the drivers we've consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever and as our China team continues to do an excellent job of building our brand equity in that market.
It's important to note that we still see the Chinese consumer as an increasing part of our total business. During the fourth quarter, our global business with the Chinese continued to grow. In addition to strong domestic spending, we experienced growth in other key destinations, including Southeast Asia. This growth was partially offset by declines in travel flows into North America and Europe, notably France, along with continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau.
In addition, and, as expected, we also saw a decline in Chinese tourist flows into Japan, impacted by currency fluctuations and the anniversary of the dramatic increase in Chinese tourists last spring.
To that end, in the fourth quarter, Japan sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis but rose 7% on a dollar basis, reflecting the stronger yen. For the year, sales rose 2% in constant currency and were essentially even with the prior year in dollars, benefiting overall from an increase in PRC tourist flows on an annual basis and the positive response to our new modern luxury positioning from Japanese consumers and tourists alike.
In Europe, our brand continues to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. Our overarching focus is to build brand awareness with both domestic consumers as well as tourists. In the fourth quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace, driven by both distribution and comparable store sales.
We experienced relative softness in France in the quarter, impacted by weak tourist traffic, as mentioned. Overall, and despite these headwinds, our sales rose 50% to $135 million in fiscal 2016 and exceeded our guidance of $125 million.
Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium women's and men's bag and accessories market.
In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales growth in the fourth quarter was solid across the entire region in local currency and rose at a low single-digit rate in dollars.
For the year, sales increased high single digits in constant currency, but declined slightly in dollars. Hereto, we remained focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives.
Finally, I would point out that we're seeing disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which, while small, are important to growing brand awareness. For the quarter, our overall sales at POS increased modestly, driven by strong growth in those distributor-operated locations focused on the domestic consumer, while travel retail was relatively weak due to the volatility of tourist-spending flows globally.
On a net sales basis, revenue was down in the quarter due to shipment timing. For the year, both POS and net sales declined slightly, as softness in travel retail offset growth in distributor-run locations targeting domestic customers.
In closing, we are encouraged with the momentum of our business and proud of the progress we've made along our transformation journey, elevating the perception of the Coach brand and Coach, Inc. as we've earned increasing acceptance as a house of modern luxury brands.
Before handing over to Jane for details of our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2017, I would like to touch on our CFO transition. First, as you know, we announced Jane Nielsen's departure in June, which will become effective later this month following the filing of our 10-K. This will be Jane's last earnings call with Coach. Jane has played an important role as a terrific partner to me and the Coach executive team as we have executed our brand transformation. I speak for the entire team in thanking her and in wishing her every success in her future.
At the same time, I could not be prouder of the bench that we have across finance, and especially the leadership role that Andrea Shaw Resnick will play as our interim CFO until we appoint a permanent successor. You all know Andrea well, she's been an important partner to me and our business in crafting and the communication of our strategies and will ensure we don't miss a beat in their execution.
I would now like to pass on to Jane. Jane?"

Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details.Please note the co",1840,"Thank you, Victor, for those kind words and for the privilege of working at this outstanding company. Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details.
Please note the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today.
We are extremely pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, as we drove increases across the key metrics of sales, operating profits and earnings. We achieved positive comps in North America while continuing to grow our business internationally, and we leveraged this growth with significant improvement in our operating margin for the quarter.
The strong fourth quarter capped a year of important financial milestones. In fiscal 2016, we generated overall top line growth for Coach, Inc., while tightly controlling our inventory. We drove a sequential improvement in our North America comps throughout the year while achieving our revenue targets for Europe and Greater China against a volatile macro backdrop.
We continued to invest in our brands while delivering our margin target for FY '16, ending the year with an operating margin of over 17%, in line with guidance of high teens, including a Coach brand gross margin slightly above prior year, excluding the impact of currency.
In addition, we successfully integrated the Stuart Weitzman business, which outperformed our original revenue and earnings per share projections for the year.
Turning now to the details. Before I begin, please note that the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively, while the same periods in fiscal 2015 included 13 and 52 weeks, respectively. The 53rd week contributed $84 million to 2016 fourth quarter and fiscal year sales, including $77 million in Coach brand revenue and $7 million associated with Stuart Weitzman. The additional week added $0.07 to earnings per share -- earnings per diluted share. The following discussion of performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 includes the 53rd week.
Focusing on Coach, Inc. Net sales totaled $1.15 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter, an increase of 15% on both a reported and constant currency basis. For the year, net sales totaled $4.49 billion, an increase of 7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis from fiscal 2015.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter totaled $783 million, an increase of 13%, while gross margin for the quarter was 67.8% compared to 69.0% last year. Gross profit for the year totaled $3.05 billion, an increase of 5%, while gross margin was 68.0% compared to 69.6% in FY '15.
SG&A expenses totaled $608 million in Q4, an increase of 7% or 52.7% of sales as compared to $566 million or 56.4% in the year ago period. For the year, SG&A expenses were $2.28 billion, an increase of 7% and represented 50.7% of sales as compared with 50.8% a year ago.
Operating income for the quarter was $175 million, an increase of 39%, while operating margin was 15.1% versus 12.6%. Operating income totaled $777 million in FY '16, a decrease of 2%, while operating margin was 17.3% versus 18.8% a year ago.
Net interest expense was $7 million in the quarter as compared to $6 million in the year ago period. Net interest expense was $27 million in FY '16 as compared to $6 million in FY '15.
Net income for the quarter totaled $126 million compared to $85 million a year ago, with earnings per diluted share of $0.45, up 47% versus prior year. Net income for the full year totaled $552 million, an increase of 4% with earnings per diluted share of $1.98, including a $0.12 contribution from Stuart Weitzman.
Now moving to global distribution. In total, we closed 11 net Coach brand locations globally in the fourth quarter to end the year with 954 directly operated locations worldwide. In addition, we finished FY '16 with 75 directly operated Stuart Weitzman stores, including 14 locations associated with the acquisition of the Canadian distributor, which closed in the fourth quarter.
Overall and consistent with our plan, our global Coach brand directly operated square footage rose low single digits for the year with North America square footage essentially even with prior year and international up mid-single digits.
In FY '17, we expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to be up low single digits globally. This guidance assumes that Coach brand directly operated square footage in North America will decline slightly with continued net store closures.
Internationally, we expect distribution growth to again be led by Europe, where we are planning another year of significant square footage growth, driven by new stores, including our flagship on Regent Street.
In Greater China, we are projecting a mid-single-digit increase in square footage, driven by net new stores openings on the Mainland, partially offset by a modest decline in units in Hong Kong and Macau.
In our directly operated businesses in Southeast Asia, we expect little change in both units and square footage, while in Japan, we are planning for additional store closures resulting in a mid-single-digit decline in square footage. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we expect 5 to 10 net new directly operated locations in FY '17.
Moving on. Inventory levels at the quarter end were $459 million compared to ending inventory of $485 million a year ago, a decrease of 5%.
Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $249 million compared to $186 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $129 million versus $111 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $120 million versus $75 million.
For the full fiscal year 2016, net cash from operating activities was $759 million compared to $937 million a year ago. Free cash flow in the fiscal year '16 was an inflow of $362 million versus $738 million in the fiscal year '15.
CapEx spending totaled $396 million for the year, including approximately $145 million of CapEx associated with the new headquarters compared to total CapEx of $199 million in FY '15.
At the end of the fiscal year, cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to $1.5 billion a year ago, and our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter.
Turning to Hudson Yards and a discussion of our capital allocation policy. Last week, we completed the sale of our interest in 10 Hudson Yards in New York City, resulting in a gain of approximately $30 million.
At the same time, we entered into a 20-year lease for the headquarter space at approximately $65 a square foot for the first 5 years. This transaction is leverage-neutral and increases the flexibility of our balance sheet, while at the same time securing a long-term lease for our company with minimal net impact to our P&L.
As planned, following the sale, we paid down approximately $300 million of our term loan with no prepayment penalty. In addition, we will receive net proceeds of approximately $125 million later this fiscal year related to the sale of our previous headquarters buildings on 34th Street. We should receive the proceeds within 45 days of vacating the buildings and, therefore, expect receipt during or by the end of the second fiscal quarter.
Overall, we are very pleased to monetize our investment in Hudson Yards, where our commitment was key to kicking off the project. Our new headquarters brings both our brands, Coach and Stuart Weitzman, together under 1 roof, in a modern workspace, very much reflective of Coach values and sensibility. The transaction was long planned for and there is no resulting change in our capital allocation policy.
Our first priority is to continue to invest in our business as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity.
Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act, if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders.
And third, capital returns. As I've stated before, we are committed to our dividend and expect our dividend to grow at least in line with the prior year's operational net income growth as our transformation gains momentum. To this end, as noted in our press release, the board declared a quarterly dividend -- cash dividend of $0.3375 per common share payable in early October, maintaining our annual rate of $1.35. Underpinning all of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively: maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets.
Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2017 on a non-GAAP 52-week versus 52-week basis. We expect total revenues for Coach, Inc. in fiscal 2017 to increase by low to mid-single digits, including the expected benefit from foreign currency of approximately 100 to 150 basis points based on current foreign exchange rates. This continues to assume a positive low-single-digit comp for the Coach brand in North America for the year.
In addition, we are initiating an operating margin forecast for Coach, Inc. of between 18.5% and 19% for fiscal 2017. This guidance incorporates the negative impact of both Stuart Weitzman and the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North America wholesale channel, including the closure of about 25% of doors and reduction in markdown allowances. Excluding this impact, Coach brand operating margin would be in the area of 20% for fiscal 2017, consistent with prior guidance.
Interest expense is expected to be in the area of $25 million for the year, which incorporates the benefit associated with the paydown of the term loan as announced. The full year fiscal 2017 tax rate is projected to be about 28%. We expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year to be in the area of 283 million.
Taken together, we are projecting double-digit growth in both net income and earnings per diluted share for the year, and we expect CapEx for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $325 million in FY '17.
In closing, we are very pleased with our progress to date. We have a clear strategy and a well-articulated implementation plan for FY '17, building on the successes we have achieved in our first 2 years of transformation.
Importantly, we expect FY '17 to be the year when we return to growth across all financials, leveraging top line growth and supported by our operational efficiency initiatives, which have allowed us to become a more nimble organization. Overall, the strength of our brands, the clarity of our vision and the dedication and proven execution capabilities of our team gives us continued confidence in our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth for Coach, Inc. over the long term.
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

And that is the case, of course, in most of our mature markets, quite different, of course, in developing markets like Europe, where we're starting with 1941, as the true first impression that these consumers have of Coach in an increasing way. In terms of how we see the balance, and we discussed in our prepared remarks the balancing of the assortment between, if you will, the essentials, fashion and 1941, we are increasing the presence of 1941 to the whole network, as I discussed. I think that during gifting periods, as has been the case in the past, you will see us, of course, increase that assortment with lower price points, taking a larger share of the mix, which would be our plan for this holiday as well. But overall, I think you're going to see us continue to see how high is high as consumers engage incredibly well with the message that we're putting out there and understand both the quality of what 1941 represents but also the fashion messaging."

In our outlet channel, we continue to drive monthly newness with monthly flows. In our full priced channel, we're moving from 12 to 8 and the reasons there are 2, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are really wanting to align much more closely with the fashion calendar as we engage increasingly with top-tier specialty and Tier 1 department stores across the world and wanting to have our launches be much more impactful as we put much more marketing muscle behind them. And the perfect example of that could be a collection such as Mickey, which in the case of Japan, is today, still very much being rolled out through special events with key department stores in that market. So it's really about having the newness, such as Rogue and other 1941 bits of the assortment play a more important role for a slightly longer period of time and, therefore, drive more efficiency.

With me today to discuss our quarterly and annual results are Victor Luis, Coach's Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Coach's CFO.
Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions.
Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon a number of important factors, including risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, control costs, successfully execute our transformation and operational efficiency initiatives and growth strategies or our ability to achieve intended benefits, cost savings and synergies from the Stuart Weitzman acquisition.
Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a complete list of risks and important factors. Please note that historical trends may not be indicative of future performance.
Also, certain financial information and metrics that will be discussed today will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items related to our transformation plan, operational efficiency plan and Stuart Weitzman acquisition-related charges as well as the impact of foreign currency fluctuations where noted. The company's sales and earnings per diluted share results have also been presented both including and excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. You may identify non-GAAP measures by the terms non-GAAP, constant currency, excluding the impact of foreign currency or excluding the additional week. The company believes that presenting these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors and others in evaluating the company's ongoing operations and financial results against historical performance and in a manner that is consistent with the management's evaluation of the business. You may find the corresponding GAAP financial information or metric as well as the related reconciliation on our website, www.coach.com/investors, and then viewing the earnings release posted today.
Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Victor Luis will provide an overall summary of our fourth fiscal quarter and full year 2016 results and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives across markets. Jane Nielsen will continue with details on financial and operational results and our outlook for FY '17.
Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session where we will be joined by Andre Cohen, President, North America and Global Marketing; and Todd Kahn, President and Chief Administrative Officer. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 A.M. We will then conclude with some brief summary remarks.

We will start with my remarks and then proceed to Jane, and we will extend time at the end for Q&A. Again, apologies for the technical difficulties. I think we're up and running here again.
Let me just first thank you, Andrea, again, and welcome, everyone, to our call. As noted in our press release, we are delighted with our strong fourth quarter performance in which we achieved positive North America comps for the first time in over 3 years and drove increases across key financial metrics.
These results capped a year where we returned the Coach brand to growth while elevating brand perception globally, thereby reaching an important milestone in the transformation journey we laid out over 2 years ago. Indeed, I could not be more pleased with and proud of our team's execution of the transformation plan over the last 2 years as we track to our goals, in spite of the significant and unanticipated volatility in tourist-spending flows as well as the range of macroeconomic, geopolitical and promotional headwinds.
In the quarter, our North American direct businesses accelerated, while we continued to implement strategic actions to elevate our positioning and streamline our distribution in the very promotional department store channel.
Our international business has continued to generate growth, highlighted by double-digit increases in Mainland China and Europe as well as sales gains in our directly operated businesses in Southeast Asia. Most importantly, we achieved the expected inflection in profitability as we leveraged our expenses and the growth in our business. Overall, our results give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will continue to drive top and bottom line growth as we enter the new fiscal year.
Looking ahead for fiscal 2017, our strategic priorities for the Coach brand include: Reenergizing our brand and category by continuing to innovate and establish our unique modern luxury positioning. We will continue the brand's elevation through a fuller expression of Coach 1941 in stores and online, while driving our men's business even further across all channels.
In addition, we will focus on raising brand awareness and relevance globally through the rollout of flagships in key fashion capitals while continuing to renovate our existing store base. And in marketing, we will continue to differentiate Coach through a combination of fashion and heritage, distorting investments to key regions and ensuring the message is relevant and increasingly aspirational for the broader market. This will include the relaunch of Coach fragrance with our partner, Interparfums, starting this fall.
And for Stuart Weitzman, we will drive our leadership position in fashion boots during the key winter selling season; continue to diversify our offering outside of boots by developing iconic styles in pumps, sandals and flats; drive global awareness and brand relevance through impactful marketing and the launch of New York and London flagships; and leverage our new leadership to bring the Stuart Weitzman brand into its next chapter of growth as a multi-category player.
Now moving to our results. During the fourth quarter, as in the preceding quarters of fiscal year '16, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing.
Most generally, we elevated our retail offering globally with the Coach 1941 assortment resonating in our retail stores and top-tier specialty stores, highlighted by iconic silhouettes, such as the Saddle Bag and Dinky, and new icons, such as the Rogue.
Also in retail, our Mickey collaboration, launched worldwide in June, was particularly well received, driving significant brand interest and buzz. We continued to transition the fleet into our modern luxury concept, driving comp improvement.
Finally, our heritage marketing campaign, focused on originality and authenticity, highlighted Coach's key competitive differences, separating us from the landscape of both legacy European luxury and American accessible brands.
We are also pleased by Stuart Weitzman's performance this quarter, which drove annual results for the brand exceeding our original estimates. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of the brand's Canadian distributor, including 14 retail stores which transitioned to direct. We also announced the appointment of Wendy Kahn as brand President and CEO, who will join Stuart Weitzman from Valentino next month, succeeding Wayne Kulkin, who will remain as a consultant supporting our corporate strategic agenda in footwear.
And just today, Stuart Weitzman announced that Giovanni Morelli, currently leather goods design director of men's and women's non-apparel categories for Loewe, will be joining the brand next May, succeeding Founder and Executive Chairman, Stuart Weitzman, who will become Chairman at that time. Giovanni will be reporting to Wendy and brings to the brand a wealth of experience in accessories and footwear design, having worked extensively at Marc Jacobs, Chloé and now Loewe. Giovanni's unique attention to detail, craft and quality with his global modern sensibility will drive the Stuart Weitzman brand's leadership in footwear design while bringing his rich and varied experience in leather luxury goods to the brand's language.
Now as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across the 3 key brand pillars of product, stores and marketing.
Starting with product, where Coach is clearly emerging as a house of modern fashion design.
During the fourth quarter, as in the first 9 months of the year, virtually all of our retail channel assortment, both men's and women's, were Stuart Vevers' designs. It was the second quarter that included Coach 1941 and emphasized our elevation strategy.
Overall, women's and retail was driven by leather goods and growth in 1941 silhouettes. In our fashion families, the Swagger comped the comp, growing in both sales and productivity and Mercer also contributed to results.
We are now focused on 2 product lines for global retail: Coach New York, our broadest assortment, which includes essentials and our fashion families; and Coach 1941, our collection runway Line, which includes our most elevated handbags as well as ready-to-wear footwear and other categories.
Given success of the collection and consumers embrace of higher price points, we expect to significantly expand it across our directly operated store network. And by holiday, all of our retail stores will offer a range of 1941 handbags.
The key retail strategies we are implementing include: The continued elevation of the assortment with a further rebalancing between essentials, fashion families and 1941; and a move from 12 to 8 deliveries in our retail channel. First, to better align with the fashion calendar, notably with higher-end specialty retail, and also to drive improved productivity in each delivery. This will allow our families to work harder for us for longer.
We are also excited to launch our women's fragrance line with Interparfums in the coming weeks and months across Coach retail stores as well as in major department stores, specialty stores and duty-free shops worldwide.
The launch will be supported by an extensive integrated marketing and communications campaign, including television spots in September, featuring Chloë Grace Moretz.
In outlet, Q4 marked the introduction of a new Stuart-designed silhouette in 2 sizes, the Harley, which is performing very well. In addition, Stuart introduced an expanded breadth of novelty prints and styles like the reversible tote and MINI Bennett. These prints clearly signaled summer and delivered strong storytelling in our stores.
Also in the fourth quarter, the consumer response to the men's product expansion to all outlet centers was exceptional. While backpacks continued to be a top performer, we were especially pleased by the performance of men's novelty prints, which underscored that our men's customer is willing to invest in fashion pieces as well as modern classics.
Looking ahead in outlet, you will also note a product and pricing architecture similar to retail. Starting with our value product, such as the reversible tote; essentials, such as Phoebe; and fashion, including collaborations and sophisticated handbags, such as Blake.
Pinnacle product also continues to be very important as our most elevated offering with the highest amounts of novelty. In FY '17, you will see some standalone disruptive outlet collaborations unique to this channel, such as Pac-Man this fall.
Finally, men's is going to be a major focus in outlet, and we expect it to be over 20% of the business by the end of the fiscal year.
On stores. We're continuing to establish our modern luxury concept globally, renovating and opening approximately 165 during the quarter, including 45 renovations and 1 new modern luxury store in our directly operated North America business. In total, we renovated and opened about 300 modern luxury locations worldwide in FY '16, taking us to just over 450 modern luxury locations globally across all channels. This is very much in line with our target to end the year with over 400 doors in the new format. Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps which exceed the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world.
We're especially excited about the ongoing positive comps we're driving in our renovated North America retail stores, including those stores that have now anniversaried their remodel.
Of course, transforming our stores is more than just the physical design, it's the experience our store teams provide each and every single day. I am so proud that our mystery shopper scores, our key metrics that demonstrate how well we deliver our unique modern luxury experience, surpassed 80% this quarter.
In addition, it's great to see how customers are responding to our new leather services, such as monogramming and leather conditioning with new services to be introduced throughout 2017.
In North American department stores, we renovated over 35 shop-in-shop locations to modern luxury in the fourth quarter. Finally, we have about 40 shop managers in place today and have seen a significant impact versus balance of doors.
Separately, and as noted in our release, one of our key strategic initiatives in the year ahead will be elevating the Coach brand in the North America wholesale channel. As discussed previously, through 1941, we have already started adding new locations and top-tier specialty in North America and globally.
In FY '17, we will also be rationalizing our department store distribution, taking our door count down by about 25% or by over 250 locations as well as reducing markdown allowances to the channel, given the high level of promotions.
While we understand that consumers may use department stores for trial and shopping across brands, the high level of promotional impressions created negatively impact our long-term brand health while generating confusion across channels.
As we look towards FY '17, the last year of our heavy lifting phase, we will focus on renovating the balance of our targeted store base. By year-end, modern luxury doors will, in aggregate, represent the vast majority of our traffic.
I should also note that we're very excited about our global flagship focus in FY '17: stores, which we view very much as key retail and marketing investments for the Coach brand. These flagships include our Coach House on Fifth Avenue and our Regent Street flagship, both opening in time for holiday.
We are also excited to announce our first flagship in Italy, opening in Milan by the end of the calendar year on the prestigious Via Montenapoleone.
On the marketing front, in the fourth quarter, Mickey was the big news with a range of impactful and creative executions globally, generating over 950 million impressions. The launch created substantial buzz with both the most fashion-engaged fans and Coach-lapsed customers who are -- with our messaging of cool fashion and quality glove-tanned leather.
More generally during the quarter, we remained focused on creating desire for our brand, amplifying our fashion positioning into our 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality.
In FY '17, we want to enhance brand perception and make the category exciting for her with a singular message that cuts through, Coach's unique modern luxury proposition, focusing on leather craft and Stuart's vision of Coach New York Cool, familiar Americana interpreted with a twist from New York's original house of leather design.
We will leverage the opening of Coach House on Fifth Avenue as a global anchoring moment and will amplify regionally via openings on Regent Street in London, Via Montenapoleone in Milan and China World in Beijing.
As a result of these efforts across all customer touch points, we're seeing continued progress with customers. Importantly, in our North America brand-tracking survey fielded in June, we saw strength in our overall brand affinities, while the percentage of customers who viewed Coach as ubiquitous declined versus a year ago.
So as our plans unfold and the momentum builds, we're delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty retailer and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design, defining modern luxury.
We're excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction, and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.
Turning now to a discussion on category trends. As we look ahead to FY '17, there is no doubt that the challenges that are existing today, affecting the category in specific and consumer spending in general, will persist. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain, currency crosswinds are affecting tourist flows and the recent geopolitical events and tragic terrorist attacks are negatively impacting sentiment. As a result, visibility into category growth is limited as the landscape continues to rapidly shift. This volatility was evidenced throughout FY '16 and notably in the most recent quarter as you've seen in some of the varied results already reported by several brands in our space.
Overall, we estimate that the North American premium women's handbag and accessory market grew at a low single-digit in the June quarter, resulting in slight growth for the year. And while men's growth was somewhat faster, given its relatively small penetration to the total, the premium men's and women's handbag and accessories category also grew at a low single-digit rate for the year. Coach's share of the combined market was 16% in FY '16.
While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market.
Starting with North America. As you read in our release, for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales rose 9% in our direct business, 10% on a dollar basis and 11% in constant currency.
Excluding the additional week, total North America sales rose 1%, reflecting the pullback in wholesale shipments while direct sales rose 2%, driven by the 2% increase in comparable store sales on a 13-week versus 13-week basis.
Comp trends in both retail and outlet stores accelerated while the Internet contributed approximately 1 percentage point to aggregate comp this quarter. Overall, our aggregate comp was up 2%, lead, as expected, by retail, while outlet comp was essentially flat. Higher ticket drove overall comp while very slight changes in traffic and conversion netted to a flat overall number of transactions.
We are especially pleased by the results we are seeing on coach.com, with our fashion launches and unique collaborations, such as Mickey, pointing to increased engagement with the most fashion-engaged online customers.
Most importantly, the fourth quarter marked a return to positive North America comp for the first time since the third quarter of '13, and the seventh sequential improvement since our transformation began 2 years ago, representing a 26% comp swing since the first quarter of FY '15.
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on products. The above $400 price bracket rose in penetration, saw another positive comp on a sales and unit basis and represented about 40% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year.
As planned and as discussed back in April, we deemphasized the entry price gifting assortment since coming out of holiday and, therefore, saw a decline in the $300 and below handbag price segment. 
Turning to event marketing. In FY '16, we continued to evolve and optimize our events with the goal of further reducing the number of days on promotion. Exiting this year, we are comfortable with the cadence and type of events we're hosting and don't expect a significant change in the year ahead.
Naturally, there may be some tweaks to the dates, type or duration, but the overall days should be fairly stable with our first preferred customer event for September anniversarying the prior year.
And now moving on to international. In the fourth quarter, international Coach brand sales rose 15% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis. For the year, Coach brand international sales increased 5% in dollars and 9% in constant currency.
As noted in our release, the additional week of sales in FY '16 added approximately $32 million to overall international segment sales. Therefore, excluding the additional week, fourth quarter sales rose 6% in dollars and 5% in constant currency, while full-year sales increased 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency.
Turning to details by geography. And please note the comments I'll make will be on a 13-week and 52-week basis. Greater China sales increased 5% in dollars in the quarter with double-digit growth and positive comparable store sales on the Mainland, offset in part by continued weakness in Hong Kong and Macau.
On a constant currency basis, sales increased 10%. For the year, sales increased 2% in dollars and 5% in constant currency to approximately $605 million, slightly ahead of our most recent guidance of approximately $600 million, despite a further devaluation in the renminbi since our last earnings call.
Notably, our constant currency sales growth for the year was consistent with our original expectations provided last August, despite the evolving macroeconomic environment and tourist-spending flows as well as sustained softness in Hong Kong and Macau.
Importantly, and despite near-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long term as the drivers we've consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever and as our China team continues to do an excellent job of building our brand equity in that market.
It's important to note that we still see the Chinese consumer as an increasing part of our total business. During the fourth quarter, our global business with the Chinese continued to grow. In addition to strong domestic spending, we experienced growth in other key destinations, including Southeast Asia. This growth was partially offset by declines in travel flows into North America and Europe, notably France, along with continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau.
In addition, and, as expected, we also saw a decline in Chinese tourist flows into Japan, impacted by currency fluctuations and the anniversary of the dramatic increase in Chinese tourists last spring.
To that end, in the fourth quarter, Japan sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis but rose 7% on a dollar basis, reflecting the stronger yen. For the year, sales rose 2% in constant currency and were essentially even with the prior year in dollars, benefiting overall from an increase in PRC tourist flows on an annual basis and the positive response to our new modern luxury positioning from Japanese consumers and tourists alike.
In Europe, our brand continues to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. Our overarching focus is to build brand awareness with both domestic consumers as well as tourists. In the fourth quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace, driven by both distribution and comparable store sales.
We experienced relative softness in France in the quarter, impacted by weak tourist traffic, as mentioned. Overall, and despite these headwinds, our sales rose 50% to $135 million in fiscal 2016 and exceeded our guidance of $125 million.
Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium women's and men's bag and accessories market.
In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales growth in the fourth quarter was solid across the entire region in local currency and rose at a low single-digit rate in dollars.
For the year, sales increased high single digits in constant currency, but declined slightly in dollars. Hereto, we remained focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives.
Finally, I would point out that we're seeing disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which, while small, are important to growing brand awareness. For the quarter, our overall sales at POS increased modestly, driven by strong growth in those distributor-operated locations focused on the domestic consumer, while travel retail was relatively weak due to the volatility of tourist-spending flows globally.
On a net sales basis, revenue was down in the quarter due to shipment timing. For the year, both POS and net sales declined slightly, as softness in travel retail offset growth in distributor-run locations targeting domestic customers.
In closing, we are encouraged with the momentum of our business and proud of the progress we've made along our transformation journey, elevating the perception of the Coach brand and Coach, Inc. as we've earned increasing acceptance as a house of modern luxury brands.
Before handing over to Jane for details of our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2017, I would like to touch on our CFO transition. First, as you know, we announced Jane Nielsen's departure in June, which will become effective later this month following the filing of our 10-K. This will be Jane's last earnings call with Coach. Jane has played an important role as a terrific partner to me and the Coach executive team as we have executed our brand transformation. I speak for the entire team in thanking her and in wishing her every success in her future.
At the same time, I could not be prouder of the bench that we have across finance, and especially the leadership role that Andrea Shaw Resnick will play as our interim CFO until we appoint a permanent successor. You all know Andrea well, she's been an important partner to me and our business in crafting and the communication of our strategies and will ensure we don't miss a beat in their execution.
I would now like to pass on to Jane. Jane?"

Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details.
Please note the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today.
We are extremely pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, as we drove increases across the key metrics of sales, operating profits and earnings. We achieved positive comps in North America while continuing to grow our business internationally, and we leveraged this growth with significant improvement in our operating margin for the quarter.
The strong fourth quarter capped a year of important financial milestones. In fiscal 2016, we generated overall top line growth for Coach, Inc., while tightly controlling our inventory. We drove a sequential improvement in our North America comps throughout the year while achieving our revenue targets for Europe and Greater China against a volatile macro backdrop.
We continued to invest in our brands while delivering our margin target for FY '16, ending the year with an operating margin of over 17%, in line with guidance of high teens, including a Coach brand gross margin slightly above prior year, excluding the impact of currency.
In addition, we successfully integrated the Stuart Weitzman business, which outperformed our original revenue and earnings per share projections for the year.
Turning now to the details. Before I begin, please note that the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively, while the same periods in fiscal 2015 included 13 and 52 weeks, respectively. The 53rd week contributed $84 million to 2016 fourth quarter and fiscal year sales, including $77 million in Coach brand revenue and $7 million associated with Stuart Weitzman. The additional week added $0.07 to earnings per share -- earnings per diluted share. The following discussion of performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 includes the 53rd week.
Focusing on Coach, Inc. Net sales totaled $1.15 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter, an increase of 15% on both a reported and constant currency basis. For the year, net sales totaled $4.49 billion, an increase of 7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis from fiscal 2015.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter totaled $783 million, an increase of 13%, while gross margin for the quarter was 67.8% compared to 69.0% last year. Gross profit for the year totaled $3.05 billion, an increase of 5%, while gross margin was 68.0% compared to 69.6% in FY '15.
SG&A expenses totaled $608 million in Q4, an increase of 7% or 52.7% of sales as compared to $566 million or 56.4% in the year ago period. For the year, SG&A expenses were $2.28 billion, an increase of 7% and represented 50.7% of sales as compared with 50.8% a year ago.
Operating income for the quarter was $175 million, an increase of 39%, while operating margin was 15.1% versus 12.6%. Operating income totaled $777 million in FY '16, a decrease of 2%, while operating margin was 17.3% versus 18.8% a year ago.
Net interest expense was $7 million in the quarter as compared to $6 million in the year ago period. Net interest expense was $27 million in FY '16 as compared to $6 million in FY '15.
Net income for the quarter totaled $126 million compared to $85 million a year ago, with earnings per diluted share of $0.45, up 47% versus prior year. Net income for the full year totaled $552 million, an increase of 4% with earnings per diluted share of $1.98, including a $0.12 contribution from Stuart Weitzman.
Now moving to global distribution. In total, we closed 11 net Coach brand locations globally in the fourth quarter to end the year with 954 directly operated locations worldwide. In addition, we finished FY '16 with 75 directly operated Stuart Weitzman stores, including 14 locations associated with the acquisition of the Canadian distributor, which closed in the fourth quarter.
Overall and consistent with our plan, our global Coach brand directly operated square footage rose low single digits for the year with North America square footage essentially even with prior year and international up mid-single digits.
In FY '17, we expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to be up low single digits globally. This guidance assumes that Coach brand directly operated square footage in North America will decline slightly with continued net store closures.
Internationally, we expect distribution growth to again be led by Europe, where we are planning another year of significant square footage growth, driven by new stores, including our flagship on Regent Street.
In Greater China, we are projecting a mid-single-digit increase in square footage, driven by net new stores openings on the Mainland, partially offset by a modest decline in units in Hong Kong and Macau.
In our directly operated businesses in Southeast Asia, we expect little change in both units and square footage, while in Japan, we are planning for additional store closures resulting in a mid-single-digit decline in square footage. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we expect 5 to 10 net new directly operated locations in FY '17.
Moving on. Inventory levels at the quarter end were $459 million compared to ending inventory of $485 million a year ago, a decrease of 5%.
Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $249 million compared to $186 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $129 million versus $111 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $120 million versus $75 million.
For the full fiscal year 2016, net cash from operating activities was $759 million compared to $937 million a year ago. Free cash flow in the fiscal year '16 was an inflow of $362 million versus $738 million in the fiscal year '15.
CapEx spending totaled $396 million for the year, including approximately $145 million of CapEx associated with the new headquarters compared to total CapEx of $199 million in FY '15.
At the end of the fiscal year, cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to $1.5 billion a year ago, and our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter.
Turning to Hudson Yards and a discussion of our capital allocation policy. Last week, we completed the sale of our interest in 10 Hudson Yards in New York City, resulting in a gain of approximately $30 million.
At the same time, we entered into a 20-year lease for the headquarter space at approximately $65 a square foot for the first 5 years. This transaction is leverage-neutral and increases the flexibility of our balance sheet, while at the same time securing a long-term lease for our company with minimal net impact to our P&L.
As planned, following the sale, we paid down approximately $300 million of our term loan with no prepayment penalty. In addition, we will receive net proceeds of approximately $125 million later this fiscal year related to the sale of our previous headquarters buildings on 34th Street. We should receive the proceeds within 45 days of vacating the buildings and, therefore, expect receipt during or by the end of the second fiscal quarter.
Overall, we are very pleased to monetize our investment in Hudson Yards, where our commitment was key to kicking off the project. Our new headquarters brings both our brands, Coach and Stuart Weitzman, together under 1 roof, in a modern workspace, very much reflective of Coach values and sensibility. The transaction was long planned for and there is no resulting change in our capital allocation policy.
Our first priority is to continue to invest in our business as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity.
Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act, if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders.
And third, capital returns. As I've stated before, we are committed to our dividend and expect our dividend to grow at least in line with the prior year's operational net income growth as our transformation gains momentum. To this end, as noted in our press release, the board declared a quarterly dividend -- cash dividend of $0.3375 per common share payable in early October, maintaining our annual rate of $1.35. Underpinning all of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively: maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets.
Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2017 on a non-GAAP 52-week versus 52-week basis. We expect total revenues for Coach, Inc. in fiscal 2017 to increase by low to mid-single digits, including the expected benefit from foreign currency of approximately 100 to 150 basis points based on current foreign exchange rates. This continues to assume a positive low-single-digit comp for the Coach brand in North America for the year.
In addition, we are initiating an operating margin forecast for Coach, Inc. of between 18.5% and 19% for fiscal 2017. This guidance incorporates the negative impact of both Stuart Weitzman and the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North America wholesale channel, including the closure of about 25% of doors and reduction in markdown allowances. Excluding this impact, Coach brand operating margin would be in the area of 20% for fiscal 2017, consistent with prior guidance.
Interest expense is expected to be in the area of $25 million for the year, which incorporates the benefit associated with the paydown of the term loan as announced. The full year fiscal 2017 tax rate is projected to be about 28%. We expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year to be in the area of 283 million.
Taken together, we are projecting double-digit growth in both net income and earnings per diluted share for the year, and we expect CapEx for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $325 million in FY '17.
In closing, we are very pleased with our progress to date. We have a clear strategy and a well-articulated implementation plan for FY '17, building on the successes we have achieved in our first 2 years of transformation.
Importantly, we expect FY '17 to be the year when we return to growth across all financials, leveraging top line growth and supported by our operational efficiency initiatives, which have allowed us to become a more nimble organization. Overall, the strength of our brands, the clarity of our vision and the dedication and proven execution capabilities of our team gives us continued confidence in our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth for Coach, Inc. over the long term.
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

We're seeing, I think, as we mentioned earlier, really a much more fashion-engaged consumer engaged with the web, particularly when we've got more elevated product, novelty and some of these collaborations like we saw with Mickey. We see that business continuing to grow in line with the balance of Coach going forward at least in line, I'd say."

In our outlet channel, we continue to drive monthly newness with monthly flows. In our full priced channel, we're moving from 12 to 8 and the reasons there are 2, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are really wanting to align much more closely with the fashion calendar as we engage increasingly with top-tier specialty and Tier 1 department stores across the world and wanting to have our launches be much more impactful as we put much more marketing muscle behind them. And the perfect example of that could be a collection such as Mickey, which in the case of Japan, is today, still very much being rolled out through special events with key department stores in that market. So it's really about having the newness, such as Rogue and other 1941 bits of the assortment play a more important role for a slightly longer period of time and, therefore, drive more efficiency.

And so we're basically exiting, one, low-volume doors. So doors that are below a certain threshold of volume and where we are no longer seeing a Coach consumer shopping. And second, it's a channel that's become very promotional over the last few quarters, as you know, and we have decided that we no longer support markdown allowances to the level we did in the past.

As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter, highlighted by continued positive comparable store sales in North America and growth internationally, includ",1855,"Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter, highlighted by continued positive comparable store sales in North America and growth internationally, including double-digit increases in mainland China and Europe as well as sales gains in our directly operated businesses across Asia outside of greater China and Japan. We remained focused on elevating the Coach brand to a compelling product, differentiated store environment and promotional marketing. At the same time, we implemented the strategic actions necessary to reposition the brand and streamline our distribution in our promotional North American department store channel. Despite this deliberate pullback, we achieved growth across key financials, including sales, gross profit and operating income as well as double-digit earnings growth. Overall, our results give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will drive top and bottom line growth for our guidance for the fiscal year. As we've outlined previously, for fiscal 2017, our 4 strategic priorities for the Coach brand include: Reenergize our brand in the category by continuing to innovate and establish our unique modern luxury proposition, continue the brand's elevation to a fuller expression of Coach 1941 in stores and online while driving our men's business even further across all channels; focus on raising brand awareness and relevance globally through the rollout of flagships in key fashion capitals while continuing to renovate our existing store base; and differentiate Coach through a combination of fashion and heritage marketing campaigns, distorting investments to key regions and ensuring the message is relevant and increasingly aspirational to the broader market. This included the relaunch of Coach Fragrance with our partner [indiscernible] in September. 
And for Stuart Weitzman, we will drive our leadership position in fashion boots during the key winter selling season, augment our leadership in boots by developing iconic styles in pumps, sandals and flats while also laying the foundation for the relaunch of the brand's handbag assortment; drive global awareness and brand relevance to impactful marketing; and the launch of New York and London flagships during the holiday quarter; leverage new leadership, both under management and creative side to bring the Stuart Weitzman brand into its next chapter of growth as a multi-category player.
Now moving to our results. During the first quarter, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Most generally, we continue to elevate our retail offering globally with the Coach 1941 assortment resonating in our own stores as well as top-tier specialty and department store accounts. Of course, we continue to transition more of our fleet into the modern luxury concept driving comp improvement. 
Finally, our fall campaign photographed by Steven , featured actress Chloë Grace Moretz against the backdrop of New York, beautifully capturing the spirit and energy of the city. We also ran our first ever TV commercial for the launch of the new Coach Fragrance together with our partner [indiscernible]. 
At Stuart Weitzman, we're driving global awareness and brand relevance, gaining traction with the important international and millennial consumer. During the quarter, we continued to drive key investments in management and creative talent as well as infrastructure to support the long-term multi-category growth. Wendy Khan, officially joined us brand President and CEO in September; and we also hired a lead footwear designer, Daniela McEntee, who starts this week and will report to Executive Creative Director, Giovanni Marelli, upon his arrival this spring. While brand sales were essentially even with the prior year this quarter, primarily due to shipment timing and repositioning of our U.K. business ahead of the opening of our first retail store on Regent Street, we continue to expect a double-digit sales increase in fiscal year '17. Indeed, we are extremely pleased by our performance in the early fall/winter season as our strength in boots gains momentum across channels and geographies. 
Now as has been our practice since we implemented our transformation strategy more than 2 years ago, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to drive relevance across the 3 Coach brand pillars of product, stores and marketing. Starting with product, where Coach has emerged as a house of modern fashion design. The key retail strategies we are implementing include: the continued elevation of the assortment with the further rebalancing between Coach New York and 1941; and the move from 12 to 8 in our retail channel, first to better align with the fashion calendar, notably with the higher-end specialty retail, and also to drive improve productivity as we align deliveries with seasonal marketing. 
During the quarter, our women's retail performance was driven by leather goods and growth in 1941 silhouettes. The Rogue, saddle bag and Dinky as well as the novelty and varsity patch platforms. Also during the quarter, we introduced the drifter family and the smaller version of Mercer. Nikki, which had successfully launched late in FY '16, built into early Q1, before selling through in most silhouettes. 
In outlet, men's continued to be a major focus for the business and is on plan to be over 20% of the channel by the end of the fiscal year. New style launches in outlet during the first quarter included the Tyler tote, the Charlie backpack and the mini-Charlie. Signature and leather exotic mixed platforms and dressy silhouettes were well received, and we had a strong customer response to seasonal neutrals.
On stores. We're continuing to establish our modern luxury concept globally, renovating and opening 40 locations during the quarter, including 3 renovations in our directly operated North America business, taking us to nearly 500 modern luxury locations globally across all channels. This is very much in line with our targets to end the year with over 700 doors into new format, representing the vast majority of our traffic. Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps, which exceeds the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. Of course, transforming our stores is more than just the physical design. It's the consumer experience our store teams provide each and every single day. I'm delighted that our mystery shopper scores are key metrics that demonstrate how we will deliver our unique modern luxury experience, was up again in Q1 at over 80% this quarter as compared to 70% when we started tracking them 1 year ago. 
In addition, it's great to see how clients are responding to our new leather services such as monogramming and leather conditioning with new services to be introduced throughout 2017. Across the global fleet, there were 17 craftsmanship bars installed as of the end of the quarter. We also just launched Coach Journey, an online multilanguage learning platform, which is globally scalable. It is designed to engage and develop our store associates into knowledgeable modern luxury brand ambassadors through a robust development program and monthly product, service and styling skill training. In our 75th year, we are very excited about our global flagship focus. We view these stores very much as key retail and marketing investments for the Coach brand. These flagships include our Coach houses on Fifth Avenue and New York City; and Regent Street in London, both opening this month, in time for the important holiday season. We will also open our first flagship in Milan, Italy by the end of the fiscal year on the prestigious, The Amonte Napoleonic. In North American department stores, where we are repositioning the brand, we did not do any renovations this quarter. We did continue to implement our shop manager program and see a significant impact versus balance of doors in key accounts. As noted on our August call, one of our strategic initiatives this year is elevating the Coach brand in the North America wholesale channel. As discussed previously, 2 1941, we have already adding new locations in top-tier specialty retail stores in North America and globally. We are now also in the process of rationalizing our North American department stores distribution, taking our door count down by about 25% or by over 250 locations over the fiscal year as well as reducing promotional events in the channel. 
In the first quarter, we closed the first group of these locations, about 120, and expect to close the remainder in our third quarter this upcoming spring season.
On the marketing front, the quarter kicked off with the successful launch of our Nikki collaboration. we were also thrilled about the reaction to our third ever 1941 runaway show this past September, which garnered positive editorial feedback while generating close to 1 billion impressions globally. More generally, during the quarter, we remained focused on creating desire for our brand, amplifying our fashion positioning and our 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality. 
This year, we want to enhance brand perception and make the category exciting for consumers with a singular message that cuts through: Coach's unique modern luxury proposition, focusing on that aircraft and stalwarts vision for Coach New York Cool. It's a New York American culture interpreted with a twist, which was from New York's original house of leather design.
As a result of these efforts across customer touch points, we are seeing continued progress with consumers. Importantly, in our North America brand tracking survey fielded in September, Coach's perception of positive brand momentum increased among category drivers versus a quarter ago, while our brand affinities were strong with consumers overall. In addition, category drivers view of the Coach brand as original increased versus 1 quarter ago, reflective of our product and marketing strategies. We are delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty leather and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design, defining modern luxury. We are excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction, and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward. 
Turning now to a discussion of category trends. As we look ahead to the balance of fiscal year '17, there is no doubt that the challenges that exist today affecting the category specific and consumer spending in general will persist. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain. Currency crosswinds continue to affect tourist flows, and geopolitical events are negatively impacting sentiment. As a result, the visibility into the category growth remains limited as the landscape continues to rapidly shift. This volatility was evidenced throughout FY '16 and in the most recent quarter. Overall, we estimate that the North American premium men's and women's bag and accessories market was flat to up low single digits in the September quarter, which we believe has been impacted by negative trends in the U.S. department store space. While Andre will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. So I'll turn over to Andre for a discussion of North America. Andre?"

Important",781,"Thanks, Victor. As you read in our release, for the quarter, total North American Coach brand sales decreased 3% on both the reported and constant currency basis, reflecting our deliberate department store pull back while direct sales were flat. Importantly, the September quarter marked a continuation of positive comps in North American. Our bricks-and-mortar comps rose approximately 4% in the quarter, driven by ticket and conversion while traffic was down modestly. Overall, our aggregate comp was up approximately 2%, with e-commerce, notably low U.S. flash sales, impacting results. Generally, our coach.com retail side demand is similar to our retail stores. For most of the category, the dot com channel is overwhelmingly a promotional one, with most of our competitors have perpetual sale shops available. As you are aware, we have a clear strategic direction to limit our promotional stance online, given the negative impact on long-term brand health. Finally, our business to international tourists in our stores rose during Q1, with declines in Chinese tourist traffic more than offset by other nationalities, notably Japanese and Korean visitors.
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product. We continue to drive brand elevation with the above $400 price brackets rising in penetration to over 50% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year and generating another positive comp on the sales and unit basis. This drove handbag AURs to over $300.
Turning to event marketing. As noted in the last call, we came out of FY '16 comfortable with the cadence and type of advance we've hosted. We held a preferred customer event for September, anniversary-ing the prior year, that's slightly shorter duration and excluded 1941 products, and we'll hold a Black Friday event followed by our semiannual winter sale in December.
Looking ahead, our goal is to be the destination for gifting with a compelling assortment and broad offering across price points. We'll incorporate fashion elements such as studs and hologram platforms with a strong note to our archives, featuring  glove hand leather across all categories for both men's and women's, creating an emotional and compelling offering for the season.
Specifically in retail, we will: one, continue elevation strategy with further animations of growth; two, establish Coach as a year-round gifting destination; three, continue to leverage our unique leather craft, which is exemplified by application quilting in our Coach New York offering and through the use of distinctive materials and techniques such as embroidery and beading in our 1941 collection; and finally, launch several major new platforms, including our iconic 1941 duffel, reinvented with increased functionality, and Brooklyn, a reimagined carryall with increased optionality, addressing the business bag opportunity.
As we move into holiday. In North America outlet, we'll accelerate our strategy to drive more innovation and emotion in the channel through limited editions, collaborations and the launch of new silhouettes and platforms. We're also focused on continuing to grow the men's category, and we'll celebrate our first holiday season with men's available in all of our outlet centers. In October, we kicked off the second quarter with a new agenda limited edition Pac-Man collection in all our North American outlet doors. This was our first collaboration strictly for the channel, and we've been extremely pleased with the results. Building on the success of introduction of Tyler, we're continuing to launch new silhouettes like the central satchel and City Zip Tote. 
For holiday, outlet launches have bold expression of 5 key prints and a wide array of metallics across multiple categories, gift sets and novelty items continue to be big drivers for the season. And for Black Friday, we launched another jewel agenda limited-edition leather bear collection in all our doors. We've seen great success with the destructive playful moments in our stores, both in bags and in novelty categories. We'll be supporting these holiday initiatives and expressing the playfulness of the season in our advertising. The holiday campaign is all about our Coach dinosaur, Rex E. Buzz has been building around it for months, beginning with London collection men's in January by celebrity dressing and the collaboration with Colette. Building on this excitement, this week, we're launching a global Rex E campaign with a video where she comes to life in the workshop, linking this character to our heritage of leather crafts. The campaign continues with our celebrity friends amplifying Rex E and our emotional heritage gifting assortment across multiple platforms, including digital and social media.
In summary, we're encouraged by our performance and excited for holiday. We believe that our initiatives across the brand pillars will continue to drive positive traction in North America. And now, turning it back to Victor for international."

As noted in our release, in the first quarter, international Coach brand sales rose 7% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis. By geography, Greater China sales were essentially even with prior year in dollars in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 5%, driven by double-digit growth and positive comparable store sales in the Mainland, offset in part by continued weakness in Hong Kong and Macau. In Japan, sales rose 11% on a reported basis, benefiting from the stronger dollar while constant currency sales decreased 7%, impacted by a decline in Chinese tourists spend as we lap last year's dramatic increase.
In Europe, our sales grew at a double-digit pace in the quarter, driven by new distribution and positive double-digit comps, excluding Paris, where our business continues to be impacted by weak tourist traffic. Post the Brexit vote, we've actually seen very strong results in the U.K., benefiting from the currency weakness and increased traction with the local consumer. In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales rose low single-digit in dollars and in constant currency.
Finally, I would point out that we're continuing to see disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which while small, are important to growing brand awareness. For the quarter, our overall sales at POS increased modestly, driven by strong domestic performance, offset in part by relatively weaker tourist location results. On a net sales basis, revenue also increased over the prior year. Now I will turn it over to Andrea for details in our financial results and guidance for the year ahead. Andrea?"
526573,407109983,1068004,"Coach, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first fiscal quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal year '17. Please note, th",1542,"Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first fiscal quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal year '17. Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on the website today.
We're pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, which marks continued progress against our transformation plan and momentum in our business. Our sales increased over the prior year, driven by positive comps in North America and continued growth internationally and despite the strategic repositioning of the Coach brand and the promotional North American wholesale channel. 
Operating margin expanded significantly over prior year once again this quarter, fueled by higher gross margin while we continue to invest in our brand. Taken together, we generated double-digit growth in net income and earnings per share, and our balance sheet remains extremely healthy with a clean inventory position and sufficient cash to support our strategic initiatives while returning capital to shareholders through our dividend.
Now turning to the details. Coach, Inc. net sales totaled $1.04 billion for the first fiscal quarter, an increase of 1% on a reported basis and a decrease of 1% on a constant currency basis, including approximately 150 bps of pressure related to the company's strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North American wholesale channel. Coach brand sales increased 1%, including positive North America comp store sales and continued international growth, as Victor and Andre had discussed. Stuart Weitzman's brand sales were essentially even with prior year in Q1, impacted by wholesale shipment timing. To this end, and as expected, second quarter-to-date, Stuart Weitzman brand sales are up double digits. Total gross profit totaled $715 million, an increase of 3% versus prior year while gross margin increased 120 basis points to 68.9%. Coach brand gross profit increased 3% while gross margin increased 120 basis points over prior year to 69.8%, which included about 40 basis points of pressure from currency. 
By segment, total North America gross margin increased over prior year, including our directly operated business were both gross profit dollars and gross profit rate grew over prior year. International segment gross margin increased over prior year excluding the negative impact of currency. Stuart Weitzman gross profit rose 2% while gross margin increased approximately 100 basis points over prior year. Total SG&A expenses increased 1% and approximately in line with sales to $538 million, and represented 51.9% of sales as compared to 51.7% in the year-ago period. 
Coach brand SG&A expenses decreased 1% and represented 51.9% of sales compared to 52.7% in the year-ago period, an improvement of 80 basis points. Stuart Weitzman brand's SG&A expenses were $45 million compared to $36 million a year ago due to store occupancy costs and the timing of marketing expenses as well as the company's strategic investments in team and infrastructure. Coach, Inc. operating income rose 7% to $177 million while operating margin increased 100 basis points over prior year to 17% even. Coach brand operating income increased 13% while operating margin increased 200 basis points over prior year to 17.9%. 
Stuart Weitzman brand operating income of $7 million was down versus prior year based on the timing of net shipments as well as key investments to support long-term multicategory growth as discussed.
Net interest expense was $6 million in the quarter as compared to $7 million in the year-ago period. Total net income for the quarter was $126 million compared to $113 million a year ago, with earnings per diluted share of $0.45, up $0.10 versus prior year. 
Now moving to global dissolution. In total, we closed a net of 2 Coach brand locations globally in the first quarter to end the period with 952 directly operated locations worldwide. In addition, we opened 2 net Stuart Weitzman directly operated stores to end the quarter with 77 locations. 
In FY '17, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to grow low single digits globally. This guidance assumes that Coach brand directly operated square footage in North America will decline slightly with net store closures in both our retail and outlet channels. Internationally, we expect a mid-single-digit increase in square footage led by significant growth in Europe and a mid-single digit increase in Mainland China, partially offset by a high single-digit square footage decline in Japan as well as a modest unit decrease in Hong Kong and Macau. 
In our other directly operated business in Asia, we expect little change in both units and square footage. 
Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we expect to open 5 to 10 net new directly operated locations in fiscal year '17. 
Moving on, inventory levels at quarter end were $547 million compared to ending inventory of $575 million a year ago, a decrease of 5%. Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was an outflow of $38 million compared to an inflow of $8 million last year. Our CapEx spending was $68 million in Q1 versus $69 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an outflow of $106 million versus an outflow of $61 million in the same period last year. 
During the quarter, we received approximately $675 million in net proceeds associated with the sale-leaseback of the [indiscernible] building. And as announced, we used a portion of these proceeds to pay down our term loan of approximately $300 million with no prepayment penalty. As such, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $600 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter compared to approximately $900 million a year ago. At the end of the fiscal quarter, cash and short-term investments stood at $1.5 billion as compared to $1.3 billion a year ago. As a reminder, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $125 million during this fiscal quarter related to the sale of our previous headquarters building on 34th Street.
Turning to our capital allocation policy, which has not changed. Our first priority is to continue to invest in our brands as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation. And we're putting our capital against this opportunity. Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when if it's the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders. And third, capital returns. We're committed for dividends and expect their dividends grow at least in line with prior year's operational net income growth as our transformation gains momentum. As always, underpinning all of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital market.
Now turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2017 on a non-GAAP 52-week versus 52-week basis, which has not changed. So I'll be brief. We still expect total revenues for Coach Inc. in fiscal 2017 to increase by low- to mid-single digits, including unexpected benefit from foreign currency of approximately 100 to 150 basis points based on current exchange rates. This continues to assume a positive low single-digit comp for the Coach brand in North America for the year and in each quarter. As a reminder, we would expect Stuart Weitzman top line variability quarter-to-quarter given the nature of the business and its high penetration of wholesale. In addition, we are maintaining our operating margin forecast for Coach, Inc. of between 18.5% and 19% for fiscal 2017. This guidance incorporates the negative impact of both Stuart Weitzman and the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North American wholesale channel. As in the side, for you modelers out there, you should note that our 2Q will likely include SG&A dollars growth ahead of sales due to the timing of our 75th anniversary celebrations, notably marketing activities surrounding the opening of Fifth Avenue and Regent Street. We continue to expect interest expense to be in the area of $25 million for the year. The full year fiscal 2017 tax rate is still projected at about 28%. And we expect our average weighted diluted shares outstanding for the year to be in the area of 283 million. 
Taken together, we are projecting double-digit growth in both net income and earnings per diluted share for the year. And we continue to expect CapEx for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $325 million in FY '17.
In closing, we're very pleased with our performance in the quarter and the consistency of our execution against a volatile backdrop building on the successes we have achieved in our first 2 years of transformation. Importantly, we continue to expect fiscal '17 to be the year when we return to growth across all financials, leveraging top line growth and supported by our operational efficiency initiatives, which we have allowed -- which have allowed us to become a more nimble organization. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth for Coach, Inc.'s over the long-term. I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

In retail, the impact is from broader distribution of Coach 1941 that we've been working on over the last couple of quarters, especially, of course, the continued rollout of our store concept as well as the great work being done by our sales associates with the enhanced service experience. In outlets, as we look to engage with the broader consumer, really proud with the level of innovation. And as the team has been leveraging a lot of inspiration, both for our retail stores. And as we mentioned, even a few very specific outlets, specific innovations such as Pac-Man, which has gotten us all in a very good start earlier this quarter. And could have been more excited with the level of innovation that we have, actually, especially in the back half of this year. In terms of your question, online, Bob.

So when you look at gross margin in the quarter for overall, the Coach brand there were a couple of areas of benefit and a couple of areas of hit. So starting off in channel mix. Channel mix was a positive in the quarter to us. Product mix and costs were actually a very large positive, which we, in turn, return to consumers in terms of pricing and value. Not a complete offset but a partial offset there. And then in terms of the currency impact. Currency was a negative impact in the quarter when we talked to about 40 basis points. Interestingly, there was an impact of the yen, and that's really about OCI and the yen hedge loss position in the quarter as well as the negative impact on other Asian currencies and on the R&D in terms of the China currency impact. For North America specifically, North America, gross margin improved in the quarter for the same reasons that I discussed. I'm sure one of the things you're interested in specifically are our outlet North America stores. Gross margin was actually up in the quarter. So glad that we were able to take the benefit of lower cost. And as I said, return some but not all of that to the consumer. We did have a small hit in North America from currency. And our guidance for the year does bake out -- bake in this continued benefit from both AUC, or average unit cost, as well as an overall impact returning that to the North America retail and outlet consumer in terms of pricing. So a nice balance there as we move through the year."

Obviously very, very hard to predict as we know the geopolitical impacts most recently, whether it be terrorist attacks or where those happen and the impact that can have are almost impossible to predict. They do lead mostly to, of course, shifts in terrorist flows, especially as well in some markets as well. Even short-term to medium-term impacts on domestic demand. The biggest impact that we have seen outside of those short-term geopolitical have been mostly currency swings. There's been a lot of talk, of course, about the Chinese tourists where there's increasing or decreasing. We've seen with the appreciation of the Japanese yen decreases in tourists spending in Japan. We've seen pickups in Korea. And of course, we have seen pretty strong drop off in Mainland Europe, especially in Paris, which is a very important destination. 
In terms of the categories, we have just, obviously, with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman, made a bigger bet on footwear. We're excited about the long-term opportunity in that category for us. A $28 billion opportunity. But generally, into the medium and long-term, we continue to believe there is no better space to be in fashion than in handbag and accessory space. We're excited about that as an opportunity, of course. Not only in developed markets here in our home market, the U.Sl., Europe, which is really a greenfield opportunity for us. I cannot be more excited about the team that we have on the ground there and the great work they're seeing. We're beginning to see decent traction now, especially with the U.K. domestic consumer.

I'm incredibly excited about the new talents that we recruited to that brand, both the CEO, Wendy Kahn; the Creative Director, Giovanni Marelli, who joins us this spring. And as we announced today, Daniela McKenney, who joins us as the lead shoe designer reporting into Giovanni. More broadly, in terms of our capital allocation strategy and what could come next, we've been very consistent. We have a tremendous amount of work and opportunity within the Coach brand and the Stuart Weitzman brand. That is our first priority. Our second priority, as you've suggested, is to look at value-additive acquisitions. Of course, we're going to be very selective in acquisitions that allow us to build platforms for long-term growth that allow us to leverage our global infrastructure and organizational capabilities and our skill sets, which is obviously building brands and retail management and a terrific supply chain in our core space. Most importantly, we'll look for great brands. We're not as committed to any specific nationality. So I would keep that in mind.
And the second? I'm just being reminded in term of physical stores in service, I couldn't be -- as I mentioned in my response to Bob's question, happier with what the teams are doing across both retail channels. As you've seen we've driven a positive 4 comp, nearly in our bricks-and-mortar stores. I believe that it's not 1 specific channel or 1 specific action, Oliver, that leads to the positive results. It's about a total brand experience. We're committed to being very active digitally and engaging with the millennial and, indeed, with the broader consumer that's increasingly engaging online. And we want to provide her with a great experience, whether she decides to shop in our stores or online. We're being careful about is managing those promotional impressions, especially in the online channel, which we know is global, transparent and can create a tremendous amount of confusion. And therefore, a lot of the steps that we've taken, both in the online channel and as well, I would say, as we have shared repeatedly in the wholesale channel where we're looking to manage our brand more effectively for long-term growth."

We've called out part due to marketing expenses, but there were also additional items. For example, as you may remember, we bought in the Canadian distributor there, so we had those directly operating expenses of the Canadian stores that we did not have in the year-ago period. We also had higher retail occupancy cost. Just like Coach, but of course, it's more magnified for Stuart Weitzman, we had the occupancy of both the Fifth Avenue and Regent Street stores, hitting the P&L there in terms of occupancy expense, where we had no sales yet. So we had those as well. There were a couple of other items that impacted it, but it was not only marketing timing. Just to keep that in mind. For the year, I would say that our operating margin for Stuart Weitzman should be in the realm of where it ended last year, and that is what we expected when we entered this year."

As you may remember, last year, I proceeded within our January call regarding December quarter. We talked about outlet promotional activity ratcheting up. We saw that in the competitive environment ours ratcheted up as well. And so we don't lap that until, let's say, partway through this second quarter. So we would continue to see that. Now we are experiencing lower average unit cost, higher initial mark ups, which is allowing us to fund, if you will, and have that onto the consumer. But we start to lax that, to your point, to the second quarter. I am fresh out of crystal balls right now, and I'm not sure that we're going to see a significant lessening in the environment in the second half of the year. But presumably over time, we'll be able to actually keep some of those at lower average unit costs of the output side. One thing I would mention is we are having and will have for the full year, a small benefit associated with the reduction of our sales in our wholesale channel. So that will help, and obviously, we're experiencing lower average unit cost on the retail side as well. And we're seeing nice growth in both AURs and ADT, as Andre talked about. So I think that probably sort of explains what's going on the outlet side and what we're looking at for the balance of the year. As you know, we've reiterated our guidance for the year of 69% to 70%."

As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter, highlighted by continued positive comparable store sales in North America and growth internationally, includ",1855,"Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter, highlighted by continued positive comparable store sales in North America and growth internationally, including double-digit increases in mainland China and Europe as well as sales gains in our directly operated businesses across Asia outside of greater China and Japan.
We remained focused on elevating the Coach brand through compelling product, differentiated store environments and promotional marketing. At the same time, we implemented the strategic actions necessary to reposition the brand and streamline our distribution in the promotional North American department store channel. Despite this deliberate pullback, we achieved growth across key financials, including sales, gross profit and operating income as well as double-digit earnings growth. Overall, our results give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will drive top and bottom line growth for our guidance for the fiscal year.
As we've outlined previously, for fiscal 2017, our 4 strategic priorities for the Coach brand include: Reenergize our brand and the category by continuing to innovate and establish our unique modern luxury proposition; continue the brand's elevation through a fuller expression of Coach 1941 in stores and online while driving our men's business even further across all channels; focus on raising brand awareness and relevance globally through the rollout of flagships in key fashion capitals while continuing to renovate our existing store base; and differentiate Coach through a combination of fashion and heritage marketing campaigns, distorting investments to key regions and ensuring the message is relevant and increasingly aspirational to the broader market. This included the relaunch of Coach fragrance with our partner, Interparfums, in September. 
And for Stuart Weitzman, we will drive our leadership position in fashion boots during the key winter selling season, augment our leadership in boots by developing iconic styles in pumps, sandals and flats while also laying the foundation for the relaunch of the brand's handbag assortment; drive global awareness and brand relevance through impactful marketing and the launch of New York and London flagships during the holiday quarter; leverage new leadership, both on the management and creative side to bring the Stuart Weitzman brand into its next chapter of growth as a multicategory player.
Now moving to our results. During the first quarter, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Most generally, we continued to elevate our retail offering globally with the Coach 1941 assortment resonating in our own stores as well as top-tier specialty and department store accounts. Of course, we continued to transition more of our fleet into the modern luxury concept, driving comp improvement. 
Finally, our fall campaign photographed by Steven Meisel, featured actress Chloë Grace Moretz against the backdrop of New York, beautifully capturing the spirit and energy of the city. We also ran our first ever TV commercial for the launch of the new Coach fragrance together with our partner
Interparfums.
At Stuart Weitzman, we're driving global awareness and brand relevance, gaining traction with the important international and millennial consumer. During the quarter, we continued to drive key investments in management and creative talent as well as infrastructure to support the long-term multicategory growth. Wendy Kahn officially joined as Brand President and CEO in September. And we also hired a lead footwear designer, [indiscernible], who starts this week and will report to Executive Creative Director, Giovanni Morelli, upon his arrival this spring. While brand sales were essentially even with the prior year this quarter, primarily due to shipment timing and repositioning of our U.K. business ahead of the opening of our first retail store on Regent Street, we continue to expect a double-digit sales increase in fiscal year '17. Indeed, we are extremely pleased by our performance in the early fall/winter season as our strength in boots gains momentum across channels and geographies.
Now as has been our practice since we implemented our transformation strategy more than 2 years ago, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to drive relevance across the 3 Coach brand pillars of product, stores and marketing. Starting with product, where Coach has emerged as a house of modern fashion design. The key retail strategies we are implementing include: the continued elevation of the assortment with the further rebalancing between Coach New York and 1941, and the move from 12 to 8 deliveries in our retail channel, first to better align with the fashion calendar, notably with the higher-end specialty retail, and also to drive improve productivity as we align deliveries with seasonal marketing.
During the quarter, our women's retail performance was driven by leather goods and growth in 1941 silhouettes. The Rogue, saddle bag and Dinky as well as the novelty tea rose and varsity patch platforms. Also during the quarter, we introduced the Drifter family and the smaller version of          Mercer. Mickey, which had successfully launched late in FY '16, built into early Q1 before selling through in most silhouettes. 
In outlet, men's continued to be a major focus for the business and is on plan to be over 20% of the channel by the end of the fiscal year. New style launches in outlet during the first quarter included the Tyler tote, the Charlie backpack and the mini Charlie. Signature and leather exotic mixed platforms in dressy silhouettes were well received, and we had a strong customer response to seasonal neutrals.
On stores. We're continuing to establish our modern luxury concept globally, renovating and opening 40 locations during the quarter, including 3 renovations in our directly operated North America business, taking us to nearly 500 modern luxury locations globally across all channels. This is very much in line with our target to end the year with over 700 doors in the new format, representing the vast majority of our traffic.
Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps, which exceed the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. Of course, transforming our stores is more than just the physical design. It's the consumer experience our store teams provide each and every single day. I'm delighted that our mystery shopper scores are key metric that demonstrates how we will deliver our unique modern luxury experience was up again in Q1 at over 80% this quarter as compared to 70% when we started tracking them 1 year ago. 
In addition, it's great to see how clients are responding to our new leather services, such as monogramming and leather conditioning with new services to be introduced throughout 2017. Across the global fleet, there were 17 craftsmanship bars installed as of the end of the quarter. We also just launched Coach journey, an online multilanguage learning platform, which is globally scalable. It is designed to engage and develop our store associates into knowledgeable modern luxury brand ambassadors through a robust development program and monthly product, service and styling skill training.
In our 75th year, we are very excited about our global flagship focus. We view these stores very much as key retail and marketing investments for the Coach brand. These flagships include our Coach houses on Fifth Avenue in New York City; and Regent Street in London, both opening this month, in time for the important holiday season. We will also open our first flagship in Milan, Italy, by the end of the fiscal year on the prestigious Via Montenapoleone.
In North American department stores, where we're repositioning the brand, we did not do any renovations this quarter. We did continue to implement our shop manager program and see a significant impact versus balance of doors and key accounts. As noted on our August call, one of our strategic initiatives this year is elevating the Coach brand into North America wholesale channel. As discussed previously, through 1941, we have already started adding new locations in top-tier specialty retail stores in North America and globally.
We are now also in the process of rationalizing our North American department store distribution, taking our door count down by about 25% or by over 250 locations over the fiscal year as well as reducing promotional events in the channel. In the first quarter, we closed the first group of these locations, about 120, and expect to close the remainder in our third quarter this upcoming spring season.
On the marketing front, the quarter kicked off with the successful launch of our Mickey collaboration. we were also thrilled about the reaction to our third ever 1941 runway show this past September, which garnered positive editorial feedback while generating close to 1 billion impressions globally. More generally, during the quarter, we remained focused on creating desire for our brand, amplifying our fashion positioning and our 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality. 
This year, we want to enhance brand perception and make the category exciting for consumers with a singular message that cuts through: Coach's unique modern luxury proposition, focusing on leather craft and Stuart's vision for Coach New York Cool. It's a new year American culture interpreted with a twist, from New York's original house of leather design.
As a result of these efforts across customer touch points, we are seeing continued progress with consumers. Importantly, in our North America brand tracking survey fielded in September, Coach's perception of positive brand momentum increased among category drivers versus a quarter ago while our brand affinities were strong with consumers overall. In addition, category drivers view of the Coach brand as original increased versus a quarter ago, reflective of our product and marketing strategies. We are delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty leather and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design, defining modern luxury. We are excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction, and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.
Turning now to a discussion of category trends. As we look ahead to the balance of fiscal year '17, there is no doubt that the challenges that exist today affecting the category in specific and consumer spending in general will persist. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain. Currency crosswinds continue to affect tourist flows, and geopolitical events are negatively impacting sentiment. As a result, visibility into the category growth remains limited as the landscape continues to rapidly shift. This volatility was evidenced throughout FY '16 and in the most recent quarter.
Overall, we estimate that the North American premium men's and women's bag and accessories market was flat to up low single digits in the September quarter, which we believe has been impacted by negative trends in the U.S. department store space. While Andrea will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. So I'll turn over to Andre for a discussion of North America. Andre?"

Importantl",778,"Thanks, Victor. As you read in our release, for the quarter, total North American Coach brand sales decreased 3% on both the reported and constant currency basis, reflecting our deliberate department store pullback while direct sales were flat. Importantly, the September quarter marked a continuation of positive comps in North America.
Our bricks-and-mortar comps rose approximately 4% in the quarter, driven by ticket and conversion while traffic was down modestly. Overall, our aggregate comp was up approximately 2% with e-commerce, notably low eOS flash sales, impacting results.
Generally, our coach.com retail side demand is similar to our retail stores. For most of the category, the dot-com channel is overwhelmingly a promotional one, with most of our competitors having perpetual sale shops available. As you are aware, we have a clear strategic direction to limit our promotional stance online, given the negative impact on long-term brand health.
Finally, our business to international tourists in our stores rose during Q1, with declines in Chinese tourist traffic more than offset by other nationalities, notably Japanese and Korean visitors.
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product. We continue to drive brand elevation with the above $400 price bracket rising in penetration to over 50% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year and generating another positive comp on the sales and unit basis. This drove handbag AURs to over $300.
Turning to event marketing. As noted on the last call, we came out of FY '16 comfortable with the cadence and type of events we had hosted. We held a preferred customer event for September, anniversary-ing the prior year, that's slightly shortened duration and which excluded 1941 products. And we'll hold a Black Friday event followed by our semiannual winter sale in December.
Looking ahead, our goal is to be the destination for gifting with a compelling assortment and broad offering across price points. We'll incorporate fashion elements, such as studs and hologram platforms, with a strong knot to our archives, featuring  glovetanned leather across all categories for both men's and women's, creating an emotional and compelling offering for the season.
Specifically in retail, we will: one, continue elevation strategy with further animations of Rouge; two, establish Coach as a year-round gifting destination; three, continue to leverage our unique leather craft, which is exemplified by application quilting in our Coach New York offering and through the use of distinctive materials and techniques such as embroidery and beading in our 1941 collection; and finally, launch several major new platforms, including our iconic 1941 duffle reinvented with increased functionality, and Brooklyn, a reimagined carryall with increased functionality, addressing the business bag opportunity.
As we move into holiday, in North America outlet, we'll accelerate our strategy to drive more innovation and emotion in the channel through limited editions, collaborations and the launch of new silhouettes and platforms. We're also focused on continuing to grow the men's category, and we'll celebrate our first holiday season with men's available in all of our outlet centers. In October, we kicked off the second quarter with the dual gender, limited-edition Pac-Man collection in all our North American outlet doors. This was our first collaboration strictly for the channel, and we've been extremely pleased with the results. Building on the success of the introduction of Tyler, we're continuing to launch new silhouettes, like the central satchel and City Zip Tote. 
For holiday, outlet launches a bold expression of 5 key prints and a wide array of metallics across multiple categories. Gift sets and novelty items continue to be big drivers for the season. And for Black Friday, we launched another dual gender, limited-edition leather bear collection in all our doors. We've seen great success with these destructive playful moments in our stores, both in bags and in novelty categories.
We'll be supporting these holiday initiatives and expressing the playfulness of the season in our advertising. The holiday campaign is all about our Coach dinosaur, Rexy. Buzz has been building around here for months, beginning with London collection men's in January by celebrity dressing and the collaboration with Colette. Building on this excitement, this week, we're launching a global Rexy campaign with a video where she comes to life in the workshop, linking this pop character to our heritage of leather crafts. The campaign continues with our celebrity friends amplifying Rexy and our emotional heritage gifting assortment across multiple platforms, including digital and social media.
In summary, we're encouraged by our performance and excited for holiday. We believe that our initiatives across the brand pillars will continue to drive positive traction in North America. And now, turning it back to Victor for international."

As noted in our release, in the first quarter, international Coach brand sales rose 7% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis. By geography, Greater China sales were essentially even with prior year in dollars in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 5%, driven by double-digit growth and positive comparable store sales on the mainland, offset in part by continued weakness in Hong Kong and Macau. In Japan, sales rose 11% on a reported basis, benefiting from the stronger dollar while constant currency sales decreased 7%, impacted by a decline in Chinese tourists spend as we lap last year's dramatic increase.
In Europe, our sales grew at a double-digit pace in the quarter, driven by new distribution and positive double-digit comps, excluding Paris, where our business continues to be impacted by weak tourist traffic. Post the Brexit vote, we've actually seen very strong results in the U.K., benefiting from the currency weakness and increased traction with the local consumer. In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales rose low single digit in dollars and in constant currency.
Finally, I would point out that we're continuing to see disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which, while small, are important to growing brand awareness. For the quarter, our overall sales at POS increased modestly, driven by strong domestic performance, offset in part by relatively weaker tourist location results. On a net sales basis, revenue also increased over the prior year.
Now I will turn it over to Andrea for details on our financial results and guidance for the year ahead. Andrea?"
526573,407109983,1068391,"Coach, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first fiscal quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal year '17. Please note, th",1550,"Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first fiscal quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal year '17. Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today.
We're pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, which marks continued progress against our transformation plan and momentum in our business. Our sales increased over the prior year, driven by positive comps in North America and continued growth internationally and despite the strategic repositioning of the Coach brand and the promotional North American wholesale channel. 
Operating margin expanded significantly over prior year once again this quarter, fueled by higher gross margin while we continue to invest in our brands. Taken together, we generated double-digit growth in net income and earnings per share, and our balance sheet remains extremely healthy with the clean inventory position and sufficient cash to support our strategic initiatives while returning capital to shareholders through our dividend.
Now turning to the details. Coach, Inc. net sales totaled $1.04 billion for the first fiscal quarter, an increase of 1% on a reported basis and a decrease of 1% on a constant currency basis, including approximately 150 bps of pressure related to the company's strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North American wholesale channel. Coach brand sales increased 1%, including positive North America comp store sales and continued international growth, as Victor and Andre have discussed.
Stuart Weitzman's brand sales were essentially even with prior year in Q1, impacted by wholesale shipment timing. To this end, and as expected, second quarter-to-date, Stuart Weitzman brand sales are up double digits.
Total gross profit totaled $715 million, an increase of 3% versus prior year, while gross margin increased 120 basis points to 68.9%. Coach brand gross profit increased 3% while gross margin increased 120 basis points over prior year to 69.8%, which included about 40 basis points of pressure from currency.
By segment, total North America gross margin increased over prior year, including our directly operated business where both gross profit dollars and gross profit rate grew over prior year. International segment gross margin increased over prior year excluding the negative impact of currency. Stuart Weitzman gross profit rose 2% while gross margin increased approximately 100 basis points over prior year.
Total SG&A expenses increased 1% and approximately in line with sales to $538 million and represented 51.9% of sales as compared to 51.7% in the year ago period. Coach brand SG&A expenses decreased 1% and represented 51.9% of sales compared to 52.7% in the year ago period, an improvement of 80 basis points.
Stuart Weitzman brand SG&A expenses were $45 million compared to $36 million a year ago due to store occupancy costs and the timing of marketing expenses as well as the company's strategic investments in team and infrastructure.
Coach, Inc. operating income rose 7% to $177 million while operating margin increased 100 basis points over prior year to 17% even. Coach brand operating income increased 13% while operating margin increased 200 basis points over prior year to 17.9%. Stuart Weitzman brand operating income of $7 million was down versus prior year based on the timing of net shipments as well as key investments to support long-term multicategory growth as discussed.
Net interest expense was $6 million in the quarter as compared to $7 million in the year ago period. Total net income for the quarter was $126 million compared to $113 million a year ago, with earnings per diluted share of $0.45, up $0.10 versus prior year. 
Now moving to global dissolution. In total, we closed a net of 2 Coach brand locations globally in the first quarter to end the period with 952 directly operated locations worldwide. In addition, we opened 2 net Stuart Weitzman directly operated stores to end the quarter with 77 locations. 
In FY '17, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to grow low single digits globally. This guidance assumes that Coach brand directly operated square footage in North America will decline slightly with net store closures in both our retail and outlet channels. Internationally, we expect a mid-single-digit increase in square footage led by significant growth in Europe and a mid-single digit increase in mainland China, partially offset by a high single-digit square footage decline in Japan as well as a modest unit decrease in Hong Kong and Macau. In our other directly operated businesses in Asia, we expect a little change in both units and square footage. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we expect to open 5 to 10 net new directly operated locations in fiscal year '17. 
Moving on, inventory levels at quarter end were $547 million compared to ending inventory of $575 million a year ago, a decrease of 5%. Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was an outflow of $38 million compared to an inflow of $8 million last year. Our CapEx spending was $68 million in Q1 versus $69 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an outflow of $106 million versus an outflow of $61 million in the same period last year. 
During the quarter, we received approximately $675 million in net proceeds associated with the sale-leaseback of the Hudson Yards building. And as announced, we used a portion of these proceeds to pay down our term loan of approximately $300 million with no prepayment penalty. As such, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $600 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter compared to approximately $900 million a year ago.
At the end of the fiscal quarter, cash and short-term investments stood at $1.5 billion as compared to $1.3 billion a year ago. As a reminder, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $125 million during this fiscal quarter related to the sale of our previous headquarters building on 34th Street.
Turning to our capital allocation policy which has not changed. Our first priority is to continue to invest in our brands as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders. And third, capital returns. We're committed to our dividend and expect our dividends to grow at least in line with prior year's operational net income growth as our transformation gains momentum. As always, underpinning all of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital market.
Now turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2017 on a non-GAAP 52-week versus 52-week basis, which has not changed. So I'll be brief. We still expect total revenues for Coach, Inc. in fiscal 2017 to increase by low to mid-single digits, including an expected benefit from foreign currency of approximately 100 to 150 basis points based on current exchange rates. This continues to assume a positive low single-digit comp for the Coach brand in North America for the year and in each quarter. As a reminder, we would expect Stuart Weitzman top line variability quarter-to-quarter given the nature of the business and its high penetration of wholesale.
In addition, we are maintaining our operating margin forecast for Coach, Inc. of between 18.5% and 19% for fiscal 2017. This guidance incorporates the negative impact of both Stuart Weitzman and the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North American wholesale channel. As an aside, for you modelers out there, we should note that our 2Q will likely include SG&A dollar growth ahead of sales due to the timing of our 75th anniversary celebrations, notably marketing activities surrounding the opening of Fifth Avenue and Regent Street.
We continue to expect interest expense to be in the area of $25 million for the year. The full year fiscal 2017 tax rate is still projected at about 28%. And we expect our average weighted diluted shares outstanding for the year to be in the area of $283 million. Taken together, we are projecting double-digit growth in both net income and earnings per diluted share for the year. And we continue to expect CapEx for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $325 million in FY '17.
In closing, we're very pleased with our performance in the quarter and the consistency of our execution against the volatile backdrop building on the successes we have achieved in our first 2 years of transformation. Importantly, we continue to expect fiscal '17 to be the year when we return to growth across all financials, leveraging top line growth and supported by our operational efficiency initiatives, which we have allowed -- which have allowed us to become a more nimble organization. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth for Coach, Inc. over the long term.
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

In retail, the impact is from broader distribution of Coach 1941 that we've been working on over the last couple of quarters, especially, of course, the continued rollout of our store concept as well as the great work being done by our sales associates with the enhanced service experience. In outlets, as we look to engage with the broader consumer, really proud of the level of innovation. And the team -- as the team has been leveraging a lot of inspiration, both from our retail stores and, as we mentioned, even a few very specific outlets, specific innovations such as Pac-Man, which has gotten us off to a very good start earlier this quarter.

So when you look at gross margin in the quarter for overall, the Coach brand, there were a couple of areas of benefit and a couple of areas of hit. So starting off on channel mix, channel mix was a positive in the quarter to us. Product mix and costs were actually a very large positive, which we, in turn, return to consumers in terms of pricing and value, not a complete offset but a partial offset there. And then in terms of the currency impact, currency was a negative impact in the quarter. We talk to about 40 basis points. Interestingly, there was an impact of the yen, and that's really about OCI and the yen hedge loss position in the quarter as well as the negative impact on other Asian currencies and on the R&D in terms of the China currency impact. For North America specifically, North America, gross margin improved in the quarter for the same reasons that I discussed. I'm sure one of the things you're interested in specifically our outlet, North America stores, gross margin was actually up in the quarter. So glad that we were able to take the benefit of lower cost. And as I said, returned some but not all of that to the consumer. We did have a small hit in North America from currency. And our guidance for the year does bake out -- bake in these continued benefits from both AUC, or average unit cost, as well as an overall impact returning that to the North America retail and outlet consumer in terms of pricing. So a nice balance there as we move through the year."

Thank you. In terms of your question on macro, David, obviously, very, very hard to predict as we know the geopolitical impacts most recently, whether it be terrorist attacks and where those happened and the impact that can have are almost impossible to predict. They do lead mostly to, of course, shifts in tourist flows, especially as well as in some markets even short term to medium-term impacts on domestic demand. The biggest impacts that we have seen outside of those short-term geopolitical have been mostly currency swings. There's been a lot of talk, of course, about the Chinese tourists where they're increasing and where they're decreasing. We've seen with the appreciation of the Japanese yen decreases in tourists spending in Japan. We've seen pickups in Korea. And of course, we have seen pretty strong drop off in mainland Europe, especially in Paris, which is a very important destination. In terms of the categories, we have just, obviously, with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman, made a bigger bet on footwear. We're excited about the long-term opportunity in that category for us, a $28 billion opportunity. But generally, into the medium and long term, we continue to believe there is no better space to be in fashion than the handbag and accessory space. We're excited about that as an opportunity, of course, not only in developed markets here in our home market, the U.S., Europe, which is really a greenfield opportunity for us. I cannot be more excited about the team that we have on the ground there and the great work they're seeing. We're beginning to see decent traction now, especially with the U.K. domestic consumer.

Going into the holiday quarter, we see continuation of growth of that $400 price point bracket. But we've also significantly expand our assortments below $400 with a gifting focus. So -- and we're particularly excited about that, the heritage gifting collection it's called that's hitting the stores in the days ahead and will give some good balance to the assortment to take advantage of the gifting opportunity. In terms of the distribution of 1941, it's now in our full retail distribution. It's been in full distribution since August. And it's been performing, I have to say, very well at every level of every tier store, not only a sort of more top-tier stores."

In terms of the progress that we've made, of course, not only with the Coach brand's but now, of course, as a dual-brand company, I couldn't be more excited about our ability to leverage the know-how that we have in Coach to support, of course, Stuart Weitzman. I'm incredibly excited about the new talents that we've recruited to that brand, both the CEO, Wendy Kahn; the Creative Director, Giovanni Morelli, who joins us in this spring. And as we announced today, [indiscernible], who joins us as the lead shoe designer reporting into Giovanni. More broadly, in terms of our capital allocation strategy and what could come next, we've been very consistent. We have a tremendous amounts of work and opportunity within the Coach brand and the Stuart Weitzman brand. That is our first priority. Our second priority, as you've suggested, is to look at value-additive acquisitions. Of course, we're going to be very selective in acquisitions that allow us to build platforms for long-term growth that allow us to leverage our global infrastructure and organizational capabilities and our skill sets, which is obviously building brands and retail management and a terrific supply chain in our core space. Most importantly, we look for great brands. We're not as committed to any specific nationality. So I would keep that in mind. And you have a second question. I'm sorry, I'm just being reminded in terms of the physical stores and service. I couldn't be -- as I mentioned in my response to Bob's question, happier with what the teams are doing across both retail channels. As you've seen, we've driven a positive 4 comp nearly in our bricks-and-mortar stores. I believe that it's not one specific channel or one specific action, Oliver, that leads to the positive results. It's about a total brand experience. We're committed to being very active digitally and engaging with the millennial and, indeed, with the broader consumer that's increasingly engaging online. And we want to provide her with a great experience, whether she decides to shop in our stores or online. What we're being very careful about is managing those promotional impressions, especially in the online channel, which we know is global, transparent and can create a tremendous amount of confusion. And therefore, a lot of the steps that we've taken, both in the online channel and as well, I would say, as we have shared repeatedly in the wholesale channel where we're looking to manage our brand more effectively for long-term growth."

We've called out part due to marketing expenses, but there were also additional items. For example, as you may remember, we bought in the Canadian distributor there. So we had those directly operating expenses of the Canadian stores that we did not have in the year ago period. We also have higher retail occupancy cost. Just like Coach, but of course, it's more magnified for Stuart Weitzman, we have the occupancy of both the Fifth Avenue and Regent Street stores hitting the P&L there in terms of occupancy expense, where we have no sales yet. So we had those as well. There were a couple of other items that impacted it, but it was not only marketing timing, just to keep that in mind. For the year, I would say that our operating margin for Stuart Weitzman should be in the realm of where it ended last year, and that is what we had expected when we entered this year."

As you may remember, last year, I believe it was in our January call regarding our second December quarter. We talked about outlet promotional activity ratcheting up. We saw that in the competitive environment ours ratcheted up as well. So we don't lap that until, let's say, partway through this second quarter. So we would continue to see that. Now we are experiencing lower average unit cost, higher initial mark-ups, which is allowing us to fund, if you will, and have that on to the consumer. But we start to lap that, to your point, through the second quarter. I am fresh out of crystal balls right now, and I'm not sure that we are going to see a significant lessening in the environment in the second half of the year. But presumably over time, we'll be able to actually keep some of those at lower average unit costs on the outlet side. One thing I will mention is we are having and will have for the full year a small benefit associated with the reduction of our sales in our wholesale channel. So that will help. And obviously, we're experiencing lower average unit cost on the retail side as well. And we're seeing nice growth in both AURs and ADT, as Andre talked about. So I think that probably sort of explains what's going on the outlet side and what we're looking at for the balance of the year. As you know that we've reiterated our guidance for the year of 69% to 70%."

Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter, highlighted by continued positive comparable store sales in North America and growth internationally, including double-digit increases in mainland China and Europe as well as sales gains in our directly operated businesses across Asia outside of greater China and Japan.
We remained focused on elevating the Coach brand through compelling product, differentiated store environments and emotional marketing. At the same time, we implemented the strategic actions necessary to reposition the brand and streamline our distribution in the promotional North American department store channel. Despite this deliberate pullback, we achieved growth across key financials, including sales, gross profit and operating income as well as double-digit earnings growth. Overall, our results give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will drive top and bottom line growth per our guidance for the fiscal year.
As we've outlined previously, for fiscal 2017, our 4 strategic priorities for the Coach brand include: Reenergize our brand in the category by continuing to innovate and establish our unique modern luxury proposition; continue the brand's elevation through a fuller expression of Coach 1941 in stores and online while driving our men's business even further across all channels; focus on raising brand awareness and relevance globally through the rollout of flagships in key fashion capitals while continuing to renovate our existing store base; and differentiate Coach through a combination of fashion and heritage marketing campaigns, distorting investments to key regions and ensuring the message is relevant and increasingly aspirational to the broader market. This included the relaunch of Coach fragrance with our partner, Interparfums, in September. 
And for Stuart Weitzman, we will drive our leadership position in fashion boots during the key winter selling season, augment our leadership in boots by developing iconic styles in pumps, sandals and flats while also laying the foundation for the relaunch of the brand's handbag assortment; drive global awareness and brand relevance through impactful marketing and the launch of New York and London flagships during the holiday quarter; leverage new leadership, both on the management and creative side to bring the Stuart Weitzman brand into its next chapter of growth as a multicategory player.
Now moving to our results. During the first quarter, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Most generally, we continued to elevate our retail offering globally with the Coach 1941 assortment resonating in our own stores as well as top-tier specialty and department store accounts. Of course, we continue to transition more of our fleet into the modern luxury concept, driving comp improvement. 
Finally, our fall campaign photographed by Steven Meisel, featured actress Chloë Grace Moretz against the backdrop of New York, beautifully capturing the spirit and energy of the city. We also ran our first ever TV commercial for the launch of the new Coach fragrance together with our partner
Interparfums.
At Stuart Weitzman, we're driving global awareness and brand relevance, gaining traction with the important international and millennial consumer. During the quarter, we continued to drive key investments in management and creative talent as well as infrastructure to support the long-term multicategory growth. Wendy Kahn officially joined as Brand President and CEO in September. And we also hired a lead footwear designer, Danielle Machete [ph], who starts this week and will report to Executive Creative Director, Giovanni Morelli, upon his arrival this spring. While brand sales were essentially even with the prior year this quarter, primarily due to shipment timing and repositioning of our U.K. business ahead of the opening of our first retail store on Regent Street, we continue to expect a double-digit sales increase in fiscal year '17. Indeed, we are extremely pleased by our performance in the early fall/winter season as our strength in boots gains momentum across channels and geographies.
Now as has been our practice since we implemented our transformation strategy more than 2 years ago, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to drive relevance across the 3 Coach brand pillars of product, stores and marketing. Starting with product, where Coach has emerged as a house of modern fashion design. The key retail strategies we are implementing include: the continued elevation of the assortment with the further rebalancing between Coach New York and 1941, and the move from 12 to 8 deliveries in our retail channel, first to better align with the fashion calendar, notably with the higher-end specialty retail, and also to drive improved productivity as we align deliveries with seasonal marketing.
During the quarter, our women's retail performance was driven by leather goods and growth in 1941 silhouettes. The Rogue, saddle bag and Dinky as well as the novelty tea rose and varsity patch platforms. Also during the quarter, we introduced the Drifter family and the smaller version of          Mercer. Mickey, which had successfully launched late in FY '16, built into early Q1 before selling through in most silhouettes. 
In outlet, men's continued to be a major focus for the business and is on plan to be over 20% of the channel by the end of the fiscal year. New style launches in outlet during the first quarter included the Tyler tote, the Charlie backpack and the mini Charlie. Signature and leather exotic mixed platforms in dressy silhouettes were well received, and we had a strong customer response to seasonal neutrals.
On stores. We're continuing to establish our modern luxury concept globally, renovating and opening 40 locations during the quarter, including 3 renovations in our directly operated North America business, taking us to nearly 500 modern luxury locations globally across all channels. This is very much in line with our target to end the year with over 700 doors in the new format, representing the vast majority of our traffic.
Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps, which exceed the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. Of course, transforming our stores is more than just the physical design. It's the consumer experience our store teams provide each and every single day. I'm delighted that our mystery shopper scores are key metric that demonstrates how we will deliver our unique modern luxury experience was up again in Q1 at over 80% this quarter as compared to 70% when we started tracking them a year ago. 
In addition, it's great to see how clients are responding to our new leather services, such as monogramming and leather conditioning with new services to be introduced throughout 2017. Across the global fleet, there were 17 craftsmanship bars installed as of the end of the quarter. We also just launched Coach journey, an online multilanguage learning platform, which is globally scalable. It is designed to engage and develop our store associates into knowledgeable modern luxury brand ambassadors through a robust development program and monthly product, service and styling skill training.
In our 75th year, we are very excited about our global flagship focus. We view these stores very much as key retail and marketing investments for the Coach brand. These flagships include our Coach houses on Fifth Avenue in New York City; and Regent Street in London, both opening this month, in time for the important holiday season. We will also open our first flagship in Milan, Italy, by the end of the fiscal year on the prestigious Via Montenapoleone.
In North American department stores, where we're repositioning the brand, we did not do any renovations this quarter. We did continue to implement our shop manager program and see a significant impact versus balance of doors and key accounts. As noted on our August call, one of our strategic initiatives this year is elevating the Coach brand into North America wholesale channel. As discussed previously, through 1941, we have already started adding new locations in top-tier specialty retail stores in North America and globally.
We are now also in the process of rationalizing our North American department store distribution, taking our door count down by about 25% or by over 250 locations over the fiscal year as well as reducing promotional events in the channel. In the first quarter, we closed the first group of these locations, about 120, and expect to close the remainder in our third quarter this upcoming spring season.
On the marketing front, the quarter kicked off with the successful launch of our Mickey collaboration. we were also thrilled about the reaction to our third ever 1941 runway show this past September, which garnered positive editorial feedback while generating close to 1 billion impressions globally. More generally, during the quarter, we remained focused on creating desire for our brand, amplifying our fashion positioning and our 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality. 
This year, we want to enhance brand perception and make the category exciting for consumers with a singular message that cuts through: Coach's unique modern luxury proposition, focusing on leather craft and Stuart's vision for Coach New York Cool, familiar American culture interpreted with a twist, from New York's original house of leather design.
As a result of these efforts across customer touch points, we are seeing continued progress with consumers. Importantly, in our North America brand tracking survey fielded in September, Coach's perception of positive brand momentum increased among category drivers versus a quarter ago while our brand affinities were strong with consumers overall. In addition, category drivers' view of the Coach brand as original increased versus a quarter ago, reflective of our product and marketing strategies. We are delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty leather and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design defining modern luxury. We are excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction, and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.
Turning now to a discussion of category trends. As we look ahead to the balance of fiscal year '17, there is no doubt that the challenges that exist today, affecting the category in specific and consumer spending in general, will persist. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain. Currency crosswinds continue to affect tourist flows, and geopolitical events are negatively impacting sentiment. As a result, visibility into the category growth remains limited as the landscape continues to rapidly shift. This volatility was evidenced throughout FY '16 and in the most recent quarter.
Overall, we estimate that the North American premium men's and women's bag and accessories market was flat to up low single digits in the September quarter, which we believe has been impacted by negative trends seen in the U.S. department store space. While Andrea will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. So I'll turn over to Andre for a discussion of North America. Andre?"

Importantl",779,"Thanks, Victor. As you read in our release, for the quarter, total North American Coach brand sales decreased 3% on both the reported and constant currency basis, reflecting our deliberate department store pullback while direct sales were flat. Importantly, the September quarter marked a continuation of positive comps in North America.
Our bricks-and-mortar comps rose approximately 4% in the quarter, driven by ticket and conversion while traffic was down modestly. Overall, our aggregate comp was up approximately 2% with e-commerce, notably low eOS flash sales, impacting results.
Generally, our coach.com retail side demand is similar to our retail stores. For most of the category, the dot-com channel is overwhelmingly a promotional one, with most of our competitors having perpetual sales shops available. As you are aware, we have a clear strategic direction to limit our promotional stance online, given the negative impact on long-term brand health.
Finally, our business to international tourists in our stores rose during Q1, with declines in Chinese tourist traffic more than offset by other nationalities, notably Japanese and Korean visitors.
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product. We continue to drive brand elevation with the above $400 price bracket rising in penetration to over 50% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year and generating another positive comp on the sales and unit basis. This drove handbag AURs to over $300.
Turning to event marketing. As noted on the last call, we came out of FY '16 comfortable with the cadence and type of events we'd hosted. We held a preferred customer event for September, anniversary-ing the prior year, though slightly short in duration and which excluded 1941 products. And we'll hold a Black Friday event followed by our semiannual winter sale in December.
Looking ahead, our goal is to be the destination for gifting with a compelling assortment and broad offering across price points. We'll incorporate fashion elements, such as studs and hologram platforms, with a strong knot to our archives, featuring glovetanned leather across all categories for both men's and women's, creating an emotional and compelling offering for the season.
Specifically in retail, we will: one, continue elevation strategy with further animations of Rouge; two, establish Coach as a year-round gifting destination; three, continue to leverage our unique leather craft, which is exemplified by appliques and quilting in our Coach New York offering and through the use of distinctive materials and techniques such as embroidery and beading in our 1941 collection; and finally, launch several major new platforms, including our iconic 1941 duffle reinvented with increased functionality, and Brooklyn, a reimagined carryall with increased functionality, addressing the business bag opportunity.
As we move into holiday, in North America outlet, we'll accelerate our strategy to drive more innovation and emotion in the channel through limited editions, collaborations and the launch of new silhouettes and platforms. We're also focused on continuing to grow the men's category, and we'll celebrate our first holiday season with men's available in all of our outlet centers. In October, we kicked off the second quarter with the dual gender, limited-edition Pac-Man collection in all our North American outlet doors. This was our first collaboration strictly for the channel, and we've been extremely pleased with the results. Building on the success of the introduction of Tyler, we're continuing to launch new silhouettes, like the central satchel and City Zip Tote. 
For holiday, outlet launches a bold expression of 5 key prints and a wide array of metallics across multiple categories. Gift sets and novelty items continue to be big drivers for the season. And for Black Friday, we launched another dual gender, limited-edition leather bear collection in all our doors. We've seen great success with these destructive playful moments in our stores, both in bags and in novelty categories.
We'll be supporting these holiday initiatives and expressing the playfulness of the season in our advertising. The holiday campaign is all about our Coach dinosaur, Rexy. Buzz has been building around her for months, beginning with London collection men's in January, by celebrity dressing and the collaboration with Colette. Building on this excitement, this week, we're launching a global Rexy campaign with a video where she comes to life in the workshop, linking this pop character to our heritage of leather crafts. The campaign continues with our celebrity friends amplifying Rexy and our emotional heritage gifting assortment across multiple platforms, including digital and social media.
In summary, we're encouraged by our performance and excited for holiday. We believe that our initiatives across the brand pillars will continue to drive positive traction in North America. And now, turning it back to Victor for international."

As noted in our release, in the first quarter, international Coach brand sales rose 7% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis. By geography, Greater China sales were essentially even with prior year in dollars in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 5%, driven by double-digit growth and positive comparable store sales on the mainland, offset in part by continued weakness in Hong Kong and Macau. In Japan, sales rose 11% on a reported basis, benefiting from the stronger dollar while constant currency sales decreased 7%, impacted by a decline in Chinese tourist spend as we lap last year's dramatic increase.
In Europe, our sales grew at a double-digit pace in the quarter, driven by new distribution and positive double-digit comps, excluding Paris, where our business continues to be impacted by weak tourist traffic. Post the Brexit vote, we've actually seen very strong results in the U.K., benefiting from the currency weakness and increased traction with the local consumer. In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales rose low single digit in dollars and in constant currency.
Finally, I would point out that we're continuing to see disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which, while small, are important to growing brand awareness. For the quarter, our overall sales at POS increased modestly, driven by strong domestic performance, offset in part by relatively weaker tourist location results. On a net sales basis, revenue also increased over the prior year.
Now I will turn it over to Andrea for details on our financial results and guidance for the year ahead. Andrea?"
526573,407109983,1068653,"Coach, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first fiscal quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal year '17. Please note, th",1550,"Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first fiscal quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal year '17. Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today.
We're pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, which marks continued progress against our transformation plan and momentum in our business. Our sales increased over the prior year, driven by positive comps in North America and continued growth internationally and despite the strategic repositioning of the Coach brand and the promotional North American wholesale channel. 
Operating margin expanded significantly over prior year once again this quarter, fueled by higher gross margin while we continue to invest in our brands. Taken together, we generated double-digit growth in net income and earnings per share, and our balance sheet remains extremely healthy with a clean inventory position and sufficient cash to support our strategic initiatives while returning capital to shareholders through our dividend.
Now turning to the details. Coach, Inc. net sales totaled $1.04 billion for the first fiscal quarter, an increase of 1% on a reported basis and a decrease of 1% on a constant currency basis, including approximately 150 bps of pressure related to the company's strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North American wholesale channel. Coach brand sales increased 1%, including positive North America comp store sales and continued international growth, as Victor and Andre have discussed.
Stuart Weitzman's brand sales were essentially even with prior year in Q1, impacted by wholesale shipment timing. To this end, and as expected, second quarter-to-date, Stuart Weitzman brand sales are up double digits.
Total gross profit totaled $715 million, an increase of 3% versus prior year, while gross margin increased 120 basis points to 68.9%. Coach brand gross profit increased 3% while gross margin increased 120 basis points over prior year to 69.8%, which included about 40 basis points of pressure from currency.
By segment, total North America gross margin increased over prior year, including our directly operated business where both gross profit dollars and gross profit rate grew over prior year. International segment gross margin increased over prior year excluding the negative impact of currency. Stuart Weitzman gross profit rose 2% while gross margin increased approximately 100 basis points over prior year.
Total SG&A expenses increased 1% and approximately in line with sales to $538 million and represented 51.9% of sales as compared to 51.7% in the year ago period. Coach brand SG&A expenses decreased 1% and represented 51.9% of sales compared to 52.7% in the year ago period, an improvement of 80 basis points.
Stuart Weitzman brand SG&A expenses were $45 million compared to $36 million a year ago due to store occupancy costs and the timing of marketing expenses as well as the company's strategic investments in team and infrastructure.
Coach, Inc. operating income rose 7% to $177 million while operating margin increased 100 basis points over prior year to 17% even. Coach brand operating income increased 13% while operating margin increased 200 basis points over prior year to 17.9%. Stuart Weitzman brand operating income of $7 million was down versus prior year based on the timing of net shipments as well as key investments to support long-term multicategory growth as discussed.
Net interest expense was $6 million in the quarter as compared to $7 million in the year ago period. Total net income for the quarter was $126 million compared to $113 million a year ago, with earnings per diluted share of $0.45, up $0.10 versus prior year. 
Now moving to global distribution. In total, we closed a net of 2 Coach brand locations globally in the first quarter to end the period with 952 directly operated locations worldwide. In addition, we opened 2 net Stuart Weitzman directly operated stores to end the quarter with 77 locations. 
In FY '17, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to grow low single digits globally. This guidance assumes that Coach brand directly operated square footage in North America will decline slightly with net store closures in both our retail and outlet channels. Internationally, we expect a mid-single-digit increase in square footage led by significant growth in Europe and a mid-single digit increase in mainland China, partially offset by a high single-digit square footage decline in Japan as well as a modest unit decrease in Hong Kong and Macau. In our other directly operated business in Asia, we expect a little change in both units and square footage. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we expect to open 5 to 10 net new directly operated locations in fiscal year '17. 
Moving on, inventory levels at quarter end were $547 million compared to ending inventory of $575 million a year ago, a decrease of 5%. Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was an outflow of $38 million compared to an inflow of $8 million last year. Our CapEx spending was $68 million in Q1 versus $69 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an outflow of $106 million versus an outflow of $61 million in the same period last year. 
During the quarter, we received approximately $675 million in net proceeds associated with the sale-leaseback of the Hudson Yards building. And as announced, we used a portion of these proceeds to pay down our term loan of approximately $300 million with no prepayment penalty. As such, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $600 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter compared to approximately $900 million a year ago.
At the end of the fiscal quarter, cash and short-term investments stood at $1.5 billion as compared to $1.3 billion a year ago. As a reminder, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $125 million during this fiscal quarter related to the sale of our previous headquarters building on 34th Street.
Turning to our capital allocation policy which has not changed. Our first priority is to continue to invest in our brands as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interests of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders. And third, capital returns. We're committed to our dividend and expect our dividends to grow at least in line with prior year's operational net income growth as our transformation gains momentum. As always, underpinning all of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets.
Now turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2017 on a non-GAAP 52-week versus 52-week basis, which has not changed. So I'll be brief. We still expect total revenues for Coach, Inc. in fiscal 2017 to increase by low to mid-single digits, including an expected benefit from foreign currency of approximately 100 to 150 basis points based on current exchange rates. This continues to assume a positive low single-digit comp for the Coach brand in North America for the year and in each quarter. As a reminder, we would expect Stuart Weitzman top line variability quarter-to-quarter given the nature of the business and its high penetration of wholesale.
In addition, we are maintaining our operating margin forecast for Coach, Inc. of between 18.5% and 19% for fiscal 2017. This guidance incorporates the negative impact of both Stuart Weitzman and the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North American wholesale channel. As an aside, for you modelers out there, we should note that our 2Q will likely include SG&A dollar growth ahead of sales due to the timing of our 75th anniversary celebrations, notably marketing activities surrounding the opening of Fifth Avenue and Regent Street.
We continue to expect interest expense to be in the area of $25 million for the year. The full year fiscal 2017 tax rate is still projected at about 28%. And we expect our average weighted diluted shares outstanding for the year to be in the area of $283 million. Taken together, we are projecting double-digit growth in both net income and earnings per diluted share for the year. And we continue to expect CapEx for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $325 million in FY '17.
In closing, we're very pleased with our performance in the quarter and the consistency of our execution against the volatile backdrop building on the successes we have achieved in our first 2 years of transformation. Importantly, we continue to expect fiscal '17 to be the year when we return to growth across all financials, leveraging top line growth and supported by our operational efficiency initiatives, which we have allowed -- which have allowed us to become a more nimble organization. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth for Coach, Inc. over the long term.
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

In retail, the impact is from broader distribution of Coach 1941 that we've been working on over the last couple of quarters, especially, of course, the continued rollout of our store concept as well as the great work being done by our sales associates with the enhanced service experience. In outlets, as we look to engage with the broader consumer, really proud of the level of innovation. And the team -- as the team has been leveraging a lot of inspiration, both from our retail stores and, as we mentioned, even a few very specific -- outlet specific innovations such as Pac-Man, which has gotten us off to a very good start earlier this quarter.

So when you look at gross margin in the quarter for overall, the Coach brand, there were a couple of areas of benefit and a couple of areas of hit. So starting off on channel mix, channel mix was a positive in the quarter to us. Product mix and costs were actually a very large positive, which we, in turn, returned to consumers in terms of pricing and value, not a complete offset but a partial offset there. And then in terms of the currency impact, currency was a negative impact in the quarter. We talk to about 40 basis points. Interestingly, there was an impact of the yen, and that's really about OCI and the yen hedge loss position in the quarter as well as the negative impact on other Asian currencies and on the R&D in terms of the China currency impact. For North America specifically, North America, gross margin improved in the quarter for the same reasons that I discussed. I'm sure one of the things you're interested in specifically our outlet, North America store, gross margin was actually up in the quarter. So glad that we were able to take the benefit of lower cost. And as I said, returned some but not all of that to the consumer. We did have a small hit in North America from currency. And our guidance for the year does bake out -- bake in these continued benefits from both AUC, or average unit cost, as well as an overall impact of returning that to the North America retail and outlet consumer in terms of pricing. So a nice balance there as we move through the year."

Thank you. In terms of your question on macro, David, obviously, very, very hard to predict as we know the geopolitical impacts most recently, whether it be terrorist attacks and where those happened and the impact that can have are almost impossible to predict. They do lead mostly to, of course, shifts in tourist flows, especially as well as in some markets even short-term to medium-term impacts on domestic demand. The biggest impacts that we have seen outside of those short-term geopolitical have been mostly currency swings. There's been a lot of talk, of course, about the Chinese tourists, where they're increasing and where they're decreasing. We've seen, with the appreciation of the Japanese yen, decreases in tourist spending in Japan. We've seen pickups in Korea. And of course, we have seen pretty strong drop off in mainland Europe, especially in Paris, which is a very important destination. In terms of the categories, we have just, obviously with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman, made a bigger bet on footwear. We're excited about the long-term opportunity in that category for us, a $28 billion opportunity. But generally, into the medium and long term, we continue to believe there is no better space to be in fashion than the handbag and accessory space. We're excited about that as an opportunity, of course, not only in developed markets here in our home market, the U.S., Europe, which is really a greenfield opportunity for us. I could not be more excited about the team that we have on the ground there and the great work they're seeing. We're beginning to see decent traction now, especially with the U.K. domestic consumer.

And then as you head into the second quarter where gifting is a key focus, how should we think about the penetration rate between that over $400, the under $300 price points? And then last, how many stores in North America have the 1941 collection currently?"

So -- and we're particularly excited about that, the heritage gifting collection, it's called. That's hitting the stores in the days ahead and will give some good balance to the assortment to take advantage of the gifting opportunity. In terms of the distribution of 1941, it's now in our full retail distribution. It's been in full distribution since August. And it's been performing, I have to say, very well at every level of every tier of store, not only our sort of more top-tier stores."

In terms of the progress that we've made, of course, not only with the Coach brand, but now, of course, as a dual-brand company, I couldn't be more excited about our ability to leverage the know-how that we have in Coach to support, of course, Stuart Weitzman. I'm incredibly excited about the new talent that we've recruited to that brand, both the CEO, Wendy Kahn; the Creative Director, Giovanni Morelli, who joins us in this spring. And as we announced today, Danielle Machete [ph], who joins us as the lead shoe designer reporting into Giovanni. More broadly, in terms of our capital allocation strategy and what could come next, we've been very consistent. We have a tremendous amount of work and opportunity within the Coach brand and the Stuart Weitzman brand. That is our first priority. Our second priority, as you've suggested, is to look at value-additive acquisitions. Of course, we're going to be very selective in acquisitions that allow us to build platforms for long-term growth that allow us to leverage our global infrastructure and organizational capabilities and our skill sets, which is obviously building brands and retail management and a terrific supply chain in our core space. Most importantly, we look for great brands. We're not as committed to any specific nationality. So I would keep that in mind. And you have a second question. I'm sorry, I'm just being reminded in terms of the physical stores and service. I couldn't be, as I mentioned in my response to Bob's question, happier with what the teams are doing across both retail channels. As you've seen, we've driven a positive 4 comp nearly in our bricks-and-mortar stores. I believe that it's not one specific channel or one specific action, Oliver, that leads to the positive results. It's about a total brand experience. We're committed to being very active digitally and engaging with the millennial and, indeed, with the broader consumer that's increasingly engaging online. And we want to provide her with a great experience, whether she decides to shop in our stores or online. What we're being very careful about is managing those promotional impressions, especially in the online channel, which we know is global, transparent and can create a tremendous amount of confusion. And therefore, a lot of the steps that we've taken, both in the online channel and as well, I would say, as we have shared repeatedly in the wholesale channel where we're looking to manage our brand more effectively for long-term growth."

We've called out part due to marketing expenses, but there were also additional items. For example, as you may remember, we bought in the Canadian distributor there. So we had those directly operating expenses of the Canadian stores that we did not have in the year ago period. We also have higher retail occupancy cost. Just like Coach, but of course, it's more magnified for Stuart Weitzman, we have the occupancy of both the Fifth Avenue and Regent Street stores hitting the P&L there in terms of occupancy expense, where we have no sales yet. So we had those as well. There were a couple of other items that impacted it, but it was not only marketing timing, just to keep that in mind. For the year, I would say that our operating margin for Stuart Weitzman should be in the realm of where it ended last year, and that is what we had expected when we entered this year."

As you may remember, last year, I believe it was in our January call regarding our second December quarter. We talked about outlet promotional activity ratcheting up. We saw that in the competitive environment, ours ratcheted up as well. So we don't lap that until, let's say, partway through this second quarter. So we would continue to see that. Now we are experiencing lower average unit cost, higher initial mark-ups, which is allowing us to fund, if you will, and pass that on to the consumer. But we start to lap that, to your point, through the second quarter. I am fresh out of crystal balls right now, and I'm not sure that we're going to see a significant lessening in the environment in the second half of the year. But presumably over time, we'll be able to actually keep some of those at lower average unit cost on the outlet side. One thing I will mention is we are having and will have for the full year a small benefit associated with the reduction of our sales in our wholesale channel. So that will help. And obviously, we're experiencing lower average unit cost on the retail side as well. And we're seeing nice growth in both AURs and ADT, as Andre talked about. So I think that probably sort of explains what's going on, on the outlet side and what we're looking at for the balance of the year. As you know, that we've reiterated our guidance for the year of 69% to 70%."

Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter, highlighted by continued positive comparable store sales in North America and growth internationally, including double-digit increases in mainland China and Europe as well as sales gains in our directly operated businesses across Asia outside of greater China and Japan.
We remained focused on elevating the Coach brand through compelling product, differentiated store environments and emotional marketing. At the same time, we implemented the strategic actions necessary to reposition the brand and streamline our distribution in the promotional North American department store channel. Despite this deliberate pullback, we achieved growth across key financials, including sales, gross profit and operating income as well as double-digit earnings growth. Overall, our results give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will drive top and bottom line growth per our guidance for the fiscal year.
As we've outlined previously, for fiscal 2017, our 4 strategic priorities for the Coach brand include: Reenergize our brand in the category by continuing to innovate and establish our unique modern luxury proposition; continue the brand's elevation through a fuller expression of Coach 1941 in stores and online while driving our men's business even further across all channels; focus on raising brand awareness and relevance globally through the rollout of flagships in key fashion capitals while continuing to renovate our existing store base; and differentiate Coach through a combination of fashion and heritage marketing campaigns, distorting investments to key regions and ensuring the message is relevant and increasingly aspirational to the broader market. This included the relaunch of Coach fragrance with our partner, Interparfums, in September. 
And for Stuart Weitzman, we will drive our leadership position in fashion boots during the key winter selling season, augment our leadership in boots by developing iconic styles in pumps, sandals and flats while also laying the foundation for the relaunch of the brand's handbag assortment; drive global awareness and brand relevance through impactful marketing and the launch of New York and London flagships during the holiday quarter; leverage new leadership, both on the management and creative side to bring the Stuart Weitzman brand into its next chapter of growth as a multicategory player.
Now moving to our results. During the first quarter, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Most generally, we continued to elevate our retail offering globally with the Coach 1941 assortment resonating in our own stores as well as top-tier specialty and department store accounts. Of course, we continue to transition more of our fleet into the modern luxury concept, driving comp improvement. 
Finally, our fall campaign photographed by Steven Meisel, featured actress Chloë Grace Moretz against the backdrop of New York, beautifully capturing the spirit and energy of the city. We also ran our first ever TV commercial for the launch of the new Coach fragrance together with our partner
Interparfums.
At Stuart Weitzman, we're driving global awareness and brand relevance, gaining traction with the important international and millennial consumer. During the quarter, we continued to drive key investments in management and creative talent as well as infrastructure to support the long-term multicategory growth. Wendy Kahn officially joined as Brand President and CEO in September. And we also hired a lead footwear designer, Daniele Michetti, who starts this week and will report to Executive Creative Director, Giovanni Morelli, upon his arrival this spring. While brand sales were essentially even with the prior year this quarter, primarily due to shipment timing and repositioning of our U.K. business ahead of the opening of our first retail store on Regent Street, we continue to expect a double-digit sales increase in fiscal year '17. Indeed, we are extremely pleased by our performance in the early fall/winter season as our strength in boots gains momentum across channels and geographies.
Now as has been our practice since we implemented our transformation strategy more than 2 years ago, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to drive relevance across the 3 Coach brand pillars of product, stores and marketing. Starting with product, where Coach has emerged as a house of modern fashion design. The key retail strategies we are implementing include: the continued elevation of the assortment with the further rebalancing between Coach New York and 1941, and the move from 12 to 8 deliveries in our retail channel, first to better align with the fashion calendar, notably with the higher-end specialty retail, and also to drive improved productivity as we align deliveries with seasonal marketing.
During the quarter, our women's retail performance was driven by leather goods and growth in 1941 silhouettes. The Rogue, saddle bag and Dinky as well as the novelty tea rose and varsity patch platforms. Also during the quarter, we introduced the Drifter family and the smaller version of          Mercer. Mickey, which had successfully launched late in FY '16, built into early Q1 before selling through in most silhouettes. 
In outlet, men's continued to be a major focus for the business and is on plan to be over 20% of the channel by the end of the fiscal year. New style launches in outlet during the first quarter included the Tyler tote, the Charlie backpack and the mini Charlie. Signature and leather exotic mixed platforms in dressy silhouettes were well received, and we had a strong customer response to seasonal neutrals.
On stores. We're continuing to establish our modern luxury concept globally, renovating and opening 40 locations during the quarter, including 3 renovations in our directly operated North America business, taking us to nearly 500 modern luxury locations globally across all channels. This is very much in line with our target to end the year with over 700 doors in the new format, representing the vast majority of our traffic.
Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps, which exceed the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. Of course, transforming our stores is more than just the physical design. It's the consumer experience our store teams provide each and every single day. I'm delighted that our mystery shopper scores are key metric that demonstrates how we will deliver our unique modern luxury experience was up again in Q1 at over 80% this quarter as compared to 70% when we started tracking them a year ago. 
In addition, it's great to see how clients are responding to our new leather services, such as monogramming and leather conditioning with new services to be introduced throughout 2017. Across the global fleet, there were 17 craftsmanship bars installed as of the end of the quarter. We also just launched Coach journey, an online multilanguage learning platform, which is globally scalable. It is designed to engage and develop our store associates into knowledgeable modern luxury brand ambassadors through a robust development program and monthly product, service and styling skill training.
In our 75th year, we are very excited about our global flagship focus. We view these stores very much as key retail and marketing investments for the Coach brand. These flagships include our Coach houses on Fifth Avenue in New York City; and Regent Street in London, both opening this month, in time for the important holiday season. We will also open our first flagship in Milan, Italy, by the end of the fiscal year on the prestigious Via Montenapoleone.
In North American department stores, where we're repositioning the brand, we did not do any renovations this quarter. We did continue to implement our shop manager program and see a significant impact versus balance of doors and key accounts. As noted on our August call, one of our strategic initiatives this year is elevating the Coach brand into North America wholesale channel. As discussed previously, through 1941, we have already started adding new locations in top-tier specialty retail stores in North America and globally.
We are now also in the process of rationalizing our North American department store distribution, taking our door count down by about 25% or by over 250 locations over the fiscal year as well as reducing promotional events in the channel. In the first quarter, we closed the first group of these locations, about 120, and expect to close the remainder in our third quarter this upcoming spring season.
On the marketing front, the quarter kicked off with the successful launch of our Mickey collaboration. we were also thrilled about the reaction to our third ever 1941 runway show this past September, which garnered positive editorial feedback while generating close to 1 billion impressions globally. More generally, during the quarter, we remained focused on creating desire for our brand, amplifying our fashion positioning and our 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality. 
This year, we want to enhance brand perception and make the category exciting for consumers with a singular message that cuts through: Coach's unique modern luxury proposition, focusing on leather craft and Stuart's vision for Coach New York Cool, familiar American culture interpreted with a twist, from New York's original house of leather design.
As a result of these efforts across customer touch points, we are seeing continued progress with consumers. Importantly, in our North America brand tracking survey fielded in September, Coach's perception of positive brand momentum increased among category drivers versus a quarter ago while our brand affinities were strong with consumers overall. In addition, category drivers' view of the Coach brand as original increased versus a quarter ago, reflective of our product and marketing strategies. We are delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty leather and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design defining modern luxury. We are excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction, and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.
Turning now to a discussion of category trends. As we look ahead to the balance of fiscal year '17, there is no doubt that the challenges that exist today, affecting the category in specific and consumer spending in general, will persist. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain. Currency crosswinds continue to affect tourist flows, and geopolitical events are negatively impacting sentiment. As a result, visibility into the category growth remains limited as the landscape continues to rapidly shift. This volatility was evidenced throughout FY '16 and in the most recent quarter.
Overall, we estimate that the North American premium men's and women's bag and accessories market was flat to up low single digits in the September quarter, which we believe has been impacted by negative trends seen in the U.S. department store space. While Andrea will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. So I'll turn over to Andre for a discussion of North America. Andre?"

Importantl",779,"Thanks, Victor. As you read in our release, for the quarter, total North American Coach brand sales decreased 3% on both the reported and constant currency basis, reflecting our deliberate department store pullback while direct sales were flat. Importantly, the September quarter marked a continuation of positive comps in North America.
Our bricks-and-mortar comps rose approximately 4% in the quarter, driven by ticket and conversion while traffic was down modestly. Overall, our aggregate comp was up approximately 2% with e-commerce, notably low eOS flash sales, impacting results.
Generally, our coach.com retail side demand is similar to our retail stores. For most of the category, the dot-com channel is overwhelmingly a promotional one, with most of our competitors having perpetual sales shops available. As you are aware, we have a clear strategic direction to limit our promotional stance online, given the negative impact on long-term brand health.
Finally, our business to international tourists in our stores rose during Q1, with declines in Chinese tourist traffic more than offset by other nationalities, notably Japanese and Korean visitors.
Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product. We continue to drive brand elevation with the above $400 price bracket rising in penetration to over 50% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year and generating another positive comp on the sales and unit basis. This drove handbag AURs to over $300.
Turning to event marketing. As noted on the last call, we came out of FY '16 comfortable with the cadence and type of events we'd hosted. We held a preferred customer event for September, anniversary-ing the prior year, though slightly short in duration and which excluded 1941 products. And we'll hold a Black Friday event followed by our semiannual winter sale in December.
Looking ahead, our goal is to be the destination for gifting with a compelling assortment and broad offering across price points. We'll incorporate fashion elements, such as studs and hologram platforms, with a strong knot to our archives, featuring glovetanned leather across all categories for both men's and women's, creating an emotional and compelling offering for the season.
Specifically in retail, we will: one, continue elevation strategy with further animations of Rouge; two, establish Coach as a year-round gifting destination; three, continue to leverage our unique leather craft, which is exemplified by appliques and quilting in our Coach New York offering and through the use of distinctive materials and techniques such as embroidery and beading in our 1941 collection; and finally, launch several major new platforms, including our iconic 1941 duffle reinvented with increased functionality, and Brooklyn, a reimagined carryall with increased functionality, addressing the business bag opportunity.
As we move into holiday, in North America outlet, we'll accelerate our strategy to drive more innovation and emotion in the channel through limited editions, collaborations and the launch of new silhouettes and platforms. We're also focused on continuing to grow the men's category, and we'll celebrate our first holiday season with men's available in all of our outlet centers. In October, we kicked off the second quarter with the dual gender, limited-edition Pac-Man collection in all our North American outlet doors. This was our first collaboration strictly for the channel, and we've been extremely pleased with the results. Building on the success of the introduction of Tyler, we're continuing to launch new silhouettes, like the central satchel and City Zip Tote. 
For holiday, outlet launches a bold expression of 5 key prints and a wide array of metallics across multiple categories. Gift sets and novelty items continue to be big drivers for the season. And for Black Friday, we launched another dual gender, limited-edition leather bear collection in all our doors. We've seen great success with these destructive playful moments in our stores, both in bags and in novelty categories.
We'll be supporting these holiday initiatives and expressing the playfulness of the season in our advertising. The holiday campaign is all about our Coach dinosaur, Rexy. Buzz has been building around her for months, beginning with London collection men's in January, by celebrity dressing and the collaboration with Colette. Building on this excitement, this week, we're launching a global Rexy campaign with a video where she comes to life in the workshop, linking this pop character to our heritage of leather crafts. The campaign continues with our celebrity friends amplifying Rexy and our emotional heritage gifting assortment across multiple platforms, including digital and social media.
In summary, we're encouraged by our performance and excited for holiday. We believe that our initiatives across the brand pillars will continue to drive positive traction in North America. And now, turning it back to Victor for international."

As noted in our release, in the first quarter, international Coach brand sales rose 7% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis. By geography, Greater China sales were essentially even with prior year in dollars in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 5%, driven by double-digit growth and positive comparable store sales on the mainland, offset in part by continued weakness in Hong Kong and Macau. In Japan, sales rose 11% on a reported basis, benefiting from the stronger dollar while constant currency sales decreased 7%, impacted by a decline in Chinese tourist spend as we lap last year's dramatic increase.
In Europe, our sales grew at a double-digit pace in the quarter, driven by new distribution and positive double-digit comps, excluding Paris, where our business continues to be impacted by weak tourist traffic. Post the Brexit vote, we've actually seen very strong results in the U.K., benefiting from the currency weakness and increased traction with the local consumer. In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales rose low single digit in dollars and in constant currency.
Finally, I would point out that we're continuing to see disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which, while small, are important to growing brand awareness. For the quarter, our overall sales at POS increased modestly, driven by strong domestic performance, offset in part by relatively weaker tourist location results. On a net sales basis, revenue also increased over the prior year.
Now I will turn it over to Andrea for details on our financial results and guidance for the year ahead. Andrea?"
526573,407109983,1069252,"Coach, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first fiscal quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal year '17. Please note, th",1550,"Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first fiscal quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal year '17. Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today.
We're pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, which marks continued progress against our transformation plan and momentum in our business. Our sales increased over the prior year, driven by positive comps in North America and continued growth internationally and despite the strategic repositioning of the Coach brand and the promotional North American wholesale channel. 
Operating margin expanded significantly over prior year once again this quarter, fueled by higher gross margin while we continue to invest in our brands. Taken together, we generated double-digit growth in net income and earnings per share, and our balance sheet remains extremely healthy with a clean inventory position and sufficient cash to support our strategic initiatives while returning capital to shareholders through our dividend.
Now turning to the details. Coach, Inc. net sales totaled $1.04 billion for the first fiscal quarter, an increase of 1% on a reported basis and a decrease of 1% on a constant currency basis, including approximately 150 bps of pressure related to the company's strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North American wholesale channel. Coach brand sales increased 1%, including positive North America comp store sales and continued international growth, as Victor and Andre have discussed.
Stuart Weitzman's brand sales were essentially even with prior year in Q1, impacted by wholesale shipment timing. To this end, and as expected, second quarter-to-date, Stuart Weitzman brand sales are up double digits.
Total gross profit totaled $715 million, an increase of 3% versus prior year, while gross margin increased 120 basis points to 68.9%. Coach brand gross profit increased 3% while gross margin increased 120 basis points over prior year to 69.8%, which included about 40 basis points of pressure from currency.
By segment, total North America gross margin increased over prior year, including our directly operated business where both gross profit dollars and gross profit rate grew over prior year. International segment gross margin increased over prior year excluding the negative impact of currency. Stuart Weitzman gross profit rose 2% while gross margin increased approximately 100 basis points over prior year.
Total SG&A expenses increased 1% and approximately in line with sales to $538 million and represented 51.9% of sales as compared to 51.7% in the year ago period. Coach brand SG&A expenses decreased 1% and represented 51.9% of sales compared to 52.7% in the year ago period, an improvement of 80 basis points.
Stuart Weitzman brand SG&A expenses were $45 million compared to $36 million a year ago due to store occupancy costs and the timing of marketing expenses as well as the company's strategic investments in team and infrastructure.
Coach, Inc. operating income rose 7% to $177 million while operating margin increased 100 basis points over prior year to 17% even. Coach brand operating income increased 13% while operating margin increased 200 basis points over prior year to 17.9%. Stuart Weitzman brand operating income of $7 million was down versus prior year based on the timing of net shipments as well as key investments to support long-term multicategory growth as discussed.
Net interest expense was $6 million in the quarter as compared to $7 million in the year ago period. Total net income for the quarter was $126 million compared to $113 million a year ago, with earnings per diluted share of $0.45, up $0.10 versus prior year. 
Now moving to global distribution. In total, we closed a net of 2 Coach brand locations globally in the first quarter to end the period with 952 directly operated locations worldwide. In addition, we opened 2 net Stuart Weitzman directly operated stores to end the quarter with 77 locations. 
In FY '17, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to grow low single digits globally. This guidance assumes that Coach brand directly operated square footage in North America will decline slightly with net store closures in both our retail and outlet channels. Internationally, we expect a mid-single-digit increase in square footage led by significant growth in Europe and a mid-single digit increase in mainland China, partially offset by a high single-digit square footage decline in Japan as well as a modest unit decrease in Hong Kong and Macau. In our other directly operated business in Asia, we expect a little change in both units and square footage. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we expect to open 5 to 10 net new directly operated locations in fiscal year '17. 
Moving on, inventory levels at quarter end were $547 million compared to ending inventory of $575 million a year ago, a decrease of 5%. Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was an outflow of $38 million compared to an inflow of $8 million last year. Our CapEx spending was $68 million in Q1 versus $69 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an outflow of $106 million versus an outflow of $61 million in the same period last year. 
During the quarter, we received approximately $675 million in net proceeds associated with the sale-leaseback of the Hudson Yards building. And as announced, we used a portion of these proceeds to pay down our term loan of approximately $300 million with no prepayment penalty. As such, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $600 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter compared to approximately $900 million a year ago.
At the end of the fiscal quarter, cash and short-term investments stood at $1.5 billion as compared to $1.3 billion a year ago. As a reminder, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $125 million during this fiscal quarter related to the sale of our previous headquarters building on 34th Street.
Turning to our capital allocation policy which has not changed. Our first priority is to continue to invest in our brands as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interests of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders. And third, capital returns. We're committed to our dividend and expect our dividends to grow at least in line with prior year's operational net income growth as our transformation gains momentum. As always, underpinning all of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets.
Now turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2017 on a non-GAAP 52-week versus 52-week basis, which has not changed. So I'll be brief. We still expect total revenues for Coach, Inc. in fiscal 2017 to increase by low to mid-single digits, including an expected benefit from foreign currency of approximately 100 to 150 basis points based on current exchange rates. This continues to assume a positive low single-digit comp for the Coach brand in North America for the year and in each quarter. As a reminder, we would expect Stuart Weitzman top line variability quarter-to-quarter given the nature of the business and its high penetration of wholesale.
In addition, we are maintaining our operating margin forecast for Coach, Inc. of between 18.5% and 19% for fiscal 2017. This guidance incorporates the negative impact of both Stuart Weitzman and the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North American wholesale channel. As an aside, for you modelers out there, we should note that our 2Q will likely include SG&A dollar growth ahead of sales due to the timing of our 75th anniversary celebrations, notably marketing activities surrounding the opening of Fifth Avenue and Regent Street.
We continue to expect interest expense to be in the area of $25 million for the year. The full year fiscal 2017 tax rate is still projected at about 28%. And we expect our average weighted diluted shares outstanding for the year to be in the area of $283 million. Taken together, we are projecting double-digit growth in both net income and earnings per diluted share for the year. And we continue to expect CapEx for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $325 million in FY '17.
In closing, we're very pleased with our performance in the quarter and the consistency of our execution against the volatile backdrop building on the successes we have achieved in our first 2 years of transformation. Importantly, we continue to expect fiscal '17 to be the year when we return to growth across all financials, leveraging top line growth and supported by our operational efficiency initiatives, which we have allowed -- which have allowed us to become a more nimble organization. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth for Coach, Inc. over the long term.
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

In retail, the impact is from broader distribution of Coach 1941 that we've been working on over the last couple of quarters, especially, of course, the continued rollout of our store concept as well as the great work being done by our sales associates with the enhanced service experience. In outlets, as we look to engage with the broader consumer, really proud of the level of innovation. And the team -- as the team has been leveraging a lot of inspiration, both from our retail stores and, as we mentioned, even a few very specific -- outlet specific innovations such as Pac-Man, which has gotten us off to a very good start earlier this quarter.

So when you look at gross margin in the quarter for overall, the Coach brand, there were a couple of areas of benefit and a couple of areas of hit. So starting off on channel mix, channel mix was a positive in the quarter to us. Product mix and costs were actually a very large positive, which we, in turn, returned to consumers in terms of pricing and value, not a complete offset but a partial offset there. And then in terms of the currency impact, currency was a negative impact in the quarter. We talk to about 40 basis points. Interestingly, there was an impact of the yen, and that's really about OCI and the yen hedge loss position in the quarter as well as the negative impact on other Asian currencies and on the R&D in terms of the China currency impact. For North America specifically, North America, gross margin improved in the quarter for the same reasons that I discussed. I'm sure one of the things you're interested in specifically our outlet, North America store, gross margin was actually up in the quarter. So glad that we were able to take the benefit of lower cost. And as I said, returned some but not all of that to the consumer. We did have a small hit in North America from currency. And our guidance for the year does bake out -- bake in these continued benefits from both AUC, or average unit cost, as well as an overall impact of returning that to the North America retail and outlet consumer in terms of pricing. So a nice balance there as we move through the year."

Thank you. In terms of your question on macro, David, obviously, very, very hard to predict as we know the geopolitical impacts most recently, whether it be terrorist attacks and where those happened and the impact that can have are almost impossible to predict. They do lead mostly to, of course, shifts in tourist flows, especially as well as in some markets even short-term to medium-term impacts on domestic demand. The biggest impacts that we have seen outside of those short-term geopolitical have been mostly currency swings. There's been a lot of talk, of course, about the Chinese tourists, where they're increasing and where they're decreasing. We've seen, with the appreciation of the Japanese yen, decreases in tourist spending in Japan. We've seen pickups in Korea. And of course, we have seen pretty strong drop off in mainland Europe, especially in Paris, which is a very important destination. In terms of the categories, we have just, obviously with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman, made a bigger bet on footwear. We're excited about the long-term opportunity in that category for us, a $28 billion opportunity. But generally, into the medium and long term, we continue to believe there is no better space to be in fashion than the handbag and accessory space. We're excited about that as an opportunity, of course, not only in developed markets here in our home market, the U.S., Europe, which is really a greenfield opportunity for us. I could not be more excited about the team that we have on the ground there and the great work they're seeing. We're beginning to see decent traction now, especially with the U.K. domestic consumer. And as well in developing markets, of course, where there's still so much untapped opportunity with growing middle-classes globally. So that's -- I hope, answers your question."

In terms of the progress that we've made, of course, not only with the Coach brand, but now, of course, as a dual-brand company, I couldn't be more excited about our ability to leverage the know-how that we have in Coach to support, of course, Stuart Weitzman. I'm incredibly excited about the new talent that we've recruited to that brand, both the CEO, Wendy Kahn; the Creative Director, Giovanni Morelli, who joins us in this spring. And as we announced today, Daniele Michetti, who joins us as the lead shoe designer reporting into Giovanni. More broadly, in terms of our capital allocation strategy and what could come next, we've been very consistent. We have a tremendous amount of work and opportunity within the Coach brand and the Stuart Weitzman brand. That is our first priority. Our second priority, as you've suggested, is to look at value-additive acquisitions. Of course, we're going to be very selective in acquisitions that allow us to build platforms for long-term growth that allow us to leverage our global infrastructure and organizational capabilities and our skill sets, which is obviously building brands and retail management and a terrific supply chain in our core space. Most importantly, we look for great brands. We're not as committed to any specific nationality. So I would keep that in mind. And you have a second question. I'm sorry, I'm just being reminded in terms of the physical stores and service. I couldn't be, as I mentioned in my response to Bob's question, happier with what the teams are doing across both retail channels. As you've seen, we've driven a positive 4 comp nearly in our bricks-and-mortar stores. I believe that it's not one specific channel or one specific action, Oliver, that leads to the positive results. It's about a total brand experience. We're committed to being very active digitally and engaging with the millennial and, indeed, with the broader consumer that's increasingly engaging online. And we want to provide her with a great experience, whether she decides to shop in our stores or online. What we're being very careful about is managing those promotional impressions, especially in the online channel, which we know is global, transparent and can create a tremendous amount of confusion. And therefore, a lot of the steps that we've taken, both in the online channel and as well, I would say, as we have shared repeatedly in the wholesale channel where we're looking to manage our brand more effectively for long-term growth."

We've called out part due to marketing expenses, but there were also additional items. For example, as you may remember, we bought in the Canadian distributor there. So we had those directly operating expenses of the Canadian stores that we did not have in the year ago period. We also have higher retail occupancy cost. Just like Coach, but of course, it's more magnified for Stuart Weitzman, we have the occupancy of both the Fifth Avenue and Regent Street stores hitting the P&L there in terms of occupancy expense, where we have no sales yet. So we had those as well. There were a couple of other items that impacted it, but it was not only marketing timing, just to keep that in mind. For the year, I would say that our operating margin for Stuart Weitzman should be in the realm of where it ended last year, and that is what we had expected when we entered this year."

So can we just get some perspective on where the -- just at a high level, where we are in the cyclicality peak to trough between the channels because it seems to me that there'd be a lot more gross margin opportunity still left in the outlet channel?

As you may remember, last year, I believe it was in our January call regarding our second December quarter. We talked about outlet promotional activity ratcheting up. We saw that in the competitive environment, ours ratcheted up as well. So we don't lap that until, let's say, partway through this second quarter. So we would continue to see that. Now we are experiencing lower average unit cost, higher initial mark-ups, which is allowing us to fund, if you will, and pass that on to the consumer. But we start to lap that, to your point, through the second quarter. I am fresh out of crystal balls right now, and I'm not sure that we're going to see a significant lessening in the environment in the second half of the year. But presumably over time, we'll be able to actually keep some of those at lower average unit cost on the outlet side. One thing I will mention is we are having and will have for the full year a small benefit associated with the reduction of our sales in our wholesale channel. So that will help. And obviously, we're experiencing lower average unit cost on the retail side as well. And we're seeing nice growth in both AURs and ADT, as Andre talked about. So I think that probably sort of explains what's going on, on the outlet side and what we're looking at for the balance of the year. As you know, that we've reiterated our guidance for the year of 69% to 70%."
