As a reminder for fiscal 2016, we utilized a 52-week comp reporting calendar. For this year, quarter-to-date and year-to-date comps will be-based upon 13 and 52-week periods, respectively. 
Our Q4 reporting period ran from Saturday, October 31, 2015, through Friday, January 29, 2016.

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our fourth quarter earnings, year-end results and progress against our strategy. We had a solid fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.49. It's important to note our numbers reflect some discrete items this quarter, including the impact of store closures and certain tax items, and Brett will share more details in a minute. 
For fiscal year 2016, adjusted EPS was $4.59 and excluding the $17.2 billion impact of currency, we delivered revenue of $499.4 billion, up 2.8%, which is $13.7 billion of growth. 
We continued to be pleased with the fundamental trends. We're making progress with customers and associates and feel good about where we're heading. We're improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening our digital relationships with customers as we work to become the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. We'll save our customers not only money but time, and shopping with us will be simple, convenient and fun. 
I also want to call out our continued commitment to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we were able to return $4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In fact, today, we announced a dividend increase. Our annual dividend was $1.96, and we've increased it to $2 per share. This is the 43rd consecutive year of dividend increases for Walmart. 
Overall, this past year has been a year of investment, operational improvement and change, even while we delivered solid growth. We do see an underlying strength in our Walmart U.S. business that wasn't there a year ago. I want to share a few highlights. As you know, our biggest investments have been in people and technology. On this call one year ago, we announced our investment in higher wages, better training and more department managers to make Walmart U.S. a better place to work and shop. 
We can only be successful with customers with engaged and empowered associates. A few weeks ago, we announced the second part of the wage increase and it's awesome to give a raise to more than 1 million people on the same day. We also announced a simplified paid time off policy that will mean no waiting for associates to use their time off. These and other changes in the business are making a difference. Our customer satisfaction scores have risen significantly this year, and we now have had 6 consecutive quarters of positive comps and 5 straight quarters of positive traffic at Walmart U.S. 
In the technology and eCommerce space, we continued to innovate with a focus on the customer. We have developed a new platform that we can scale across the business. We have improved our fulfillment capabilities with new fulfillment centers that are helping us get orders to customers doors faster and more efficiently. And we continue to see growth in store pickup for online orders. 
We also expanded online grocery shopping to over 150 locations across more than 20 markets in the U.S. Customers are ordering online and on their phones and then picking up their groceries on our parking lots without ever leaving their cars. 
Customer satisfaction for those who use our free pickup service is in the high 90s. We are learning some interesting things along the way. We found that 8 to 9:00 p.m. is one of the most popular times customers order groceries online, usually once the kids go to bed. We also see a healthy number of orders in the middle of the night. These may be parents comforting or feeding infants and ordering more diapers or formula to pick up the next day. 
While it's been a while since my kids were that age, I remember those days well and I absolutely love that we're able to offer convenience and blend in to our customers lives when they need us most. 
I'm also excited about the introduction of Walmart pay, and I was very proud of how different parts of our company worked together on it with a relentless focus on customer experience. I look forward to us rolling it out this coming year. 
We recently aligned our technology teams because we want more speed and more customer-centric and cost-efficient innovations like this one. We will deliver one Walmart experience to our customers. 
Additionally, we took steps this quarter to sharpen the focus of our portfolio. As part of this continuing portfolio review process, we looked at all of our stores from both a financial and strategic standpoint. One of the key takeaways for me was how strong our portfolio really is in that we only closed stores representing less than 1% of our global revenue and square footage. I'm pleased but not surprised that we have already found open positions for more than half of the impacted associates in the U.S. and we're moving aggressively to identify other open positions for the remaining associates who are interested in transferring to new locations. 
So we're doing what we said we'd do and we're on the right path. Still, we know we have a lot more work to do and there are areas of the business that are not where they need to be. Let's look more closely at each of the segments. 
Walmart U.S. is on firm ground. We had comp sales of 0.6 % on top of last year's 1.5% comp for the fourth quarter. As we lapped positive comps, we accelerated on a 2-year stack basis. We also had continued strong performance from Neighborhood Markets. 
In addition to our investments in our associates, we're getting better at the fundamentals of retail and managing the business better. We are reducing comp store inventory and improving our in-stock performance. We also had a sound plan for the holiday season that ensured customers could rely on us for low prices throughout the season, not just at big moments. Walmart International again delivered solid financial performance. 9 of our 11 markets delivered positive comps for the quarter and I'm the very encouraged by the results overall. Walmart in particular is in a good groove again and Canada delivered strong performance. Although we faced near-term headwinds with the economy in China, our business there is on track. Brazil, however, is proving to be an increasingly challenging economic environment and the competitive intensity in the U.K. continues to increase. As we review and act on our portfolio, we also announced that we are exploring selling both our clothing chain, called suburbia, in Mexico, and a property company in Chile. Our International business is healthy and growing. 
Global eCommerce sales and gross merchandise value, GMV, globally grew approximately 8% in the fourth quarter. For the year, sales grew 12% and GMV grew 13%. The holiday season gave a good preview of how all the pieces we're putting in place will come together. We saw strong online sales in the U.S. on the big days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, and nearly half of our customers bought their online orders on a mobile device. 
We also saw growth in store pickup in online grocery. We have faced specific challenges in our largest eCommerce markets outside the U.S. Economic softness in Brazil and China continued to weigh on growth and we have been in a transition phase at Yihaodian since acquiring full ownership. As mentioned before, the environment in the U.K. remains extremely competitive and it's important to remember our eCommerce business in the U.K. is a food delivery and pickup business. 
In the U.S., we plan to build on the foundation we've built by delivering a significant assortment expansion and faster delivery at a lower cost this year. We need more GMV growth from our eCommerce business. Sam's Club is in the early days with its new strategy. Comps for the quarter were below what we anticipated, and food, in particular, underperformed outside of the holiday periods. We're pleased with the work so far to addres  the fundamentals of the business, to improve merchandising and drive new membership, but we have more to do. There are encouraging signs in our membership numbers. 
As we address issues with the core business, we're excited by growth in new areas. For example, Club Pickup continued to be the fastest growing right of the business. 
Finally, even as we focus on our customers and our associates, we were reminded a few weeks ago about the opportunity we had to lead in our communities. Walmart, Coca-Cola, Nestlé and PepsiCo announced we will collectively donate water to meet the needs of over 10,000 school children in Flint, Michigan for the balance of the calendar year. 
Whether it's hiring veterans, supporting U.S. manufacturing or driving new renewable energy production, we have strengths that can help others in important ways. 
During the first quarter, we will release our annual global responsibility report alongside our annual report, to share more on how we're making a difference. Leading on social and environmental issues is good for our business, for our shareholders and for the world, and we will continue to move the needle this year. 
In summary, we continue to believe we are putting the right foundation in place to better serve customers, deliver stronger sales growth and ultimately, strengthen bottom line performance. 
As we begin this new year, I'm focused on continuing the momentum in our U.S. stores, getting all the ingredients in place for stronger growth in eCommerce and the strategic choices related to how we put them together. I'm also mindful of the need for balance. Improving productivity as we grow, is important. Brett will talk through our full year forecast with the first quarter being the most pressured from an earnings point of view due to timing of the incremental wage investments. This will be another year where we digest foundational investments and it's important that we build on what we've started as we go through the year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Greg."

Over the last 12 months, we've laid out our plan to win in the U.S. now and in the future. We are executing against it and have taken several steps towards delivering on our commitment of growing the top line, increasing market share and delivering shareholder value. 
We've still got a lot of work to do, but I'm pleased that our fourth quarter results demonstrated solid progress against this plan. Across the key metrics we track to measure our progress, we're right where we expected to be. Comp sales were positive for the sixth straight quarter and driven by our fifth straight quarter of positive traffic. 
Our customers are increasingly pleased with the changes in our stores in there letting us and others know through improvements in the Net Promoter Score and improved customer experience feedback. In fact, and then end of this fiscal year, more than 75% of stores had met or exceeded their customer experience goals set back at the beginning of the year. 
This was a significant improvement over the 16% that we're meeting this mark at the beginning of the fiscal year. Additionally, our associates are more engaged and turnover is lower. Department managers have been hired in key areas of the stores and our new training programs are underway. New technology is in our associates' hands and better processes are creating efficiencies in the stores, driving higher in stocks and a continuing decline in comp store inventory. 
As we've discussed, there will be more investments necessary to further deliver on our plan, but we've remained on task and we're seeing progress. 
Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I want to address 2 announcements we've made recently. First, we announced the second phase of our 2-year, $2.7 billion investment in our associates. Just 2 days from now, on February 20th, we'll raise the starting wage to at least $10 per hour for hourly associates hired before January 1, 2016. 
Additionally, we're continuing to simplify our business and enhance our benefits package by shifting to a paid time off policy for all associates. These changes, along with our previous announcements around training programs and store structure, are exciting for all our associates. 
We're providing our people with a ladder of opportunity to build a career with Walmart and to provide great service to our customers. 
Secondly, in January, we announced the closing of 150 U.S. stores, including all 102 of our express format locations. Closing stores is never an easy decision. But it's necessary to ensure we are positioned to deliver our long-term plan. 
Strengthening the supercenter and Neighborhood Market formats while simultaneously delivering a seamless experience with eCommerce, will require our full attention. In fact, we expect to open more than 135 stores in fiscal 2017 alone. 
While we know that closing stores affected a number of our associates, I'm proud to say that more than half of these associates have already received offers or have been placed in open roles in nearby stores, and we're moving aggressively to identify other open positions for the remaining associates who are interested in transferring to new locations. 
Due to the financial impact of the store closures, our reported results differ significantly from the adjusted results in the underlying business performance. As reported, we incurred $729 million in charges related to these store closures. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude the impact of store closures for purposes of comparability. 
For reported results, including the impact of store closures and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript. 
Moving to our fourth quarter results. Net sales grew $1.9 billion or 2.4%, and comp store sales were up 0.6%. We're pleased with the continued growth in customer traffic, which improved 0.7% this quarter, on top of last year's 1.4% traffic gain. On a 2-year stack basis, our fourth quarter comp sales improved to 2.1%. 
While customers benefited from lower gas prices, we experienced significant headwinds from deflation in meat and dairy products. Additional sales pressure came from warmer than normal temperatures early in the quarter and delays in IRS tax refund checks impacted the very end of the quarter. 
Neil will cover our eCommerce initiatives in more detail in this call. But for this quarter, eCommerce contributed approximately 30 basis points to our comp. 
Overall, we were pleased with our performance over the 6-week holiday season. We made a strategic decision to sensibly pull back on short-term, deep price investments, as we looked to simplify the experience of both our customers and associates and shift back towards a more EDLP focus. 
Investments in eCommerce fulfillment centers allowed us to extend the shipping cutoff date and customers took full advantage of pickup, ordering their gifts online and conveniently picking them up alongside their grocery trips. 
As we approached the end of the season, customers transitioned from online to in-store, and we delivered, driving strong performance across the box as customers stocked up on last-minute gifts and food for their holiday meals. 
The supercenter format delivered its sixth straight positive comp in the fourth quarter. Additionally, our traditional format, Neighborhood Markets, continued their strong performance, delivering a 7% comp. We're seeing steady progress in our efforts to improve each of these formats with a focus on fresh offerings, clean stores, fast checkouts, friendly associates and better in stocks. 
We're pleased with our progress in grocery, which saw a positive comp this quarter, led by improvement in consumables. As I mentioned earlier, we experienced substantial deflation in both meat and dairy, which resulted in slight deflation across all the food. We estimate this deflation negatively impacted our segment comp by approximately 100 basis points relative to last year's comps. 
Our grocery business delivered positive comp traffic growth, even while lapping positive comp traffic from last year. We continue to push forward with our win in fresh initiatives, including testing new layouts, reducing inventory, while improving in stocks in both food and consumables, and exceeding expectations in our urgent agenda items such as reducing waste and throwaways. 
We still have work to do in our fresh area, and many things we want to accomplish in the upcoming year, but we remain on track. 
In our general merchandise areas, apparel improved throughout the quarter after a slow start due to warmer than usual temperatures. 
On trend assortments, particularly in active wear, drove results in this area. In entertainment, we continue to experience soft wireless sales and a slower adoption of new technology in televisions. 
We're continuing to make progress in this space by focusing on our operating model, including service to our customers, assortment and department layout, but it will take time to get it right. 
Across the rest of the general merchandise and home categories, solid performance came from better end stocks, assortment updates and new products. 
Finally, health and wellness remained a positive comp driver for us, with growth coming from branded drug inflation and better in stocks in OTC. However, a slower flu season created headwind to our cold, cough and flu business this quarter. 
Moving to the remainder of our financials, gross margin was up 69 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in food, general merchandise and consumables. This was somewhat offset by the declines in health and wellness, although we're still focused on providing better visibility and tools to help combat ongoing pharmacy reimbursement pressures. Transportation costs were helped by lower fuel rates. 
Additionally, our intentional pullback on deep price investments during the holiday season meaningfully improved margins in entertainment. Lastly, we made additional progress on our urgent agenda items, focused on reducing cost, both in how we operate the business and in procuring merchandise; and remained diligent on improving processes related to shrink. 
As expected, expenses increased 129 basis points from the fourth quarter, driven by our investments in associates and stores, including transitioning to a new paid time off policy, along with building out our eCommerce capabilities. However, we did a better job of aligning store labor hours with customer traffic by leveraging efficiencies gained from new processes and technology. The increase in expenses was partially offset by the improvements in gross margin, which resulted in an operating income decline of 5.3%. We continue to make progress in managing inventory. Overall inventory grew 0.9% or approximately 25% the rate of total sales growth. Comp store inventory declined 2.9%, as we remained focused on cleaning up our backrooms and using processes such as CAP and top stock to ensure better in stocks for our customers. Inventory will remain a key focus area for us in this new fiscal year. 
Fiscal 2016 has been a year of redefinition: redefining our goals, redefining our focus and redefining our future. We've been intentional in our design and in our actions, and these actions have resulted in steady progress. 
To recap our performance for the year, net sales increased by $10.3 billion or 3.6%. Comp store sales grew 1.2%, driven by a 1.2% growth in comp traffic. eCommerce contributed approximately 25 basis points to our comp performance. Gross margin improved 14 basis points for the year, helped by our ongoing focus on urgent agenda items and lower transportation costs, partially offset by headwinds from shrink and pharmacy reimbursement pressures. However, the investments in our associates, stores and eCommerce drove expenses up 8.3% versus last year, which resulted in an operating income decline of 7.1%. 
We opened 69 supercenters in this year, including relocations and conversions, and 146 traditional format Neighborhood Markets. In '17, we expect to open 50 to 60 supercenters, including relocations and conversions. we'll also open 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets. Additionally, we plan to further expand our online grocery program to more markets this year. 
As we have discussed in the past, we are committed to growth but we'll do it sensibly, with the customer in mind as we select the right locations, products and service offerings for each store. 
We know the decisions we've made this year to improve our business pressured the bottom line, but we're confident they were in the best interest of our customers, our associates and our shareholders. We believe in our long-term plan, and we remain on track to achieve these goals. In the new fiscal year, we're continuing to March down the path we've laid out. Our initiatives across the box are gaining steam and a look forward to drive improvements in assortment and pricing, while focusing on building a seamless shopping experience across all channels. We've just held our annual year beginning meeting in Indianapolis with nearly 7,000 of our operations and merchandising associates. I told the team that I was proud of their hard work and progress last year, and this year, we would build upon that as we work to execute with excellence. 
In fact, we've raised the bar higher with a new annual goals in our stores to drive an even cleaner, faster and friendlier customer experience as the year goes on. We expect of these efforts, along with the ongoing investments in our stores and our associates, to drive continued growth in the top line. Lower fuel prices will also provide some tailwinds. However, for deflation, which has accelerated in the last 6 weeks, will remain a challenge. Given these factors, for the 13 week period ended April 29, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase of around 50 basis points. Last year's 13 week comp ended May 1, 2015, increased 1.1%. 
As a reminder, the investments in our associates will be an expense headwind this year, most significantly in the first quarter, as we implement Phase II of these investments prior to lapping last year's Phase I implementation, which started in April. However, we will continue to focus on lowering costs through better buying and operating a better business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?"

We're delivering our strategy, seeing comp sales improve and bringing in profit ahead of our expectations. Most our performance was driven by Walmex and Canada, our results reflect broad achievement. 9 of our 11 markets had positive comps this quarter and 7 of the markets have now maintained positive comps for at least 7 quarters in a row. We continue to see headwinds in the U.K, China Brazil, which I'll discuss more in a moment. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities, which are to: actively manage the existing portfolio, deliver a balanced growth, with a lowest cost operator, and to build strong foundations in talent, trust and technology. 
In terms of the portfolio, we announced the closure of 115 small, underperforming stores in Brazil and other Latin American markets. Whilet these are difficult decisions for our markets and associates, it better positions us for growth in the right formats and geographies. Recently, we also announced that we're pursuing the sale of our suburbia apparel business in Mexico and were in the process of selling our shopping centers in Chile. These are successful businesses but aren't the part of our portfolio strategy. These changes would help drive greater some percent to our operations and an increased focus on our strategic priorities. For balanced growth, imp leased with our comp trends. We look forward forward to opening between 200 and 240 stores this year across our portfolio, while at the same time, expanding our reach in eCommerce. Our lowest cost operator initiative is focused on two key areas: cost of goods sold and overhead reductions. On cost of goods sold, we started a cost analytics program that provides improved tools and cost visibility to our merchants, which enables them to lead fact-based negotiations with suppliers. We're pleased with early results from this program in Canada and in the U.K. and will expand the program to additional markets later this year. Now let's discuss our overall results. 
In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3.3% on a constant currency basis, slightly higher than last quarter. Reported net sales declined 9.7 %, impacted by a $4.7 billion currency headwind from continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As mentioned, went a strong quarter for comp sales. In our 5 largest markets, Mexico, Canada and Brazil reported positive comps, while the U.K. and China reported negative comps. All other markets had solid, positive comp sales. 
Operating income declined 7.8% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacted by $215 million in charges, $153 million on a reported basis, related to previously announced store closures. Excluding this and certain other charges this year, such as restructuring cost, as well as last year store closure costs in Japan, operating income would have increased. 
On a reported basis, operating income declined 19%. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than net sales at 4.2%. This increase was driven primarily by China, where inventory increased in preparation for Chinese New Year. on a reported basis, inventory declined 10.2%. 
For the full year, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis with improved comp sales, on top of 3.6% growth last year. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had a significant impact of $17.1 billion on our reported results, by far the largest one year impact in our history, resulting in a net sales decline of 9.4% on a reported basis. Full year operating income declined 1% on a constant currency basis, driven by store closures this quarter. Excluding this and last year's store closure costs in Japan, operating income would have increased. 
On a reported basis, operating income declined the 113.4%. Now let's discuss the fourth quarter results for our largest markets presented on a concurrency basis. 
In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of eCommerce. Let's start with Mexico, which was the biggest driver of this quarter's results. Walmex released its earnings on February 16th under IFRS, while results here are under U.S. GAAP, so some numbers may differ. 
Walmex net sales increased 9.3%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico net sales grew 9.7% and comp sales increased 8.6% driven by increased customer spending and solid execution from our stores. 
Self-service was particularly strong, with comp sales of 8.8% while the rest of the market, according to grew only 4.9%. Sam's Club also had its best performance of the year, delivering comp sales of 7%, driven by strong sales from advantage or nonbusiness members. 
Operating income declined versus last year, driven by a planned reduction in our gross profit rate. 
Let's next discuss Canada, which had another strong sales quarter. Net sales grew 5.8%, benefiting by strong customer traffic as a result of our improved fresh offer, continued price investments in improvement in operational standards. Comp sales were 4.3%, our seventh consecutive quarter in positive territory. I'm, especially pleased with our sales in Canada, given the economic pressures in the oil-producing provinces. We had positive market share gains in food, consumables and health and wellness for the 12 weeks ended January 23, according to Nielsen. Our online sales continue to grow and perform well. Operating income was down versus last year due to certain land impairments and pre-opening expenses for 13 previously announced stores acquired from a former competitor. Ixcluding these impacts, open Inc. would have been positive. 
Let's talk now about the U.K. which continues to face challenging market conditions. Grocery market sales fell .2 percent in the 12 weeks ended January according to Cantar. This was driven by price deflation of 1.8% as a result of intense competition and was the 17th consecutive period with deflation. The big 4 grocers been under pressure as discounters continued to grow and gain share. In the U.K, we're striking a balance between investment in the customer offer, profit and cash flow. Overall, net sales declined 4.4% and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 5.5%, driven by declines in our large store format and in our food business, partially offset by continued growth in online grocery. We decided not to participate in Black Friday discounting, which impacted our comp sales, but helped profitability and allowed greater focus on operational standards in the customer offer in the core food business. We delivered strong cash performance as a result of a disciplined management of CapEx and working capital. That's because is focused on repositioning its business through project renewal, which will simplify operations, lead to substantial reduction in costs and allow for significant investments in customer value. As part of this project, we're deploying a new cost analytics program to aid with buying. We're also joining EMD, a European buying alliance, and we recently completed the purchase of 2 meat processing businesses. These actions will help increase buying efficiencies and remove costs from the supply chain, prickly for private label products. The U.K. also completed a restructuring of this Home Office, adding a bit of increasing focus and improving operational agility. 
In addition, the U.K. will invest in additional $500 million starting pounds in price through the period of its 5 year strategy, on top of the $1 billion pounds previously committed. We're taking aggressive actions, and we're focused on repositioning our offering to meet the changing needs of our customers. In China, despite ongoing economic challenges and slower GDP growth, the continued to gain share for the 12th consecutive quarter in the hypermarket channel, according to Nielsen. Net sales grew 0.3 percent, driven by new store openings and improved performance from completed remodels. Comp sales fell 3%, in part due to warmer weather and disappointing sales in winter seasonal categories. Will continue to make progress in building a platform for sustainable growth in China. We're benefiting from our earlier actions to centralize our buying offices and build out our supply chain. We've improved our gross margin rate and have realized benefits for productivity initiatives, while investing in labor and customer experience. We can see momentum building as performance in fresh has improved in recent quarters in both sales and margin. Operating income continues to grow faster than sales. 
The team in China is focused on delivering a trusted shopping experience through both physical and digital channels. Starting to see the benefits from tighter collaboration with the Haugen. In Shenzhen and Guangzhou, Walmart now leverages a healthy and's last mile network for online orders, which has led to greater delivery capacity. Overall we're excited about the actions we've taken in China that are setting us up for long term growth. 
In Brazil, we continue to face political and economic instability. The deterioration in the macro environment, combined with persistent, high inflation, continues to put a strain on customers. Net sales grew 1.2% and comps grew 0.8 percent in a retail market that contracted by 5.7%, according to Serasa Experian. We were encouraged by another quarter of double digit growth in our wholesale business, mostly offset by continued softness in the hypermarket format. Operating income was down versus last year, driven by the cost to close the 60 stores announced excluding store closure costs, operating income would have been relatively flat to last year. 
We're seeing positive results from some of our information initiatives, such as repositioning the customer proposition in our wholesale business, we're still work to be done. Brazil's a focused for the year ahead will be to finalize store closures, revise and reposition the customer proposition for our hypermarket format and complete integration of systems and processes in our stores. We are committed to turnaround efforts in this important market. 
As I wrap up, let's recognize the efforts of our dedicated international associates operating in 28 countries around the globe that helped us achieve consistently good results throughout the year. I'm confident in the management teams we have leading our markets and the strategic priorities we have in place to drive further growth in the year ahead. Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?"

I'll start today's call with details around our fourth quarter performance. I'll also update an update on how we have begun to execute against our strategy that I detailed during our third quarter earnings call. At Sam's Club, we remain laser-focused another members. Through investments we've made and will continue to make, in people and technology, we will deliver for our members a seamless shopping experience across our app, our site and our clubs. Let's begin by talking about our fourth quarter results. It's important to note that our reported results were negatively impacted by certain charges totaling approximately $77 million. This amount includes a charge for approximately $57 million, resulting from our decision to close underperforming clubs. 
The remainder of the charges includes a policy change related to paid time off as well as severance ooand other cost associated with recently announced organizational enhancements. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with farewell and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript. Comp sales for the fourth quarter were below our expectations. Save her winter storms significantly disrupted approximately 200 clubs towards the end of the quarter, which resulted in a negative impact to the comps of approximately 30 basis points. That said, we know that our core comp performance can improve and it will. The work we have underway, which I'll talk about in just a bit, it is designed in part to improve the fundamentals of our business, specifically membership and merchandising. For broadly speaking, trends that we saw throughout the year were again prevail and during the quarter. On the most notable items were: softness in food, prime as a result of a minimal level of inflation or in some instances, deflation in key categories; an impact to grocery as we begin to evolve the assortment; and challenges in the technology and entertainment area from a deliberate transition in space reallocation, along with pressures in wireless. Yet we know that there we have seen innovation in the assortment and in service offerings, we have seen success. I'll talk more about our merchandise categories in a moment. Net sales decreased 0.1% as comp sales declined .5% as company sales declined 0.5% percent. Slide 10 of the financial presentation provides the components of our comp sales. We were pleased with the performance of our savings members as positive momentum in traffic continued, but softness from our business member negatively impacted our results. Gross profit rate decreased 4 basis points from last year. We continued to invest in membership value through price and our cash rewards program. Operating expenses deleveraged during the quarter. As expected, investments in people and technology pressured our expenses. Additionally, charges for the items I mentioned earlier impacted Q4. Excluding these items, operating expense as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat compared with last year. Membership income increased 5.6% during Q4. Plus renewals increased 35% over last year, and we continue to see a favorable trend of renewal rates for plus members. The value of a Sam's Club membership is clear. Our targeted marketing programs resulted in new membership acquisitions that accelerated each of the last 3 quarters versus last year. 
Let's turn now to our merchandising categories. I'll provide details on areas that were materially impactful to the quarter. Please see slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories. In fresh, freezer, Kohler, deflationary trends continued particularly in fresh meat and dairy. We saw positive results in produce, yet headwinds from the remainder of the category proved too much to overcome. 
Dry grocery in areas of fresh experienced pressures from deflation. As we continue to expand our private brand, generate more newness and reallocate space, these areas are gaining member acceptance but we'll take careful handling and coordination. Technology, entertainment, office had some bright spots with new items in TVs and wearables, both of which performed well online and in clubs. Wireless installment plans continue to place pressure on the category. 
When we innovate, we see good results. in health and wellness and consumables, our free benefit program in pharmacy is helping to lift the total category. Services are important to our members and they reward us when we deliver in this space. The technology services company, IMS Health, measures our market share of the 5 free scripts in the program. According to IMS, we grew share by 11 basis points for the 3 months ended December 31, 2015, and our share is nearly 25 basis points higher than it was prior to the launch of the program. Free for 10 was also a strong contributor to membership upgrades plus since the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Moving on to eCommerce. This year, we made the decision to push many of our holiday events online, and we were pleased with the response from our members. Our Holiday Savings Celebration on November 14 drove good results and they were pleased with other events, including Cyber Monday. During the quarter, traffic to our site increased by 7% versus the prior year and the conversion improved by 18%. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in our pure eCommerce and mobile commerce capabilities. We're also excited about the integration of our digital and physical offerings. 
During Q4, Club Pickup increased 46% over last year and it now represents the fastest growing piece of our business. Members want to shop with Sam's Club how and where they choose and we're building the infrastructure across multiple channels to deliver that experience.  
On our call from Q3, I talked about a new strategy. During Q4, we began to execute against that strategy in important ways, including: additional organizational enhancements that will better align talent with critical needs; portfolio management through the closure of underperforming clubs; an extensive review of merchandise categories; and the expansion of private label brands in key areas. 
These are only a few examples, and we have many other work streams underway. The totality of these efforts will address the fundamentals of our business, including membership and merchandising, as well as deliver new services and offerings. 
As I think about guidance for the first quarter, I'm reminded that although we have accomplished a great deal over the previous months, it remains early days in our transformation. As a result, comp sales without fuel for the 13 week period ending April 29 2016. are expected to be around flat. Let me close today with a few thoughts. First, the new alignment of our organization will position the business to better serve our members. It was a significant step in our transformation, and we will begin to see the benefits of the coming quarter. 
Secondly, our new Chief Merchandising Officer has conducted a compress of review of our merchandise based on identified markets, and what he has gleaned from our strategy work. We're excited about his early insights at this stage. I'm confident we're taking the business in the right direction now and for the future. Through a disciplined, refined approach to growth, we will deliver, for our members, a seamless shopping experience across app, site and cloud. Now I'll turn the call over to Neil. Neil?"

I want to pick up on Doug's comments about our opportunity to be the first to offer a seamless shopping experience at a scale that only Walmart can deliver. eCommerce at Walmart is about bringing together all of the pieces to help customers buy the items they want at Walmart prices, however, and wherever they want. Our customers look at us as  1 Walmart, 1 easy experience across our app, site and store or cloud. In a short span, we've built an eCommerce technology company inside of Walmart. We have rolled out a new technology platform, and we've dramatically increased our physical distribution network. And and just the past 6 months, we've grown to serve over 20 markets with online grocery. 
During the fourth quarter, we started to get a glimpse into how these capabilities we've put into place are starting to come together to deliver the seamless customer experience. Looking forward, we're focused on 3 big opportunities: continuing to build a digital relationship with our customers, scaling our online assortment and expanding online grocery. 
For the quarter, Global eCommerce sales and the GMV, both grew at 8%. For the full year, sales grew 12% and GMV grew 13%. As we discussed in October, growth continues to be pressured by weakness in Brazil, china and the U.K, due to macroeconomic and competitive challenges. 
In China, we have rebut the leadership team since taking full ownership and they continue to build on the strength of their mobile engagement with customers and increasing business through imported products. There is work to do there what we are taking actions to improve the business and accelerate growth in one of our key markets. In Brazil, The team has been waving to develop growth in both the during an economically challenging pure you that we expect to continue throughout the fiscal year. 
In the U.S., with we to grow the business and created a more seamless experience for our customers across our app, our site and our store. Looking more closely at holiday in the U.S. Saw strong sales on the big das from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday but What was most exciting was how our new capability the started to deliver seamless shopping for customers. As customers shopped on Walmart.com, our new platform was powering the front nd backend shopping experience for the first time during holiday. Despite the capacity of a complete platform rebuild, Pangaea handled the intense holiday volume. Customers could order gifts even closer to Christmas this year and they saw our best on-time delivery rates ever, thanks to our new fulfillment centers. While the FCS opened just a few months before holiday, they lived up to our targets for efficiency and productivity, which of the they can scale with our business and completed our stores, DCs and transportation network to deliver speed, efficiency and better experiences for customers. 
Customers could also get their online orders the same day in stores, and we saw nearly a 40% jump in store pickup  the holidays. There were also able to blend our online and stores to serve customers how and where they were shopping 1 great example was on the morning of Black Friday, when we saw a smart TV sell out online within 20 minutes. Went another TV from that supplier available in stores so we dialed up the promotion on Walmart.com in made it did available for store pickup. The item quickly sold out in stores. To customers, it was a seamless access to a gift they wanted. It was a great example of the power of combining online with stores in close proximity to customers. Customers were also using our app to shop seamlessly across online and stores. We offered early access to the Black Friday circular on the mobile app for the first time, and and the app jumped to the number one spot the Apple App Store that day. Customers also showed they are now comfortable buying on their phone. This year, more than half of online sales were on a mobile device on Thanksgiving, which was double last year. We saw significant growth in mobile sales for the rest of the peak holiday period. With our app, customers were also able to create wish lists, check-in for store pickup and pick up item locations in the stores. We continue to build on that app experience in the quarter with another powerful tool, Walmart pay. We started testing it in a small group of stores and the initial feedback from customers reinforced that the experience was simple and easy. Walmart based the perfect example of how our app gives customers a seamless experience that merges digital and physical to make shopping faster and easier and gives customers a reason to form a digital relationship with Walmart. It was also a great example of how our teams aligned to deliver these experiences in just a few months. 
At SamsClub.com, we started the holidays with a big kickoff event on November 14, which delivered a triple digit comp for today. We also saw strong comps and record sales on the biggest days of the holiday season. closed pickup continues to be a delighter for members, and we saw it hit an all-time high in December. We saw strong growth in both desktop and mobile conversion and mobile purchases nearly tripled over last year. SamsClub.com has also continued to drive growth in digital member sign-ups. As a look at critical touch points that meld our app, site and store, we obviously think about online grocery. In October, we announced we were expanding from 5 markets to over 20. We've rolled out to those additional markets, and we're continuing to see the strong emotional response it triggers with customers and the very personal relationship there forming with Walmart. Customers are literally jumping out of their cars to rave about it and want of my recent favorites was a mom with 2 kids in the back of her car. She told us about how much easier it has made her life because she can shop where and when it's convenient and then drive up and just get her groceries. 
She placed her order while she was relaxing and watching her kids play. Customers are inviting us into the fabric of their lives. In just a few months, we've dramatically increased online grocery and look for us to continue expanding this year. 
Behind all the capabilities we're delivering are some of the best technologists in the world. The built an eCommerce technology company's inside of Walmart. We've always had one of the strongest enterprise technology organizations. Those teams have worked closely to deliver experiences like online grocery and Walmart pay that seamlessly merge that we're bringing over those teams under a single technology banner. This aligns all of our technology is with how our customers see us, One Walmart. I'm excited about the building blocks we've put in place for the future and it was a starting to serve customers seamlessly across our app, site and store. We've replatformed our technology and physical distributional, while continuing to grow our business. And we've quickly grown online grocery. This year, focus on 3 areas: continuing to build a digital range with our customers, scaling our online assortment and expanding online grocery. All these will combine to offer customers compelling experiences that let them shop seamlessly with Walmart in ways that help them save money and save time. As we deliver that seamless experience across our app, site and store, we're building deeper relationships with customers. This relationship is key to building value for the enterprise.

I'll wrap up today by providing some thoughts on the company's performance in fiscal year 2016 as well as our expectations for fiscal year 2017. Before we jump into guidance, I want to highlight a few items from the quarter and the year. Overall, we are pleased with the way have ended fiscal year 2016. In the fourth quarter, Walmart U.S. comps us increased 0.6%\  representing the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales in the fifth straight quarter of positive traffic. For the year, Walmart International delivered another solid financial performance of the strong results in Canada and at Walmex. We generated full year cost of currency revenue growth of nearly $14 billion or 2.8%. Currency impacted our full year revenue by over $17 billion. We continue to innovate to make progress towards a seamless shopping experience through a number of initiatives, including an increased number of online grocery markets. While we would have liked to see higher eCommerce sales growth this quarter, we continued to make good foundational progress for the future. 
For the year, we generated approximately $27 billion in operating cash flow, which speaks to our continued Francis chance as we transform the company. I'm particularly pleased with our inventory performance in Walmart U.S.. During the year, we returned over $10 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We were able to deliver consistent returns the shareholders while investing for the future. ROI decreased to 15.5%, primarily due to lower operating income as well as continued capital investments. Additionally, today, we announced an increase in our dividend from $1.96 per share to $2 per share in fiscal 2017. Now increased our dividend for 43 consecutive years. Not I would like to spend some time statistically on our EPS results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016. Fourth quarter and full year adjusted EPS were $1.49 and $4 dollars $0.59, respectively. Our reported EPS for the same periods were $1.43 and $4.57, respectively. Let me briefly discuss the discrete items that were factored into our adjusted EPS. 
Recall in January, we announced the closure of 269 stores globally. Charges for these store closures, which impact both the fourth quarter and full year earnings, resulted in a negative impact of $0.20 per share. Also, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year benefited from the December passage by Congress of the tax extenders legislation, which we considered in our fourth quarter guidance. However, the fourth quarter and full year effective tax rate also benefited by $0.14 per share related to other discrete tax items in the quarter. 
Finally, our full year adjusted EPS also excludes the effects of a benefit of approximately $0.04 from an adjustment for certain leases we disclosed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Now let's shift gears and discuss fiscal year 2017 guidance. We remain confident that the investments we're making in our associates, our stores in our digital capabilities are the right ones and are better preparing Walmart for the future. It's also important to note that although we continued to invest in these important areas for the future, we will remained focused on managing expenses across the company. Our guidance today includes several important assumptions, including that the economic conditions in our largest markets remain generally consistent and that the currency exchange rates remain at current levels. From a capital standpoint as we indicated at our October investor meeting, we expect capital investments to be approximately $11 billion in fiscal year 2017, down from fiscal year 2016. Currency remains a headwind for our business as it is for many U.S. multinational companies. Today, we expect a currency headwind of approximately $12 billion on net sales for fiscal year 2017. Additionally, currency is expected to impact EPS we approximately $0.10 per share this year, including approximately $0.03 in the first quarter. 
Now let's turn to full year sales growth guidance. In October, we guided that on a constant currency basis, net sales would grow 3% to 4% annually over the next 3 years. Excluding the impact of the recently announced store closures and the continuing impact of a strengthening US dollars, our fiscal 2017 sales growth guidance would have remained in that same range. However, including store closures and the impact of the just the U.S. dollar, we now expect net sales growth to be relatively flat in fiscal year 2017. As for taxes, our earnings per share guidance is based on the fiscal 2017 estimated tax rate ranging between 31.5% and 33.5%. As is of the norm, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in laws, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. In any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. 
I also want to note that historically, that tax extenders legislation has been approved at the and of each year, impacting the fourth quarter tax rate. In the December legislation, many of the relevant tax provisions were either made permanent or passed through 2019. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2019, the benefits of extenders will be spread across the full year better than all being in the fourth quarter. Other discrete items as described above may still cause the effective tax rate to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Taking into account the producing mentioned assumptions, including currency rates at today's levels, tax rate and the incremental wage investments of $1.5 billion, we expect the full year fiscal 2017 EPS to range between $4 and $4.30. This most closely compares to our adjusted earnings per share of $4.59 in fiscal year 2016 and is broadly in line with our guidance from October for earnings per share to be down 6% above percent in fiscal year 2017. With respect to the first quarter, Vicksburg earnings per share to range between $0.80 and $0.95. With respect to the first quarter, this compares to the $1.03 we reported last year. When comparing to last were's EPS, it's important to note that the first quarter of this year will be impacted somewhat more on a year-over-year basis than subsequent quarters due to the timing of wage investments. In closing, I am honored to serve as a the chief old during this very exciting time at Walmart. All of us at Walmart we're pleased with the progress we're making and the work the work of our with associates at on the world's. We look forward to building on that in serving our customers in the future."

Then we'll cover the 3 operating segments starting with: Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Walmart International; and then Roz Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club; next, Neil Ashe, President and CEO of Global eCommerce & Technology, is joining us this quarter to share insights regarding our investments in e-commerce; and last, Brett Biggs, Walmart's CFO, will wrap up with context around the financial results, along with guidance for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2017.  
Now I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug?"

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our fourth quarter earnings, year-end results and progress against our strategy. We had a solid fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year with adjusted earnings p",1667,"Thanks, Pauline, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our fourth quarter earnings, year-end results and progress against our strategy. 
We had a solid fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year with adjusted earnings per share of $1.49. It's important to note our numbers reflect some discrete items this quarter, including the impact of store closures and certain tax items. And Brett will share more details in a minute. For fiscal year 2016, adjusted EPS was $4.59. And excluding the $17.2 billion impact of currency, we delivered revenue of $499.4 billion, up 2.8%, which is $13.7 billion of growth.  
We continued to be pleased with the fundamental trends. We're making progress with customers and associates and feel good about where we're heading. We're improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening our digital relationships with customers as we work to become the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. We'll save our customers not only money but time. And shopping with us will be simple, convenient and fun.  
I also want to call out our continued commitment to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we were able to return $4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In fact, today, we announced a dividend increase. Our annual dividend was $1.96, and we've increased it to $2 per share. This is the 43rd consecutive year of dividend increases for Walmart. Overall, this past year has been a year of investment, operational improvement and change, even while we delivered solid growth. We do see an underlying strength in our Walmart U.S. business that wasn't there a year ago. 
I want to share a few highlights. As you know, our biggest investments have been in people and technology. On this call 1 year ago, we announced our investment in higher wages, better training and more department managers to make Walmart U.S. a better place to work and shop. We can only be successful with customers with engaged and empowered associates. A few weeks ago, we announced the second part of the wage increase, and it's awesome to give a raise to more than 1 million people on the same day. We also announced a simplified paid time-off policy that will mean no waiting for associates to use their time off. These and other changes in the business are making a difference. Our customer satisfaction scores have risen significantly this year. And we now have had 6 consecutive quarters of positive comps and 5 straight quarters of positive traffic at Walmart U.S.  
In the technology and e-commerce space, we continued to innovate with a focus on the customer. We have developed a new platform that we can scale across the business. We have improved our fulfillment capabilities with new fulfillment centers that are helping us get orders to customers' doors faster and more efficiently. And we continued to see growth in store pickup for online orders. We also expanded online grocery shopping to over 150 locations across more than 20 markets in the U.S. Customers are ordering online and on their phones, and then picking up their groceries on our parking lots without ever leaving their cars. Customer satisfaction for those who use our free pickup service is in the high 90s. We are learning some interesting things along the way. 
We found that 8 to 9 p.m. is one of the most popular times customers order groceries online, usually once the kids go to bed. We also see a healthy number of orders in the middle of the night. These may be parents comforting or feeding infants and ordering more diapers or formula to pick up the next day. While it's been a while since my kids were that age, I remember those days well. And I absolutely love that we're able to offer convenience and blend into our customers' lives when they need us most.  
I'm also excited about the introduction of Walmart Pay. And I was very proud of how different parts of our company worked together on it with a relentless focus on the customer experience. I look forward to us rolling it out this coming year. We recently aligned our technology teams because we want more speed and more customer-centric and cost-efficient innovations like this one. We will deliver one Walmart experience to our customers.  
Additionally, we took steps this quarter to sharpen the focus of our portfolio. As part of this continuing portfolio review process, we looked at all of our stores from both a financial and strategic standpoint. One of the key takeaways for me was how strong our portfolio really is in that we only closed stores representing less than 1% of our global revenue and square footage. I'm pleased but not surprised that we have already found open positions for more than half of the impacted associates in the U.S. and we're moving aggressively to identify other open positions for the remaining associates who are interested in transferring to new locations.  
So we're doing what we said we'd do and we're on the right path. Still, we know we have a lot more work to do. And there are areas of the business that are not where they need to be. Let's look more closely at each of the segments.  
Walmart U.S. is on firm ground. We had comp sales of 0.6% on top of last year's 1.5% comp for the fourth quarter. As we lapped positive comps, we accelerated on a 2-year stack basis. We also had continued strong performance from Neighborhood Markets. In addition to our investments in our associates, we're getting better at the fundamentals of retail and managing the business better. We are reducing comp store inventory and improving our in-stock performance. We also had a sound plan for the holiday season that ensured customers could rely on us for low prices throughout the season, not just at big moments. 
Walmart International again delivered solid financial performance. 9 of our 11 markets delivered positive comps for the quarter, and I'm very encouraged by the results overall. Walmex, in particular, is in a good groove again and Canada delivered strong performance. Although we face near-term headwinds with the economy in China, our business there is on track. Brazil, however, is proving to be an increasingly challenging economic environment and the competitive intensity in the U.K. continues to increase. As we review and act on our portfolio, we also announced that we are exploring selling both our clothing chain, called Suburbia, in Mexico and a property company in Chile. Our International business is healthy and growing.  
Global eCommerce sales and gross merchandise value, or GMV, globally grew approximately 8% in the fourth quarter. For the year, sales grew 12% and GMV grew 13%. The holiday season gave a good preview of how all the pieces we're putting in place will come together. We saw strong online sales in the U.S. on the big days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday and nearly half of our customers bought their online orders on a mobile device. We also saw growth in store pickup and online grocery. We have faced specific challenges in our largest e-commerce markets outside the U.S. Economic softness in Brazil and China continued to weigh on growth and we have been in a transition phase at Yihaodian since acquiring full ownership. As mentioned before, the environment in the U.K. remains extremely competitive. And it's important to remember our e-commerce business in the U.K. is a food delivery and pickup business. In the U.S., we plan to build on the foundation we've built by delivering a significant assortment expansion and faster delivery at a lower cost this year. We need more GMV growth from our e-commerce businesses. 
Sam's Club is in the early days with its new strategy. Comps for the quarter were below what we anticipated. And food, in particular, underperformed outside of the holiday periods. We're pleased with the work so far to address the fundamentals of the business to improve merchandising and drive new membership, but we have more to do. There are encouraging signs in our membership numbers. As we address issues with the core business, we're excited by growth in new areas. For example, Club Pickup continued to be the fastest-growing part of the business.  
Finally, even as we focus on our customers and our associates, we were reminded a few weeks ago about the opportunity we have to lead in our communities. Walmart, Coca-Cola, Nestlé and PepsiCo announced we will collectively donate water to meet the daily needs of over 10,000 school children in Flint, Michigan for the balance of the calendar year. Whether it's hiring veterans, supporting U.S. manufacturing or driving new renewable energy production, we have strengths that can help others in important ways. During the first quarter, we will release our Annual Global Responsibility Report alongside our annual report to share more on how we're making a difference. Leading on social and environmental issues is good for our business, for our shareholders and for the world. And we will continue to move the needle this year.  
In summary, we continue to believe we are putting the right foundation in place to better serve customers, deliver stronger sales growth and ultimately, strengthen bottom line performance. As we begin this new year, I'm focused on continuing the momentum in our U.S. stores, getting all the ingredients in place for stronger growth in e-commerce and the strategic choices related to how we put them together. I'm also mindful of the need for balance. Improving productivity as we grow is important. Brett will talk through our full year forecast with the first quarter being the most pressured from an earnings point of view due to the timing of the incremental wage investments. This will be another year where we digest foundational investments. And it's important that we build on what we've started as we go through the year.  
Now I'll turn it over to Greg."

Over the last 12 months, we've laid out our plan to win in the U.S. now and in the future. We are executing against it and have taken several steps towards delivering on our commitment of growing the top line, increasing market share and delivering shareholder value. We've still got a lot of work to do, but I'm pleased that our fourth quarter results demonstrated solid progress against this plan. 
Across the key metrics we track to measure our progress, we're right where we expected to be. Comp sales were positive for the sixth straight quarter and driven by our fifth straight quarter of positive traffic. Our customers are increasingly pleased with the changes in our stores. And they're letting us and others know through improvements in the Net Promoter Score and improved customer experience feedback. In fact, at the end of this fiscal year, more than 75% of stores had met or exceeded their customer experience goals set back at the beginning of the year. This was a significant improvement over the 16% that were meeting this mark at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Additionally, our associates are more engaged and turnover is lower. Department managers have been hired in key areas of the stores. And our new training programs are underway. New technology is in our associates' hands and better processes are creating efficiencies in the stores, driving higher in-stocks and a continuing decline in comp store inventory. As we have discussed, there will be more investments necessary to further deliver on our plan. But we have remained on task and we're seeing progress.  
Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I want to address 2 announcements we've made recently. First, we announced the second phase of our 2-year, $2.7 billion investment in our associates. Just 2 days from now, on February 20, we'll raise the starting wage to at least $10 per hour for hourly associates hired before January 1, 2016. Additionally, we're continuing to simplify our business and enhance our benefits package by shifting to a paid time-off policy for all associates. These changes, along with our previous announcements around training programs and store structure, are exciting for all our associates. We're providing our people with a ladder of opportunity to build a career with Walmart and to provide great service to our customers.  
Secondly, in January, we announced the closing of 150 U.S. stores, including all 102 of our Express format locations. Closing stores is never an easy decision. But it's necessary to ensure we are positioned to deliver our long-term plan. Strengthening the supercenter and Neighborhood Market formats while simultaneously delivering a seamless experience with e-commerce will require our full attention. In fact, we expect to open more than 135 stores in fiscal 2017 alone. While we know that closing stores affected a number of our associates, I'm proud to say that more than half of these associates have already received offers or have been placed in open roles in nearby stores. And we're moving aggressively to identify other open positions for the remaining associates who are interested in transferring to new locations.  
Due to the financial impact of the store closures, our reported results differ significantly from the adjusted results and the underlying business performance. As reported, we incurred $729 million in charges related to these store closures. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude the impact of store closures for purposes of comparability. For reported results, including the impact of store closures and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.  
Moving to our fourth quarter results. Net sales grew $1.9 billion or 2.4% and comp store sales were up 0.6%. We're pleased with the continued growth in customer traffic, which improved 0.7% this quarter on top of last year's 1.4% traffic gain. On a 2-year stack basis, our fourth quarter comp sales improved to 2.1%.  
While customers benefited from lower gas prices, we experienced significant headwinds from deflation in meat and dairy products. Additional sales pressure came from warmer-than-normal temperatures early in the quarter. And delays in IRS tax refund checks impacted the very end of the quarter. Neil will cover our e-commerce initiatives in more detail in this call. But for this quarter, e-commerce contributed approximately 30 basis points to our comp.  
Overall, we were pleased with our performance over the 6-week holiday season. We made a strategic decision to sensibly pull back on short-term, deep price investments as we looked to simplify the experience for both our customers and associates and shift back towards a more EDLP focus. Investments in e-commerce fulfillment centers allowed us to extend the shipping cutoff date. And customers took full advantage of pickup, ordering their gifts online and conveniently picking them up alongside their grocery trips. As we approached the end of the season, customers transitioned from online to in-store. And we delivered, driving strong performance across the box as customers stocked up on last-minute gifts and food for their holiday meals. The supercenter format delivered its sixth straight positive comp in the fourth quarter. Additionally, our traditional format, Neighborhood Markets, continued their strong performance, delivering a 7% comp. We're seeing steady progress in our efforts to improve each of these formats with a focus on fresh offerings, clean stores, fast checkouts, friendly associates and better in-stocks. 
We're pleased with our progress in grocery, which saw a positive comp this quarter, led by improvement in consumables. As I mentioned earlier, we experienced substantial deflation in both meat and dairy, which resulted in slight deflation across all of food. We estimate this deflation negatively impacted our segment comp by approximately 100 basis points relative to last year's comp. Our grocery business delivered positive comp traffic growth, even while lapping positive comp traffic from last year. We continue to push forward with our Win in Fresh initiatives, including testing new layouts, reducing inventory, while improving in-stocks in both food and consumables and exceeding expectations in our urgent agenda items, such as reducing waste and throwaways. We still have work to do in our fresh area and many things we want to accomplish in the upcoming year, but we remain on track.  
In our general merchandise areas, apparel improved throughout the quarter after a slow start due to warmer-than-usual temperatures. On-trend assortments, particularly in active wear, drove results in this area. In entertainment, we continued to experience soft wireless sales and a slower adoption of new technology in televisions. We're continuing to make progress in this space by focusing on our operating model, including service to our customers, assortment and department layout, but it will take time to get it right. Across the rest of the general merchandise and home categories, solid performance came from better in-stocks, assortment updates and new products. Finally, health and wellness remained a positive comp driver for us with growth coming from branded drug inflation and better in-stocks in OTC. However, a slower flu season created a headwind to our cold, cough and flu business this quarter.  
Moving to the remainder of our financials, gross margin was up 69 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in food, general merchandise and consumables. This was somewhat offset by declines in health and wellness, although we're still focused on providing better visibility and tools to help combat ongoing pharmacy reimbursement pressures. Transportation costs were helped by lower fuel rates. Additionally, our intentional pullback on deep price investments during the holiday season meaningfully improved margins in entertainment. Lastly, we made additional progress on our urgent agenda items, focused on reducing cost both in how we operate the business and in procuring merchandise and remained diligent on improving processes related to shrink.  
As expected, expenses increased 129 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by our investments in associates and stores, including transitioning to a new paid time-off policy, along with building out our e-commerce capabilities. However, we did a better job of aligning store labor hours with customer traffic by leveraging efficiencies gained from new processes and technology. The increase in expenses was partially offset by the improvements in gross margin, which resulted in an operating income decline of 5.3%. 
We continue to make progress in managing inventory. Overall inventory grew 0.9% or approximately 25% the rate of total sales growth. Comp store inventory declined 2.9% as we remained focused on cleaning up our backrooms and using processes, such as CAP and top stock, to ensure better in-stocks for our customers. Inventory will remain a key focus area for us in this new fiscal year. Fiscal 2016 has been a year of redefinition: redefining our goals, redefining our focus and redefining our future. We've been intentional in our design and in our actions. And these actions have resulted in steady progress. 
To recap our performance for the year, net sales increased by $10.3 billion or 3.6%. Comp store sales grew 1.2%, driven by a 1.2% growth in comp traffic. E-commerce contributed approximately 25 basis points to our comp performance. Gross margin improved 14 basis points for the year, helped by our ongoing focus on urgent agenda items and lower transportation costs, partially offset by headwinds from shrink and pharmacy reimbursement pressures. However, the investments in our associates, stores and e-commerce drove expenses up 8.3% versus last year, which resulted in an operating income decline of 7.1%.  
We opened 69 supercenters in this year, including relocations and conversions, and 146 traditional format Neighborhood Markets. In '17, we expect to open 50 to 60 supercenters, including relocations and conversions. We'll also open 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets. Additionally, we plan to further expand our online grocery program to more markets this year. As we have discussed in the past, we are committed to growth, but we'll do it sensibly with the customer in mind as we select the right locations, products and service offerings for each store.  
We know the decisions we've made this year to improve our business pressured the bottom line, but we're confident they were in the best interest of our customers, our associates and our shareholders. We believe in our long-term plan and we remain on track to achieve these goals. In the new fiscal year, we're continuing to march down the path we've laid out. Our initiatives across the box are gaining steam and we'll look forward to drive improvements in assortment and pricing while focusing on building a seamless shopping experience across all channels. 
We've just held our annual Year Beginning Meeting in Indianapolis with nearly 7,000 of our operations and merchandising associates. I told the team that I was proud of their hard work and progress last year. And this year, we would build upon that as we work to execute with excellence. In fact, we've raised the bar higher with new annual goals in our stores to drive an even cleaner, faster and friendlier customer experience as the year goes on. 
We expect these efforts, along with the ongoing investments in our stores and our associates, to drive continued growth in the top line. Lower fuel prices will also provide some tailwinds. However, food deflation, which has accelerated in the last 6 weeks, will remain a challenge. Given these factors, for the 13-week period ended April 29, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase of around 50 basis points. Last year's 13-week comp ended May 1, 2015, increased 1.1%. As a reminder, the investments in our associates will be an expense headwind this year, most significantly in the first quarter, as we implement Phase 2 of these investments prior to lapping last year's Phase 1 implementation, which started in April. However, we will continue to focus on lowering costs through better buying and operating a better business.  
Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?"

We're delivering our strategy, seeing comp sales improve and bringing in profit ahead of our expectations. Whilst our performance was driven by Walmex and Canada, our results reflect broad achievement. 9 of our 11 markets had positive comps this quarter and 7 of our markets have now maintained positive comps for at least 7 quarters in a row. We continue to see headwinds in the U.K., China and Brazil, which I'll discuss more in a moment. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities, which are to: actively manage the existing portfolio, deliver balanced growth, be the lowest cost operator and build strong foundations in talent, trust and technology.  
In terms of the portfolio, we announced the closure of 115 small, underperforming stores in Brazil and other Latin American markets. Whilst these are difficult decisions for our markets and associates, it better positions us for growth in the right formats and geographies. Recently, we also announced that we're pursuing the sale of our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico and we're in the process of selling our shopping centers in Chile. These are successful businesses but aren't a core part of our portfolio strategy. These changes would help drive greater simplicity to our operations and an increased focus on our strategic priorities. 
For balanced growth, I'm pleased with our comp trends and look forward to opening between 200 and 240 stores this year across our portfolio while at the same time, expanding our reach in e-commerce. Our lowest cost operator initiative is focused on two key areas: cost of goods sold and overhead reductions. On cost of goods sold, we started a cost analytics program that provides improved tools and cost visibility to our merchants, which enables them to lead fact-based negotiations with suppliers. We're pleased with early results from this program in Canada and in the U.K. and will expand the program to additional markets later this year. 
Now let's discuss our overall results. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3.3% on a constant currency basis, slightly higher than last quarter. Reported net sales declined 9.7 %, impacted by a $4.7 billion currency headwind from continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As mentioned, we had a strong quarter for comp sales. In our 5 largest markets, Mexico, Canada and Brazil reported positive comps while the U.K. and China reported negative comps. All other markets had solid positive comp sales.  
Operating income declined 7.8% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacted by $215 million in charges, $153 million on a reported basis, related to previously announced store closures. Excluding this and certain other charges this year, such as restructuring cost, as well as last year's store closure costs in Japan, operating income would have increased. On a reported basis, operating income declined 19%. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than net sales at 4.2%. This increase was driven primarily by China, where inventory increased in preparation for Chinese New Year. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10.2%.  
For the full year, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis with improved comp sales on top of 3.6% growth last year. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had a significant impact of $17.1 billion on our reported results, by far the largest 1-year impact in our history, resulting in a net sales decline of 9.4% on a reported basis. Full year operating income declined 1% on a constant currency basis, driven by store closures this quarter. Excluding this and last year's store closure costs in Japan, operating income would have increased. On a reported basis, operating income declined 13.4%. 
Now let's discuss fourth quarter results for our largest markets, presented on a constant currency basis. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Let's start with Mexico, which was the biggest driver of this quarter's results. Walmex released its earnings on February 16 under IFRS while results here are under U.S. GAAP, so some numbers may differ.  
Walmex net sales increased 9.3% with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico net sales grew 9.7% and comp sales increased 8.6%, driven by increased customer spending and solid execution from our stores. Self-service was particularly strong, with comp sales of 8.8% while the rest of the market, according to ANTAD, grew only 4.9%. Sam's Club also had its best performance of the year, delivering comp sales of 7%, driven by strong sales from Advantage or non-Business members. Operating income declined versus last year, driven by a planned reduction in our gross profit rate.  
Let's next discuss Canada, which had another strong sales quarter. Net sales grew 5.8%, benefiting by strong customer traffic as a result of our improved fresh offer, continued price investments and improvement in operational standards. Comp sales were 4.3%, our seventh consecutive quarter in positive territory. I'm especially pleased with our sales in Canada, given the economic pressures in the oil-producing provinces. We had positive market share gains in food, consumables and health and wellness for the 12 weeks ended January 23, according to Nielsen. Our online sales continue to grow and perform well. Operating income was down versus last year due to certain land impairments and preopening expenses for 13 previously announced stores acquired from a former competitor. Excluding these impacts, operating income would have been positive.  
Let's talk now about the U.K., which continues to face challenging market conditions. Grocery market sales fell 0.2% in the 12 weeks ended January 3, according to Kantar. This was driven by price deflation of 1.8% as a result of intense competition and was the 17th consecutive period with deflation. The big 4 grocers remained under pressure as discounters continued to grow and gain share. In the U.K., we're striking a balance between investment in the customer offer, profit and cash flow. Overall, net sales declined 4.4% and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 5.5%, driven by declines in our large store format and in our food business, partially offset by continued growth in online grocery. We decided not to participate in Black Friday discounting, which impacted our comp sales but helped profitability and allowed greater focus on operational standards and the customer offer in the core food business. We delivered strong cash performance as a result of disciplined management of CapEx and working capital. 
Asda is focused on repositioning its business through Project Renewal, which will simplify operations, lead to substantial reduction in costs and allow for significant investments in customer value. As part of this project, we're deploying a new cost analytics program to aid with buying. We're also joining EMD, a European buying alliance. And we recently completed the purchase of 2 meat processing businesses. These actions will help increase buying efficiencies and remove costs from the supply chain, particularly for private label products. The U.K. has also completed a restructuring of its Home Office, aimed at increasing focus and improving operational agility. In addition, the U.K. will invest an additional GBP 500 million in price during the period of its 5-year strategy on top of the GBP 1 billion  previously committed. We're taking aggressive actions, and we're focused on repositioning our offering to meet the changing needs of our customers. 
In China, despite ongoing economic challenges and slower GDP growth, we continued to gain share for the 12th consecutive quarter in the hypermarket channel, according to Nielsen. Net sales grew 0.3%, driven by new store openings and improved performance from completed remodels. Comp sales fell 3% in part due to warmer weather and disappointing sales in winter seasonal categories. We continue to make progress in building a platform for sustainable growth in China. We're benefiting from our earlier actions to centralize our buying offices and build out our supply chain. We've improved our gross margin rate and have realized benefits from productivity initiatives while investing in labor and customer experience. We can see momentum building as performance in fresh has improved in recent quarters in both sales and margin. Operating income continues to grow faster than sales. The team in China is focused on delivering a trusted shopping experience through both physical and digital channels. We're starting to see the benefits from tighter collaboration with Yihaodian. In Shenzhen and Guangzhou, Walmart now leverages Yihaodian's last-mile network for online orders, which has led to greater delivery capacity. Overall, we're excited about the actions we're taking in China that are setting us up for long-term growth.  
In Brazil, we continue to face political and economic instability. The deterioration in the macro environment, combined with persistent high inflation, continues to put a strain on customers. Net sales grew 1.2% and comps grew 0.8% in a retail market that contracted by 5.7%, according to Serasa Experian. We were encouraged by another quarter of double-digit growth in our wholesale business, mostly offset by continued softness in the hypermarket format. Operating income was down versus last year, driven by the cost to close the 60 stores announced earlier. Excluding store closure costs, operating income would have been relatively flat to last year. We're seeing positive results from some of our transformation initiatives, such as repositioning the customer proposition in our wholesale business, but there's still work to be done. Brazil's focus for the year ahead will be to finalize store closures, revise and reposition the customer proposition for our hypermarket format and complete the integration of systems and processes in our stores. We are committed to turnaround efforts in this important market.  
As I wrap up, I'd like to recognize the efforts of our dedicated International associates operating in 28 countries around the globe that helped us achieve consistently good results throughout the year. I'm confident in the management teams we have leading our markets and the strategic priorities we have in place to drive further growth in the year ahead.

I'll start today's call with details around our fourth quarter performance. I'll also update an update on how we have begun to execute against the strategy that I detailed during our third quarter earnings call. At Sam's Club, we remain laser-focused on our members. Through investments we've made and will continue to make in people and technology, we will deliver for our members a seamless shopping experience across our app, our site and our clubs. 
Let's begin by talking about our fourth quarter results. It's important to note that our reported results were negatively impacted by certain charges totaling approximately $77 million. This amount includes a charge of approximately $57 million resulting from our decision to close underperforming clubs. The remainder of the charges includes a policy change related to paid time-off as well as severance and other costs associated with recently announced organizational enhancements. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with fuel and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript. 
Comp sales for the fourth quarter were below our expectations. Severe winter storms significantly disrupted approximately 200 clubs toward the end of the quarter, which resulted in a negative impact to the comp of approximately 30 basis points. That said, we know that our core comp performance can improve and it will. The work we have underway, which I'll talk about in just a bit, is designed in part to improve the fundamentals of our business, specifically membership and merchandising. 
Broadly speaking, trends that we saw throughout the year were again prevalent during the quarter. Among the most notable items were: softness in food, primarily as a result of a minimal level of inflation or in some instances, deflation in key categories; an impact to grocery as we begin to evolve the assortment; and challenges in the technology and entertainment area from a deliberate transition in space reallocation, along with pressures in wireless. Yet we know that where we have seen innovation in the assortment and in service offerings, we have seen success. I'll talk more about our merchandise categories in a moment. 
Net sales decreased 0.1% as comp sales declined 0.5%. Slide 10 of the financial presentation provides the components of our comp sales. We were pleased with the performance of our Savings members as positive momentum in traffic continued. But softness from our Business member negatively impacted our results. Gross profit rate decreased 4 basis points from last year. We continued to invest in membership value through price and our cash rewards program. 
Operating expenses deleveraged during the quarter. As expected, investments in people and technology pressured our expenses. Additionally, charges for the items I mentioned earlier impacted Q4. Excluding these items, operating expense as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat compared with last year. Membership income increased 5.6% during Q4. Plus renewals increased 35% over last year and we continue to see a favorable trend of renewal rates for Plus members. The value of a Sam's Club membership is clear. Our targeted marketing programs resulted in new membership acquisitions that accelerated each of the last 3 quarters versus last year.  
Let's turn now to our merchandising categories. I'll provide details on areas that were materially impactful to the quarter. Please see Slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories. In 
fresh/freezer/cooler, deflationary trends continued, particularly in fresh meat and dairy. We saw positive results in produce, yet headwinds from the remainder of the category proved too much to overcome. Dry grocery and areas of fresh experienced pressures from deflation. As we continue to expand our private brand, generate more newness and reallocate space, these areas are gaining member acceptance but will take careful handling and coordination. Technology/entertainment/office had some bright spots with new items in TVs and wearables, both of which performed well online and in clubs. Wireless installment plans continue to place pressure on the category.  
When we innovate, we see good results. In health and wellness and consumables, our Free/4/10 Plus benefit program in pharmacy is helping to lift the total category. Services are important to our members and they reward us when we deliver in this space. The technology services company, IMS Health, measures our market share of the 5 free scripts in the program. According to IMS, we grew share by 11 basis points for the 3 months ended December 31, 2015, and our share is nearly 25 basis points higher than it was prior to the launch of the program. Free/4/10 was also a strong contributor to membership upgrades to Plus since the beginning of the fiscal year.  
Moving on to e-commerce. This year, we made the decision to push many of our holiday events online and we were pleased with the response from our members. Our Holiday Savings Celebration on November 14 drove good results. And we were pleased with other events, including Cyber Monday. During the quarter, traffic to our site increased by 7% versus the prior year and the conversion improved by 18%. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in our pure e-commerce and mobile commerce capabilities. We're also excited about the integration of our digital and physical offerings. During Q4, Club Pickup increased 46% over last year and it now represents the fastest-growing piece of our business. Members want to shop with Sam's Club how and where they choose, and we are building the infrastructure across multiple channels to deliver that experience.  
On our call from Q3, I talked about a new strategy. During Q4, we began to execute against that strategy in important ways, including: additional organizational enhancements that will better align talent with critical needs; portfolio management through the closure of underperforming clubs; an extensive review of merchandise categories; and the expansion of private label brands in key areas. These are only a few examples, and we have many other work streams underway. The totality of these efforts will address the fundamentals of our business, including membership and merchandising as well as deliver new services and offerings. As I think about guidance for the first quarter, I'm reminded that although we have accomplished a great deal over the previous months, it remains early days in our transformation. As a result, comp sales without fuel for the 13-week period ending April 29, 2016, are expected to be around flat. 
Let me close today with a few thoughts. First, the new alignment of our organization will position the business to better serve our members. It was a significant step in our transformation, and we will begin to see the benefits in the coming quarter. Secondly, our new Chief Merchandising Officer has conducted a comprehensive review of our merchandise based on identified markets and what he has gleaned from our strategy work. We're excited about his early insights at this stage. I'm confident we're taking the business in the right direction now and for the future. Through a disciplined, refined approach to growth, we will deliver for our members a seamless shopping experience across app, site and club.

I want to pick up on Doug's comments about our opportunity to be the first to offer a seamless shopping experience at a scale that only Walmart can deliver. E-commerce at Walmart is about bringing together all of the pieces to help customers buy the items they want at Walmart prices however and wherever they want. Our customers look at us as one Walmart, one easy experience across our app, site and store or club. 
In a short span, we've built an e-commerce technology company inside of Walmart. We have rolled out a new technology platform and we have dramatically increased our physical distribution network. And in just the past 6 months, we've grown to serve over 20 markets with online grocery. During the fourth quarter, we started to get a glimpse into how these capabilities we've put into place are starting to come together to deliver the seamless customer experience. Looking forward, we're focused on 3 big opportunities: continuing to build a digital relationship with our customers, scaling our online assortment and expanding online grocery.  
For the quarter, Global eCommerce sales and GMV both grew at 8%. For the full year, sales grew 12% and GMV grew 13%. As we discussed in October, growth continues to be pressured by weakness in Brazil, China and the U.K., due to macroeconomic and competitive challenges. In China, we have rebuilt the Yihaodian leadership team since taking full ownership. And they continue to build on the strengths of their mobile engagement with the customers and increasing business through imported products. There is work to do there, but we are taking actions to improve the business and accelerate growth in one of our key markets. In Brazil, the team has been working to balance growth and profitability during an economically challenging period that we expect to continue throughout the fiscal year. In the U.S., we continued to grow the business and created a more seamless experience for our customers across our app, our site and our store. 
Looking more closely at holiday in the U.S. Walmart.com saw strong sales on the big days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. What was most exciting was how our new capability started to deliver seamless shopping for customers. As customers shopped on Walmart.com, our new platform was powering the front- and back-end shopping experience for the first time during holiday. Despite the complexity of a complete platform rebuild, Pangaea handled the intense holiday volume. Customers could order gifts even closer to Christmas this year and they saw our best on-time delivery rates ever, thanks to our new fulfillment centers. While the FCs opened just a few months before holiday, they lived up to our targets for efficiency and productivity. They showed that they can scale with our business and combine with our stores, DCs and transportation network to deliver speed, efficiency and better experiences for customers.  
Customers could also get their online orders the same day in stores. And we saw nearly a 40% jump in store pickup during the holidays. We were also able to blend our online and stores to serve customers how and where they were shopping. One great example was on the morning of Black Friday, when we saw a smart TV sell out online within 20 minutes. We had another TV from that supplier available in stores, so we dialed up the promotion on Walmart.com in made it did available for store pickup. The item quickly sold out in stores. To customers, it was a seamless access to a gift they wanted. It was a great example of the power of combining online with stores in close proximity to customers. 
Customers were also using our app to shop seamlessly across online and stores. We offered early access to the Black Friday circular on the mobile app for the first time. And the app jumped to the #1 spot in the Apple App Store that day. Customers also showed that they are now comfortable buying on their phone. This year, more than half of online sales were on a mobile device on Thanksgiving, which was double last year. We saw significant growth in mobile sales for the rest of the peak holiday period. With our app, customers were also able to create wish lists, check-in for store pickup and pick up item locations in stores. 
We continue to build on that app experience in the quarter with another powerful tool, Walmart Pay. We started testing it in a small group of stores. And the initial feedback from customers reinforced that the experience was simple and easy. Walmart Pay is the perfect example of how our app gives customers a seamless experience that merges digital and physical to make shopping faster and easier and gives customers a reason to form a digital relationship with Walmart. It was also a great example of how our teams align to deliver these experiences in just a few months.  
At SamsClub.com, we started the holidays with a big kickoff event on November 14, which delivered a triple-digit comp for the day. We also saw strong comps and record sales on the biggest days of the holiday season. Club Pickup continues to be a delighter for members, and we saw it hit an all-time high in December. We saw strong growth in both desktop and mobile conversion. And mobile purchases nearly tripled over last year. SamsClub.com has also continued to drive growth in digital member sign-ups. 
As we look at critical touch points that meld our app, site and store, we obviously think about online grocery. In October, we announced we were expanding from 5 markets to over 20. We've rolled out to those additional markets, and we're continuing to see the strong emotional response it triggers with customers and the very personal relationship they're forming with Walmart. Customers are literally jumping out of their cars to rave about it. And one of my recent favorites was a mom with 2 kids in the back of her car. She told us about how much easier it has made her life because she can shop where and when it's convenient, and then drive up and just get her groceries. She placed her order while she was relaxing and watching her kids play. Customers are inviting us into the fabric of their lives. In just a few months, we've dramatically increased online grocery and look for us to continue expanding this year.  
Behind all the capabilities we're delivering are some of the best technologists in the world. We've built an e-commerce technology company inside of Walmart. We've always had one of the strongest enterprise technology organizations. Those teams have worked closely to deliver experiences, like online grocery and Walmart Pay, that seamlessly merge the app, site and store. Last month, we announced that we are bringing together those teams under a single Walmart Technology banner. This aligns all of our technologists with how our customers see us, one Walmart. 
I'm excited about the building blocks we've put in place for the future and the ways we're starting to serve customers seamlessly across our app, site and store. We've replatformed our technology and physical distribution while continuing to grow our business. And we've quickly grown online grocery. This year, we'll focus on 3 areas: continuing to build a digital relationship with our customers, scaling our online assortment and expanding online grocery. All these will combine to offer customers compelling experiences that let them shop seamlessly with Walmart in ways that help them save money and save time. As we deliver that seamless experience across our app, site and store, we're building deeper relationships with customers. This relationship is key to building value for the enterprise. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Brett. Brett?"
313055,280452684,936146,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Neil. I'll wrap up today by providing some thoughts on the company's performance in fiscal year 2016 as well as our expectations for fiscal year 2017. Before we jump into guidance, I want to highlight a few items from the quarter and the year. O",1113,"Thanks, Neil. I'll wrap up today by providing some thoughts on the company's performance in fiscal year 2016 as well as our expectations for fiscal year 2017. Before we jump into guidance, I want to highlight a few items from the quarter and the year. 
Overall, we are pleased with the way we ended fiscal year 2016. In the fourth quarter, Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 0.6%, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and the fifth straight quarter of positive traffic. For the year, Walmart International delivered another solid financial performance with the very strong results in Canada and at Walmex. We generated full year constant currency revenue growth of nearly $14 billion or 2.8%. Currency impacted our full year revenue by over $17 billion. 
We continue to innovate to make progress towards a seamless shopping experience through a number of initiatives, including an increased number of online grocery markets. While we would have liked to have seen higher e-commerce sales growth this quarter, we continue to make good foundational progress for the future. For the year, we generated approximately $27 billion in operating cash flow, which speaks to our continued financial strength as we transform the company. I'm particularly pleased with our inventory performance in Walmart U.S. 
During the year, we returned over $10 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We were able to deliver consistent returns the shareholders while investing for the future. ROI decreased to 15.5%, primarily due to lower operating income as well as continued capital investments. Additionally, today, we announced an increase in our dividend from $1.96 per share to $2 per share in fiscal 2017. We've now increased our dividend for 43 consecutive years. 
Now I'd like to spend some time specifically on our EPS results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016. Fourth quarter and full year adjusted EPS were $1.49 and $4.59, respectively. Our reported EPS for the same periods were $1.43 and $4.57, respectively. Let me briefly discuss the discrete items that were factored into our adjusted EPS. Recall in January, we announced the closure of 269 stores globally. Charges for these store closures, which impact both the fourth quarter and full year earnings, resulted in a negative impact of $0.20 per share. Also our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full year benefited from the December passage by Congress of the tax extenders legislation, which we considered in our fourth quarter guidance. However, the fourth quarter and full year effective tax rate also benefited by $0.14 per share related to other discrete tax items in the quarter. Finally, our full year adjusted EPS also excludes the effects of a benefit of approximately $0.04 from an adjustment for certain leases we disclosed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Now let's shift gears and discuss fiscal year 2017 guidance. We remain confident that the investments we are making in our associates, our stores and our digital capabilities are the right ones and are better preparing Walmart for the future. It's also important to note that although we continue to invest in these important areas for the future, we will remain focused on managing expenses across the company. Our guidance today includes several important assumptions, including that the economic conditions in our largest markets remain generally consistent and that the currency exchange rates remain at current levels. 
From a capital standpoint, as we indicated at our October investor meeting, we expect capital investments to be approximately $11 billion in fiscal year 2017, down from fiscal year 2016. Currency remains a headwind for our business as it is for many U.S. multinational companies. Today, we expect a currency headwind of approximately $12 billion on net sales for fiscal year 2017. Additionally, currency is expected to impact EPS by approximately $0.10 per share this year, including approximately $0.03 in the first quarter.  
Now let's turn to full year sales growth guidance. In October, we guided that on a constant currency basis, net sales would grow 3% to 4% annually over the next 3 years. Excluding the impact of the recently announced store closures and the continuing impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our fiscal 2017 sales growth guidance would have remained in that same range. However, including store closures and the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, we now expect net sales growth to be relatively flat in fiscal year 2017. 
As for taxes, our earnings per share guidance is based on a fiscal 2017 estimated tax rate ranging between 31.5% and 33.5%. As is the norm, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in laws, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. In any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range.  
I also want to note that historically, the tax extenders legislation has been approved at the end of each year, impacting the fourth quarter tax rate. In the December legislation, many of the relevant tax provisions were either made permanent or passed through 2019. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2017, the benefits of the extenders will be spread across the full year rather than all being in the fourth quarter. Other discrete items as described above may still cause the effective tax rate to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. 
Taking into account the previously mentioned assumptions, including currency rates at today's levels, tax rate and the incremental wage investments of $1.5 billion, we expect the full year fiscal 2017 EPS to range between $4 and $4.30. This most closely compares to our adjusted earnings per share of $4.59 in fiscal year 2016 and is broadly in line with our guidance from October for our earnings per share to be down 6% to 12% in fiscal year 2017. With respect to the first quarter, we expect earnings per share to range between $0.80 and $0.95. This compares to the $1.03 we reported last year. When comparing to last year's EPS, it's important to note that the first quarter of this year will be impacted somewhat more on a year-over-year basis than subsequent quarters due to the timing of wage investments. 
In closing, I'm honored to serve as the Chief Financial Officer during this very exciting time at Walmart. All of us at Walmart are pleased with the progress we're making and the work of our great associates around the world. We look forward to building on that in serving our customers in the future."

We continue to be pleased with the fundamental trends. We're making progress with customers and associates and feel good about where we're heading. We're improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening our digital relationships with customers as we work to become the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. We'll save our customers not only money but time. And shopping with us will be simple, convenient and fun.  
I also want to call out our continued commitment to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we were able to return $4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In fact, today, we announced a dividend increase. Our annual dividend was $1.96, and we've increased it to $2 per share. This is the 43rd consecutive year of dividend increases for Walmart. Overall, this past year has been a year of investment, operational improvement and change, even while we delivered solid growth. We do see an underlying strength in our Walmart U.S. business that wasn't there a year ago. 
I want to share a few highlights. As you know, our biggest investments have been in people and technology. On this call 1 year ago, we announced our investment in higher wages, better training and more department managers to make Walmart U.S. a better place to work and shop. We can only be successful with customers with engaged and empowered associates. A few weeks ago, we announced the second part of the wage increase, and it's awesome to give a raise to more than 1 million people on the same day. We also announced a simplified paid time-off policy that will mean no waiting for associates to use their time off. These and other changes in the business are making a difference. Our customer satisfaction scores have risen significantly this year. And we now have had 6 consecutive quarters of positive comps and 5 straight quarters of positive traffic at Walmart U.S.  
In the technology and e-commerce space, we continued to innovate with a focus on the customer. We have developed a new platform that we can scale across the business. We have improved our fulfillment capabilities with new fulfillment centers that are helping us get orders to customers' doors faster and more efficiently. And we continued to see growth in store pickup for online orders. We also expanded online grocery shopping to over 150 locations across more than 20 markets in the U.S. Customers are ordering online and on their phones, and then picking up their groceries on our parking lots without ever leaving their cars. Customer satisfaction for those who use our free pickup service is in the high 90s. We are learning some interesting things along the way. 
We found that 8 to 9 p.m. is one of the most popular times customers order groceries online, usually once the kids go to bed. We also see a healthy number of orders in the middle of the night. These may be parents comforting or feeding infants and ordering more diapers or formula to pick up the next day. While it's been a while since my kids were that age, I remember those days well. And I absolutely love that we're able to offer convenience and blend into our customers' lives when they need us most.  
I'm also excited about the introduction of Walmart Pay. And I was very proud of how different parts of our company worked together on it with a relentless focus on the customer experience. I look forward to us rolling it out this coming year. We recently aligned our technology teams because we want more speed and more customer-centric and cost-efficient innovations like this one. We will deliver one Walmart experience to our customers.  
Additionally, we took steps this quarter to sharpen the focus of our portfolio. As part of this continuing portfolio review process, we looked at all of our stores from both a financial and strategic standpoint. One of the key takeaways for me was how strong our portfolio really is in that we only closed stores representing less than 1% of our global revenue and square footage. I'm pleased but not surprised that we have already found open positions for more than half of the impacted associates in the U.S. and we're moving aggressively to identify other open positions for the remaining associates who are interested in transferring to new locations.  
So we're doing what we said we'd do and we're on the right path. Still, we know we have a lot more work to do. And there are areas of the business that are not where they need to be. Let's look more closely at each of the segments.  
Walmart U.S. is on firm ground. We had comp sales of 0.6% on top of last year's 1.5% comp for the fourth quarter. As we lapped positive comps, we accelerated on a 2-year stack basis. We also had continued strong performance from Neighborhood Markets. In addition to our investments in our associates, we're getting better at the fundamentals of retail and managing the business better. We are reducing comp store inventory and improving our in-stock performance. We also had a sound plan for the holiday season that ensured customers could rely on us for low prices throughout the season, not just at big moments. 
Walmart International again delivered solid financial performance. 9 of our 11 markets delivered positive comps for the quarter, and I'm very encouraged by the results overall. Walmex, in particular, is in a good groove again and Canada delivered strong performance. Although we face near-term headwinds with the economy in China, our business there is on track. Brazil, however, is proving to be an increasingly challenging economic environment and the competitive intensity in the U.K. continues to increase. As we review and act on our portfolio, we also announced that we are exploring selling both our clothing chain, called Suburbia, in Mexico and a property company in Chile. Our International business is healthy and growing.  
Global eCommerce sales and gross merchandise value, or GMV, globally grew approximately 8% in the fourth quarter. For the year, sales grew 12% and GMV grew 13%. The holiday season gave a good preview of how all the pieces we're putting in place will come together. We saw strong online sales in the U.S. on the big days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday and nearly half of our customers bought their online orders on a mobile device. We also saw growth in store pickup and online grocery. We have faced specific challenges in our largest e-commerce markets outside the U.S. Economic softness in Brazil and China continued to weigh on growth and we have been in a transition phase at Yihaodian since acquiring full ownership. As mentioned before, the environment in the U.K. remains extremely competitive. And it's important to remember our e-commerce business in the U.K. is a food delivery and pickup business. In the U.S., we plan to build on the foundation we've built by delivering a significant assortment expansion and faster delivery at a lower cost this year. We need more GMV growth from our e-commerce businesses. 
Sam's Club is in the early days with its new strategy. Comps for the quarter were below what we anticipated. And food, in particular, underperformed outside of the holiday periods. We're pleased with the work so far to address the fundamentals of the business to improve merchandising and drive new membership, but we have more to do. There are encouraging signs in our membership numbers. As we address issues with the core business, we're excited by growth in new areas. For example, Club Pickup continued to be the fastest-growing part of the business.  
Finally, even as we focus on our customers and our associates, we were reminded a few weeks ago about the opportunity we have to lead in our communities. Walmart, Coca-Cola, Nestlé and PepsiCo announced we will collectively donate water to meet the daily needs of over 10,000 school children in Flint, Michigan for the balance of the calendar year. Whether it's hiring veterans, supporting U.S. manufacturing or driving new renewable energy production, we have strengths that can help others in important ways. During the first quarter, we will release our Annual Global Responsibility Report alongside our annual report to share more on how we're making a difference. Leading on social and environmental issues is good for our business, for our shareholders and for the world. And we will continue to move the needle this year.  
In summary, we continue to believe we are putting the right foundation in place to better serve customers, deliver stronger sales growth and ultimately, strengthen bottom line performance. As we begin this new year, I'm focused on continuing the momentum in our U.S. stores, getting all the ingredients in place for stronger growth in e-commerce and the strategic choices related to how we put them together. I'm also mindful of the need for balance. Improving productivity as we grow is important. Brett will talk through our full year forecast with the first quarter being the most pressured from an earnings point of view due to the timing of the incremental wage investments. This will be another year where we digest foundational investments. And it's important that we build on what we've started as we go through the year.  
Now I'll turn it over to Greg."

Over the last 12 months, we've laid out our plan to win in the U.S. now and in the future. We are executing against it and have taken several steps towards delivering on our commitment of growing the top line, increasing market share and delivering shareholder value. We've still got a lot of work to do, but I'm pleased that our fourth quarter results demonstrated solid progress against this plan. 
Across the key metrics we track to measure our progress, we're right where we expected to be. Comp sales were positive for the sixth straight quarter and driven by our fifth straight quarter of positive traffic. Our customers are increasingly pleased with the changes in our stores. And they're letting us and others know through improvements in the Net Promoter Score and improved customer experience feedback. In fact, at the end of this fiscal year, more than 75% of stores had met or exceeded their customer experience goals set back at the beginning of the year. This was a significant improvement over the 16% that were meeting this mark at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Additionally, our associates are more engaged and turnover is lower. Department managers have been hired in key areas of the stores. And our new training programs are underway. New technology is in our associates' hands and better processes are creating efficiencies in the stores, driving higher in-stocks and a continuing decline in comp store inventory. As we have discussed, there will be more investments necessary to further deliver on our plan. But we have remained on task and we're seeing progress.  
Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I want to address 2 announcements we've made recently. First, we announced the second phase of our 2-year, $2.7 billion investment in our associates. Just 2 days from now, on February 20, we'll raise the starting wage to at least $10 per hour for hourly associates hired before January 1, 2016. Additionally, we're continuing to simplify our business and enhance our benefits package by shifting to a paid time-off policy for all associates. These changes, along with our previous announcements around training programs and store structure, are exciting for all our associates. We're providing our people with a ladder of opportunity to build a career with Walmart and to provide great service to our customers.  
Secondly, in January, we announced the closing of 150 U.S. stores, including all 102 of our Express format locations. Closing stores is never an easy decision. But it's necessary to ensure we are positioned to deliver our long-term plan. Strengthening the supercenter and Neighborhood Market formats while simultaneously delivering a seamless experience with e-commerce will require our full attention. In fact, we expect to open more than 135 stores in fiscal 2017 alone. While we know that closing stores affected a number of our associates, I'm proud to say that more than half of these associates have already received offers or have been placed in open roles in nearby stores. And we're moving aggressively to identify other open positions for the remaining associates who are interested in transferring to new locations.  
Due to the financial impact of the store closures, our reported results differ significantly from the adjusted results and the underlying business performance. As reported, we incurred $729 million in charges related to these store closures. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude the impact of store closures for purposes of comparability. For reported results, including the impact of store closures and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.  
Moving to our fourth quarter results. Net sales grew $1.9 billion or 2.4% and comp store sales were up 0.6%. We're pleased with the continued growth in customer traffic, which improved 0.7% this quarter on top of last year's 1.4% traffic gain. On a 2-year stack basis, our fourth quarter comp sales improved to 2.1%.  
While customers benefited from lower gas prices, we experienced significant headwinds from deflation in meat and dairy products. Additional sales pressure came from warmer-than-normal temperatures early in the quarter. And delays in IRS tax refund checks impacted the very end of the quarter. Neil will cover our e-commerce initiatives in more detail in this call. But for this quarter, e-commerce contributed approximately 30 basis points to our comp.  
Overall, we were pleased with our performance over the 6-week holiday season. We made a strategic decision to sensibly pull back on short-term, deep price investments as we looked to simplify the experience for both our customers and associates and shift back towards a more EDLP focus. Investments in e-commerce fulfillment centers allowed us to extend the shipping cutoff date. And customers took full advantage of pickup, ordering their gifts online and conveniently picking them up alongside their grocery trips. As we approached the end of the season, customers transitioned from online to in-store. And we delivered, driving strong performance across the box as customers stocked up on last-minute gifts and food for their holiday meals. The supercenter format delivered its sixth straight positive comp in the fourth quarter. Additionally, our traditional format, Neighborhood Markets, continued their strong performance, delivering a 7% comp. We're seeing steady progress in our efforts to improve each of these formats with a focus on fresh offerings, clean stores, fast checkouts, friendly associates and better in-stocks. 
We're pleased with our progress in grocery, which saw a positive comp this quarter, led by improvement in consumables. As I mentioned earlier, we experienced substantial deflation in both meat and dairy, which resulted in slight deflation across all of food. We estimate this deflation negatively impacted our segment comp by approximately 100 basis points relative to last year's comp. Our grocery business delivered positive comp traffic growth, even while lapping positive comp traffic from last year. We continue to push forward with our Win in Fresh initiatives, including testing new layouts, reducing inventory, while improving in-stocks in both food and consumables and exceeding expectations in our urgent agenda items, such as reducing waste and throwaways. We still have work to do in our fresh area and many things we want to accomplish in the upcoming year, but we remain on track.  
In our general merchandise areas, apparel improved throughout the quarter after a slow start due to warmer-than-usual temperatures. On-trend assortments, particularly in active wear, drove results in this area. In entertainment, we continued to experience soft wireless sales and a slower adoption of new technology in televisions. We're continuing to make progress in this space by focusing on our operating model, including service to our customers, assortment and department layout, but it will take time to get it right. Across the rest of the general merchandise and home categories, solid performance came from better in-stocks, assortment updates and new products. Finally, health and wellness remained a positive comp driver for us with growth coming from branded drug inflation and better in-stocks in OTC. However, a slower flu season created a headwind to our cold, cough and flu business this quarter.  
Moving to the remainder of our financials, gross margin was up 69 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in food, general merchandise and consumables. This was somewhat offset by declines in health and wellness, although we're still focused on providing better visibility and tools to help combat ongoing pharmacy reimbursement pressures. Transportation costs were helped by lower fuel rates. Additionally, our intentional pullback on deep price investments during the holiday season meaningfully improved margins in entertainment. Lastly, we made additional progress on our urgent agenda items, focused on reducing cost both in how we operate the business and in procuring merchandise and remained diligent on improving processes related to shrink.  
As expected, expenses increased 129 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by our investments in associates and stores, including transitioning to a new paid time-off policy, along with building out our e-commerce capabilities. However, we did a better job of aligning store labor hours with customer traffic by leveraging efficiencies gained from new processes and technology. The increase in expenses was partially offset by the improvements in gross margin, which resulted in an operating income decline of 5.3%. 
We continue to make progress in managing inventory. Overall inventory grew 0.9% or approximately 25% the rate of total sales growth. Comp store inventory declined 2.9% as we remained focused on cleaning up our backrooms and using processes, such as CAP and top stock, to ensure better in-stocks for our customers. Inventory will remain a key focus area for us in this new fiscal year. Fiscal 2016 has been a year of redefinition: redefining our goals, redefining our focus and redefining our future. We've been intentional in our design and in our actions. And these actions have resulted in steady progress. 
To recap our performance for the year, net sales increased by $10.3 billion or 3.6%. Comp store sales grew 1.2%, driven by a 1.2% growth in comp traffic. E-commerce contributed approximately 25 basis points to our comp performance. Gross margin improved 14 basis points for the year, helped by our ongoing focus on urgent agenda items and lower transportation costs, partially offset by headwinds from shrink and pharmacy reimbursement pressures. However, the investments in our associates, stores and e-commerce drove expenses up 8.3% versus last year, which resulted in an operating income decline of 7.1%.  
We opened 69 supercenters this year, including relocations and conversions, and 146 traditional format Neighborhood Markets. In FY '17, we expect to open 50 to 60 supercenters, including relocations and conversions. We'll also open 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets. Additionally, we plan to further expand our online grocery program to more markets this year. As we have discussed in the past, we are committed to growth, but we'll do it sensibly with the customer in mind as we select the right locations, products and service offerings for each store.  
We know the decisions we've made this year to improve our business pressured the bottom line, but we're confident they were in the best interest of our customers, our associates and our shareholders. We believe in our long-term plan and we remain on track to achieve these goals. In the new fiscal year, we're continuing to march down the path we've laid out. Our initiatives across the box are gaining steam and we'll look forward to drive improvements in assortment and pricing while focusing on building a seamless shopping experience across all channels. 
We've just held our annual Year Beginning Meeting in Indianapolis with nearly 7,000 of our operations and merchandising associates. I told the team that I was proud of their hard work and progress last year. And this year, we would build upon that as we work to execute with excellence. In fact, we've raised the bar higher with new annual goals in our stores to drive an even cleaner, faster and friendlier customer experience as the year goes on. 
We expect these efforts, along with the ongoing investments in our stores and our associates, to drive continued growth in the top line. Lower fuel prices will also provide some tailwinds. However, food deflation, which has accelerated in the last 6 weeks, will remain a challenge. Given these factors, for the 13-week period ended April 29, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase of around 50 basis points. Last year's 13-week comp ended May 1, 2015, increased 1.1%. As a reminder, the investments in our associates will be an expense headwind this year, most significantly in the first quarter, as we implement Phase 2 of these investments prior to lapping last year's Phase 1 implementation, which started in April. However, we will continue to focus on lowering costs through better buying and operating a better business.

We're delivering our strategy, seeing comp sales improve and bringing in profit ahead of our expectations. Whilst our performance was driven by Walmex and Canada, our results reflect broad achievement. 9 of our 11 markets had positive comps this quarter and 7 of our markets have now maintained positive comps for at least 7 quarters in a row. We continue to see headwinds in the U.K., China and Brazil, which I'll discuss more in a moment. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities, which are to: actively manage the existing portfolio, deliver balanced growth, be the lowest cost operator and build strong foundations in talent, trust and technology.  
In terms of the portfolio, we announced the closure of 115 small, underperforming stores in Brazil and other Latin American markets. Whilst these are difficult decisions for our markets and associates, it better positions us for growth in the right formats and geographies. Recently, we also announced that we're pursuing the sale of our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico and we're in the process of selling our shopping centers in Chile. These are successful businesses but aren't a core part of our portfolio strategy. These changes would help drive greater simplicity to our operations and an increased focus on our strategic priorities. 
For balanced growth, I'm pleased with our comp trends and look forward to opening between 200 and 240 stores this year across our portfolio while at the same time, expanding our reach in e-commerce. Our lowest cost operator initiative is focused on two key areas: cost of goods sold and overhead reductions. On cost of goods sold, we started a cost analytics program that provides improved tools and cost visibility to our merchants, which enables them to lead fact-based negotiations with suppliers. We're pleased with early results from this program in Canada and in the U.K. and will expand the program to additional markets later this year. 
Now let's discuss our overall results. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3.3% on a constant currency basis, slightly higher than last quarter. Reported net sales declined 9.7 %, impacted by a $4.7 billion currency headwind from continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As mentioned, we had a strong quarter for comp sales. In our 5 largest markets, Mexico, Canada and Brazil reported positive comps while the U.K. and China reported negative comps. All other markets had solid positive comp sales.  
Operating income declined 7.8% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacted by $215 million in charges, $153 million on a reported basis, related to previously announced store closures. Excluding this and certain other charges this year, such as restructuring costs, as well as last year's store closure costs in Japan, operating income would have increased. On a reported basis, operating income declined 19%. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than net sales at 4.2%. This increase was driven primarily by China, where inventory increased in preparation for Chinese New Year. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10.2%.  
For the full year, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis with improved comp sales on top of 3.6% growth last year. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had a significant impact of $17.1 billion on our reported results, by far the largest 1-year impact in our history, resulting in a net sales decline of 9.4% on a reported basis. Full year operating income declined 1% on a constant currency basis, driven by store closures this quarter. Excluding this and last year's store closure costs in Japan, operating income would have increased. On a reported basis, operating income declined 13.4%. 
Now let's discuss fourth quarter results for our largest markets, presented on a constant currency basis. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Let's start with Mexico, which was the biggest driver of this quarter's results. Walmex released its earnings on February 16 under IFRS while results here are under U.S. GAAP, so some numbers may differ.  
Walmex net sales increased 9.3% with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico net sales grew 9.7% and comp sales increased 8.6%, driven by increased customer spending and solid execution from our stores. Self-service was particularly strong, with comp sales of 8.8% while the rest of the market, according to ANTAD, grew only 4.9%. Sam's Club also had its best performance of the year, delivering comp sales of 7%, driven by strong sales from Advantage or non-Business members. Operating income declined versus last year, driven by a planned reduction in our gross profit rate.  
Let's next discuss Canada, which had another strong sales quarter. Net sales grew 5.8%, benefiting by strong customer traffic as a result of our improved fresh offer, continued price investments and improvement in operational standards. Comp sales were 4.3%, our seventh consecutive quarter in positive territory. I'm especially pleased with our sales in Canada, given the economic pressures in the oil-producing provinces. We had positive market share gains in food, consumables and health and wellness for the 12 weeks ended January 23, according to Nielsen. Our online sales continue to grow and perform well. Operating income was down versus last year due to certain land impairments and preopening expenses for 13 previously announced stores acquired from a former competitor. Excluding these impacts, operating income would have been positive.  
Let's talk now about the U.K., which continues to face challenging market conditions. Grocery market sales fell 0.2% in the 12 weeks ended January 3, according to Kantar. This was driven by price deflation of 1.8% as a result of intense competition and was the 17th consecutive period with deflation. The big 4 grocers remained under pressure as discounters continued to grow and gain share. In the U.K., we're striking a balance between investment in the customer offer, profit and cash flow. Overall, net sales declined 4.4% and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 5.5%, driven by declines in our large store format and in our food business, partially offset by continued growth in online grocery. We decided not to participate in Black Friday discounting, which impacted our comp sales but helped profitability and allowed greater focus on operational standards and the customer offer in the core food business. We delivered strong cash performance as a result of disciplined management of CapEx and working capital. 
Asda is focused on repositioning its business through Project Renewal, which will simplify operations, lead to substantial reduction in costs and allow for significant investments in customer value. As part of this project, we're deploying a new cost analytics program to aid with buying. We're also joining EMD, a European buying alliance. And we recently completed the purchase of 2 meat processing businesses. These actions will help increase buying efficiencies and remove costs from the supply chain, particularly for private label products. The U.K. has also completed a restructuring of its Home Office, aimed at increasing focus and improving operational agility. In addition, the U.K. will invest an additional GBP 500 million in price during the period of its 5-year strategy on top of the GBP 1 billion previously committed. We're taking aggressive actions, and we're focused on repositioning our offering to meet the changing needs of our customers. 
In China, despite ongoing economic challenges and slower GDP growth, we continued to gain share for the 12th consecutive quarter in the hypermarket channel, according to Nielsen. Net sales grew 0.3%, driven by new store openings and improved performance from completed remodels. Comp sales fell 3% in part due to warmer weather and disappointing sales in winter seasonal categories. We continue to make progress in building a platform for sustainable growth in China. We're benefiting from our earlier actions to centralize our buying offices and build out our supply chain. We've improved our gross margin rate and have realized benefits from productivity initiatives while investing in labor and customer experience. We can see momentum building as performance in fresh has improved in recent quarters in both sales and margin. Operating income continues to grow faster than sales. The team in China is focused on delivering a trusted shopping experience through both physical and digital channels. We're starting to see the benefits from tighter collaboration with Yihaodian. In Shenzhen and Guangzhou, Walmart now leverages Yihaodian's last-mile network for online orders, which has led to greater delivery capacity. Overall, we're excited about the actions we're taking in China that are setting us up for long-term growth.  
In Brazil, we continue to face political and economic instability. The deterioration in the macro environment, combined with persistent high inflation, continues to put a strain on customers. Net sales grew 1.2% and comps grew 0.8% in a retail market that contracted by 5.7%, according to Serasa Experian. We were encouraged by another quarter of double-digit growth in our wholesale business, mostly offset by continued softness in the hypermarket format. Operating income was down versus last year, driven by the cost to close the 60 stores announced earlier. Excluding store closure costs, operating income would have been relatively flat to last year. We're seeing positive results from some of our transformation initiatives, such as repositioning the customer proposition in our wholesale business, but there's still work to be done. Brazil's focus for the year ahead will be to finalize store closures, revise and reposition the customer proposition for our hypermarket format and complete the integration of systems and processes in our stores. We are committed to turnaround efforts in this important market.  
As I wrap up, I'd like to recognize the efforts of our dedicated International associates operating in 28 countries around the globe that helped us achieve consistently good results throughout the year. I'm confident in the management teams we have leading our markets and the strategic priorities we have in place to drive further growth in the year ahead.

I'll start today's call with details around our fourth quarter performance. I'll also provide an update on how we have begun to execute against the strategy that I detailed during our third quarter earnings call. At Sam's Club, we remain laser-focused on our members. Through investments we've made and will continue to make in people and technology, we will deliver for our members a seamless shopping experience across our app, our site and our clubs. 
Let's begin by talking about our fourth quarter results. It's important to note that our reported results were negatively impacted by certain charges totaling approximately $77 million. This amount includes a charge of approximately $57 million resulting from our decision to close underperforming clubs. The remainder of the charges includes a policy change related to paid time-off as well as severance and other costs associated with recently announced organizational enhancements. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with fuel and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript. 
Comp sales for the fourth quarter were below our expectations. Severe winter storms significantly disrupted approximately 200 clubs toward the end of the quarter, which resulted in a negative impact to the comp of approximately 30 basis points. That said, we know that our core comp performance can improve and it will. The work we have underway, which I'll talk about in just a bit, is designed in part to improve the fundamentals of our business, specifically membership and merchandising. 
Broadly speaking, trends that we saw throughout the year were again prevalent during the quarter. Among the most notable items were: softness in food, primarily as a result of a minimal level of inflation or in some instances, deflation in key categories; an impact to grocery as we begin to evolve the assortment; and challenges in the technology and entertainment area from a deliberate transition in space reallocation, along with pressures in wireless. Yet we know that where we have seen innovation in the assortment and in service offerings, we have seen success. I'll talk more about our merchandise categories in a moment. 
Net sales decreased 0.1% as comp sales declined 0.5%. Slide 10 of the financial presentation provides the components of our comp sales. We were pleased with the performance of our Savings members as positive momentum in traffic continued. But softness from our Business member negatively impacted our results. Gross profit rate decreased 4 basis points from last year. We continued to invest in membership value through price and our cash rewards program. 
Operating expenses deleveraged during the quarter. As expected, investments in people and technology pressured our expenses. Additionally, charges for the items I mentioned earlier impacted Q4. Excluding these items, operating expense as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat compared with last year. Membership income increased 5.6% during Q4. Plus renewals increased 35% over last year and we continue to see a favorable trend of renewal rates for Plus members. The value of a Sam's Club membership is clear. Our targeted marketing programs resulted in new membership acquisitions that accelerated each of the last 3 quarters versus last year.  
Let's turn now to our merchandising categories. I'll provide details on areas that were materially impactful to the quarter. Please see Slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories. In 
fresh/freezer/cooler, deflationary trends continued, particularly in fresh meat and dairy. We saw positive results in produce, yet headwinds from the remainder of the category proved too much to overcome. Dry grocery and areas of fresh experienced pressures from deflation. As we continue to expand our private brand, generate more newness and reallocate space, these areas are gaining member acceptance but will take careful handling and coordination. Technology/entertainment/office had some bright spots with new items in TVs and wearables, both of which performed well online and in clubs. Wireless installment plans continue to place pressure on the category.  
When we innovate, we see good results. In health and wellness and consumables, our Free/4/10 Plus benefit program in pharmacy is helping to lift the total category. Services are important to our members and they reward us when we deliver in this space. The technology services company, IMS Health, measures our market share of the 5 free scripts in the program. According to IMS, we grew share by 11 basis points for the 3 months ended December 31, 2015, and our share is nearly 25 basis points higher than it was prior to the launch of the program. Free/4/10 was also a strong contributor to membership upgrades to Plus since the beginning of the fiscal year.  
Moving on to e-commerce. This year, we made the decision to push many of our holiday events online and we were pleased with the response from our members. Our Holiday Savings Celebration on November 14 drove good results. And we were pleased with other events, including Cyber Monday. During the quarter, traffic to our site increased by 7% versus the prior year and the conversion improved by 18%. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in our pure e-commerce and mobile commerce capabilities. We're also excited about the integration of our digital and physical offerings. During Q4, Club Pickup increased 46% over last year and it now represents the fastest-growing piece of our business. Members want to shop with Sam's Club how and where they choose, and we are building the infrastructure across multiple channels to deliver that experience.  
On our call from Q3, I talked about a new strategy. During Q4, we began to execute against that strategy in important ways, including: additional organizational enhancements that will better align talent with critical needs; portfolio management through the closure of underperforming clubs; an extensive review of merchandise categories; and the expansion of private label brands in key areas. These are only a few examples, and we have many other work streams underway. The totality of these efforts will address the fundamentals of our business, including membership and merchandising as well as deliver new services and offerings. As I think about guidance for the first quarter, I'm reminded that although we have accomplished a great deal over the previous months, it remains early days in our transformation. As a result, comp sales without fuel for the 13-week period ending April 29, 2016, are expected to be around flat. 
Let me close today with a few thoughts. First, the new alignment of our organization will position the business to better serve our members. It was a significant step in our transformation, and we will begin to see the benefits in the coming quarter. Secondly, our new Chief Merchandising Officer has conducted a comprehensive review of our merchandise based on identified markets and what he has gleaned from our strategy work. We're excited about his early insights at this stage. I'm confident we're taking the business in the right direction now and for the future. Through a disciplined, refined approach to growth, we will deliver for our members a seamless shopping experience across app, site and club.

I want to pick up on Doug's comments about our opportunity to be the first to offer a seamless shopping experience at a scale that only Walmart can deliver. E-commerce at Walmart is about bringing together all of the pieces to help customers buy the items they want at Walmart prices however and wherever they want. Our customers look at us as one Walmart, one easy experience across our app, site and store or club. 
In a short span, we've built an e-commerce technology company inside of Walmart. We have rolled out a new technology platform and we have dramatically increased our physical distribution network. And in just the past 6 months, we've grown to serve over 20 markets with online grocery. During the fourth quarter, we started to get a glimpse into how these capabilities we've put into place are starting to come together to deliver the seamless customer experience. Looking forward, we're focused on 3 big opportunities: continuing to build a digital relationship with our customers, scaling our online assortment and expanding online grocery.  
For the quarter, Global eCommerce sales and GMV both grew at 8%. For the full year, sales grew 12% and GMV grew 13%. As we discussed in October, growth continues to be pressured by weakness in Brazil, China and the U.K., due to macroeconomic and competitive challenges. In China, we have rebuilt the Yihaodian leadership team since taking full ownership. And they continue to build on the strengths of their mobile engagement with the customers and increasing business through imported products. There is work to do there, but we are taking actions to improve the business and accelerate growth in one of our key markets. In Brazil, the team has been working to balance growth and profitability during an economically challenging period that we expect to continue throughout the fiscal year. In the U.S., we continued to grow the business and created a more seamless experience for our customers across our app, our site and our store. 
Looking more closely at holiday in the U.S. Walmart.com saw strong sales on the big days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. What was most exciting was how our new capability started to deliver seamless shopping for customers. As customers shopped on Walmart.com, our new platform was powering the front- and back-end shopping experience for the first time during holiday. Despite the complexity of a complete platform rebuild, Pangaea handled the intense holiday volume. Customers could order gifts even closer to Christmas this year and they saw our best on-time delivery rates ever, thanks to our new fulfillment centers. While the FCs opened just a few months before holiday, they lived up to our targets for efficiency and productivity. They showed that they can scale with our business and combine with our stores, DCs and transportation network to deliver speed, efficiency and better experiences for customers.  
Customers could also get their online orders the same day in stores. And we saw nearly a 40% jump in store pickup during the holidays. We were also able to blend our online and stores to serve customers how and where they were shopping. One great example was on the morning of Black Friday, when we saw a smart TV sell out online within 20 minutes. We had another TV from that supplier available in stores, so we dialed up the promotion on Walmart.com and made it did available for store pickup. The item quickly sold out in stores. To customers, it was a seamless access to a gift they wanted. It was a great example of the power of combining online with stores in close proximity to customers. 
Customers were also using our app to shop seamlessly across online and stores. We offered early access to the Black Friday circular on the mobile app for the first time. And the app jumped to the #1 spot in the Apple App Store that day. Customers also showed that they are now comfortable buying on their phone. This year, more than half of online sales were on a mobile device on Thanksgiving, which was double last year. We saw significant growth in mobile sales for the rest of the peak holiday period. With our app, customers were also able to create wish lists, check-in for store pickup and pick up item locations in stores. 
We continue to build on that app experience in the quarter with another powerful tool, Walmart Pay. We started testing it in a small group of stores. And the initial feedback from customers reinforced that the experience was simple and easy. Walmart Pay is the perfect example of how our app gives customers a seamless experience that merges digital and physical to make shopping faster and easier and gives customers a reason to form a digital relationship with Walmart. It was also a great example of how our teams align to deliver these experiences in just a few months.  
At SamsClub.com, we started the holidays with a big kickoff event on November 14, which delivered a triple-digit comp for the day. We also saw strong comps and record sales on the biggest days of the holiday season. Club Pickup continues to be a delighter for members, and we saw it hit an all-time high in December. We saw strong growth in both desktop and mobile conversion. And mobile purchases nearly tripled over last year. SamsClub.com has also continued to drive growth in digital member sign-ups. 
As we look at critical touch points that meld our app, site and store, we obviously think about online grocery. In October, we announced we were expanding from 5 markets to over 20. We've rolled out to those additional markets, and we're continuing to see the strong emotional response it triggers with customers and the very personal relationship they're forming with Walmart. Customers are literally jumping out of their cars to rave about it. And one of my recent favorites was a mom with 2 kids in the back of her car. She told us about how much easier it has made her life because she can shop where and when it's convenient, and then drive up and just get her groceries. She placed her order while she was relaxing and watching her kids play. Customers are inviting us into the fabric of their lives. In just a few months, we've dramatically increased online grocery and look for us to continue expanding this year.  
Behind all the capabilities we're delivering are some of the best technologists in the world. We've built an e-commerce technology company inside of Walmart. We've always had one of the strongest enterprise technology organizations. Those teams have worked closely to deliver experiences, like online grocery and Walmart Pay, that seamlessly merge the app, site and store. Last month, we announced that we are bringing together those teams under a single Walmart Technology banner. This aligns all of our technologists with how our customers see us, one Walmart. 
I'm excited about the building blocks we've put in place for the future and the ways we're starting to serve customers seamlessly across our app, site and store. We've replatformed our technology and physical distribution while continuing to grow our business. And we've quickly grown online grocery. This year, we'll focus on 3 areas: continuing to build a digital relationship with our customers, scaling our online assortment and expanding online grocery. All these will combine to offer customers compelling experiences that let them shop seamlessly with Walmart in ways that help them save money and save time. As we deliver that seamless experience across our app, site and store, we're building deeper relationships with customers. This relationship is key to building value for the enterprise. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Brett. Brett?"
313055,280452684,936309,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Neil. I'll wrap up today by providing some thoughts on the company's performance in fiscal year 2016 as well as our expectations for fiscal year 2017. Before we jump into guidance, I want to highlight a few items from the quarter and the year. O",1113,"Thanks, Neil. I'll wrap up today by providing some thoughts on the company's performance in fiscal year 2016 as well as our expectations for fiscal year 2017. Before we jump into guidance, I want to highlight a few items from the quarter and the year. 
Overall, we are pleased with the way we ended fiscal year 2016. In the fourth quarter, Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 0.6%, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and the fifth straight quarter of positive traffic. For the year, Walmart International delivered another solid financial performance with the very strong results in Canada and at Walmex. We generated full year constant currency revenue growth of nearly $14 billion or 2.8%. Currency impacted our full year revenue by over $17 billion. 
We continue to innovate to make progress towards a seamless shopping experience through a number of initiatives, including an increased number of online grocery markets. While we would have liked to have seen higher e-commerce sales growth this quarter, we continue to make good foundational progress for the future. For the year, we generated approximately $27 billion in operating cash flow, which speaks to our continued financial strength as we transform the company. I'm particularly pleased with our inventory performance in Walmart U.S. 
During the year, we returned over $10 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We were able to deliver consistent returns the shareholders while investing for the future. ROI decreased to 15.5%, primarily due to lower operating income as well as continued capital investments. Additionally, today, we announced an increase in our dividend from $1.96 per share to $2 per share in fiscal 2017. We've now increased our dividend for 43 consecutive years. 
Now I'd like to spend some time specifically on our EPS results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016. Fourth quarter and full year adjusted EPS were $1.49 and $4.59, respectively. Our reported EPS for the same periods were $1.43 and $4.57, respectively. Let me briefly discuss the discrete items that were factored into our adjusted EPS. Recall in January, we announced the closure of 269 stores globally. Charges for these store closures, which impact both the fourth quarter and full year earnings, resulted in a negative impact of $0.20 per share. Also our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full year benefited from the December passage by Congress of the tax extenders legislation, which we considered in our fourth quarter guidance. However, the fourth quarter and full year effective tax rate also benefited by $0.14 per share related to other discrete tax items in the quarter. Finally, our full year adjusted EPS also excludes the effects of a benefit of approximately $0.04 from an adjustment for certain leases we disclosed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Now let's shift gears and discuss fiscal year 2017 guidance. We remain confident that the investments we are making in our associates, our stores and our digital capabilities are the right ones and are better preparing Walmart for the future. It's also important to note that although we continue to invest in these important areas for the future, we will remain focused on managing expenses across the company. Our guidance today includes several important assumptions, including that the economic conditions in our largest markets remain generally consistent and that the currency exchange rates remain at current levels. 
From a capital standpoint, as we indicated at our October investor meeting, we expect capital investments to be approximately $11 billion in fiscal year 2017, down from fiscal year 2016. Currency remains a headwind for our business as it is for many U.S. multinational companies. Today, we expect a currency headwind of approximately $12 billion on net sales for fiscal year 2017. Additionally, currency is expected to impact EPS by approximately $0.10 per share this year, including approximately $0.03 in the first quarter.  
Now let's turn to full year sales growth guidance. In October, we guided that on a constant currency basis, net sales would grow 3% to 4% annually over the next 3 years. Excluding the impact of the recently announced store closures and the continuing impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our fiscal 2017 sales growth guidance would have remained in that same range. However, including store closures and the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, we now expect net sales growth to be relatively flat in fiscal year 2017. 
As for taxes, our earnings per share guidance is based on a fiscal 2017 estimated tax rate ranging between 31.5% and 33.5%. As is the norm, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in laws, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. In any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range.  
I also want to note that historically, the tax extenders legislation has been approved at the end of each year, impacting the fourth quarter tax rate. In the December legislation, many of the relevant tax provisions were either made permanent or passed through 2019. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2017, the benefits of the extenders will be spread across the full year rather than all being in the fourth quarter. Other discrete items as described above may still cause the effective tax rate to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. 
Taking into account the previously mentioned assumptions, including currency rates at today's levels, tax rate and the incremental wage investments of $1.5 billion, we expect the full year fiscal 2017 EPS to range between $4 and $4.30. This most closely compares to our adjusted earnings per share of $4.59 in fiscal year 2016 and is broadly in line with our guidance from October for our earnings per share to be down 6% to 12% in fiscal year 2017. With respect to the first quarter, we expect earnings per share to range between $0.80 and $0.95. This compares to the $1.03 we reported last year. When comparing to last year's EPS, it's important to note that the first quarter of this year will be impacted somewhat more on a year-over-year basis than subsequent quarters due to the timing of wage investments. 
In closing, I'm honored to serve as the Chief Financial Officer during this very exciting time at Walmart. All of us at Walmart are pleased with the progress we're making and the work of our great associates around the world. We look forward to building on that and serving our customers in the future."

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our first quarter results and an update on our overall strategy. We're off to a good start for the fiscal year. For the first quarter, EPS was $0.98, which is above t",1111,"Thanks, Pauline and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our first quarter results and an update on our overall strategy. 
We're off to a good start for the fiscal year. For the first quarter, EPS was $0.98, which is above the top end of our guidance. Excluding a $3.5 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $119.4 billion, which is growth of $4.6 billion or 4% over last year. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.9% to $115.9 billion. We exceeded both our EPS and Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance. 
As we described in October, we are improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening relationships with customers. We are encouraged by the Walmart U.S. comp and believe it's attributable to real improvement in our store experience. Our customers are giving us positive feedback. And I'm seeing it myself on store visits and you can see it in the traffic numbers. 
We delivered comp sales of 1% in Walmart U.S. due to continuing traffic increases, which improved 1.5% this quarter. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of positive comp sales, and our sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. 
It's exciting to see the improvement in core retail fundamentals. For example, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making our inventory. That progress is important in its own right and for cash flow purposes. But it can also help create a virtuous loop. When combined with our investments in training and associate education, wages and store structure, it's giving our associates more time on the sales floor to serve customers. Our customer satisfaction scores have continued to strengthen and our in-stock has gotten better. Our associates are responding and I'm proud of them, Greg Foran and the entire U.S. leadership team. 
In the quarter, we did a better job of managing costs. SG&A discipline improved as our store teams did a good job of more closely aligning expenses with sales growth. Better expense management in the quarter gave us increased confidence to initiate our next phase of U.S. price investment earlier than planned. Over time, we intend to lower prices further in a deliberate, strategic way to drive our productivity loop. Doing this in a sustainable way takes time and we are seeing progress. 
Globally, on a constant-currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV grew 7% and 7.5%, respectively. Growth here is too slow, the U.S. number is better than the global number but neither is as high as we'd like. We can see progress against several of the necessary capabilities for need to win in e-commerce but we're still working on a few others. We need them all to come together to see stronger growth. For example, our marketplace is ramping up but it takes time to build the assortment to the point where customers realize the depth of assortment. We now offer more than 10 million SKUs on Walmart.com, and we are growing that number through a combination of first party and third-party items. It makes sense that perception will trail reality and we'll work on both during the course of this year. 
We'll build on the successes we've seen around the world, including in the U.S., and we'll continue to work through the challenges we've experienced in key markets like Brazil, China and the U.K. where our e-commerce and mobile commerce sales are softer. 
We're pleased with our e-commerce operating system and happy to have our new e-commerce fulfillment centers operational, those are necessary building blocks. I'm excited about the ways we're using technology to deepen our relationships with customers and help them save both money and time. Our grocery pickup service in the U.S. continues to receive high marks from customers, and we're continuing to expand it. 
I'm pleased to share we're announcing 9 new markets today, bringing our total number of markets to nearly 40 by the end of this month. In addition, in some markets, we'll double the number of stores that offer the service locally in May. We expect to continue to quickly expand to new markets. 
The Walmart app is also allowing us to serve customers in convenient ways, whether it's by finding an item in store, researching a product or refilling a prescription. 
Walmart Pay is enhancing our ability to provide a seamless shopping experience as customers quickly pay with their phone. A few weeks ago, we began to expand this service nationwide and we're on schedule to complete the rollout by the end of June. 
Walmart International had a strong start to the year, with 10 of our 11 markets posting positive comp sales and 9 of those markets growing comp sales by more than 4% on a constant-currency basis. In particular, Walmex and Canada continued to perform well, with strong sales, market share gains and solid profit performance. 
China remains a strategic market for our future and is now our fourth largest international market from a sales standpoint. We recently held a Board of Directors meeting in China, and while visiting stores and e-commerce operations, I continue to be encouraged by the pace of operational improvements made by our team in China. 
A highly competitive environment and food deflation in the U.K. continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends in our business. We're focused on making strategic investments to improve our position in the market and invest in price, while being diligent in managing our bottom line and cash flow. 
At Sam's Club, we are pleased with the growth in membership income. Plus member penetration is near an all-time high and we like the trend we're seeing. It's clear that members recognize the value that a Plus membership brings. Comp sales for the period were in line with our guidance. But we know we can deliver stronger results. 
Leading in digital is a focus area for Sam's and the team is doing a good job of delivering for members as we continue to see strong growth in Club Pickup. 
Finally, we look forward to welcoming many of our shareholders, investors and associates to Northwest Arkansas in a few weeks for our annual meeting. This is one of my favorite weeks of the year as we get a chance to connect with you and share more of our thinking about the business. We also bring in associates from around the world. It's aspiring to see them and to hear their stores. We hope you'll join us for a great meeting. 
In summary, we are continuing to do what we said we do in our strategic plan and we're getting traction as a result. Now I'll turn it over to Brett."
313055,326063400,988574,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2017 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, May 19, 2016",2016-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug and good morning everyone. As Pauline mentioned, our earnings materials are a little different this quarter.

As Pauline mentioned, our earnings materials are a little different this quarter. Our intent is to continue to provide you with a high level of transparency and information but in a more efficient and concise manner. For example, we've added specific comments and highlights on the performance of each of our operating segments within the financial presentation instead of being spread out among several parts of a lengthy transcript. Therefore, it's important that you review the financial presentation in conjunction with the comments from Doug and me. We hope you find this new format more efficient and we look forward to any feedback you may have. 
With that, let's turn our attention to the results for the quarter. 
I would like to start by taking a minute to thank all of our associates around the world. Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to visit with associates in our U.S. stores, as well as in China, Japan and Brazil. And I was encouraged by the level of dedication they continue to demonstrate. As a company, we are executing against our strategic priorities and not only delivering short to mid term improvements but positioning Walmart for long-term success. 
We still have work to do. However, we are pleased that our first quarter results demonstrate continued progress. First quarter EPS of $0.98 as above our guidance range. During the quarter, we saw a benefit from lower utility and maintenance expenses due to a milder winter in the U.S. and slightly lower costs from store closures announced last quarter. 
From a revenue standpoint, excluding the $3.5 billion currency impact, total revenue increased $4.6 billion or 4% to $119.4 billion. On a reported basis, our total revenue increased 0.9% to $115.9 billion. Walmart U.S. delivered comp sales of 1% due to continuing solid traffic, which increased 1.5%. This was our seventh straight quarter of positive comp sales and our sixth straight quarter of positive comp traffic. 
Globally, e-commerce sales increased 7% and GMV grew by 7.5% in the first quarter on a constant-currency basis, which is not as strong as we wanted. 
We are pleased with the ways we are using technology to deepen our relationships with customers and helping them save both money and time. For example, our grocery pickup service in the U.S. will be in nearly 40 markets by the end of this month, which is up from 22 when we started the year. 
Advances we have made in fulfillment capabilities, including our most recent center in Southern California, where customers can get the items they want fast and at Walmart prices. Although we are making progress in several of our key priorities, we have more work to do, particularly in some of our largest international markets. 
Gross profit increased 60 basis points during the quarter, primarily driven by gross margin improvements in the U.S., which I will discuss in more detail shortly. During the quarter, we were more disciplined from an expense standpoint. However, as anticipated, total SG&A increased compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily as a result of our previously announced wage rate increase which took effect in February. As you review our financial statements, you will notice a reduction in interest expense as well as an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. As a reminder, the primary reason for the year-on-year variances is related to the sale-leaseback accounting correction we made in Canada during the first year of last year, which impacted these line items and had a de minimis overall impact on operating income and EPS. 
Along with solid operating performance, disciplined working capital management allowed us to generate approximately $4 billion of free cash flow, which compares to $2.2 billion generated in the first quarter of last year. We also returned $4.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends. During the quarter, we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2.7 billion. 
With that let's now turn our attention to the results for each of the operating segments. Walmart U.S. had a good first quarter with comp sales ahead of guidance driven by solid traffic growth. We continue to steadily execute against the plan we laid out a year ago and we are seeing positive results from these efforts. Our customers continue to tell us they are happy with the changes we're making in our stores as evidenced by our customer experience scores, which rose again this quarter versus last year. 
Comparable sales were up 1% in the first quarter despite continued impacts from deflation in food, which we estimate impacted our total comp by approximately 60 basis points relative to last year's first quarter comp. 
Customer traffic increased 1.5%. E-commerce contributed approximately 20 basis points to the overall comp. In addition, our Neighborhood Market format also delivered a comp sales increase of approximately 7%. We have good momentum in the business as on a two-year stack basis, comp sales for Walmart U.S. were up 2.1%. 
We saw strength in general merchandise, driven by solid sales growth in hardlines, home and seasonal and apparel. While entertainment continues to be a sales headwind, we did see some improving trends in electronics. Branded drug inflation and script growth drove pharmacy sales while better in-stock levels and a focus on the right assortment drove sales growth in both consumables and OTC. 
Gross margin improved 44 basis points in the quarter. We delivered improved margin rates in food, consumables and health and wellness as our continued focus on reducing costs both in how we operate the business and in procuring merchandise provided benefits. In addition, transportation costs benefited from lower fuel prices. We had some improvements in shrink and we also lapped last year's incremental expenses related to the West Coast port congestion. 
Operating expenses increased 11.5% over last year, primarily due to previously announced wage rate increases. However, our store teams were more efficient in managing expenses to more closely align with sales growth and a milder winter drove lower utility and maintenance expenses. 
Overall, the SG&A increase was partially offset by improved gross margins, which resulted in an operating income decline of 8.8%. Inventory continues to be a key focus area for Walmart U.S. and we're pleased with the progress we are making toward our goal of stronger working capital management. 
Inventory declined 3.5% in the first quarter, including a 5.7% decline in comp stores. The inventory discipline is driving benefits across the store, such as improved in-stock levels and more efficient processes for our associates. 
Finally, as we communicated in October, price investment is always an important part of our growth plan. We began the initial phase of additional price investment late in the first quarter, lowering prices on key items in select geographies. As always, we are committed to providing quality merchandise at a great value, using data and analytics to better serve our customers. 
Heading into the second quarter, the execution of Walmart U.S.'s strategic plan remains on course. For the 13-week period ending July 29, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%. As a reminder, the comp sales increase for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 1.5%. 
Now let's turn to Walmart International. Walmart International had a strong start to the year despite some continuing challenges in certain markets. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of our e-commerce performance. 
Comp sales remained strong with all markets other than the U.K. posting positive comp sales. Also worth mentioning, 9 of our markets grew comp sales by more than 4% on a constant-currency basis. This year, Easter benefited the first quarter some in international, as the holiday last year fell within the second quarter, given the 1-month reporting lag in all markets except Canada. 
Overall, net sales grew 4.3% on a constant-currency basis. Reported net sales declined 7.2%, due to the $3.5 billion currency headwind, although the impact was slightly less than anticipated. 
From an expense and cost of goods perspective, we're pleased with the continued progress we're making on our cost analytics program, which includes fact-based negotiations and new merchant tools. We are now expanding the program beyond the U.K. and Canada to include Mexico in Q2 and other markets in Q3 and Q4. We're also focused on We Operate For Less initiatives across our markets and we're pleased that we leverage expenses in the majority of our markets. 
From a profitability standpoint, operating income increased 22% on a constant-currency basis and increased 8.8% on a reported basis, driven by solid sales and broad gross profit rate improvement. On a constant-currency basis, inventory grew slower than net sales at 2.2%, due to a focus on reducing unproductive and obsolete merchandise. While on a reported basis, inventory declined 6.9%. 
Within the accompanying financial presentation, you will find detailed information for our 5 major markets. However, I will give some highlights on these markets starting with 2 which are performing exceptionally well. 
Walmex continues to lead the way delivering strong results. As a reminder, Walmex releases results under IFRS and the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some numbers may differ. Sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions and countries, led by strong results in food and consumables. Total sales and comp sales performance significantly outpaced the rest of the self-service market. Comp sales for Walmex increased 8.6% in the quarter. From a profitability standpoint, higher gross margins driven by strong inventory management, reduced clearance and good expense managements led to strong growth in operating income. 
In Canada, comp sales increased 6.7%, driven by strong traffic growth of 4.6%. Comp sales have now been positive for 8 consecutive quarters. The performance was driven by improvements in our merchandise assortment and price investment, which led to strong customer traffic growth. 
Our e-commerce business also continued to grow nicely with the expansion of online grocery in the greater Toronto area. Even as the e-commerce investments continued, our ability to leverage expenses led to growth in operating income that outpaced sales growth. 
The U.K. continues to struggle, due primarily to fierce competition. Improvements in price and product availability throughout the quarter were not enough to overcome traffic and food volume declines in our large format stores. However, Project Renewal remains a focus with the aim to simplify and strengthen the customer offer, reduce costs and drive sales. The cost analytics program, which is part of Project Renewal, made good progress and delivered savings we were able to invest back into the business. 
Our China business continues to grow and is now our fourth largest international market by revenue. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, a strong performance during Chinese New Year, a double-digit growth in gift card loading and continued strengthening in fresh categories led to good sales growth and positive comps. 
In Brazil, despite ongoing economic challenges, our team is making the right decisions to better position the business for both short and long-term success. We are pleased with the positive comp sales performance in the quarter. 
Overall, our international strategy remains simple and focused and we continue to execute against our key priorities around the world. 
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, net sales without fuel grew by 2.9%. Membership income increased by nearly 4% as Plus member renewals grew by more than 30% and Plus penetration was near an all-time high. 
Comp sales excluding fuel increased 0.1% in the period as deflation, especially in fresh meat and dairy, continued to be a headwind and negatively impact the comp sales by approximately 50 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. 
E-commerce performed well and contributed 60 basis points to the comp, including sales through Club Pickup, which grew by more than 30%. In addition, our direct to home business experienced very impressive growth. 
Gross profit rate increased 18 basis points even as we made investments in price and in the cash rewards program. As planned, investments in people and technology led to growth and operating expenses that outpaced our sales growth. 
The team at Sam's is in the early stages of executing against a strategy that was outlined at the end of last year. We know we have work to do and we are on the right path. For the 13-week period ending July 29, 2016, we expect comps sales to be slightly positive. 
So let's wrap things up. This is an exciting time for the company and our financial strength positions us to make the necessary investments in the business to drive sustainable long-term results. We are proud of our overall results in the first quarter and there is momentum in many parts of the business. 
Based on our reviews of the global operating environment and assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings per share to range between $0.95 and $1.08. We appreciate your interest in our company. I look forward to seeing many of you at our shareholders meeting in a couple of weeks."

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our first quarter results and an update on our overall strategy. We're off to a good start to the fiscal year. For the first quarter, EPS was $0.98, which is above",1103,"Thanks, Pauline, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our first quarter results and an update on our overall strategy. 
We're off to a good start to the fiscal year. For the first quarter, EPS was $0.98, which is above the top end of our guidance. Excluding a $3.5 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $119.4 billion, which is growth of $4.6 billion or 4% over last year. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.9% to $115.9 billion. We exceeded both our EPS and Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance. 
As we described in October, we're improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening relationships with customers. We're encouraged by the Walmart U.S. comp and believe it's attributable to real improvement in our store experience. Our customers are giving us positive feedback. And I'm seeing it myself on store visits, and you can see it in the traffic numbers. 
We delivered comp sales of 1% in Walmart U.S. due to continuing traffic increases, which improved 1.5% this quarter. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and our sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. 
It's exciting to see the improvement in core retail fundamentals. For example, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making on inventory. That progress is important in its own right and for cash flow purposes, but it can also help create a virtuous loop. When combined with our investments in training and associate education, wages and store structure, it's giving our associates more time on the sales floor to serve customers. Our customer satisfaction scores have continued to strengthen, and our in-stock has gotten better. Our associates are responding, and I'm proud of them, Greg Foran and the entire U.S. leadership team. 
In the quarter, we did a better job of managing costs. SG&A discipline improved as our store teams did a good job of more closely aligning expenses with sales growth. Better expense management in the quarter gave us increased confidence to initiate our next phase of U.S. price investment earlier than planned. Over time, we intend to lower prices further in a deliberate, strategic way to drive our productivity loop. Doing this in a sustainable way takes time, and we're seeing progress. 
Globally, on a constant-currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV grew 7% and 7.5%, respectively. Growth here is too slow. The U.S. number is better than the global number but neither is as high as we'd like. We can see progress against several of the necessary capabilities we need to win in e-commerce, but we're still working on a few others. We need them all to come together to see stronger growth. 
For example, our marketplace is ramping up, but it takes time to build the assortment to the point where customers realize the depth of assortment. We now offer more than 10 million SKUs on walmart.com, and we're growing that number through a combination of first-party and third-party items. It makes sense that perception will trail reality, and we'll work on both during the course of this year. We'll build on the successes we've seen around the world, including in the U.S., and we'll continue to work through the challenges we've experienced in key markets like Brazil, China and the U.K., where our e-commerce and mobile commerce sales are softer. 
We're pleased with our e-commerce operating system and happy to have our new e-commerce fulfillment centers operational. Those are necessary building blocks. I'm excited about the ways we're using technology to deepen our relationship with customers and help them save both money and time. Our grocery pickup service in the U.S. continues to receive high marks from customers, and we're continuing to expand it. 
I'm pleased to share we're announcing 9 new markets today, bringing our total number of markets to nearly 40 by the end of this month. In addition, in some markets, we'll double the number of stores that offer the service locally in May. We expect to continue to quickly expand to new markets. 
The Walmart app is also allowing us to serve customers in convenient ways, whether it's by finding an item in store, researching a product or refilling a prescription. Walmart Pay is enhancing our ability to provide a seamless shopping experience as customers quickly pay with their phone. A few weeks ago, we began to expand this service nationwide, and we're on schedule to complete the rollout by the end of June. 
Walmart International had a strong start to the year, with 10 of our 11 markets posting positive comp sales and 9 of those markets growing comp sales by more than 4% on a constant-currency basis. In particular, Walmex and Canada continued to perform well, with strong sales, market share gains and solid profit performance. 
China remains a strategic market for our future and is now our fourth largest international market from a sales standpoint. We recently held a Board of Directors meeting in China. And while visiting stores and e-commerce operations, I continue to be encouraged by the pace of operational improvements made by our team in China. 
A highly competitive environment and food deflation in the U.K. continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends in our business. We're focused on making strategic investments to improve our position in the market and invest in price while being diligent in managing our bottom line and cash flow. 
At Sam's Club, we're pleased with the growth in membership income. Plus Member penetration is near an all-time high, and we like the trend we're seeing. It's clear that members recognize the value that a Plus membership brings. Comp sales for the period were in line with our guidance, but we know we can deliver stronger results. Leading in digital is a focus area for Sam's, and the team is doing a good job of delivering for members as we continue to see strong growth in Club Pickup. 
Finally, we look forward to welcoming many of our shareholders, investors and associates to northwest Arkansas in a few weeks for our Annual Meeting. This is one of my favorite weeks of the year as we get a chance to connect with you and share more of our thinking about the business. We also bring in associates from around the world. It's inspiring to see them and hear their stores. We hope you'll join us for a great meeting. In summary, we're continuing to do what we said we'd do on our strategic plan, and we're getting traction as a result. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brett."

As a company, we're executing against our strategic priorities and not only delivering short- to midterm improvements but positioning Walmart for long-term success. 
We still have work to do. However, we are pleased that our first quarter results demonstrate continued progress. First quarter EPS of $0.98 was above our guidance range. During the quarter, we saw benefit from lower utility and maintenance expenses due to a milder winter in the U.S. and slightly lower cost from store closures announced last quarter. 
From a revenue standpoint, excluding the $3.5 billion currency impact, total revenue increased $4.6 billion or 4% to $119.4 billion. On a reported basis, our total revenue increased 0.9% to $115.9 billion. Walmart U.S. delivered comp sales of 1% due to continuing solid traffic, which increased 1.5%. This was our seventh straight quarter of positive comp sales and our sixth straight quarter of positive comp traffic. 
Globally, e-commerce sales increased 7%, and GMV grew by 7.5% in the first quarter on a constant-currency basis, which is not as strong as we wanted. We are pleased with the ways we're using technology to deepen our relationships with customers and helping them save both money and time. For example, our grocery pickup service in the U.S. will be in nearly 40 markets by the end of this month, which is up from 22 when we started the year. Advances we have made in fulfillment capabilities, including our most recent center in southern California, mean customers can get the items they want fast and at Walmart prices. Although we are making progress on several of our key priorities, we have more work to do, particularly in some of our largest international markets. 
Gross profit increased 60 basis points during the quarter, primarily driven by gross margin improvements in the U.S., which I will discuss in more detail shortly. During the quarter, we were more disciplined from an expense standpoint. However, as anticipated, total SG&A increased compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily as a result of our previously announced wage rate increase, which took effect in February. 
As you review our financial statements, you will notice a reduction in interest expense as well as an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. As a reminder, the primary reason for the year-on-year variances is related to the sale-leaseback accounting correction we made in Canada during the first quarter of last year, which impacted these line items and had a de minimis overall impact on operating income and EPS. 
Along with solid operating performance, disciplined working capital management allowed us to generate approximately $4 billion of free cash flow, which compares to $2.2 billion generated in the first quarter of last year. We also returned $4.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends. During the quarter, we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2.7 billion. 
With that, let's now turn our attention to the results for each of the operating segments. Walmart U.S. had a good first quarter, with comp sales ahead of guidance, driven by solid traffic growth. We continued to steadily execute against the plan we laid out a year ago, and we're seeing positive results from these efforts. Our customers continue to tell us they are happy with the changes we're making in our stores, as evidenced by our customer experience scores which rose again this quarter versus last year. 
Comparable sales were up 1% in the first quarter despite continued impacts from deflation in food, which we estimate impacted our total comp by approximately 60 basis points relative to last year's first quarter comp. Customer traffic increased 1.5%. E-commerce contributed approximately 20 basis points to the overall comp. In addition, our Neighborhood Market format also delivered a comp sales increase of approximately 7%. We have good momentum in the business as, on a 2-year stack basis, comp sales for Walmart U.S. were up 2.1%. 
We saw strength in general merchandise, driven by solid sales growth in hardlines, home and seasonal and apparel. While entertainment continues to be a sales headwind, we did see some improving trends in electronics. Branded drug inflation and script growth drove pharmacy sales while better in-stock levels and a focus on the right assortment drove sales growth in both consumables and OTC. 
Gross margin improved 44 basis points in the quarter. We delivered improved margin rates in food, consumables and health and wellness as our continued focus on reducing costs, both in how we operate the business and in procuring merchandise, provided benefits. In addition, transportation costs benefited from lower fuel prices. We had some improvements in shrink, and we also lapped last year's incremental expenses related to the West Coast port congestion. 
Operating expenses increased 11.5% over last year primarily due to previously announced wage rate increases. However, our store teams were more efficient in managing expenses to more closely align with sales growth, and a milder winter drove lower utility and maintenance expenses. Overall, the SG&A increase was partially offset by improved gross margins, which resulted in an operating income decline of 8.8%. 
Inventory continues to be a key focus area for Walmart U.S., and we're pleased with the progress we're making toward our goal of stronger working capital management. 
Inventory declined 3.5% in the first quarter, including a 5.7% decline in comp stores. The inventory discipline is driving benefits across the store, such as improved in-stock levels and more efficient processes for our associates. 
Finally, as we communicated in October, price investment is always an important part of our growth plan. We began the initial phase of additional price investment late in the first quarter, lowering prices on key items in select geographies. As always, we're committed to providing quality merchandise at a great value, using data and analytics to better serve our customers. 
Heading into the second quarter, the execution of Walmart U.S.' strategic plan remains on course. For the 13-week period ending July 29, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%. As a reminder, the comp sales increase for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 1.5%. 
Now let's turn to Walmart International. Walmart International had a strong start to the year despite some continuing challenges in certain markets. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of our e-commerce performance. 
Comp sales remained strong with all markets other than the U.K. posting positive comp sales. Also worth mentioning, 9 of our markets grew comp sales by more than 4% on a constant-currency basis. This year, Easter benefited the first quarter some in international as the holiday last year fell within the second quarter, given the 1-month reporting lag in all markets except Canada. Overall, net sales grew 4.3% on a constant-currency basis. Reported net sales declined 7.2% due to the $3.5 billion currency headwind, although the impact was slightly less than anticipated. 
From an expense and cost of goods perspective, we're pleased with the continued progress we're making on our cost analytics program, which includes fact-based negotiations and new merchant tools. We're now expanding the program beyond the U.K. and Canada to include Mexico in Q2 and other markets in Q3 and Q4. We're also focused on We Operate For Less initiatives across our markets, and we're pleased that we leveraged expenses in the majority of our markets. 
From a profitability standpoint, operating income increased 22% on a constant-currency basis and increased 8.8% on a reported basis, driven by solid sales and broad gross profit rate improvement. On a constant-currency basis, inventory grew slower than net sales at 2.2% due to a focus on reducing unproductive and obsolete merchandise while, on a reported basis, inventory declined 6.9%. 
Within the accompanying financial presentation, you will find detailed information for our 5 major markets. However, I will give some highlights on these markets, starting with 2 which are performing exceptionally well. Walmex continues to lead the way, delivering strong results. As a reminder, Walmex releases results under IFRS, and the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some numbers may differ. 
Sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions and countries, led by strong results in food and consumables. Total sales and comp sales performance significantly outpaced the rest of the self-service market. Comp sales for Walmex increased 8.6% in the quarter. From a profitability standpoint, higher gross margins driven by strong inventory management, reduced clearance and good expense managements led to strong growth in operating income. 
In Canada, comp sales increased 6.7%, driven by strong traffic growth of 4.6%. Comp sales have now been positive for 8 consecutive quarters. Their performance was driven by improvements in our merchandise assortment and price investment, which led to strong customer traffic growth. Our e-commerce business also continue to grow nicely with the expansion of online grocery in the greater Toronto area. Even as the e-commerce investments continued, our ability to leverage expenses led to growth in operating income that outpaced sales growth. 
The U.K. continues to struggle due primarily to fierce competition. Improvements in price and product availability throughout the quarter were not enough to overcome traffic and food volume declines in our large-format stores. However, Project Renewal remains a focus with the aim to simplify and strengthen the customer offer, reduce costs and drive sales. The cost analytics program, which is part of Project Renewal, made good progress and delivered savings we were able to invest back into the business. 
Our China business continues to grow and is now our fourth largest international market by revenue. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, a strong performance during Chinese New Year, double-digit growth in gift card loading and continued strengthening in fresh categories led to good sales growth and positive comps. 
In Brazil, despite ongoing economic challenges, our team is making the right decisions to better position the business for both short- and long-term success. We are pleased with the positive comp sales performance in the quarter. Overall, our international strategy remains simple and focused, and we continue to execute against our key priorities around the world. 
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, net sales without fuel grew by 2.9%. Membership income increased by nearly 4% as Plus Member renewals grew by more than 30% and Plus penetration was near an all-time high.  
Comp sales excluding fuel increased 0.1% in the period as deflation, especially in fresh meat and dairy, continued to be a headwind and negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 50 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. E-commerce performed well and contributed 60 basis points to the comp, including sales through Club Pickup, which grew by more than 30%. In addition, our direct-to-home business experienced impressive growth. 
Gross profit rate increased 18 basis points even as we made investments in price and in the cash rewards program. As planned, investments in people and technology led to growth in operating expenses that outpaced our sales growth. 
The team at Sam's is in the early stages of executing against the strategy that was outlined at the end of last year. We know we have work to do, and we're on the right path. For the 13-week period ending July 29, 2016, we expect comps sales to be slightly positive. 
So let's wrap things up. This is an exciting time for the company, and our financial strength positions us to make the necessary investments in the business to drive sustainable long-term results. We are proud of our overall results in the first quarter, and there is momentum in many parts of the business. 
Based on our views of the global operating environment and assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings per share to range between $0.95 and $1.08. We appreciate your interest in our company. I look forward to seeing many of you at our shareholders meeting in a couple of weeks."

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our first quarter results and an update on our overall strategy. We're off to a good start to the fiscal year. For the first quarter, EPS was $0.98, which is above",1103,"Thanks, Pauline, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our first quarter results and an update on our overall strategy. 
We're off to a good start to the fiscal year. For the first quarter, EPS was $0.98, which is above the top end of our guidance. Excluding a $3.5 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $119.4 billion, which is growth of $4.6 billion or 4% over last year. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.9% to $115.9 billion. We exceeded both our EPS and Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance. 
As we described in October, we're improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening relationships with customers. We're encouraged by the Walmart U.S. comp and believe it's attributable to real improvement in our store experience. Our customers are giving us positive feedback. And I'm seeing it myself on store visits, and you can see it in the traffic numbers. 
We delivered comp sales of 1% in Walmart U.S. due to continuing traffic increases, which improved 1.5% this quarter. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and our sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. 
It's exciting to see the improvement in core retail fundamentals. For example, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making on inventory. That progress is important in its own right and for cash flow purposes, but it can also help create a virtuous loop. When combined with our investments in training and associate education, wages and store structure, it's giving our associates more time on the sales floor to serve customers. Our customer satisfaction scores have continued to strengthen, and our in-stock has gotten better. Our associates are responding, and I'm proud of them, Greg Foran and the entire U.S. leadership team. 
In the quarter, we did a better job of managing costs. SG&A discipline improved as our store teams did a good job of more closely aligning expenses with sales growth. Better expense management in the quarter gave us increased confidence to initiate our next phase of U.S. price investment earlier than planned. Over time, we intend to lower prices further in a deliberate, strategic way to drive our productivity loop. Doing this in a sustainable way takes time, and we're seeing progress. 
Globally, on a constant-currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV grew 7% and 7.5%, respectively. Growth here is too slow. The U.S. number is better than the global number but neither is as high as we'd like. We can see progress against several of the necessary capabilities we need to win in e-commerce, but we're still working on a few others. We need them all to come together to see stronger growth. 
For example, our marketplace is ramping up, but it takes time to build the assortment to the point where customers realize the depth of assortment. We now offer more than 10 million SKUs on walmart.com, and we're growing that number through a combination of first-party and third-party items. It makes sense that perception will trail reality, and we'll work on both during the course of this year. We'll build on the successes we've seen around the world, including in the U.S., and we'll continue to work through the challenges we've experienced in key markets like Brazil, China and the U.K., where our e-commerce and mobile commerce sales are softer. 
We're pleased with our e-commerce operating system and happy to have our new e-commerce fulfillment centers operational. Those are necessary building blocks. I'm excited about the ways we're using technology to deepen our relationship with customers and help them save both money and time. Our grocery pickup service in the U.S. continues to receive high marks from customers, and we're continuing to expand it. 
I'm pleased to share we're announcing 9 new markets today, bringing our total number of markets to nearly 40 by the end of this month. In addition, in some markets, we'll double the number of stores that offer the service locally in May. We expect to continue to quickly expand to new markets. 
The Walmart app is also allowing us to serve customers in convenient ways, whether it's by finding an item in store, researching a product or refilling a prescription. Walmart Pay is enhancing our ability to provide a seamless shopping experience as customers quickly pay with their phone. A few weeks ago, we began to expand this service nationwide, and we're on schedule to complete the rollout by the end of June. 
Walmart International had a strong start to the year, with 10 of our 11 markets posting positive comp sales and 9 of those markets growing comp sales by more than 4% on a constant-currency basis. In particular, Walmex and Canada continued to perform well, with strong sales, market share gains and solid profit performance. 
China remains a strategic market for our future and is now our fourth largest international market from a sales standpoint. We recently held a Board of Directors meeting in China. And while visiting stores and e-commerce operations, I continue to be encouraged by the pace of operational improvements made by our team in China. 
A highly competitive environment and food deflation in the U.K. continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends in our business. We're focused on making strategic investments to improve our position in the market and invest in price while being diligent in managing our bottom line and cash flow. 
At Sam's Club, we're pleased with the growth in membership income. Plus Member penetration is near an all-time high, and we like the trend we're seeing. It's clear that members recognize the value that a Plus membership brings. Comp sales for the period were in line with our guidance, but we know we can deliver stronger results. Leading in digital is a focus area for Sam's, and the team is doing a good job of delivering for members as we continue to see strong growth in Club Pickup. 
Finally, we look forward to welcoming many of our shareholders, investors and associates to northwest Arkansas in a few weeks for our Annual Meeting. This is one of my favorite weeks of the year as we get a chance to connect with you and share more of our thinking about the business. We also bring in associates from around the world. It's inspiring to see them and hear their stores. We hope you'll join us for a great meeting. In summary, we're continuing to do what we said we'd do on our strategic plan, and we're getting traction as a result. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brett."

Therefore, it's important that you review the financial presentation in conjunction with the comments from Doug and me. We hope you find this new format more efficient, and we look forward to any feedback you may have. 
With that, let's turn our attention to the results for the quarter. I would like to start by taking a minute to thank all of our associates around the world. Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to visit with associates in our U.S. stores as well as in China, Japan and Brazil, and I was encouraged by the level of dedication they continue to demonstrate. As a company, we're executing against our strategic priorities and not only delivering short- to midterm improvements but positioning Walmart for long-term success. 
We still have work to do. However, we are pleased that our first quarter results demonstrate continued progress. First quarter EPS of $0.98 was above our guidance range. During the quarter, we saw benefit from lower utility and maintenance expenses due to a milder winter in the U.S. and slightly lower cost from store closures announced last quarter. 
From a revenue standpoint, excluding the $3.5 billion currency impact, total revenue increased $4.6 billion or 4% to $119.4 billion. On a reported basis, our total revenue increased 0.9% to $115.9 billion. Walmart U.S. delivered comp sales of 1% due to continuing solid traffic, which increased 1.5%. This was our seventh straight quarter of positive comp sales and our sixth straight quarter of positive comp traffic. 
Globally, e-commerce sales increased 7%, and GMV grew by 7.5% in the first quarter on a constant-currency basis, which is not as strong as we wanted. We are pleased with the ways we're using technology to deepen our relationships with customers and helping them save both money and time. For example, our grocery pickup service in the U.S. will be in nearly 40 markets by the end of this month, which is up from 22 when we started the year. Advances we have made in fulfillment capabilities, including our most recent center in southern California, mean customers can get the items they want fast and at Walmart prices. Although we are making progress on several of our key priorities, we have more work to do, particularly in some of our largest international markets. 
Gross profit increased 60 basis points during the quarter, primarily driven by gross margin improvements in the U.S., which I will discuss in more detail shortly. During the quarter, we were more disciplined from an expense standpoint. However, as anticipated, total SG&A increased compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily as a result of our previously announced wage rate increase, which took effect in February. 
As you review our financial statements, you will notice a reduction in interest expense as well as an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. As a reminder, the primary reason for the year-on-year variances is related to the sale-leaseback accounting correction we made in Canada during the first quarter of last year, which impacted these line items and had a de minimis overall impact on operating income and EPS. 
Along with solid operating performance, disciplined working capital management allowed us to generate approximately $4 billion of free cash flow, which compares to $2.2 billion generated in the first quarter of last year. We also returned $4.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends. During the quarter, we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2.7 billion. 
With that, let's now turn our attention to the results for each of the operating segments. Walmart U.S. had a good first quarter, with comp sales ahead of guidance, driven by solid traffic growth. We continued to steadily execute against the plan we laid out a year ago, and we're seeing positive results from these efforts. Our customers continue to tell us they are happy with the changes we're making in our stores, as evidenced by our customer experience scores which rose again this quarter versus last year. 
Comparable sales were up 1% in the first quarter despite continued impacts from deflation in food, which we estimate impacted our total comp by approximately 60 basis points relative to last year's first quarter comp. Customer traffic increased 1.5%. E-commerce contributed approximately 20 basis points to the overall comp. In addition, our Neighborhood Market format also delivered a comp sales increase of approximately 7%. We have good momentum in the business as, on a 2-year stack basis, comp sales for Walmart U.S. were up 2.1%. 
We saw strength in general merchandise, driven by solid sales growth in hardlines, home and seasonal and apparel. While entertainment continues to be a sales headwind, we did see some improving trends in electronics. Branded drug inflation and script growth drove pharmacy sales while better in-stock levels and a focus on the right assortment drove sales growth in both consumables and OTC. 
Gross margin improved 44 basis points in the quarter. We delivered improved margin rates in food, consumables and health and wellness as our continued focus on reducing costs, both in how we operate the business and in procuring merchandise, provided benefits. In addition, transportation costs benefited from lower fuel prices. We had some improvements in shrink, and we also lapped last year's incremental expenses related to the West Coast port congestion. 
Operating expenses increased 11.5% over last year primarily due to previously announced wage rate increases. However, our store teams were more efficient in managing expenses to more closely align with sales growth, and a milder winter drove lower utility and maintenance expenses. Overall, the SG&A increase was partially offset by improved gross margins, which resulted in an operating income decline of 8.8%. 
Inventory continues to be a key focus area for Walmart U.S., and we're pleased with the progress we're making toward our goal of stronger working capital management. 
Inventory declined 3.5% in the first quarter, including a 5.7% decline in comp stores. The inventory discipline is driving benefits across the store, such as improved in-stock levels and more efficient processes for our associates. 
Finally, as we communicated in October, price investment is always an important part of our growth plan. We began the initial phase of additional price investment late in the first quarter, lowering prices on key items in select geographies. As always, we're committed to providing quality merchandise at a great value, using data and analytics to better serve our customers. 
Heading into the second quarter, the execution of Walmart U.S.' strategic plan remains on course. For the 13-week period ending July 29, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%. As a reminder, the comp sales increase for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 1.5%. 
Now let's turn to Walmart International. Walmart International had a strong start to the year despite some continuing challenges in certain markets. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of our e-commerce performance. 
Comp sales remained strong with all markets other than the U.K. posting positive comp sales. Also worth mentioning, 9 of our markets grew comp sales by more than 4% on a constant-currency basis. This year, Easter benefited the first quarter some in international as the holiday last year fell within the second quarter, given the 1-month reporting lag in all markets except Canada. Overall, net sales grew 4.3% on a constant-currency basis. Reported net sales declined 7.2% due to the $3.5 billion currency headwind, although the impact was slightly less than anticipated. 
From an expense and cost of goods perspective, we're pleased with the continued progress we're making on our cost analytics program, which includes fact-based negotiations and new merchant tools. We're now expanding the program beyond the U.K. and Canada to include Mexico in Q2 and other markets in Q3 and Q4. We're also focused on We Operate For Less initiatives across our markets, and we're pleased that we leveraged expenses in the majority of our markets. 
From a profitability standpoint, operating income increased 22% on a constant-currency basis and increased 8.8% on a reported basis, driven by solid sales and broad gross profit rate improvement. On a constant-currency basis, inventory grew slower than net sales at 2.2% due to a focus on reducing unproductive and obsolete merchandise while, on a reported basis, inventory declined 6.9%. 
Within the accompanying financial presentation, you will find detailed information for our 5 major markets. However, I will give some highlights on these markets, starting with 2 which are performing exceptionally well. Walmex continues to lead the way, delivering strong results. As a reminder, Walmex releases results under IFRS, and the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some numbers may differ. 
Sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions and countries, led by strong results in food and consumables. Total sales and comp sales performance significantly outpaced the rest of the self-service market. Comp sales for Walmex increased 8.6% in the quarter. From a profitability standpoint, higher gross margins driven by strong inventory management, reduced clearance and good expense managements led to strong growth in operating income. 
In Canada, comp sales increased 6.7%, driven by strong traffic growth of 4.6%. Comp sales have now been positive for 8 consecutive quarters. Their performance was driven by improvements in our merchandise assortment and price investment, which led to strong customer traffic growth. Our e-commerce business also continued to grow nicely with the expansion of online grocery in the greater Toronto area. Even as the e-commerce investments continued, our ability to leverage expenses led to growth in operating income that outpaced sales growth. 
The U.K. continues to struggle due primarily to fierce competition. Improvements in price and product availability throughout the quarter were not enough to overcome traffic and food volume declines in our large-format stores. However, Project Renewal remains a focus with the aim to simplify and strengthen the customer offer, reduce cost and drive sales. The cost analytics program, which is part of Project Renewal, made good progress and delivered savings we were able to invest back into the business. 
Our China business continues to grow and is now our fourth largest international market by revenue. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, a strong performance during Chinese New Year, double-digit growth in gift card loading and continued strengthening in fresh categories led to good sales growth and positive comps. 
In Brazil, despite ongoing economic challenges, our team is making the right decisions to better position the business for both short- and long-term success. We are pleased with the positive comp sales performance in the quarter. Overall, our international strategy remains simple and focused, and we continue to execute against our key priorities around the world. 
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, net sales without fuel grew by 2.9%. Membership income increased by nearly 4% as Plus Member renewables grew by more than 30% and Plus penetration was near an all-time high.  
Comp sales excluding fuel increased 0.1% in the period as deflation, especially in fresh meat and dairy, continued to be a headwind and negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 50 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. E-commerce performed well and contributed 60 basis points to the comp, including sales through Club Pickup, which grew by more than 30%. In addition, our direct-to-home business experienced impressive growth. 
Gross profit rate increased 18 basis points even as we made investments in price and in the cash rewards program. As planned, investments in people and technology led to growth in operating expenses that outpaced our sales growth. 
The team at Sam's is in the early stages of executing against the strategy that was outlined at the end of last year. We know we have work to do, and we're on the right path. For the 13-week period ending July 29, 2016, we expect comps sales to be slightly positive. 
So let's wrap things up. This is an exciting time for the company, and our financial strength positions us to make the necessary investments in the business to drive sustainable long-term results. We are proud of our overall results in the first quarter, and there is momentum in many parts of the business. 
Based on our views of the global operating environment and assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings per share to range between $0.95 and $1.08. We appreciate your interest in our company. I look forward to seeing many of you at our shareholders meeting in a couple of weeks."

With this year being a leap year, today's results, including international comparable sales data, reflect the extra day in our first quarter. Leap year does not affect the 4-5-4 comp sales reporting for the U.S. businesses. As a reminder, for fiscal year 2017, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar.

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our first quarter results and an update on our overall strategy. We're off to a good start to the fiscal year. For the first quarter, EPS was $0.98, which is above",1103,"Thanks, Pauline, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our first quarter results and an update on our overall strategy. 
We're off to a good start to the fiscal year. For the first quarter, EPS was $0.98, which is above the top end of our guidance. Excluding a $3.5 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $119.4 billion, which is growth of $4.6 billion or 4% over last year. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.9% to $115.9 billion. We exceeded both our EPS and Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance. 
As we described in October, we're improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening relationships with customers. We're encouraged by the Walmart U.S. comp and believe it's attributable to real improvement in our store experience. Our customers are giving us positive feedback. And I'm seeing it myself on store visits, and you can see it in the traffic numbers. 
We delivered comp sales of 1% in Walmart U.S. due to continuing traffic increases, which improved 1.5% this quarter. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and our sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. 
It's exciting to see the improvement in core retail fundamentals. For example, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making on inventory. That progress is important in its own right and for cash flow purposes, but it can also help create a virtuous loop. When combined with our investments in training and associate education, wages and store structure, it's giving our associates more time on the sales floor to serve customers. Our customer satisfaction scores have continued to strengthen, and our in-stock has gotten better. Our associates are responding, and I'm proud of them, Greg Foran and the entire U.S. leadership team. 
In the quarter, we did a better job of managing costs. SG&A discipline improved as our store teams did a good job of more closely aligning expenses with sales growth. Better expense management in the quarter gave us increased confidence to initiate our next phase of U.S. price investment earlier than planned. Over time, we intend to lower prices further in a deliberate, strategic way to drive our productivity loop. Doing this in a sustainable way takes time, and we're seeing progress. 
Globally, on a constant-currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV grew 7% and 7.5%, respectively. Growth here is too slow. The U.S. number is better than the global number but neither is as high as we'd like. We can see progress against several of the necessary capabilities we need to win in e-commerce, but we're still working on a few others. We need them all to come together to see stronger growth. 
For example, our marketplace is ramping up, but it takes time to build the assortment to the point where customers realize the depth of assortment. We now offer more than 10 million SKUs on walmart.com, and we're growing that number through a combination of first-party and third-party items. It makes sense that perception will trail reality, and we'll work on both during the course of this year. We'll build on the successes we've seen around the world, including in the U.S., and we'll continue to work through the challenges we've experienced in key markets like Brazil, China and the U.K., where our e-commerce and mobile commerce sales are softer. 
We're pleased with our e-commerce operating system and happy to have our new e-commerce fulfillment centers operational. Those are necessary building blocks. I'm excited about the ways we're using technology to deepen our relationship with customers and help them save both money and time. Our grocery pickup service in the U.S. continues to receive high marks from customers, and we're continuing to expand it. 
I'm pleased to share we're announcing 9 new markets today, bringing our total number of markets to nearly 40 by the end of this month. In addition, in some markets, we'll double the number of stores that offer the service locally in May. We expect to continue to quickly expand to new markets. 
The Walmart app is also allowing us to serve customers in convenient ways, whether it's by finding an item in store, researching a product or refilling a prescription. Walmart Pay is enhancing our ability to provide a seamless shopping experience as customers quickly pay with their phone. A few weeks ago, we began to expand this service nationwide, and we're on schedule to complete the rollout by the end of June. 
Walmart International had a strong start to the year, with 10 of our 11 markets posting positive comp sales and 9 of those markets growing comp sales by more than 4% on a constant-currency basis. In particular, Walmex and Canada continued to perform well, with strong sales, market share gains and solid profit performance. 
China remains a strategic market for our future and is now our fourth largest international market from a sales standpoint. We recently held a Board of Directors meeting in China. And while visiting stores and e-commerce operations, I continue to be encouraged by the pace of operational improvements made by our team in China. 
A highly competitive environment and food deflation in the U.K. continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends in our business. We're focused on making strategic investments to improve our position in the market and invest in price while being diligent in managing our bottom line and cash flow. 
At Sam's Club, we're pleased with the growth in membership income. Plus Member penetration is near an all-time high, and we like the trend we're seeing. It's clear that members recognize the value that a Plus membership brings. Comp sales for the period were in line with our guidance, but we know we can deliver stronger results. Leading in digital is a focus area for Sam's, and the team is doing a good job of delivering for members as we continue to see strong growth in Club Pickup. 
Finally, we look forward to welcoming many of our shareholders, investors and associates to northwest Arkansas in a few weeks for our Annual Meeting. This is one of my favorite weeks of the year as we get a chance to connect with you and share more of our thinking about the business. We also bring in associates from around the world. It's inspiring to see them and hear their stores. We hope you'll join us for a great meeting. In summary, we're continuing to do what we said we'd do on our strategic plan, and we're getting traction as a result. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brett."

As Pauline mentioned, our earnings materials are a little different this quarter. Our intent is to continue to provide you with a high level of transparency and information but in a more efficient and concise manner. For example, we've added specific comments and highlights on the performance of each of our operating segments within the financial presentation instead of being spread out among several parts of a lengthy transcript. Therefore, it's important that you review the financial presentation in conjunction with the comments from Doug and me. We hope you find this new format more efficient, and we look forward to any feedback you may have. 
With that, let's turn our attention to the results for the quarter. I would like to start by taking a minute to thank all of our associates around the world. Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to visit with associates in our U.S. stores as well as in China, Japan and Brazil, and I was encouraged by the level of dedication they continue to demonstrate. As a company, we're executing against our strategic priorities and not only delivering short- to midterm improvements but positioning Walmart for long-term success. 
We still have work to do. However, we are pleased that our first quarter results demonstrate continued progress. First quarter EPS of $0.98 was above our guidance range. During the quarter, we saw benefit from lower utility and maintenance expenses due to a milder winter in the U.S. and slightly lower cost from store closures announced last quarter. 
From a revenue standpoint, excluding the $3.5 billion currency impact, total revenue increased $4.6 billion or 4% to $119.4 billion. On a reported basis, our total revenue increased 0.9% to $115.9 billion. Walmart U.S. delivered comp sales of 1% due to continuing solid traffic, which increased 1.5%. This was our seventh straight quarter of positive comp sales and our sixth straight quarter of positive comp traffic. 
Globally, e-commerce sales increased 7%, and GMV grew by 7.5% in the first quarter on a constant-currency basis, which is not as strong as we wanted. We are pleased with the ways we're using technology to deepen our relationships with customers and helping them save both money and time. For example, our grocery pickup service in the U.S. will be in nearly 40 markets by the end of this month, which is up from 22 when we started the year. Advances we have made in fulfillment capabilities, including our most recent center in southern California, mean customers can get the items they want fast and at Walmart prices. Although we are making progress on several of our key priorities, we have more work to do, particularly in some of our largest international markets. 
Gross profit increased 60 basis points during the quarter, primarily driven by gross margin improvements in the U.S., which I will discuss in more detail shortly. During the quarter, we were more disciplined from an expense standpoint. However, as anticipated, total SG&A increased compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily as a result of our previously announced wage rate increase, which took effect in February. 
As you review our financial statements, you will notice a reduction in interest expense as well as an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. As a reminder, the primary reason for the year-on-year variances is related to the sale-leaseback accounting correction we made in Canada during the first quarter of last year, which impacted these line items and had a de minimis overall impact on operating income and EPS. 
Along with solid operating performance, disciplined working capital management allowed us to generate approximately $4 billion of free cash flow, which compares to $2.2 billion generated in the first quarter of last year. We also returned $4.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends. During the quarter, we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2.7 billion. 
With that, let's now turn our attention to the results for each of the operating segments. Walmart U.S. had a good first quarter, with comp sales ahead of guidance, driven by solid traffic growth. We continued to steadily execute against the plan we laid out a year ago, and we're seeing positive results from these efforts. Our customers continue to tell us they are happy with the changes we're making in our stores, as evidenced by our customer experience scores which rose again this quarter versus last year. 
Comparable sales were up 1% in the first quarter despite continued impacts from deflation in food, which we estimate impacted our total comp by approximately 60 basis points relative to last year's first quarter comp. Customer traffic increased 1.5%. E-commerce contributed approximately 20 basis points to the overall comp. In addition, our Neighborhood Market format also delivered a comp sales increase of approximately 7%. We have good momentum in the business as, on a 2-year stack basis, comp sales for Walmart U.S. were up 2.1%. 
We saw strength in general merchandise, driven by solid sales growth in hardlines, home and seasonal and apparel. While entertainment continues to be a sales headwind, we did see some improving trends in electronics. Branded drug inflation and script growth drove pharmacy sales while better in-stock levels and a focus on the right assortment drove sales growth in both consumables and OTC. 
Gross margin improved 44 basis points in the quarter. We delivered improved margin rates in food, consumables and health and wellness as our continued focus on reducing costs, both in how we operate the business and in procuring merchandise, provided benefits. In addition, transportation costs benefited from lower fuel prices. We had some improvements in shrink, and we also lapped last year's incremental expenses related to the West Coast port congestion. 
Operating expenses increased 11.5% over last year primarily due to previously announced wage rate increases. However, our store teams were more efficient in managing expenses to more closely align with sales growth, and a milder winter drove lower utility and maintenance expenses. Overall, the SG&A increase was partially offset by improved gross margins, which resulted in an operating income decline of 8.8%. 
Inventory continues to be a key focus area for Walmart U.S., and we're pleased with the progress we're making toward our goal of stronger working capital management. 
Inventory declined 3.5% in the first quarter, including a 5.7% decline in comp stores. The inventory discipline is driving benefits across the store, such as improved in-stock levels and more efficient processes for our associates. 
Finally, as we communicated in October, price investment is always an important part of our growth plan. We began the initial phase of additional price investment late in the first quarter, lowering prices on key items in select geographies. As always, we're committed to providing quality merchandise at a great value, using data and analytics to better serve our customers. 
Heading into the second quarter, the execution of Walmart U.S.' strategic plan remains on course. For the 13-week period ending July 29, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%. As a reminder, the comp sales increase for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 1.5%. 
Now let's turn to Walmart International. Walmart International had a strong start to the year despite some continuing challenges in certain markets. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of our e-commerce performance. 
Comp sales remained strong with all markets other than the U.K. posting positive comp sales. Also worth mentioning, 9 of our markets grew comp sales by more than 4% on a constant-currency basis. This year, Easter benefited the first quarter some in international as the holiday last year fell within the second quarter, given the 1-month reporting lag in all markets except Canada. Overall, net sales grew 4.3% on a constant-currency basis. Reported net sales declined 7.2% due to the $3.5 billion currency headwind, although the impact was slightly less than anticipated. 
From an expense and cost of goods perspective, we're pleased with the continued progress we're making on our cost analytics program, which includes fact-based negotiations and new merchant tools. We're now expanding the program beyond the U.K. and Canada to include Mexico in Q2 and other markets in Q3 and Q4. We're also focused on We Operate For Less initiatives across our markets, and we're pleased that we leveraged expenses in the majority of our markets. 
From a profitability standpoint, operating income increased 22% on a constant-currency basis and increased 8.8% on a reported basis, driven by solid sales and broad gross profit rate improvement. On a constant-currency basis, inventory grew slower than net sales at 2.2% due to a focus on reducing unproductive and obsolete merchandise while, on a reported basis, inventory declined 6.9%. 
Within the accompanying financial presentation, you will find detailed information for our 5 major markets. However, I will give some highlights on these markets, starting with 2 which are performing exceptionally well. Walmex continues to lead the way, delivering strong results. As a reminder, Walmex releases results under IFRS, and the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some numbers may differ. 
Sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions and countries, led by strong results in food and consumables. Total sales and comp sales performance significantly outpaced the rest of the self-service market. Comp sales for Walmex increased 8.6% in the quarter. From a profitability standpoint, higher gross margins driven by strong inventory management, reduced clearance and good expense managements led to strong growth in operating income. 
In Canada, comp sales increased 6.7%, driven by strong traffic growth of 4.6%. Comp sales have now been positive for 8 consecutive quarters. Their performance was driven by improvements in our merchandise assortment and price investment, which led to strong customer traffic growth. Our e-commerce business also continued to grow nicely with the expansion of online grocery in the greater Toronto area. Even as the e-commerce investments continued, our ability to leverage expenses led to growth in operating income that outpaced sales growth. 
The U.K. continues to struggle due primarily to fierce competition. Improvements in price and product availability throughout the quarter were not enough to overcome traffic and food volume declines in our large-format stores. However, Project Renewal remains a focus with the aim to simplify and strengthen the customer offer, reduce cost and drive sales. The cost analytics program, which is part of Project Renewal, made good progress and delivered savings we were able to invest back into the business. 
Our China business continues to grow and is now our fourth largest international market by revenue. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, a strong performance during Chinese New Year, double-digit growth in gift card loading and continued strengthening in fresh categories led to good sales growth and positive comps. 
In Brazil, despite ongoing economic challenges, our team is making the right decisions to better position the business for both short- and long-term success. We are pleased with the positive comp sales performance in the quarter. Overall, our international strategy remains simple and focused, and we continue to execute against our key priorities around the world. 
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, net sales without fuel grew by 2.9%. Membership income increased by nearly 4% as Plus Member renewables grew by more than 30% and Plus penetration was near an all-time high. 
Comp sales excluding fuel increased 0.1% in the period as deflation, especially in fresh meat and dairy, continued to be a headwind and negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 50 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. E-commerce performed well and contributed 60 basis points to the comp, including sales through Club Pickup, which grew by more than 30%. In addition, our direct-to-home business experienced impressive growth. 
Gross profit rate increased 18 basis points even as we made investments in price and in the cash rewards program. As planned, investments in people and technology led to growth in operating expenses that outpaced our sales growth. 
The team at Sam's is in the early stages of executing against the strategy that was outlined at the end of last year. We know we have work to do, and we're on the right path. For the 13-week period ending July 29, 2016, we expect comps sales to be slightly positive. 
So let's wrap things up. This is an exciting time for the company, and our financial strength positions us to make the necessary investments in the business to drive sustainable long-term results. We are proud of our overall results in the first quarter, and there is momentum in many parts of the business. 
Based on our views of the global operating environment and assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings per share to range between $0.95 and $1.08. We appreciate your interest in our company. I look forward to seeing many of you at our shareholders meeting in a couple of weeks."

We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.07. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $123.6 billion, an increase of 2.8% over last year.
We exceeded our Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance this quarter, with Walmart U.S. delivering comp sales of 1.6%, driven by traffic increase of 1.2%.
This was our eighth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and our seventh consecutive quarter of positive traffic. I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing when I visit stores and pleased with how Greg Foran, our leadership team, and our associates are executing our plan to win. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. And the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. Comp store inventory was down 6.5% and in-stock levels are up.
We are also showing progress in e-commerce. On a constant currency basis, GMV and e-commerce sales increased 13% and 11.8%, respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets. This was primarily due to growth in our marketplace offering in the U.S., the continued rollout of our grocery and growth of pickup in our stores and clubs. We continue to see proof that our customers enjoy a seamless shopping experience. The distinction that we talked about today between stores, apps, pickup, delivery and sites are continuing to blur into the background for customers. For them, it's just Walmart.
We built a solid foundation in e-commerce under the leadership of Neil Ashe. During Neil's tenure, reward and doubled our e-commerce GMV, became the second-most trafficked e-commerce site in the U.S. replatformed walmart.com national fulfill the center and most importantly, became known as a great place to work for talented technologists and e-commerce professionals in Silicon Valley. Neil also lead our discussions with JD. Neil will be with Walmart through the end of our fiscal year, working and our e-commerce strategies in several international markets. I'd like to thank him for his significant contributions to our company.
Building on this solid foundation, we made some strategic decisions to position ourselves for the future in the priority markets of the U.S. and China, including the announcement last week to acquire Jet.com.
Operating walmart.com and Jet.com will allow us to reach even more customers and drive a higher level of growth more quickly. One of the things we like about the technology they've developed is that it rewards customers in real-time with savings on a basket of goods and puts them more in charge of the price they pay.
This empowers customers in a way that is true to the spirit of Walmart. When customers build a basket of goods online rather than ordering one item at a time, shipping economics are in their favor and ours. Walmart's advantage has always been and providing the lowest prices on a basket, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest cost basket online.
It's important to remember that customers won't see changes immediately as we await government approval and the necessary tech platform changes, which will take time.
Once the acquisition is complete, we look forward to welcoming Marc Lori, current President of Jet.com. He will join Walmart is our new President and CEO of e-commerce, reporting to me. He'll be responsible for both the Walmart and Jet brands in the U.S. Marc is a passionate March and an innovative thinker who will definitely add value to our business. I look forward to working with him.
In China, our recent announced transaction with an investment in JD.com improves our position there. JD's significant presence online where Walmart and Sam's Club will feature prominently affords us the opportunity to extend the reach of our brands to millions of new customers.
I made a couple of visits to JD's delivery and pickup points and Shanghai when I was last in China and I'm excited about the potential that it creates for our customers dare. Richard Blum, CEO of JD.com, is a talented e-commerce merchant and would look forward to our collaborations going forward.
Additionally, we made advancements in the U.S. on our key priorities to build digital relationships with customers, scale the assortment and expand online grocery. As of June, we've rolled out Walmart Pay nationwide to all stores. Customers tell us they love the convenience of this unique service and we found that the majority of transactions has come from repeat users. If you haven't tried Walmart Pay, please do and share your feedback.
Customers also continue to enjoy our online grocery pickup service and give it high marks. We added grocery pickup to 30 more markets this quarter bringing our total to more than 60 markets and nearly 400 locations.
It's gratifying to see how much this service helps our customers save time. Next, we're growing our marketplace offering at a strong pace. Since the beginning of the year, we've added about $7 million new items to the assortment. And today, offer approximately 15 million SKUs.
Walmart international delivered another solid performance in the second quarter. Nine of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 6 of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continue to lead the way, and I'm pleased with the fact that the momentum in the business is broad-based across all formats and countries.
In China, in addition to expanding our reach through the strategic alliance with JD.com, we continue to grow our base of stores and clubs. In fact, we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel. China remained the strategic focus for us as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally.
In the U.K., the competitive environment and food deflation continued to challenge the market significantly impacting traffic and comp sales. Our strategy to turn things around is focused on improving the retail basics. We are simplifying and strengthening our offering through improved availability and assortment disciplined, reducing costs and driving sales through strategic price investments.
While our turnaround will take time, I'm confident in the new leadership team there and want to assure you, we're addressing this with urgency.
At Sam's Club, comp sales for the period were slightly above our expectations. Membership performance was the highlight, and there is quite a bit of innovation underway at Sam's related to the member experience. Earlier this year, we launched a test of Scan and Go, a mobile checkout and payment solution, which lets member skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of this service, and we expect to roll this out nationwide later this year.
We also saw strong growth in the quarter from both club pickup and direct to home e-commerce. The new platform we are using the prospect for new members and better manage their accounts will help us deliver on our priority of growing membership. These innovations are making it easy for members to shop and save time.
Finally, I've enjoyed my time this week with more than 5,000 store leaders and merchants with the U.S. team at our annual holiday meeting in Denver. We've got a great plan for the busiest time of the year and the mood of the meeting was deservedly upbeat. As I do think our store managers and all of our associates for the job they're doing.
In summary, I'm pleased with the momentum of the business. We have a plan, and we're executing against it, and customers are responding favorably.
Now I'll turn it over to Brett."

We're halfway through the year, and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we're seeing across many parts of the business. We are executing against our strategic birdies, focusing on the customer and improving core retail fundamentals around the world. In addition to delivering solid second quarter results, which I'll talk about in a minute, we continue to make decisions that focused the business for long-term success. Just in the past few weeks, we furthered our strategy in e-commerce through the alliance with JD.com and the planned acquisition of Jet.com.
In addition, we've agreed to the vest our suburbia apparel business in Mexico, allowing for additional focus and our core business in that market. Each of these decisions aligns with our strategy and demonstrates our commitment to thoughtfully allocating capital against our long-term strategy.
Now let's get to the results. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.07, which was at the high-end of our guidance range, while reported EPS was $1.21. Adjusted EPS excludes the noncash gain of $0.14, net of tax, from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com.
We anticipate the gain for the full year will be $0.16 per share, which is within the original guidance range when we announced the transaction. From a revenue perspective, we had another solid quarter. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, total revenue increased 2.8% to $123.6 billion, while on a reported basis, total revenue was $120.9 billion.
On a constant currency basis, we had a net sales of $2.8 billion in the quarter and $7.2 billion in the first 6 months of the fiscal year.
Walmart U.S. delivered a very solid comp sales increase of 1.6%, driven by a 1.2% increase in traffic. It's now been 2 full years that Walmart U.S. has delivered positive comp sales. In fact, on a 2-year stack basis, comp sales increased 3.1%. As Doug mentioned earlier, we made progress in e-commerce with GMV and sales, for a 30% and 11.8%, respectively. The U.S. were stronger than the international results and globally, we continue to make headway on expanding our assortment and enhancing the shopping experience for our customers.
Whether it's through online grocery, Walmart Pay or broadening our reach in China through the alliance of JD.com, we are making it easier for customers to access products when and how they want.
Now with the agreement acquired Jet.com, we're building on our e-commerce foundation and creating an opportunity to accelerate e-commerce even further.
Consolidated gross profit margin increased 53 basis points, driven by improvements in all 3 operating segments. From an expense standpoint, as anticipated, total SG&A increased compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to our previously announced investments in people and technology for this fiscal year.
That being said, our teams across the globe remained focused on managing expenses. In addition to solid operating results, disciplined working capital management and the timing of payments allowed us to generate $10.3 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year, which compares to $5.1 billion in the first half of last year.
Continuing to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases is a priority for us, and we're fortunate to have such a strong business model that generate substantial distributable cash even after we've invested thoughtfully into the business.
During the quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased 30.3 million shares for approximately $2.1 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, we have utilized approximately $7.3 billion of our current $20 billion share repurchase authorization.
With that, let's discuss the results of each of our operating segments, starting with Walmart U.S. We continue to see steady improvement in the Walmart U.S. business as customers respond favorably to the changes we are making in our stores and e-commerce offer. Net sales were up 3.1% or $2.3 billion, and comp sales rose 1.6%, with a 1.2% increase in customer traffic.
We believe the contributing factor to the result is our consistent improvement in customer experience. Customer surveys indicated we are making good progress and providing a better shopping experience with cleaner stores, faster checkout and friendlier service. We've also broadened our e-commerce assortment, strengthen our mobile capabilities and expanded online grocery to more than 60 markets in nearly 400 locations. While there are still a lot of work to do in executing our multiyear plan, we are encouraged by the results we are seeing.
E-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment comp, and all of our formats have positive comp sales, including neighborhood markets, which delivered approximately a 6.5% comp sales growth in the period. Although difficult to quantify, we know overall sales include some tailwinds from external factors such as continued low gas prices and unseasonably warm weather across much of the country. however, we also experienced sales headwinds from continued market deflation in food, which negatively impacted our food comp by around 100 basis points and our second quarter total segment comp by similar amount as what we face in the first quarter. The grocery business showed improvement during the first what it would positive comp sales in traffic despite the ongoing deflationary impacts in food. In addition, both general merchandise and health and wellness delivered solid sales growth with strengthen home, toys, sporting goods and OTC.
The back-to-school shopping season is in full swing, and we aim to be the destination of choice with low prices on a great assortment of products, for parents and students preparing for the new school year.
In the second quarter, we continue to implement a multiyear strategy of incremental price investment in the U.S. business. It's still early days for this initiative, but we are pleased with the initial results. We are committed to providing everyday low prices, using data and analytics to better serve our customers both through stores and e-commerce.
Gross margin increased 33 basis points in the quarter. The improved margin rates in food and consumables were a contributing factor. In addition, with improvement in our cost of goods due to savings in procuring merchandise, lower transportation expense as a result of lower fuel costs and some improvements in shrink. These benefits are somewhat offset by the implementation of the multiyear strategy of incremental price investments.
Operating expenses increased 8.3% over last year due primarily to the previously announced associate wage rate increases and investments in technology.
We remain focused on managing expenses with an mindset while elevating the shopping environment for customers.
Overall, the SG&A increase was partially offset by improved gross margins, resulting in an operating income decline of 6.2%. We are also encouraged by the progress on inventory management, with inventory declining about 2.9% in the second quarter versus last year, including a 6.5% decline in comp stores. By cleaning up our store backrooms, leveraging technology and changing certain processes, we're improving product availability and enabling associates to be at the sales floor serving customers in more effective way.
Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect the comp sales increase in the range of 1% to 1.5%. As a reminder, comp sales for last year's comparable period were 1.5%.
Now let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International delivered another solid performance in the second quarter. Nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 6 of those markets of grew comp sales by more than 4%. The rate of sales growth in several markets slowed versus our first quarter results, impacted by a leap day in the first quarter and the Easter holiday shift to the first and second quarters in most markets due to the 1 month reporting lag. Walmex continues to produce strong results across all formats, while the U.K. environment remains challenging.
The international team remains focused and continues to execute on key strategic priorities. To actively manage the existing portfolio; deliver balanced growth; be the lowest cost operator; and build strong foundations in talent, trust and technology. We continue to be aggressive in managing the portfolio, announcing last week, the agreement to sell our Suburbia Apparel business in Mexico. In addition, our recently announced strategic alliance with JD.com in China aligns with our growth strategy in this key market by better integrating our digital and physical retail operations. We also continue to execute aggressive cost reduction programs in the U.K. and Canada and are expanding cost analytics programs into other markets like Mexico and China.
We also announced market CEO moves this quarter in China, the U.K. and Canada. We are confident these moves position us well for driving improved performance in each of these markets and demonstrate the depth of our talent globally.
With that, let's discuss international's overall results.
Net sales grew 2.2% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 6.6% due to a $2.7 billion currency headwind.
From a profitability standpoint, operating income increased 47.5% on a constant currency basis and 35.2% on a reported basis. This increase includes the gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. Excluding the impact from this gain, operating income increased 3.1% on a constant currency basis, which slightly outpaced sales growth. On a reported basis, excluding the gain, operating income decreased 6.7%.
The accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets, however, I'd like to provide some highlights on each one. As a reminder, in all countries, except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of our e-commerce performance.
Walmex continues to lead the way, delivering strong results. Keep in mind, Walmex releases results under IFRS, and the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some numbers may differ. The positive momentum in the business continues to across all formats, divisions and countries. Comp sales for Walmex increased 7.3% in the quarter, significantly outpacing the rest of the self-service market. Excluding the gain from the sale of our bank operations in Mexico last year, operating income would have increased faster than sales.
In Canada, despite increased promotional activity by competitors throughout the quarter, comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for 9 consecutive quarters, and according to Nielsen, we continue to gain market share in food and consumables and health and wellness. Our cost analytics program made good progress helping drive down cost of goods, allowing us to invest in price.
Excluding the gain from the sale of certain properties in Canada last year, operating income increased faster than sales. Additionally, we continue to decrease inventory levels and improve efficiency from the store and labor perspective.
In the U.K., appears competition and food deflation continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends. During the quarter, comp sales, excluding fuel, decreased 7.5%. Our strategy remains focused on improving retail basics, simplifying and strengthening the offer to improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs through our cost analytics program and driving sales through strategic price investments where we remain committed to the previously announced 5-year GBP 1.5 billion price investment.
In China, despite negative comp sales of 0.5% this quarter, our business continues to grow with an expanded footprint throughout the country, and we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel. We operate for less initiatives have delivered results and we were able to lever expenses.
Our recently announced alliance with JD.com us better serve consumers are a powerful combination of e-commerce and retail. JD.com, the leading online direct sales company and the country's largest Internet business by revenue, has a complementary offering, allowing us to deliver compelling new experiences that can reach significantly more customers. We are optimistic about our future in China.
In Brazil, despite the ongoing economic recession, we delivered comp sales growth of 4.7%. Our wholesale format continues to perform well and delivered strong growth again this quarter. In addition, we completed our store systems integration, which allows all banners to operate under single financial system. This will provide better visibility to business outcomes, improved alignment of marketing efforts and further enhance our compliance programs. Overall, we're pleased with another solid performance from our international business in the quarter.
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. Net sales without fuel grew by 0.4%. Membership income increased 2.9% as plus member counts increased and plus member penetration is near all-time highs. Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.6%, which is slightly above our guidance. Market deflation, especially in food, continued to be a headwind and negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 100 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. We are pleased with how e-commerce performed as both direct to home and Club Pickup had strong growth.
Sam's also continues to make progress on being a leader in the digital space. Our members tell us they really appreciate the convenience that innovations like Scan and Go bring to their lives. This new checkout and payment solution lets members complete the shopping experience using their own mobile device.
Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect comp sales without fuel to be slightly positive. As a reminder, comp sales for last year's comparable period increased 0.4%.
With that, let's wrap things up.
There's always more work to do, but we're pleased with the first half performance. These results combined with our outlook for the balance of the year, give us of dividends in raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.35, which includes a range of $0.90 to $1 in the third quarter. This compares to previous guidance of $4 to the $4.30 for the full year.
As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14 net of tax noncash gain from the sale of Yihaodian and China to JD.com. In addition, this guidance includes an estimated diluted EPS impact of approximately $0.05, primarily in the fourth quarter, as a result of expected operating losses and onetime transaction expenses related to the planned acquisition of Jet.com, assuming the transaction is closed near the beginning of the fourth quarter of FY '17.
Keep in mind that this updated guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels and that our full year effective tax rate is expected to be the low end of our previously stated range of 31.5% to 33.5%.
In closing, we continue to be pleased with momentum we are seeing across many parts of the business. We are executing against our strategic priorities and continue to focus on the customer.
It's an exciting time at Walmart and we are proud of the progress we're making. Thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to seeing many of you here in Arkansas, at our Annual Meeting for the investment community on October 5th and 6th."

We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.07. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $123.6 billion, an increase of 2.8% over last year.  We exceeded our Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance this quarter, with Walmart U.S. delivering comp sales of 1.6%, driven by traffic increase of 1.2%.  This was our eighth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and our seventh consecutive quarter of positive traffic. 
I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing when I visit stores and pleased with how Greg Foran, our leadership team and our associates are executing our plan to win. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. And the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. Comp store inventory was down 6.5% and in-stock levels are up.
We are also showing progress in e-commerce. On a constant currency basis, GMV and e-commerce sales increased 13% and 11.8%, respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets. This was primarily due to growth in our marketplace offering in the U.S., the continued rollout of online grocery and growth of pickup in our stores and clubs. We continue to see proof that our customers enjoy a seamless shopping experience. The distinctions that we talk about today between stores, apps, pickup, delivery and sites are continuing to blur into the background for customers. For them, it's just Walmart.
We built a solid foundation in e-commerce under the leadership of Neil Ashe. During Neil's tenure, we more than doubled our e-commerce GMV, became the second most trafficked e-commerce site in the U.S.; replatformed walmart.com; opened a national fulfillment center network; and most importantly, became known as a great place to work for talented technologists and e-commerce professionals in Silicon Valley. Neil also led our discussions with JD. Neil will be with Walmart through the end of our fiscal year, working on our e-commerce strategies in several international markets. I'd like to thank him for his significant contributions to our company.
Building on this solid foundation, we made some strategic decisions to position ourselves for the future in the priority markets of the U.S. and China, including the announcement last week to acquire Jet.com. Operating Walmart.com and Jet.com will allow us to reach even more customers and drive the higher level of growth more quickly. One of the things we like about the technology they've developed is that it rewards customers in real time with savings on a basket of goods and puts them more in charge of the price they pay. This empowers customers in a way that is true to the spirit of Walmart. When customers build a basket of goods online rather than ordering one item at a time, shipping economics are in their favor and ours. Walmart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest cost basket online.
It's important to remember that customers won't see changes immediately as we await government approval and the necessary tech platform changes, which will take time.
Once the acquisition is complete, we look forward to welcoming Marc Lore, current President and CEO of Jet.com. He will join Walmart as our new President and CEO of E-commerce, reporting to me. He'll be responsible for both the Walmart and Jet brands in the U.S. Marc is a passionate merchant and innovative thinker, who will definitely add value to our business. I look forward to working with him.
In China, our recent announced transaction with an investment in JD.com improves our position there. JD's significant presence online, where Walmart and Sam's Club will feature prominently, affords us the opportunity to extend the reach of our brands to millions of new customers. I made a couple of visits to JD's delivery and pickup points in Shanghai when I was last in China. And I'm excited about the potential it creates for our customers there. 
Richard Liu, CEO of JD.com, is a talented e-commerce merchant, and we look forward to our collaborations going forward.
Additionally, we made advancements in the U.S. on our key priorities to build digital relationships with customers, scale the assortment and expand online grocery. As of June, we've rolled out Walmart Pay nationwide to all stores. Customers tell us they love the convenience of this unique service. And we found that a majority of transactions come from repeat users. If you haven't tried Walmart Pay, please do and share your feedback.
Customers also continue to enjoy our online grocery pickup service and give it high marks. We added grocery pickup to 30 more markets this quarter bringing our total to more than 60 markets and nearly 400 locations. It's gratifying to see how much this service helps our customers save time. 
Next, we're growing our marketplace offering at a strong pace. Since the beginning of the year, we've added about $7 million new items to the assortment; and today, offer approximately 15 million SKUs.
Walmart International delivered another solid performance in the second quarter. 9 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales, and 6 of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continue to lead the way, and I'm pleased with the fact that the momentum in the business is broad-based across all formats and countries.
In China, in addition to expanding our reach through the strategic alliance with JD.com, we continue to grow our base of stores and clubs. In fact, we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel. China remained the strategic focus for us as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally.
In the U.K., the competitive environment and food deflation continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales. Our strategy to turn things around is focused on improving the retail basics. We are simplifying and strengthening our offering through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs and driving sales through strategic price investments. While our turnaround will take time, I'm confident in the new leadership team there and want to assure you we're addressing this with urgency.
At Sam's Club, comp sales for the period were slightly above our expectations. Membership performance was the highlight. And there is quite a bit of innovation underway at Sam's related to the member experience. Earlier this year, we launched a test of Scan & Go, a mobile checkout and payment solution, which lets members skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of this service, and we expect to roll this out nationwide later this year.
We also saw strong growth in the quarter from both Club Pickup and direct to home e-commerce. The new platform we are using to prospect for new members and better manage their accounts will help us deliver on our priority of growing membership. These innovations are making it easy for members to shop and save time.
Finally, I've enjoyed my time this week with more than 5,000 store leaders and merchants with the U.S. team at our annual holiday meeting in Denver. We've got a great plan for the busiest time of the year, and the mood at the meeting was deservedly upbeat. I'd like to thank our store managers and all of our associates for the job they're doing.
In summary, I'm pleased with the momentum in the business. We have a plan, and we're executing against it, and customers are responding favorably.
Now I'll turn it over to Brett."

We're halfway through the year, and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we're seeing across many parts of the business. We're executing against our strategic priorities, focusing on the customer and improving core retail fundamentals around the world. 
In addition to delivering solid second quarter results, which I'll talk about in a minute, we continue to make decisions that focused the business for long-term success. Just in the past few weeks, we furthered our strategy in e-commerce through the alliance of JD.com and the planned acquisition of Jet.com.
In addition, we've agreed to divest our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico, allowing for additional focus on our core business in that market. Each of these decisions aligns with our strategy and demonstrates our commitment to thoughtfully allocating capital against our long-term strategy.
Now let's get to the results. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.07, which was at the high end of our guidance range, while reported EPS was $1.21. Adjusted EPS excludes the noncash gain of $0.14, net of tax, from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. We anticipate the gain for the full year will be $0.16 per share, which is within the original guidance range when we announced the transaction. 
From a revenue perspective, we had another solid quarter. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, total revenue increased 2.8% to $123.6 billion. While on a reported basis, total revenue was $120.9 billion. On a constant-currency basis, we had a net sales of $2.8 billion in the quarter and $7.2 billion in the first 6 months of the fiscal year.
Walmart U.S. delivered a very solid comp sales increase of 1.6%, driven by a 1.2% increase in traffic. It's now been 2 full years that Walmart U.S. has delivered positive comp sales. In fact, on a 2-year stack basis, comp sales increased 3.1%. As Doug mentioned earlier, we made progress in e-commerce with GMV and sales, growing 13% and 11.8%, respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than the international results. And globally, we continue to make headway on expanding our assortment and enhancing the shopping experience for our customers. Whether it's through online grocery, Walmart Pay or broadening our reach in China through the alliance of JD.com, we're making it easier for customers to access products when and how they want.
Now with the agreement to acquire Jet.com, we're building on our e-commerce foundation and creating an opportunity to accelerate e-commerce even further.
Consolidated gross profit margin increased 53 basis points, driven by improvements in all 3 operating segments. From an expense standpoint, as anticipated, total SG&A increased compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to our previously announced investments in people and technology for this fiscal year. That being said, our teams across the globe remain focused on managing expenses. 
In addition to solid operating results, disciplined working capital management and the timing of payments allowed us to generate $10.3 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year, which compares to $5.1 billion in the first half of last year. 
Continuing to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases is a priority for us. And we're fortunate to have such a strong business model that generate substantial distributable cash even after we've invested thoughtfully into the business. 
During the quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased 30.3 million shares for approximately $2.1 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, we have utilized approximately $7.3 billion of our current $20 billion share repurchase authorization.
With that, let's discuss the results of each of our operating segments, starting with Walmart U.S. We continue to see steady improvement in the Walmart U.S. business as customers respond favorably to the changes we're making in our stores and e-commerce offer. Net sales were up 3.1% or $2.3 billion. And comp sales rose 1.6% with a 1.2% increase in customer traffic. We believe the contributing factor to the result is our consistent improvement in customer experience. Customer surveys indicate that we're making good progress and providing a better shopping experience with cleaner stores, faster checkout and friendlier service. We've also broadened our e-commerce assortment, strengthened our mobile capabilities and expanded online grocery to more than 60 markets in nearly 400 locations. While there is still a lot of work to do in executing our multiyear plan, we're encouraged by the results we're seeing.
e-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment comp, and all of our formats had positive comp sales, including neighborhood markets, which delivered approximately a 6.5% comp sales growth in the period. Although difficult to quantify, we know overall sales included some tailwinds from external factors, such as continued low gas prices and unseasonably warm weather across much of the country. However, we also experienced sales headwinds from continued market deflation in food, which negatively impacted our food comp by around 100 basis points and our second quarter total segment comp by a similar amount as what we faced in the first quarter. 
The grocery business showed improvement from the first quarter with positive comp sales in traffic despite the ongoing deflationary impacts in food. In addition, both general merchandise and health and wellness delivered solid sales growth with strength in home, toys, sporting goods and OTC.  The back-to-school shopping season is in full swing. And we aim to be the destination of choice with low prices on a great assortment of products, for parents and students preparing for the new school year.
In the second quarter, we continue to implement a multiyear strategy of incremental price investment in the U.S. business. It's still early days for this initiative, but we are pleased with the initial results. We're committed to providing everyday low prices, using data and analytics to better serve our customers both through stores and e-commerce.
Gross margin increased 33 basis points in the quarter. Improved margin rates in food and consumables were a contributing factor. In addition, we had improvement in our cost of goods due to savings in procuring merchandise, lower transportation expense as a result of lower fuel costs and some improvements in shrink. These benefits are somewhat offset by the implementation of the multiyear strategy of incremental price investments.
Operating expenses increased 8.3% over last year due primarily to the previously announced associate wage rate increases and investments in technology.  We remain focused on managing expenses with an EDLC mindset while elevating the shopping environment for customers.
Overall, the SG&A increase was partially offset by improved gross margins, resulting in an operating income decline of 6.2%. We're also encouraged by the progress on inventory management with inventory declining about 2.9% in the second quarter versus last year, including a 6.5% decline in comp stores. By cleaning up our store backrooms, leveraging technology and changing certain processes, we're improving product availability and enabling associates to be on the sales floor serving customers in a more effective way.
Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect the comp sales increase in the range of 1% to 1.5%. As a reminder, comp sales for last year's comparable period were 1.5%.
Now let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International delivered another solid performance in the second quarter. 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 6 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%. The rate of sales growth in several markets slowed versus our first quarter results, impacted by a leap day in the first quarter and the Easter holiday shift between first and second quarters in most markets due to the 1 month reporting lag. 
Walmex continues to produce strong sales results across all formats, while the U.K. environment remains challenging. 
The international team remains focused and continues to execute on key strategic priorities: to actively manage the existing portfolio; deliver balanced growth; be the lowest cost operator; and build strong foundations in talent, trust and technology. We continue to be aggressive in managing the portfolio, announcing last week the agreement to sell our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico. In addition, our recently announced strategic alliance with JD.com in China aligns with our growth strategy in this key market by better integrating our digital and physical retail operations. We also continue to execute aggressive cost-reduction programs in the U.K. and Canada and are expanding cost analytics programs into other markets like Mexico and China.
We also announced market CEO moves this quarter in China, the U.K. and Canada. We are confident these moves position us well for driving improved performance in each of these markets and demonstrate the depth of our talent globally.
With that, let's discuss International's overall results. Net sales grew 2.2% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 6.6% due to a $2.7 billion currency headwind.
From a profitability standpoint, operating income increased 47.5% on a constant-currency basis and 35.2% on a reported basis. This increase includes the gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. Excluding the impact from this gain, operating income increased 3.1% on a constant-currency basis, which slightly outpaced sales growth. On a reported basis, excluding the gain, operating income decreased 6.7%.
The accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets. However, I'd like to provide some highlights on each one. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of our e-commerce performance. 
Walmex continues to lead the way delivering strong results. Keep in mind, Walmex releases results under IFRS. And the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some numbers may differ. The positive momentum in the business continued across all formats, divisions and countries. Comp sales for Walmex increased 7.3% in the quarter, significantly outpacing the rest of the self-service market. Excluding the gain from the sale of our bank operations in Mexico last year, operating income would have increased faster than sales.
In Canada, despite increased promotional activity by competitors throughout the quarter, comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for 9 consecutive quarters. And according to Nielsen, we continue to gain market share in food and consumables and health and wellness. Our cost analytics program made good progress helping drive down cost of goods, allowing us to invest in price.
Excluding the gain from the sale of certain properties in Canada last year, operating income increased faster than sales. Additionally, we continue to decrease inventory levels and improve efficiency from a store and labor perspective.
In the U.K., fierce competition in food deflation continue to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends. During the quarter, comp sales, excluding fuel, decreased 7.5%. Our strategy remains focused on improving retail basics, simplifying and strengthening the offer through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs through our cost analytics program and driving sales through strategic price investments where we remain committed to the previously announced 5-year GBP 1.5 billion price investment.
In China, despite negative comp sales of 0.5% this quarter, our business continues to grow as we expand our footprint throughout the country. And we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel. We Operate For Less initiatives have delivered results, and we were able to leverage expenses.
Our recently announced alliance with JD.com enables us to better serve consumers through a powerful combination of e-commerce and retail. JD.com, the leading online direct sales company and the country's largest Internet business by revenue, has a complementary offering, allowing us to deliver compelling new experiences that can reach significantly more customers. We are optimistic about our future in China.
In Brazil, despite the ongoing economic recession, we delivered comp sales growth of 4.7%. Our wholesale format continues to perform well and delivered strong growth again this quarter. In addition, we completed our store systems integration, which allows all banners to operate under a single financial system. This will provide better visibility to business outcomes, improved alignment of marketing efforts and further enhance our compliance programs. Overall, we're pleased with another solid performance from our international business in the quarter.
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. Net sales without fuel grew by 0.4%. Membership income increased 2.9% as Plus member counts increased and Plus member penetration is near all-time highs. Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.6%, which is slightly above our guidance. Market deflation, especially in food, continued to be a headwind and negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 100 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. We're pleased with how e-commerce performed as both direct to home and Club Pickup had strong growth.
Sam's also continues to make progress on being a leader in the digital space. Our members tell us they really appreciate the convenience that innovations like Scan & Go bring to their lives. This new checkout and payment solution lets members complete the shopping experience using their own mobile device.
Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect comp sales without fuel to be slightly positive. As a reminder, comp sales for last year's comparable period increased 0.4%.
With that, let's wrap things up. There's always more work to do, but we're pleased with the first half performance. These results combined with our outlook for the balance of the year give us confidence in raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.35, which includes a range of $0.90 to $1 in the third quarter. This compares to previous guidance of $4 to $4.30 for the full year.
As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14 net of tax noncash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. In addition, this guidance includes an estimated dilutive EPS impact of approximately $0.05, primarily in the fourth quarter as a result of expected operating losses and onetime transaction expenses related to the planned acquisition of Jet.com, assuming the transaction is closed near the beginning of the fourth quarter of FY '17. Keep in mind that this updated guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels and that our full year effective tax rate is expected to be at the low end of our previously stated range of 31.5% to 33.5%.
In closing, we continue to be pleased with momentum we are seeing across many parts of the business. We're executing against our strategic priorities and continue to focus on the customer. It's an exciting time at Walmart, and we are proud of the progress we're making.

From a revenue perspective, we had another solid quarter. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, total revenue increased 2.8% to $123.6 billion. While on a reported basis, total revenue was $120.9 billion. On a constant-currency basis, we added net sales of $2.8 billion in the quarter and $7.2 billion in the first 6 months of the fiscal year.
Walmart U.S. delivered a very solid comp sales increase of 1.6%, driven by a 1.2% increase in traffic. It's now been 2 full years that Walmart U.S. has delivered positive comp sales. In fact, on a 2-year stack basis, comp sales increased 3.1%. As Doug mentioned earlier, we made progress in e-commerce with GMV and sales, growing 13% and 11.8%, respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than the international results. And globally, we continue to make headway on expanding our assortment and enhancing the shopping experience for our customers. Whether it's through online grocery, Walmart Pay or broadening our reach in China through the alliance of JD.com, we're making it easier for customers to access products when and how they want. Now with the agreement to acquire Jet.com, we're building on our e-commerce foundation and creating an opportunity to accelerate e-commerce even further.
Consolidated gross profit margin increased 53 basis points, driven by improvements in all 3 operating segments. From an expense standpoint, as anticipated, total SG&A increased compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to our previously announced investments in people and technology for this fiscal year. That being said, our teams across the globe remain focused on managing expenses. In addition to solid operating results, disciplined working capital management and the timing of payments allowed us to generate $10.3 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year, which compares to $5.1 billion in the first half of last year. 
Continuing to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases is a priority for us. And we're fortunate to have such a strong business model that generates substantial distributable cash even after we've invested thoughtfully into the business. During the quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased 30.3 million shares for approximately $2.1 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, we have utilized approximately $7.3 billion of our current $20 billion share repurchase authorization.
With that, let's discuss the results of each of our operating segments, starting with Walmart U.S. We continue to see steady improvement in the Walmart U.S. business as customers respond favorably to the changes we're making in our stores and e-commerce offer. Net sales were up 3.1% or $2.3 billion. And comp sales rose 1.6% with a 1.2% increase in customer traffic. We believe a contributing factor to the result is our consistent improvement in customer experience. Customer surveys indicate that we're making good progress and providing a better shopping experience with cleaner stores, faster checkout and friendlier service. We've also broadened our e-commerce assortment, strengthened our mobile capabilities and expanded online grocery to more than 60 markets in nearly 400 locations. While there is still a lot of work to do in executing our multiyear plan, we're encouraged by the results we're seeing.
e-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment comp, and all of our formats had positive comp sales, including neighborhood markets, which delivered approximately a 6.5% comp sales growth in the period. Although difficult to quantify, we know overall sales included some tailwinds from external factors, such as continued low gas prices and unseasonably warm weather across much of the country. However, we also experienced sales headwinds from continued market deflation in food, which negatively impacted our food comp by around 100 basis points and our second quarter total segment comp by a similar amount as what we faced in the first quarter. 
The grocery business showed improvement from the first quarter with positive comp sales and traffic despite the ongoing deflationary impacts in food. In addition, both general merchandise and health and wellness delivered solid sales growth with strength in home, toys, sporting goods and OTC.  The back-to-school shopping season is in full swing. And we aim to be the destination of choice with low prices on a great assortment of products for parents and students preparing for the new school year.
In the second quarter, we continued to implement a multiyear strategy of incremental price investment in the U.S. business. It's still early days for this initiative, but we are pleased with the initial results. We're committed to providing everyday low prices, using data and analytics to better serve our customers both through stores and e-commerce.
Gross margin increased 33 basis points in the quarter. Improved margin rates in food and consumables were a contributing factor. In addition, we had improvement in our cost of goods due to savings in procuring merchandise, lower transportation expense as a result of lower fuel costs and some improvements in shrink. These benefits are somewhat offset by the implementation of the multiyear strategy of incremental price investments.
Operating expenses increased 8.3% over last year due primarily to the previously announced associate wage rate increases and investments in technology.  We remain focused on managing expenses with an EDLC mindset while elevating the shopping environment for customers. Overall, the SG&A increase was partially offset by improved gross margins, resulting in an operating income decline of 6.2%. We're also encouraged by the progress on inventory management with inventory declining about 2.9% in the second quarter versus last year, including a 6.5% decline in comp stores. By cleaning up our store backrooms, leveraging technology and changing certain processes, we're improving product availability and enabling associates to be on the sales floor serving customers in a more effective way. Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect the comp sales increase in the range of 1% to 1.5%. As a reminder, comp sales for last year's comparable period were 1.5%.
Now let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International delivered another solid performance in the second quarter. Nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 6 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%. The rate of sales growth in several markets slowed versus our first quarter results, impacted by a leap day in the first quarter and the Easter holiday shift between first and second quarters in most markets due to the 1 month reporting lag. Walmex continues to produce strong sales results across all formats, while the U.K. environment remains challenging. 
The international team remains focused and continues to execute on key strategic priorities: to actively manage the existing portfolio; deliver balanced growth; be the lowest cost operator; and build strong foundations in talent, trust and technology. We continue to be aggressive in managing the portfolio, announcing last week the agreement to sell our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico. In addition, our recently announced strategic alliance with JD.com in China aligns with our growth strategy in this key market by better integrating our digital and physical retail operations. We also continue to execute aggressive cost-reduction programs in the U.K. and Canada and are expanding cost analytics programs into other markets like Mexico and China. We also announced market CEO moves this quarter in China, the U.K. and Canada. We are confident these moves position us well for driving improved performance in each of these markets and demonstrate the depth of our talent globally. 
With that, let's discuss International's overall results. Net sales grew 2.2% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 6.6% due to a $2.7 billion currency headwind. From a profitability standpoint, operating income increased 47.5% on a constant-currency basis and 35.2% on a reported basis. This increase includes the gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. Excluding the impact from this gain, operating income increased 3.1% on a constant-currency basis, which slightly outpaced sales growth. On a reported basis, excluding the gain, operating income decreased 6.7%.
The accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets. However, I'd like to provide some highlights on each one. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of our e-commerce performance. Walmex continues to lead the way delivering strong results. Keep in mind, Walmex releases results under IFRS and the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some numbers may differ. The positive momentum in the business continued across all formats, divisions and countries. Comp sales for Walmex increased 7.3% in the quarter, significantly outpacing the rest of the self-service market. Excluding the gain from the sale of our bank operations in Mexico last year, operating income would have increased faster than sales.
In Canada, despite increased promotional activity by competitors throughout the quarter, comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for 9 consecutive quarters. And according to Nielsen, we continue to gain market share in food and consumables and health and wellness. Our cost analytics program made good progress helping drive down cost of goods, allowing us to invest in price. Excluding the gain from the sale of certain properties in Canada last year, operating income increased faster than sales. Additionally, we continue to decrease inventory levels and improve efficiency from a store and labor perspective.
In the U.K., fierce competition and food deflation continue to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends. During the quarter, comp sales, excluding fuel, decreased 7.5%. Our strategy remains focused on improving retail basics, simplifying and strengthening the offer through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs through our cost analytics program and driving sales through strategic price investments where we remain committed to the previously announced 5-year GBP 1.5 billion price investment.
In China, despite negative comp sales of 0.5% this quarter, our business continues to grow as we expand our footprint throughout the country. And we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel. We Operate For Less initiatives have delivered results, and we were able to leverage expenses. Our recently announced alliance with JD.com enables us to better serve consumers through a powerful combination of e-commerce and retail. JD.com, the leading online direct sales company and the country's largest Internet business by revenue, has a complementary offering, allowing us to deliver compelling new experiences that can reach significantly more customers. We are optimistic about our future in China.
In Brazil, despite the ongoing economic recession, we delivered comp sales growth of 4.7%. Our wholesale format continues to perform well and delivered strong growth again this quarter. In addition, we completed our store systems integration, which allows all banners to operate under a single financial system. This will provide better visibility to business outcomes, improved alignment of marketing efforts and further enhance our compliance programs. Overall, we're pleased with another solid performance from our international business in the quarter.
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. Net sales without fuel grew by 0.4%. Membership income increased 2.9% as Plus member counts increased and Plus member penetration is near all-time highs. Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.6%, which is slightly above our guidance. Market deflation, especially in food, continued to be a headwind and negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 100 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. We're pleased with how e-commerce performed as both direct to home and Club Pickup had strong growth.
Sam's also continues to make progress on being a leader in the digital space. Our members tell us they really appreciate the convenience that innovations like Scan & Go bring to their lives. This new checkout and payment solution lets members complete the shopping experience using their own mobile device. Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect comp sales without fuel to be slightly positive. As a reminder, comp sales for last year's comparable period increased 0.4%.
With that, let's wrap things up. There's always more work to do, but we're pleased with the first half performance. These results combined with our outlook for the balance of the year give us confidence in raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.35, which includes a range of $0.90 to $1 in the third quarter. This compares to previous guidance of $4 to $4.30 for the full year.
As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14 net of tax noncash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. In addition, this guidance includes an estimated dilutive EPS impact of approximately $0.05, primarily in the fourth quarter as a result of expected operating losses and onetime transaction expenses related to the planned acquisition of Jet.com, assuming the transaction is closed near the beginning of the fourth quarter of FY '17. Keep in mind that this updated guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels and that our full year effective tax rate is expected to be at the low end of our previously stated range of 31.5% to 33.5%.
In closing, we continue to be pleased with momentum we are seeing across many parts of the business. We're executing against our strategic priorities and continue to focus on the customer. It's an exciting time at Walmart, and we are proud of the progress we're making. 
Thank you for joining our call today. And we look forward to seeing many of you here in Arkansas at our Annual Meeting for the investment community on October 5 and 6."

313055,326063476,1037258,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2017 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2016",2016-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter results. We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.07. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue",1270,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter results. 
We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.07. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $123.6 billion, an increase of 2.8% over last year.  We exceeded our Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance this quarter, with Walmart U.S. delivering comp sales of 1.6%, driven by a traffic increase of 1.2%.  This was our eighth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and our seventh consecutive quarter of positive traffic. I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing when I visit stores and pleased with how Greg Foran, our leadership team and our associates are executing our plan to win. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. And the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. Comp store inventory was down 6.5% and in-stock levels are up.
We're also showing progress in e-commerce. On a constant currency basis, GMV and e-commerce sales increased 13% and 11.8%, respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets. This was primarily due to growth in our marketplace offering in the U.S., the continued rollout of online grocery and growth of pickup in our stores and clubs. We continue to see proof that our customers enjoy a seamless shopping experience. The distinctions that we talk about today between stores, apps, pickup, delivery and sites are continuing to blur into the background for customers. For them, it's just Walmart.
We built a solid foundation in e-commerce under the leadership of Neil Ashe. During Neil's tenure, we more than doubled our e-commerce GMV, became the second most trafficked e-commerce site in the U.S.; replatformed walmart.com; opened a national fulfillment center network; and most importantly, became known as a great place to work for talented technologists and e-commerce professionals in Silicon Valley. Neil also led our discussions with JD. Neil will be with Walmart through the end of our fiscal year, working on our e-commerce strategies in several international markets. I'd like to thank him for his significant contributions to our company.
Building on this solid foundation, we made some strategic decisions to position ourselves for the future in the priority markets of the U.S. and China, including the announcement last week to acquire Jet.com. Operating Walmart.com and Jet.com will allow us to reach even more customers and drive a higher level of growth more quickly. One of the things we like about the technology they've developed is that it rewards customers in real time with savings on a basket of goods and puts them more in charge of the price they pay. This empowers customers in a way that is true to the spirit of Walmart. When customers build a basket of goods online rather than ordering one item at a time, shipping economics are in their favor and ours. Walmart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest cost basket online. It's important to remember that customers won't see changes immediately as we await government approval and the necessary tech platform changes, which will take time.
Once the acquisition is complete, we look forward to welcoming Marc Lore, current President and CEO of Jet.com. He will join Walmart as our new President and CEO of E-commerce, reporting to me. He'll be responsible for both the Walmart and Jet brands in the U.S. Marc is a passionate merchant and innovative thinker, who will definitely add value to our business. I look forward to working with him.
In China, our recent announced transaction with an investment in JD.com improves our position there. JD's significant presence online, where Walmart and Sam's Club will feature prominently, affords us the opportunity to extend the reach of our brands to millions of new customers. I made a couple of visits to JD's delivery and pickup points in Shanghai when I was last in China. And I'm excited about the potential it creates for our customers there.  Richard Liu, CEO of JD.com, is a talented e-commerce merchant, and we look forward to our collaborations going forward.
Additionally, we made advancements in the U.S. on our key priorities to build digital relationships with customers, scale the assortment and expand online grocery. As of June, we've rolled out Walmart Pay nationwide to all stores. Customers tell us they love the convenience of this unique service. And we've found that a majority of transactions come from repeat users. If you haven't tried Walmart Pay, please do and share your feedback. Customers also continue to enjoy our online grocery pickup service and give it high marks. We added grocery pickup to 30 more markets this quarter, bringing our total to more than 60 markets and nearly 400 locations. It's gratifying to see how much this service helps our customers save time. Next, we're growing our marketplace offering at a strong pace. Since the beginning of the year, we've added about 7 million new items to the assortment; and today, offer approximately 15 million SKUs. 
Walmart International delivered another solid performance in the second quarter. 9 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales, and 6 of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way, and I'm pleased with the fact that the momentum in the business is broad-based across all formats and countries. In China, in addition to expanding our reach through the strategic alliance with JD.com, we continue to grow our base of stores and clubs. In fact, we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel. China remains a strategic focus for us as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally.
In the U.K., the competitive environment and food deflation continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales. Our strategy to turn things around is focused on improving the retail basics. We are simplifying and strengthening our offering through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs and driving sales through strategic price investments. While our turnaround will take time, I'm confident in the new leadership team there and want to assure you we're addressing this with urgency.
At Sam's Club, comp sales for the period were slightly above our expectations. Membership performance was the highlight. And there is quite a bit of innovation underway at Sam's related to the member experience. Earlier this year, we launched a test of Scan & Go, a mobile checkout and payment solution, which lets members skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of this service, and we expect to roll this out nationwide later this year. We also saw strong growth in the quarter from both Club Pickup and direct to home e-commerce. The new platform we are using to prospect for new members and better manage their accounts will help us deliver on our priority of growing membership. These innovations are making it easy for members to shop and save time.
Finally, I've enjoyed my time this week with more than 5,000 store leaders and merchants with the U.S. team at our annual holiday meeting in Denver. We've got a great plan for the busiest time of the year, and the mood at the meeting was deservedly upbeat. I'd like to thank our store managers and all of our associates for the job they're doing. In summary, I'm pleased with the momentum in the business. We have a plan, and we're executing against it, and customers are responding favorably.
Now I'll turn it over to Brett."

We're halfway through the year, and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we're seeing across many parts of the business. We're executing against our strategic priorities, focusing on the customer and improving core retail fundamentals around the world. 
In addition to delivering solid second quarter results, which I'll talk about in a minute, we continue to make decisions that focus the business for long-term success. Just in the past few weeks, we furthered our strategy in e-commerce through the alliance of JD.com and the planned acquisition of Jet.com. In addition, we've agreed to divest our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico, allowing for additional focus on our core business in that market. Each of these decisions aligns with our strategy and demonstrates our commitment to thoughtfully allocating capital against our long-term strategy.
Now let's get to the results. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.07, which was at the high end of our guidance range, while reported EPS was $1.21. Adjusted EPS excludes the noncash gain of $0.14, net of tax, from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. We anticipate the gain for the full year will be $0.16 per share, which is within the original guidance range when we announced the transaction. From a revenue perspective, we had another solid quarter. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, total revenue increased 2.8% to $123.6 billion.

Excluding the gain from the sale of certain properties in Canada last year, operating income increased faster than sales. Additionally, we continue to decrease inventory levels and improve efficiency from a store and labor perspective.
In the U.K., fierce competition and food deflation continue to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends. During the quarter, comp sales, excluding fuel, decreased 7.5%. Our strategy remains focused on improving retail basics, simplifying and strengthening the offer through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs through our cost analytics program and driving sales through strategic price investments where we remain committed to the previously announced 5-year GBP 1.5 billion price investment.
In China, despite negative comp sales of 0.5% this quarter, our business continues to grow as we expand our footprint throughout the country. And we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel. We Operate For Less initiatives have delivered results, and we were able to leverage expenses. Our recently announced alliance with JD.com enables us to better serve consumers through a powerful combination of e-commerce and retail. JD.com, the leading online direct sales company and the country's largest Internet business by revenue, has a complementary offering, allowing us to deliver compelling new experiences that can reach significantly more customers. We are optimistic about our future in China.
In Brazil, despite the ongoing economic recession, we delivered comp sales growth of 4.7%. Our wholesale format continues to perform well and delivered strong growth again this quarter. In addition, we completed our store systems integration, which allows all banners to operate under a single financial system. This will provide better visibility to business outcomes, improved alignment of marketing efforts and further enhance our compliance programs. Overall, we're pleased with another solid performance from our international business in the quarter.
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. Net sales without fuel grew by 0.4%. Membership income increased 2.9% as Plus member counts increased and Plus member penetration is near all-time highs. Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.6%, which is slightly above our guidance. Market deflation, especially in food, continued to be a headwind and negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 100 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. We're pleased with how e-commerce performed as both direct to home and Club Pickup had strong growth.
Sam's also continues to make progress on being a leader in the digital space. Our members tell us they really appreciate the convenience that innovations like Scan & Go bring to their lives. This new checkout and payment solution lets members complete the shopping experience using their own mobile device. Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect comp sales without fuel to be slightly positive. As a reminder, comp sales for last year's comparable period increased 0.4%.
With that, let's wrap things up. There's always more work to do, but we're pleased with the first half performance. These results combined with our outlook for the balance of the year give us confidence in raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.35, which includes a range of $0.90 to $1 in the third quarter. This compares to previous guidance of $4 to $4.30 for the full year.
As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14 net of tax noncash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. In addition, this guidance includes an estimated dilutive EPS impact of approximately $0.05, primarily in the fourth quarter as a result of expected operating losses and onetime transaction expenses related to the planned acquisition of Jet.com, assuming the transaction is closed near the beginning of the fourth quarter of FY '17. Keep in mind that this updated guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels and that our full year effective tax rate is expected to be at the low end of our previously stated range of 31.5% to 33.5%.
In closing, we continue to be pleased with momentum we are seeing across many parts of the business. We're executing against our strategic priorities and continue to focus on the customer. It's an exciting time at Walmart, and we are proud of the progress we're making. 
Thank you for joining our call today. And we look forward to seeing many of you here in Arkansas at our Annual Meeting for the investment community on October 5 and 6."

As you saw in our earnings release this morning, we delivered another solid quarter and are pleased with our continued momentum in the business. Our associates are doing a good job, and it's much appreciated. I'll discuss the details in a minute, but I'd like to start about thanking everyone who came to Bentonville for our investment community meeting in October. We enjoyed giving us an update in our plans going forward. We have a strong company. We're executing well in our stores and making strategic investments in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster to better serve our customers every day. When we worked together last month, I outlined 4 priorities: make everyday easier for busy families, operate with discipline, be the most trusted retailer and deliver results and position the company to win. By executing on these priorities, the customer and our shareholders will benefit. 
To start, I'd like to highlight some recent developments in e-commerce that demonstrate how we're moving faster and making everyday easier for busy families. First, we're excited to see Walmart.com gaining traction. From a marketplace perspective, we're scaling scanning fast, adding 8 million SKUs over the last 3 months alone. E-commerce contributed 50 basis points to our Q3 Wal-Mart U.S. comp, which is our largest contribution yet. It's great to see an improving e-commerce business complement the momentum we have in our stores. Next, recently completed acquisition of Jet.com, and we're excited to have [indiscernible] as a member of our leadership team driving U.S. e-commerce for Wal-Mart and Jet.com. One of the reasons that JD.com make sense for Walmart is the common ground we shared with basket economics. Walmart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket of goods and Jet has created the unique way to deliver lowest-cost basket online. When customers build a bigger basket online, the economics work in their favor and in ours. Mark has hit the ground running since the acquisition with finalized. We immediately set up teams to accelerate our integration efforts, and we're working hard to leverage our strengths, such as optimizing our combined fulfillment networks, utilizing our skill in areas like shipping, sharing our assortment leveraging with strength of our marketing teams. We're excited to bring the benefits of our combined businesses, and we look forward to updating you on our progress going forward. I'm also excited about how we positioned our business in China to win. We continue to be pleased with how our alliance with JD.com allows us to reach even more customers with our brands. We recently announced we owned roughly 10% of JD.com's shares. And during my visit a few weeks ago, we jointly launched 2 new services. Our Sam's Club flagship store launched on JD's website, providing hundreds of millions of customers access to Sam's Clubs premium products with JD's same day and next day delivery service. We also announced an exclusive Wal-Mart global import store on JD.Com Worldwide, the company's cross-border platform. The new store provides Chinese consumers access to Walmart's selection of thousands of products imported from Walmart stores around the world. We're working together with them to create a seamless shopping experience. 
I was able to visit the JD home office when I was in China last month, and it was clear that they work with speed and the spirit of innovation is strong. When I was in one of our Walmart hypermarkets in Beijing, JD already had a site set up for picking a delivery customer orders. We also announce an investment in New Data, China's largest ongoing demand logistics and grocery online and off-line or O2O seamless e-commerce platform. Already, New Data has enabled to our delivery service from more than a 45 Walmart locations. It's amazing to see how O2O is changing how Chinese consumers shop. populated cities and favorable delivery economics enable to 2-hour delivery, and we look to expand the number of locations using New Data to 2-hour delivery going forward. We're moving faster to position the company to win, and we're doing this for a position of increasing strength. 
Now I'd like to move to our third quarter results where we delivered another solid quarter with earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding the $2.1 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $120.3 billion, an increase of 2.5% over last year. Comp store sales grew 1.2% in Walmart U.S, driven by a traffic increase of 0.7%. Greg Ford, our U.S. leadership team and our associates continue to execute our plan to win, and it's working. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve, and the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. 
Comp store inventory was down approximately 6%, and in stock levels are up. We also continue to show progress in your commerce. On a constant-currency basis, Global eCommerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8%, respectively. U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets, driven by our marketplace offering as I mentioned earlier as well as the contribution from Jet.com. We continue to roll out online grocery and grow our pick-up business in stores and clubs. 
We're making progress giving our customers the seamless shopping experience they are looking for. They choose rights international team delivered another solid performance in the quarter, growing sales and constant currency 2.4%. 10 of our 11 markets posed a positive comp sales, and 7 of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continue to lead the way, and I'm pleased with the fact that our momentum is broad-based across formats and countries within Walmex. I am pleased comps sales growth returned to positive territory in China. We continue to grow our basic stores and clubs in addition to the e-commerce initiative I mentioned earlier. When I was in China and in conjunction with the Walmart foundation, we were proud to launch the Walmart Food Safety and Collaboration Center in Beijing with an investment of $25 million from the company and our foundation. The goal of this center is to develop solutions to food safety that can be implemented across the global supply chain, so China's consumers can trust that the food they eat is safe and good for their families. China is clearly a strategic market for us as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally, and we're moving with speed to position the business for success. 
In the U.K, we're making some progress, but our turnaround will take time. We're confident in our leadership team there and want to assure you we continue to address this market with urgency. 
We have a strong international business and encouraged by positive momentum. As we mentioned in October, we are shaping our portfolio, and we'll make appropriate adjustments if it strengthens the company. You've seen examples of this recently in Chile and Mexico, and we'll continue to evaluate and adjust when it's best. 
At Sam's Club, and the team grew comp sales extruding fuel 1.4% and launched Scan & Go nationwide. Scan & Go is a mobile checkout and payment solution, which lets members skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of the service, and we're excited about how it will improve our members experience, making it easy to shop and save time. Whether it's transforming the way members shop or elevating the experience with exciting new merchandise, the initiatives we have underway position us to win. 
Overall, we're gearing up for the holidays, our busiest time of the year. And we'll be ready with great items and low prices to delight our customers. Here in the U.S., we'll have an expanded assortment online and available for pickup, in addition to holiday helpers in-stores to help speed customers through the checkout line. 
Finally, one of the goals we laid out for you in October was to be the most trusted retailer. Part of building that trust is not only helping customers save money and time, but helping them feel good about shopping at Walmart. We want them to be able to trust that the products they buy are good for their families, the planet and the people that made them. So earlier this month, we shared some new targets in sustainability, food and responsible sourcing. We've set new goals in the areas of waste, renewable energy and sustainable products, including food. Please check out our website to learn more. 
Customers have more transparency than ever before when they shop, and they expect us to lead in these areas, but they will also expect us to earn their trust, and we will. We're excited about this work and are committed to lead in what we believe is a new area of trust and transparency in retail. 
In summary, over all, we're pleased with the progress we're making across our business. We have momentum, and we're moving faster. We have a plan to win. We're executing against it, and customers are responding favorably. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brett."
313055,326063534,1088593,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2017 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks Doug, and good morning, everyone.

Last month at our investment committee meeting, we have been investors on how we're transforming the company for a position of strength. I laid out the financial framework that will guide our decisions, focused on delivering strong, efficient growth, operating with discipline and strategic capital allocation. Growth going forward will focus more on comp sales, and we're investing to accelerate e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. with our acquisition of Jet.com and further scaling in Walmart.com. We are moving with speed to drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
Let's turn our third quarter results. We're pleased the results were in line with our expectations and showed continued momentum in the business. Excluding currency impacts, each business segment delivered solid net sales growth, and e-commerce GMV and sales growth continues to accelerate. Keep in mind that the results included the operating impact of Jet.com for roughly half of the quarter as well as the transaction cost, both of which were initially forecast to be in the fourth quarter. 
Total revenue, excluding an unfavorable $2.1 billion currency impact, increased 2.5% to $120.3 billion. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.7% to $118.2 billion. During the quarter, we added $2.7 billion in net sales on a constant-currency basis, which brings year-to-date constant currency growth in nearly $10 billion. Walmart U.S. continues its solid top line performance, and it's clear that our focus on driving value and a better store experience is resonating with customers. International delivered another solid quarter with Walmex once again leading the way. Sam's Club comp sales were better than expected, and membership income again showed steady improvement. Third quarter EPS was $0.98 versus guidance of $0.90 to $1. There were a few items that impacted our results that were not anticipated in our guidance, but in total had a minimal impact. The primary items included a gain on the sale of certain shopping center assets in Chile, a tax benefit related to our agreement to sell the Suburbia business in Mexico as well as the diluted impact from the earlier-than-expected completion of the JD.com acquisition, including transaction costs. Also, we're recall that last year, there was a $0.04 benefit to third quarter EPS due to a lease accounting adjustment. 
I'll provide more details about our operating segments performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce where the results have improved sequentially throughout the year. Globally, on a constant-currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8%, respectively, with even stronger growth in the U.S. The continuing transition of the e-commerce business in China disproportionately impacted the GMV growth rate versus the sales growth rate this quarter due to the mix of first party versus marketplace sales. Excluding in total, GMV increased 28.6%. 
E-commerce growth includes the benefit from the 6 weeks of Jet.com results in the quarter, but the GMV growth rate would still be greater than 20%, excluding this contribution. In the U.S. e-commerce business, we continue to make solid progress expanding marketplace. We're thrilled to have the Jet team on board, and we're moving quickly to accelerate growth. In addition, we're pleased with the progress we're making with online grocery. Customer count and basket size continue to outperform our expectations, and we've expanded this service to more than 100 U.S. markets. In China, we expect our broader presence on JD.com with a new Sam's Club flagship store and Walmart global imports store will accelerate growth. We're moving quickly with e-commerce innovation and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth. 
Now let's turn back to the broader business. Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 34 basis points due primarily to improvements in the U.S. and international segments. As expected, total SG&A also increased primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology. We continue to make progress on working capital, driven primarily by continuing discipline in managing inventory and payables. We also had a cash flow benefit this quarter due to the application of new tax guidelines related to accelerated reduction of remodels and related expenses. In total, we generated $12.2 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year compared to $6.8 billion in the first 9 months of last year. 
During this transformational time, a key priority remains using our financial strength to provide strong cash returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In the quarter, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased 19.6 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we have now returned $10.9 billion to shareholders. As of the end of the third quarter, we have utilize approximately $8.7 billion of the current $20 million share repurchase authorization. 
Lets now discuss the results for each of the operating segments, starting with Walmart U.S. Overall, we're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. Sales and traffic increased again this quarter, and customer experience scores improved. Walmart U.S. net sales increased 2.5% or more than $1.8 million. This growth comes despite persistent market deflation in food, which negatively impacted our food comp by approximately 150 basis points as well as unseasonably warm weather in the back half of the quarter. Comp sales increased 1.2%, driven by 0.7% increase in customer traffic. On a 2-year stack basis, comp traffic was up 2.4%, which was relatively consistent with first 2 quarters of the year. E-commerce contributed approximately 50 basis points in the segment called, which was an acceleration from the second quarter. Also, All-Star for much a positive comps as including Neighborhood Markets which delivered come sales growth for approximately 5.2%. Gross margin increased 32 basis points. Savings from procuring merchandise contributed to margin rate improvement in general merchandise, food and consumables. In addition, transportation-related fuel cost-savings favorably impacted results. These factors which reduce cost of goods sold were partially offset by the continued implementation of our multiyear strategy of incremental price investment. 
Operating expenses increased 8.6% percent primarily due to the previously announced associate wage rate increases as well as investments in technology. In addition, we let the lease accounting adjustment, which I mentioned earlier, which benefited last year's U.S. third quarter results. As a result, operating income declined 11.3% for the quarter. Excluding last year's lease accounting adjustment, operating income would have declined 9.8%. 
We continue to do a good job with inventory while maintaining high-end stock levels. In the third quarter, inventory declined 2% with comp store inventory down approximately 6%. We continue to execute our plan and are making good progress delivering a better experience for our customers. We're pleased with the underlying momentum in the business and feel good about our plans for the fourth quarter. We are well-positioned for holiday with newness, exciting gift items in update through out the assortment. All the pieces are in place to ensure great shopping experience in our stores and online. 
For the 13-week period ended January 27, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of between 1% in 1.5%. 
Now let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International continues to deliver solid results. This quarter, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 7 of those markets grew comps by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way with comp sales growth of 7% representing a 2-year comp growth of nearly 13%. Our positive comp sales trend again this quarter is a continuation of what we have seen over the last several years. We will continue to focus on driving growth to refresh offering, expanding online grocery and private brands. 
With that, let's discuss international's overall results. Net sales grew 2.4% on a constant-currency basis, while reported net sales declined 4.8% due to a $2.1 billion currency impact. Operating income increased 11.2% on a constant-currency basis. On a reported basis, operating income increased 1.2%. In the quarter, there was a gain from the sale of several shopping malls in Chile. Also recall that in the third quarter last year, we had a favorable impact from a lease accounting adjustment. Excluding both of these items, operating income increased 9.4% on a constant-currency basis. We expect a similar gain in the fourth quarter reflecting the completion of the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile. 
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of our key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Additionally, results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. 
Let's begin with Walmex, which released its earnings on October 25. Keep in mind, that Walmex releases results under IFRS, and that the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore, some results may differ. The positive momentum in the business continued across all formats, divisions and countries. Comp sales for Walmex increased 7% in the quarter, and total sales increased nearly 9%. In Mexico, comp sales increased 7.3% and continued to outpace the rest of the self-service market, according to ANTAD. In addition, Walmex did a good job managing inventory, which grew at a slower rate in sales growth. In Canada, net sales increased 3.3% and comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for 10 consecutive quarters. And according to Nielsen, we continue to gain market share in food and consumables and health and wellness. Our cost analytics program continues in helping drive down cost of goods, allowing us to invest in price. In Canada, we also reduced inventory levels even as sales increased. 
Turning to the U.K. Net sales declined 3.8% and comp sales declined 5.8% in the third quarter. The key priority remains driving an improved customer experience and building sales momentum by simplifying the offer, improving product availability and making strategic investments in service and price. We are moving with pace as we address our customer value proposition in the market. 
In China, net sales grew 4.2% and comp sales increased 1.6% this quarter. The key drivers of the performance were strong seasonal categories during the mid-Autumn Festival and a strong performance in fresh categories, an ongoing focus area for us in China. As Doug mentioned, through our recent alliance with JD.com, we continue to offer exciting new ways for customers to access high-quality products from around the world. That was another solid performance for Walmart International. 
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. Excluding fuel, net sales and comp sales increased 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively, and membership income grew by 2.3%. Market deflation, primarily in food, negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 110 basis points versus last year. E-commerce performed well and contributed approximately 60 basis points to the comp growth. Operating income including fuel declined year-over-year by approximately 7%, primarily as a result of an increase in operating expenses, including planned investments in people and technology as well as fuel profit and lapping last year's lease accounting benefits. Excluding fuel as a lease-related benefit, segment income decreased approximately 18%. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter for the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect comp sales growth excluding fuel to be in the range of 1% to 1.5%. 
With that, let's discuss our fourth quarter and full year EPS guidance. We are increasing the bottom end of our full year adjusted EPS guidance, resulting in a new range of $4.20 to $4.35. As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14 noncash gain from the sale of [indiscernible] in China to JD.com in the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, our full year EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.34 to $4.49. The updated guidance assumes that the full year effective tax rate will be between 31% and 32% as well as currency exchange rates remaining at the current levels. 
In closing, we're very pleased with our progress in the business and the positive momentum we're seeing. We're excited for the holidays. 
Thank you for joining our call today, and we wish each of you a happy and healthy holiday season."

As you saw in our earnings release this morning, we delivered another solid quarter and are pleased with the continued momentum in the business. Our associates are doing a good job, and it's much appreciated. 
I'll discuss the details in a minute, but I'd like to start about thanking everyone who came to Bentonville for our investment community meeting in October. We enjoyed giving you an update on our plans going forward. 
We have a strong company. We're executing well in our stores and making strategic investments in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster to better serve our customers every day. 
When we were together last month, I outlined 4 priorities: Make everyday easier for busy families, operate with discipline, be the most trusted retailer and deliver results and position the company to win. By executing on these priorities, the customer and our shareholders will benefit. 
To start, I'd like to highlight some recent developments in e-commerce that demonstrate how we're moving faster and making everyday easier for busy families. First, we're excited to see Walmart.com gaining traction. From a marketplace perspective, we're scaling scanning fast, adding 8 million SKUs over the last 3 months alone. 
E-commerce contributed 50 basis points to our Q3 Walmart U.S. comp, which is our largest contribution yet. It's great to see an improving e-commerce business complement the momentum we have in our stores. 
Next, we recently completed acquisition of Jet.com, and we're excited to have Marc Lore as a member of our leadership team driving U.S. e-commerce for Walmart and Jet.com. One of the reasons that Jet.com makes sense for Walmart is the common ground we share with basket economics. Walmart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket of goods, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest-cost basket online. When customers build a bigger basket online, the economics work in their favor and in ours. 
Marc has hit the ground running since the acquisition was finalized. We immediately set up teams to accelerate our integration efforts, and we're working hard to leverage our strengths, such as optimizing our combined fulfillment networks, utilizing our scale in areas like shipping, sharing our assortment and leveraging the strengths of our marketing teams. We're excited to reap the benefits of our combined businesses, and we look forward to updating you on our progress going forward. 
I'm also excited by how we positioned our business in China to win. We continue to be pleased with how our alliance with JD.com allows us to reach even more customers with our brands. We recently announced we own roughly 10% of JD.com's shares. And during my visit a few weeks ago, we jointly launched 2 new services. 
Our Sam's Club flagship store launched on JD's website, providing hundreds of millions of customers access to Sam's Club's premium products with JD's same-day and next-day delivery service. 
We also announced an exclusive Walmart Global import store on JD.Com Worldwide, the company's cross-border platform. The new store provides Chinese consumers access to Walmart's selection of thousands of products imported from Walmart stores around the world. We're working together with them to create a seamless shopping experience. 
I was able to visit the JD home office when I was in China last month, and it was clear that they work with speed and the spirit of innovation is strong. When I was in one of our Walmart hypermarkets in Beijing, JD already had a site set up for picking and delivering customer orders. 
We also announced an investment in New Dada, China's largest on-demand logistics and grocery online to off-line, or O2O, seamless e-commerce platform. Already, New Dada is enabling 2-hour delivery service from more than 45 Walmart locations. 
It's amazing to see how O2O is changing how Chinese consumers shop. Densely populated cities and favorable delivery economics enable 2-hour delivery, and we look to expand the number of locations using New Dada for 2-hour delivery going forward. 
We're moving faster to position the company to win, and we're doing this from a position of increasing strength. 
Now I'd like to move to our third quarter results, where we delivered another solid quarter with earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding the $2.1 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $120.3 billion, an increase of 2.5% over last year. Comp store sales grew 1.2% in Walmart U.S, driven by a traffic increase of 0.7%. 
Greg Foran, our U.S. leadership team and our associates continue to execute our plan to win, and it's working. Our customer satisfaction scores continued to improve, and the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. Comp store inventory was down approximately 6%, and in-stock levels are up. 
We also continued to show progress in e-commerce. On a constant currency basis, global e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8%, respectively. U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets, driven by our marketplace offering, as I mentioned earlier, as well as a contribution from Jet.com. 
We continue to roll out online grocery and grow our pick-up business in stores and clubs. We're making progress giving our customers the seamless shopping experience they are looking for. 
Dave Cheesewright and the International team delivered another solid performance in the quarter, growing sales in constant currency 2.4%. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales, and 7 of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way, and I'm pleased with the fact that our momentum is broad-based across formats and countries within Walmex. 
I'm pleased comps sales growth returned to positive territory in China. We continue to grow our basic stores and clubs in addition to the e-commerce initiatives I mentioned earlier. When I was in China, and in conjunction with the Walmart foundation, we were proud to launch the Walmart Food Safety and Collaboration Center in Beijing with an investment of $25 million from the company and our foundation. The goal of this center is to develop solutions to food safety that can be implemented across the global supply chain. So Chinese consumers can trust that the food they eat is safe and good for their families. China is clearly a strategic market for us, as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally, and we're moving with speed to position the business for success. 
In the U.K, we're making some progress, but our turnaround will take time. We're confident in our leadership team there and want to assure you we continue to address this market with urgency. 
We have a strong International business and are encouraged by our positive momentum. As we mentioned in October, we are shaping our portfolio, and we'll make appropriate adjustments if it strengthens the company. You've seen examples of this recently in Chile and Mexico. And we'll continue to evaluate and adjust when it's best. 
At Sam's Club, Roz and the team grew comp sales, excluding fuel, 1.4% and launched Scan & Go nationwide. Scan & Go is a mobile checkout and payment solution which lets members skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of the service, and we're excited about how it will improve our members' experience, making it easy to shop and save time. 
Whether it's transforming the way members shop or elevating the experience with exciting new merchandise, the initiatives we have underway position us to win. 
Overall, we're gearing up for the holidays, our busiest time of the year. And we'll be ready with great items at low prices to delight our customers. Here in the U.S., we'll have an expanded assortment online and available for pickup in addition to holiday helpers in stores to help speed customers through the checkout line. 
Finally, one of the goals we laid out for you in October was to be the most trusted retailer. Part of building that trust is not only helping customers save money and time, but helping them feel good about shopping at Walmart. We want them to be able to trust that the products they buy are good for their families, the planet and the people that made them. 
So earlier this month, we shared some new targets in sustainability, food and responsible sourcing. We've set new goals in the areas of waste, renewable energy and sustainable products, including food. Please check out our website to learn more. 
Customers have more transparency than ever before when they shop, and they expect us to lead in these areas, but they will also expect us to earn their trust, and we will. We're excited about this work and are committed to lead in what we believe is a new era of trust and transparency in retail. 
In summary overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making across our business. We have momentum, and we're moving faster. We have a plan to win, we're executing against it, and customers are responding favorably. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brett."
313055,326063534,1088716,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2017 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks Doug, and good morning, everyone. Last month at our investment community meeting, we updated investors on how we're transforming the company from a position of strength.

Last month at our investment community meeting, we updated investors on how we're transforming the company from a position of strength. 
I laid out the financial framework that will guide our decisions, focused on: Delivering strong, efficient growth, operating with discipline and strategic capital allocation. 
Growth going forward will focus more on comp sales, and we're investing to accelerate e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. with our acquisition of Jet.com and further scaling Walmart.com. We are moving with speed to drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
Let's turn our third quarter results. We're pleased the results were in line with our expectations and showed continuing momentum in the business. Excluding currency impacts, each business segment delivered solid net sales growth, and e-commerce GMV and sales growth continued to accelerate. Keep in mind that the results included the operating impact of Jet.com for roughly half of the quarter, as well as the transaction cost, both of which were initially forecast to be in the fourth quarter. 
Total revenue, excluding an unfavorable $2.1 billion currency impact, increased 2.5% to $120.3 billion. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.7% to $118.2 billion. During the quarter, we added $2.7 billion in net sales on a constant currency basis, which brings year-to-date constant currency growth to nearly $10 billion. 
Walmart U.S. continued its solid top line performance, and it's clear that our focus on driving value and a better store experience is resonating with customers. International delivered another solid quarter, with Walmex once again leading the way. Sam's Club comp sales were better than expected, and membership income again showed steady improvement. 
Third quarter EPS was $0.98 versus guidance of $0.90 to $1. There were a few items that impacted the results that were not anticipated in our guidance, but in total, had a minimal impact. The primary items included a gain on the sale of certain shopping center assets in Chile, a tax benefit related to our agreement to sell the Suburbia business in Mexico, as well as the diluted impact from the earlier than expected completion of the Jet.com acquisition, including transaction costs. Also recall that last year, there was a $0.04 benefit to third quarter EPS due to a lease accounting adjustment. 
I'll provide more details about our operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce, where results have improved sequentially throughout the year. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8%, respectively, with even stronger growth in the U S. 
The continuing transition of the Yihaodian and e-commerce business in China disproportionately impacted the GMV growth rate versus the sales growth rate this quarter due to the mix of first party versus marketplace sales. Excluding Yihaodian in total, GMV increased 28.6%. 
E-commerce growth includes a benefit from the 6 weeks of Jet.com results in the quarter, but the GMV growth rate would still be greater than 20% when excluding this contribution. 
In the U.S. e-commerce business, we continue to make solid progress expanding marketplace. We're thrilled to have the Jet team on board, and we're moving quickly to accelerate growth. In addition, we're pleased with the progress we're making with online grocery. Customer count and basket size continued to outperform our expectations, and we've expanded the service to more than 100 U.S. markets. 
In China, we expect our broader presence on JD.com with the new Sam's Club flagship store and Walmart Global import store will accelerate growth. We're moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth. 
Now let's turn back to the broader business. Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 34 basis points, due primarily to improvements in the U.S. and International segments. As expected, total SG&A also increased primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology. We continue to make progress on working capital, driven primarily by continuing discipline in managing inventory and payables. We also had a cash flow benefit this quarter due to the application of new tax guidelines related to the accelerated reduction of remodels and related expenses. In total, we generated $12.2 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year compared to $6.8 billion in the first 9 months of last year. 
During this transformational time, a key priority remains using our financial strength to provide strong cash returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In the quarter, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased 19.6 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we have now returned $10.9 billion to shareholders. As of the end of the third quarter, we have utilized approximately $8.7 billion of the current $20 million share repurchase authorization. 
Let's now discuss the results for each of the operating segments in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. Overall, we're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. Sales and traffic increased again this quarter and customer experience scores improved. Walmart U.S. net sales increased 2.5% or more than $1.8 billion. This growth comes despite persistent market deflation of food, which negatively impacted our food comp by approximately 150 basis points, as well as unseasonably warm weather in the back half of the quarter. 
Comp sales increased 1.2%, driven by 0.7% increase in customer traffic. On a 2-year stack basis, comp traffic was up 2.4%, which was relatively consistent with first 2 quarters of the year. E-commerce contributed approximately 50 basis points to the segment comp, which was an acceleration from the second quarter. Also, all store formats had positive comp sales, including Neighborhood Markets, which delivered comp sales growth of approximately 5.2%. 
Gross margin increased 32 basis points. Savings from procuring merchandise contributed to margin rate improvement in general merchandise, food and consumables. In addition, transportation-related fuel cost savings favorably impacted results. These factors which reduce cost of goods sold were partially offset by the continued implementation of our multiyear strategy of incremental price investment. 
Operating expenses increased 8.6%, primarily due to the previously announced associate wage rate increases, as well as investments in technology. In addition, we lapped the lease accounting adjustment that I mentioned earlier, which benefited last year's U.S. third quarter results. As a result, operating income declined 11.3% for the quarter. Excluding last year's lease accounting adjustment, operating income would have declined 9.8%. 
We continue to do a good job with inventory while maintaining high in-stock levels. In the third quarter, inventory declined 2%, with comp store inventory down approximately 6%. 
We continue to execute our plan and are making good progress delivering a better experience for our customers. We're pleased with the underlying momentum in the business and feel good about our plans for the fourth quarter. We're well-positioned for holiday with newness and exciting gift items and EDLP throughout the assortment. 
All the pieces are in place to ensure a great shopping experience in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of between 1% in 1.5%. 
Now let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International continues to deliver solid results. This quarter, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 7 of those markets grew comps by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way with comp sales growth of 7%, representing a 2-year comp growth of nearly 13%. Our positive comp sales trend again this quarter is a continuation of what we have seen over the last several years. We will continue to focus on driving growth through our fresh offering, expanding online grocery and private brands. 
With that, let's discuss International's overall results. Net sales grew 2.4% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 4.8% due to a $2.1 billion currency impact. Operating income increased 11.2% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, operating income increased 1.2%. In the quarter, there was a gain from the sale of several shopping malls in Chile. Also recall that in the third quarter last year, we had a favorable impact from a lease accounting adjustment. Excluding both of these items, operating income increased 9.4% on a constant currency basis. We expect a similar gain in the fourth quarter reflecting the completion of the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile. 
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of our key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Additionally, the results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. 
Let's begin with Walmex, which released its earnings on October 25. Keep in mind that Walmex releases results under IFRS and that the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore, some results may differ. 
The positive momentum in the business continued across all formats, divisions and countries. Comp sales for Walmex increased 7% in the quarter and total sales increased nearly 9%. In Mexico, comp sales increased 7.3% and continued to outpace the rest of the self-service market according to ANTAD. In addition, Walmex did a good job managing inventory, which grew at a slower rate than its sales growth. 
In Canada, net sales increased 3.3% and comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for 10 consecutive quarters. And according to Nielsen, we continue to gain market share in food and consumables and health and wellness. Our cost analytics program continues in helping drive down cost of goods, allowing us to invest in price. In Canada, we also reduced inventory levels even as sales increased. 
Turning to the U.K. Net sales declined 3.8% and comp sales declined 5.8% in the third quarter. The key priority remains driving an improved customer experience and building sales momentum by simplifying the offer, improving product availability and making strategic investments in service and price. We are moving with pace as we address our customer value proposition in the market. 
In China, net sales grew 4.2% and comp sales increased 1.6% this quarter. The key drivers of the performance were strong seasonal and festive categories during the Mid-Autumn Festival and a strong performance in fresh categories, an ongoing focus area for us in China. As Doug mentioned, through our recent alliance with JD.com, we continue to offer exciting new ways for customers to access high-quality products from around the world. It was another solid performance for Walmart International. 
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. Excluding fuel, net sales and comp sales increased 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively, and membership income grew by 2.3%. Market deflation, primarily in food, negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 110 basis points versus last year. E-commerce performed well and contributed approximately 60 basis points to the comp growth. 
Operating income, including fuel, declined year-over-year by approximately 7%, primarily as a result of an increase in operating expenses, including planned investments in people and technology, as well as fuel profit and lapping last year's lease accounting benefit. Excluding fuel and the lease-related benefit, segment income decreased approximately 18%. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter for the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect comp sales growth, excluding fuel, to be in a range of 1% to 1.5%. 
With that, let's discuss our fourth quarter and full year EPS guidance. We are increasing the bottom end of our full year adjusted EPS guidance, resulting in a new range of $4.20 to $4.35. As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14 noncash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com in the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, our full year EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.34 to $4.49. The updated guidance assumes that the full year effective tax rate will be between 31% and 32%, as well as currency exchange rates remaining at current levels. 
In closing, we're pleased with our progress in the business and the positive momentum we're seeing. We're excited for the holidays. 
Thank you for joining our call today, and we wish each of you a happy and healthy holiday season."

I'll discuss the details in a minute, but I'd like to start about thanking everyone who came to Bentonville for our investment community meeting in October. We enjoyed giving you an update on our plans going forward. 
We have a strong company. We're executing well in our stores and making strategic investments in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster to better serve our customers every day. 
When we were together last month, I outlined 4 priorities: Make everyday easier for busy families, operate with discipline, be the most trusted retailer and deliver results and position the company to win. By executing on these priorities, the customer and our shareholders will benefit. 
To start, I'd like to highlight some recent developments in e-commerce that demonstrate how we're moving faster and making everyday easier for busy families. First, we're excited to see Walmart.com gaining traction. From a marketplace perspective, we're scaling fast, adding 8 million SKUs over the last 3 months alone. 
E-commerce contributed 50 basis points to our Q3 Walmart U.S. comp, which is our largest contribution yet. It's great to see an improving e-commerce business complement the momentum we have in our stores. 
Next, we recently completed the acquisition of Jet.com, and we're excited to have Marc Lore as a member of our leadership team driving U.S. e-commerce for Walmart and Jet.com. One of the reasons that Jet.com makes sense for Walmart is the common ground we share with basket economics. Walmart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket of goods, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest-cost basket online. When customers build a bigger basket online, the economics work in their favor and in ours. 
Marc has hit the ground running since the acquisition was finalized. We immediately set up teams to accelerate our integration efforts, and we're working hard to leverage our strengths, such as optimizing our combined fulfillment networks, utilizing our scale in areas like shipping, sharing our assortment and leveraging the strengths of our marketing teams. We're excited to reap the benefits of our combined businesses, and we look forward to updating you on our progress going forward. 
I'm also excited by how we positioned our business in China to win. We continue to be pleased with how our alliance with JD.com allows us to reach even more customers with our brands. We recently announced we own roughly 10% of JD.com's shares. And during my visit a few weeks ago, we jointly launched 2 new services. 
Our Sam's Club flagship store launched on JD's website, providing hundreds of millions of customers access to Sam's Club's premium products with JD's same-day and next-day delivery service. 
We also announced an exclusive Walmart Global import store on JD.Com Worldwide, the company's cross-border platform. The new store provides Chinese consumers access to Walmart's selection of thousands of products imported from Walmart stores around the world. We're working together with them to create a seamless shopping experience. 
I was able to visit the JD home office when I was in China last month, and it was clear that they work with speed and the spirit of innovation is strong. When I was in one of our Walmart hypermarkets in Beijing, JD already had a site set up for picking and delivering customer orders. 
We also announced an investment in New Dada, China's largest local on-demand logistics and grocery online to off-line, or O2O, seamless e-commerce platform. Already, New Dada is enabling 2-hour delivery service from more than 45 Walmart locations. 
It's amazing to see how O2O is changing how Chinese consumers shop. Densely populated cities and favorable delivery economics enable 2-hour delivery, and we look to expand the number of locations using New Dada for 2-hour delivery going forward. 
We're moving faster to position the company to win, and we're doing this from a position of increasing strength. 
Now I'd like to move to our third quarter results, where we delivered another solid quarter with earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding the $2.1 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $120.3 billion, an increase of 2.5% over last year. Comp store sales grew 1.2% in Walmart U.S, driven by a traffic increase of 0.7%. 
Greg Foran, our U.S. leadership team and our associates continue to execute our plan to win, and it's working. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve, and the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. Comp store inventory was down approximately 6%, and in-stock levels are up. 
We also continued to show progress in e-commerce. On a constant currency basis, global e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8%, respectively. U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets, driven by our marketplace offering, as I mentioned earlier, as well as a contribution from Jet.com. 
We continue to roll out online grocery and grow our pick-up business in stores and clubs. We're making progress giving our customers the seamless shopping experience they are looking for. 
Dave Cheesewright and the International team delivered another solid performance in the quarter, growing sales in constant currency 2.4%. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales, and 7 of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way, and I'm pleased with the fact that our momentum is broad-based across formats and countries within Walmex. 
I'm pleased comps sales growth returned to positive territory in China. We continue to grow our basic stores and clubs in addition to the e-commerce initiatives I mentioned earlier. When I was in China, and in conjunction with the Walmart foundation, we were proud to launch the Walmart Food Safety and Collaboration Center in Beijing with an investment of $25 million from the company and our foundation. The goal of this center is to develop solutions to food safety that can be implemented across the global supply chain, so Chinese consumers can trust that the food they eat is safe and good for their families. China is clearly a strategic market for us, as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally, and we're moving with speed to position the business for success. 
In the U.K, we're making some progress, but our turnaround will take time. We're confident in our leadership team there and want to assure you we continue to address this market with urgency. 
We have a strong International business and are encouraged by our positive momentum. As we mentioned in October, we are shaping our portfolio, and we'll make appropriate adjustments if it strengthens the company. You've seen examples of this recently in Chile and Mexico. And we'll continue to evaluate and adjust when it's best. 
At Sam's Club, Roz and the team grew comp sales, excluding fuel, 1.4% and launched Scan & Go nationwide. Scan & Go is a mobile checkout and payment solution which lets members skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of the service, and we're excited about how it will improve our members' experience, making it easy to shop and save time. 
Whether it's transforming the way members shop or elevating the experience with exciting new merchandise, the initiatives we have underway position us to win. 
Overall, we're gearing up for the holidays, our busiest time of the year. And we'll be ready with great items at low prices to delight our customers. Here in the U.S., we'll have an expanded assortment online and available for pickup in addition to holiday helpers in stores to help speed customers through the checkout line. 
Finally, one of the goals we laid out for you in October was to be the most trusted retailer. Part of building that trust is not only helping customers save money and time, but helping them feel good about shopping at Walmart. We want them to be able to trust that the products they buy are good for their families, the planet and the people that made them. 
So earlier this month, we shared some new targets in sustainability, food and responsible sourcing. We've set new goals in the areas of waste, renewable energy and sustainable products, including food. Please check out our website to learn more. 
Customers have more transparency than ever before when they shop, and they expect us to lead in these areas, but they will also expect us to earn their trust, and we will. We're excited about this work and are committed to lead in what we believe is a new era of trust and transparency in retail. 
In summary overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making across our business. We have momentum, and we're moving faster. We have a plan to win, we're executing against it, and customers are responding favorably. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brett."
313055,326063534,1088777,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2017 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks Doug, and good morning, everyone. Last month at our investment community meeting, we updated investors on how we're transforming the company from a position of strength.

Last month at our investment community meeting, we updated investors on how we're transforming the company from a position of strength. 
I laid out the financial framework that will guide our decisions, focused on delivering strong, efficient growth, operating with discipline and strategic capital allocation. 
Growth going forward will focus more on comp sales, and we're investing to accelerate e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. with our acquisition of Jet.com and further scaling Walmart.com. We are moving with speed to drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
Let's turn to our third quarter results. We're pleased the results were in line with our expectations and showed continuing momentum in the business. Excluding currency impacts, each business segment delivered solid net sales growth, and e-commerce GMV and sales growth continued to accelerate. Keep in mind that the results included the operating impact of Jet.com for roughly half of the quarter, as well as the transaction cost, both of which were initially forecast to be in the fourth quarter. 
Total revenue, excluding an unfavorable $2.1 billion currency impact, increased 2.5% to $120.3 billion. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.7% to $118.2 billion. During the quarter, we added $2.7 billion in net sales on a constant currency basis, which brings year-to-date constant currency growth to nearly $10 billion. 
Walmart U.S. continued its solid top line performance, and it's clear that our focus on driving value and a better store experience is resonating with customers.  International delivered another solid quarter, with Walmex once again leading the way. Sam's Club comp sales were better than expected, and membership income again showed steady improvement. 
Third quarter EPS was $0.98 versus guidance of $0.90 to $1. There were a few items that impacted the results that were not anticipated in our guidance, but in total had a minimal impact. The primary items included a gain on the sale of certain shopping center assets in Chile, a tax benefit related to our agreement to sell the Suburbia business in Mexico, as well as the diluted impact from the earlier than expected completion of the Jet.com acquisition, including transaction costs. Also recall that last year, there was a $0.04 benefit to third quarter EPS due to a lease accounting adjustment. 
I'll provide more details about our operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce, where results have improved sequentially throughout the year. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8%, respectively, with even stronger growth in the U S. 
The continuing transition of the Yihaodian  e-commerce business in China disproportionately impacted the GMV growth rate versus the sales growth rate this quarter due to the mix of first party versus marketplace sales. Excluding Yihaodian in total, GMV increased 28.6%. 
E-commerce growth includes a benefit from the 6 weeks of Jet.com results in the quarter, but the GMV growth rate would still be greater than 20% when excluding this contribution. 
In the U.S. e-commerce business, we continue to make solid progress expanding marketplace. We're thrilled to have the Jet team on board, and we're moving quickly to accelerate growth. In addition, we're pleased with the progress we're making with online grocery. Customer count and basket size continued to outperform our expectations, and we've expanded the service to more than 100 U.S. markets. 
In China, we expect our broader presence on JD.com with the new Sam's Club flagship store and Walmart Global import store will accelerate growth. We're moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth. 
Now let's turn back to the broader business. Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 34 basis points, due primarily to improvements in the U.S. and International segments. As expected, total SG&A also increased primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology. We continue to make progress on working capital, driven primarily by continuing discipline in managing inventory and payables. We also had a cash flow benefit this quarter due to the application of new tax guidelines related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses. In total, we generated $12.2 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year compared to $6.8 billion in the first 9 months of last year. 
During this transformational time, a key priority remains using our financial strength to provide strong cash returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In the quarter, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased 19.6 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we have now returned $10.9 billion to shareholders. As of the end of the third quarter, we have utilized approximately $8.7 billion of the current $20 million share repurchase authorization. 
Let's now discuss the results for each of the operating segments in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. Overall, we're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. Sales and traffic increased again this quarter and customer experience scores improved. Walmart U.S. net sales increased 2.5% or more than $1.8 billion. This growth comes despite persistent market deflation of food, which negatively impacted our food comp by approximately 150 basis points, as well as unseasonably warm weather in the back half of the quarter. 
Comp sales increased 1.2%, driven by 0.7% increase in customer traffic. On a 2-year stack basis, comp traffic was up 2.4%, which was relatively consistent with the first 2 quarters of the year. E-commerce contributed approximately 50 basis points to the segment comp, which was an acceleration from the second quarter. Also, all store formats had positive comp sales, including Neighborhood Markets, which delivered comp sales growth of approximately 5.2%. 
Gross margin increased 32 basis points. Savings from procuring merchandise contributed to margin rate improvement in general merchandise, food and consumables. In addition, transportation-related fuel cost savings favorably impacted results. These factors which reduce cost of goods sold were partially offset by the continued implementation of our multiyear strategy of incremental price investment. 
Operating expenses increased 8.6%, primarily due to the previously announced associate wage rate increases, as well as investments in technology. In addition, we lapped the lease accounting adjustment that I mentioned earlier, which benefited last year's U.S. third quarter results. As a result, operating income declined 11.3% for the quarter. Excluding last year's lease accounting adjustment, operating income would have declined 9.8%. 
We continue to do a good job with inventory while maintaining high in-stock levels. In the third quarter, inventory declined 2%, with comp store inventory down approximately 6%. 
We continue to execute our plan and are making good progress delivering a better experience for our customers. We're pleased with the underlying momentum in the business and feel good about our plans for the fourth quarter. We're well-positioned for holiday with newness, exciting gift items and EDLP throughout the assortment. 
All the pieces are in place to ensure a great shopping experience in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of between 1% and 1.5%. 
Now let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International continues to deliver solid results. This quarter, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 7 of those markets grew comps by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way with comp sales growth of 7%, representing a 2-year comp growth of nearly 13%. Our positive comp sales trend again this quarter is a continuation of what we have seen over the last several years. We will continue to focus on driving growth through our fresh offering, expanding online grocery and private brands. 
With that, let's discuss International's overall results. Net sales grew 2.4% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 4.8% due to a $2.1 billion currency impact. Operating income increased 11.2% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, operating income increased 1.2%. In the quarter, there was a gain from the sale of several shopping malls in Chile. Also recall that in the third quarter last year, we had a favorable impact from a lease accounting adjustment. Excluding both of these items, operating income increased 9.4% on a constant currency basis. We expect a similar gain in the fourth quarter reflecting the completion of the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile. 
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of our key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Additionally, the results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. 
Let's begin with Walmex, which released its earnings on October 25. Keep in mind that Walmex releases results under IFRS and that the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP; therefore, some results may differ. 
The positive momentum in the business continued across all formats, divisions and countries. Comp sales for Walmex increased 7% in the quarter and total sales increased nearly 9%. In Mexico, comp sales increased 7.3% and continued to outpace the rest of the self-service market, according to ANTAD. In addition, Walmex did a good job managing inventory, which grew at a slower rate than its sales growth. 
In Canada, net sales increased 3.3% and comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for 10 consecutive quarters. And according to Nielsen, we continue to gain market share in food and consumables and health and wellness. Our cost analytics program continues in helping drive down cost of goods, allowing us to invest in price. In Canada, we also reduced inventory levels even as sales increased. 
Turning to the U.K. Net sales declined 3.8% and comp sales declined 5.8% in the third quarter. The key priority remains driving an improved customer experience and building sales momentum by simplifying the offer, improving product availability and making strategic investments in service and price. We are moving with pace as we address our customer value proposition in the market. 
In China, net sales grew 4.2% and comp sales increased 1.6% this quarter. The key drivers of the performance were strong seasonal and festive categories during the Mid-Autumn Festival and a strong performance in fresh categories, an ongoing focus area for us in China. As Doug mentioned, through our recent alliance with JD.com, we continue to offer exciting new ways for customers to access high-quality products from around the world. It was another solid performance for Walmart International. 
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. Excluding fuel, net sales and comp sales increased 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively, and membership income grew by 2.3%. Market deflation, primarily in food, negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 110 basis points versus last year. E-commerce performed well and contributed approximately 60 basis points to the comp growth. 
Operating income, including fuel, declined year-over-year by approximately 27%, primarily as a result of an increase in operating expenses, including planned investments in people and technology, as well as fuel profit and lapping last year's lease accounting benefit. Excluding fuel and the lease-related benefit, segment income decreased approximately 18%. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter for the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect comp sales growth, excluding fuel, to be in a range of 1% to 1.5%. 
With that, let's discuss our fourth quarter and full year EPS guidance. We are increasing the bottom end of our full year adjusted EPS guidance, resulting in a new range of $4.20 to $4.35. As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14 noncash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com in the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, our full year EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.34 to $4.49. The updated guidance assumes that the full year effective tax rate will be between 31% and 32%, as well as currency exchange rates remaining at current levels. 
In closing, we're pleased with our progress in the business and the positive momentum we're seeing. We're excited for the holidays. 
Thank you for joining our call today, and we wish each of you a happy and healthy holiday season."

I'll discuss the details in a minute, but I'd like to start about thanking everyone who came to Bentonville for our investment community meeting in October. We enjoyed giving you an update on our plans going forward. 
We have a strong company. We're executing well in our stores and making strategic investments in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster to better serve our customers every day. 
When we were together last month, I outlined 4 priorities: Make everyday easier for busy families, operate with discipline, be the most trusted retailer and deliver results and position the company to win. By executing on these priorities, the customer and our shareholders will benefit. 
To start, I'd like to highlight some recent developments in e-commerce that demonstrate how we're moving faster and making everyday easier for busy families. First, we're excited to see Walmart.com gaining traction. From a marketplace perspective, we're scaling fast, adding 8 million SKUs over the last 3 months alone. 
E-commerce contributed 50 basis points to our Q3 Walmart U.S. comp, which is our largest contribution yet. It's great to see an improving e-commerce business complement the momentum we have in our stores. 
Next, we recently completed the acquisition of Jet.com, and we're excited to have Marc Lore as a member of our leadership team driving U.S. e-commerce for Walmart and Jet.com. One of the reasons that Jet.com makes sense for Walmart is the common ground we share with basket economics. Walmart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket of goods, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest-cost basket online. When customers build a bigger basket online, the economics work in their favor and in ours. 
Marc has hit the ground running since the acquisition was finalized. We immediately set up teams to accelerate our integration efforts, and we're working hard to leverage our strengths, such as optimizing our combined fulfillment networks, utilizing our scale in areas like shipping, sharing our assortment and leveraging the strengths of our marketing teams. We're excited to reap the benefits of our combined businesses, and we look forward to updating you on our progress going forward. 
I'm also excited by how we positioned our business in China to win. We continue to be pleased with how our alliance with JD.com allows us to reach even more customers with our brands. We recently announced we own roughly 10% of JD.com's shares. And during my visit a few weeks ago, we jointly launched 2 new services. 
Our Sam's Club flagship store launched on JD's website, providing hundreds of millions of customers access to Sam's Club's premium products with JD's same-day and next-day delivery service. 
We also announced an exclusive Walmart Global import store on JD.Com Worldwide, the company's cross-border platform. The new store provides Chinese consumers access to Walmart's selection of thousands of products imported from Walmart stores around the world. We're working together with them to create a seamless shopping experience. 
I was able to visit the JD home office when I was in China last month, and it was clear that they work with speed and the spirit of innovation is strong. When I was in one of our Walmart hypermarkets in Beijing, JD already had a site set up for picking and delivering customer orders. 
We also announced an investment in New Dada, China's largest local on-demand logistics and grocery online to off-line, or O2O, seamless e-commerce platform. Already, New Dada is enabling 2-hour delivery service from more than 45 Walmart locations. 
It's amazing to see how O2O is changing how Chinese consumers shop. Densely populated cities and favorable delivery economics enable 2-hour delivery, and we look to expand the number of locations using New Dada for 2-hour delivery going forward. 
We're moving faster to position the company to win, and we're doing this from a position of increasing strength. 
Now I'd like to move to our third quarter results, where we delivered another solid quarter with earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding the $2.1 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $120.3 billion, an increase of 2.5% over last year. Comp store sales grew 1.2% in Walmart U.S, driven by a traffic increase of 0.7%. 
Greg Foran, our U.S. leadership team and our associates continue to execute our plan to win, and it's working. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve, and the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. Comp store inventory was down approximately 6%, and in-stock levels are up. 
We also continued to show progress in e-commerce. On a constant currency basis, global e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8%, respectively. U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets, driven by our marketplace offering, as I mentioned earlier, as well as a contribution from Jet.com. 
We continue to roll out online grocery and grow our pick-up business in stores and clubs. We're making progress giving our customers the seamless shopping experience they are looking for. 
Dave Cheesewright and the International team delivered another solid performance in the quarter, growing sales in constant currency 2.4%. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales, and 7 of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way, and I'm pleased with the fact that our momentum is broad-based across formats and countries within Walmex. 
I'm pleased comps sales growth returned to positive territory in China. We continue to grow our basic stores and clubs in addition to the e-commerce initiatives I mentioned earlier. When I was in China, and in conjunction with the Walmart foundation, we were proud to launch the Walmart Food Safety and Collaboration Center in Beijing with an investment of $25 million from the company and our foundation. The goal of this center is to develop solutions to food safety that can be implemented across the global supply chain, so Chinese consumers can trust that the food they eat is safe and good for their families. China is clearly a strategic market for us, as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally, and we're moving with speed to position the business for success. 
In the U.K, we're making some progress, but our turnaround will take time. We're confident in our leadership team there and want to assure you we continue to address this market with urgency. 
We have a strong International business and are encouraged by our positive momentum. As we mentioned in October, we are shaping our portfolio, and we'll make appropriate adjustments if it strengthens the company. You've seen examples of this recently in Chile and Mexico. And we'll continue to evaluate and adjust when it's best. 
At Sam's Club, Roz and the team grew comp sales, excluding fuel, 1.4% and launched Scan & Go nationwide. Scan & Go is a mobile checkout and payment solution which lets members skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of the service, and we're excited about how it will improve our members' experience, making it easy to shop and save time. 
Whether it's transforming the way members shop or elevating the experience with exciting new merchandise, the initiatives we have underway position us to win. 
Overall, we're gearing up for the holidays, our busiest time of the year. And we'll be ready with great items at low prices to delight our customers. Here in the U.S., we'll have an expanded assortment online and available for pickup in addition to holiday helpers in stores to help speed customers through the checkout line. 
Finally, one of the goals we laid out for you in October was to be the most trusted retailer. Part of building that trust is not only helping customers save money and time, but helping them feel good about shopping at Walmart. We want them to be able to trust that the products they buy are good for their families, the planet and the people that made them. 
So earlier this month, we shared some new targets in sustainability, food and responsible sourcing. We've set new goals in the areas of waste, renewable energy and sustainable products, including food. Please check out our website to learn more. 
Customers have more transparency than ever before when they shop, and they expect us to lead in these areas, but they will also expect us to earn their trust, and we will. We're excited about this work and are committed to lead in what we believe is a new era of trust and transparency in retail. 
In summary overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making across our business. We have momentum, and we're moving faster. We have a plan to win, we're executing against it, and customers are responding favorably. 
Now I'll turn it over to Brett."

Last month at our investment community meeting, we updated investors on how we're transforming the company from a position of strength. 
I laid out the financial framework that will guide our decisions, focused on delivering strong, efficient growth, operating with discipline and strategic capital allocation. 
Growth going forward will focus more on comp sales, and we're investing to accelerate e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. with our acquisition of Jet.com and further scaling Walmart.com. We are moving with speed to drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
Let's turn to our third quarter results. We're pleased the results were in line with our expectations and showed continuing momentum in the business. Excluding currency impacts, each business segment delivered solid net sales growth, and e-commerce GMV and sales growth continued to accelerate. Keep in mind that the results included the operating impact of Jet.com for roughly half of the quarter, as well as the transaction cost, both of which were initially forecast to be in the fourth quarter. 
Total revenue, excluding an unfavorable $2.1 billion currency impact, increased 2.5% to $120.3 billion. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.7% to $118.2 billion. During the quarter, we added $2.7 billion in net sales on a constant currency basis, which brings year-to-date constant currency growth to nearly $10 billion. 
Walmart U.S. continued its solid top line performance, and it's clear that our focus on driving value and a better store experience is resonating with customers.  International delivered another solid quarter, with Walmex once again leading the way. Sam's Club comp sales were better than expected, and membership income again showed steady improvement. 
Third quarter EPS was $0.98 versus guidance of $0.90 to $1. There were a few items that impacted the results that were not anticipated in our guidance, but in total had a minimal impact. The primary items included a gain on the sale of certain shopping center assets in Chile, a tax benefit related to our agreement to sell the Suburbia business in Mexico, as well as the diluted impact from the earlier than expected completion of the Jet.com acquisition, including transaction costs. Also recall that last year, there was a $0.04 benefit to third quarter EPS due to a lease accounting adjustment. 
I'll provide more details about our operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce, where results have improved sequentially throughout the year. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8%, respectively, with even stronger growth in the U S. 
The continuing transition of the Yihaodian  e-commerce business in China disproportionately impacted the GMV growth rate versus the sales growth rate this quarter due to the mix of first party versus marketplace sales. Excluding Yihaodian in total, GMV increased 28.6%. 
E-commerce growth includes a benefit from the 6 weeks of Jet.com results in the quarter, but the GMV growth rate would still be greater than 20% when excluding this contribution. 
In the U.S. e-commerce business, we continue to make solid progress expanding marketplace. We're thrilled to have the Jet team on board, and we're moving quickly to accelerate growth. In addition, we're pleased with the progress we're making with online grocery. Customer count and basket size continued to outperform our expectations, and we've expanded the service to more than 100 U.S. markets. 
In China, we expect our broader presence on JD.com with the new Sam's Club flagship store and Walmart Global import store will accelerate growth. We're moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth. 
Now let's turn back to the broader business. Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 34 basis points, due primarily to improvements in the U.S. and International segments. As expected, total SG&A also increased primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology. We continue to make progress on working capital, driven primarily by continuing discipline in managing inventory and payables. We also had a cash flow benefit this quarter due to the application of new tax guidelines related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses. In total, we generated $12.2 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year compared to $6.8 billion in the first 9 months of last year. 
During this transformational time, a key priority remains using our financial strength to provide strong cash returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In the quarter, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased 19.6 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we have now returned $10.9 billion to shareholders. As of the end of the third quarter, we have utilized approximately $8.7 billion of the current $20 million share repurchase authorization. 
Let's now discuss the results for each of the operating segments in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. Overall, we're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. Sales and traffic increased again this quarter and customer experience scores improved. Walmart U.S. net sales increased 2.5% or more than $1.8 billion. This growth comes despite persistent market deflation of food, which negatively impacted our food comp by approximately 150 basis points, as well as unseasonably warm weather in the back half of the quarter. 
Comp sales increased 1.2%, driven by 0.7% increase in customer traffic. On a 2-year stack basis, comp traffic was up 2.4%, which was relatively consistent with the first 2 quarters of the year. E-commerce contributed approximately 50 basis points to the segment comp, which was an acceleration from the second quarter. Also, all store formats had positive comp sales, including Neighborhood Markets, which delivered comp sales growth of approximately 5.2%. 
Gross margin increased 32 basis points. Savings from procuring merchandise contributed to margin rate improvement in general merchandise, food and consumables. In addition, transportation-related fuel cost savings favorably impacted results. These factors which reduce cost of goods sold were partially offset by the continued implementation of our multiyear strategy of incremental price investment. 
Operating expenses increased 8.6%, primarily due to the previously announced associate wage rate increases, as well as investments in technology. In addition, we lapped the lease accounting adjustment that I mentioned earlier, which benefited last year's U.S. third quarter results. As a result, operating income declined 11.3% for the quarter. Excluding last year's lease accounting adjustment, operating income would have declined 9.8%. 
We continue to do a good job with inventory while maintaining high in-stock levels. In the third quarter, inventory declined 2%, with comp store inventory down approximately 6%. 
We continue to execute our plan and are making good progress delivering a better experience for our customers. We're pleased with the underlying momentum in the business and feel good about our plans for the fourth quarter. We're well-positioned for holiday with newness, exciting gift items and EDLP throughout the assortment. 
All the pieces are in place to ensure a great shopping experience in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of between 1% and 1.5%. 
Now let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International continues to deliver solid results. This quarter, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 7 of those markets grew comps by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way with comp sales growth of 7%, representing a 2-year comp growth of nearly 13%. Our positive comp sales trend again this quarter is a continuation of what we have seen over the last several years. We will continue to focus on driving growth through our fresh offering, expanding online grocery and private brands. 
With that, let's discuss International's overall results. Net sales grew 2.4% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 4.8% due to a $2.1 billion currency impact. Operating income increased 11.2% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, operating income increased 1.2%. In the quarter, there was a gain from the sale of several shopping malls in Chile. Also recall that in the third quarter last year, we had a favorable impact from a lease accounting adjustment. Excluding both of these items, operating income increased 9.4% on a constant currency basis. We expect a similar gain in the fourth quarter reflecting the completion of the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile. 
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of our key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Additionally, the results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. 
Let's begin with Walmex, which released its earnings on October 25. Keep in mind that Walmex releases results under IFRS and that the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP; therefore, some results may differ. 
The positive momentum in the business continued across all formats, divisions and countries. Comp sales for Walmex increased 7% in the quarter and total sales increased nearly 9%. In Mexico, comp sales increased 7.3% and continued to outpace the rest of the self-service market, according to ANTAD. In addition, Walmex did a good job managing inventory, which grew at a slower rate than its sales growth. 
In Canada, net sales increased 3.3% and comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for 10 consecutive quarters. And according to Nielsen, we continue to gain market share in food and consumables and health and wellness. Our cost analytics program continues in helping drive down cost of goods, allowing us to invest in price. In Canada, we also reduced inventory levels even as sales increased. 
Turning to the U.K. Net sales declined 3.8% and comp sales declined 5.8% in the third quarter. The key priority remains driving an improved customer experience and building sales momentum by simplifying the offer, improving product availability and making strategic investments in service and price. We are moving with pace as we address our customer value proposition in the market. 
In China, net sales grew 4.2% and comp sales increased 1.6% this quarter. The key drivers of the performance were strong seasonal and festive categories during the Mid-Autumn Festival and a strong performance in fresh categories, an ongoing focus area for us in China. As Doug mentioned, through our recent alliance with JD.com, we continue to offer exciting new ways for customers to access high-quality products from around the world. It was another solid performance for Walmart International. 
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. Excluding fuel, net sales and comp sales increased 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively, and membership income grew by 2.3%. Market deflation, primarily in food, negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 110 basis points versus last year. E-commerce performed well and contributed approximately 60 basis points to the comp growth. 
Operating income, including fuel, declined year-over-year by approximately 27%, primarily as a result of an increase in operating expenses, including planned investments in people and technology, as well as fuel profit and lapping last year's lease accounting benefit. Excluding fuel and the lease-related benefit, segment income decreased approximately 18%. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter for the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect comp sales growth, excluding fuel, to be in a range of 1% to 1.5%. 
With that, let's discuss our fourth quarter and full year EPS guidance. We are increasing the bottom end of our full year adjusted EPS guidance, resulting in a new range of $4.20 to $4.35. As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14 noncash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com in the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, our full year EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.34 to $4.49. The updated guidance assumes that the full year effective tax rate will be between 31% and 32%, as well as currency exchange rates remaining at current levels. 
In closing, we're pleased with our progress in the business and the positive momentum we're seeing. We're excited for the holidays. 
Thank you for joining our call today, and we wish each of you a happy and healthy holiday season."
