Good afternoon, and happy new year. With a doubt, this is a type of earnings call a CEO dreams about: reporting a great quarter, performing with operational excellence during the holiday shopping period, reporting a record earnings year, and from a shareholder perspective, producing a 47.8% total shareholder return for 2015, making TSYS the ninth best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the year. And of course, the icing on the cake is the announcement earlier today of the strategic and transformative acquisition of TransFirst, a leading U.S. acquirer of payment solutions. This will be the largest acquisition in our history at $2.35 billion. This is truly a watershed event for our company, team members and shareholders, and we are all very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We are also very pleased to have John Shlonsky, CEO of TransFirst, here with us this afternoon, and he, Paul and I will provide additional details on the strategic rationale for this new partnership and take questions a little later in our presentation. 
Before we get to that, I want to take a few minutes to call out some significant highlights for the quarter and for the year. The fourth quarter was our best quarter in our 33-year history. We produced record-setting transactions, authorizations and volumes. Holiday authorizations on same client basis were up 12.7% in North America and 10% in our International segment. We repurchased 3 million shares of our stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our total repurchases for the year to 5.2 million shares, for $242.1 million. These repurchases, coupled with dividends, represented a return in excess of 92% of our available free cash flow to shareholders in 2015, a 31% increase over last year. On the segment front, there are a few callouts I would like to mention. First is North America. The North America segment produced record revenues, operating income and transactions for the year. Our traditional accounts on file increased 37% on a year-over-year quarter basis, and we ended the year with $654.1 million total accounts on file. Our EMV chip card production soared in the fourth quarter, increasing over 400% over the fourth quarter of 2014. All in all, it was another exceptional quarter for our North America segment. 
Turning our attention to the International segment, perhaps the biggest achievement for the International segment was the attainment of its 4 year goal to achieve a minimum 18% margin by year-end 2015. We ended the year at 18.1%. The outstanding 24.5% fourth quarter margin was a catalyst to achieving our goal. We are very proud of the team for their relentless focus and determination to reach this very important goal by year-end. On the business development front in the International segment, we signed a letter of intent to provide processing solutions in 2 regional markets in Latin America. This processing will be performed in Brazil, generating scale by leveraging our platform investment that currently supports the market-leading retail cards business of Carrefour. 
As we move to merchant, a few quick callouts. For the quarter, direct revenue increased 15.4% and indirect revenue increased 10.4%. The excellent fourth quarter helped propel overall revenue growth for the segment of 8.8% for the year. Continued momentum in our ISV channel, new product offerings like our Blue, improved sales productivity and EMV terminal activity all contributed to our strong growth for the quarter. And lastly, a few important comments about NetSpend. NetSpend produced its 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth of 20.9%. We were successful in introducing our payroll, incentive and disbursement cards program within Capital One, the 10th largest bank in the United States. Also during the quarter, we expanded our products and our relationship with both Rite Aid and Walmart. 
All in all, it was good execution and performance by all segments in the fourth quarter, providing a good foundation and momentum as we move into 2016. After today's announcement, our reach and distribution uniquely positions us to provide innovative products and solutions that our clients and customers need to adapt to the evolving payment landscape. Now is our moment to unlock these opportunities in payments and continue to deliver strong results for TSYS, our customers and our shareholders. 
I'll now ask Paul Todd to provide additional detailed financial information in our quarter, the year-end and review our guidance for 2016. Paul?"
308973,320953462,921162,"Total System Services, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Total System Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Troy, and before we review the transaction we are announcing today, I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the performance of the company this year specifically related to the achievement of our strategic and financial goals on an in",2777,"Thank you, Troy, and before we review the transaction we are announcing today, I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the performance of the company this year specifically related to the achievement of our strategic and financial goals on an individual segment and corporate basis. Each of our segments performed better than we expected when we started the year and provide us with a good launching pad as we enter 2016. I want to point out at the start that any guidance or expectations I give regarding segment, our consolidated performance for '16 does not include the transaction we have announced today. 
Now digging into the results starting on Slide 7, at the consolidated level, our revenue before reimbursables increased 13.3% for the quarter, resulting in a 4-year [ph] increase for 2015 of 14%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $195 million, and $833.9 million for the year representing a year-over-year increase of $121.7 million or 17.1%. Finally, on adjusted EPS from continuing operations, the $0.57 for the quarter allowed for $2.46 adjusted EPS on a yearly basis, which represent a 25.5% increase from prior year and in line with our guidance range we provided last quarter of $2.43 to $2.47. This EPS performance was driven by the fantastic results from our segments, the tax benefits that I mentioned last quarter, as well as other drivers. On a comparative basis for the quarter, the $0.01 decline from last year was primarily due to a onetime item in 4Q of '14 in our international segment, higher incentive compensation in 2015 versus 2014 and strategic investments in NetSpend, among other items. 
Before I leave the consolidated financial highlights, I want to point out that our quarterly revenue growth of 13.3% and the yearly revenue growth of 14% is all organic and was driven by cross-segment organic performance across our businesses throughout the year. And our ability to take that revenue growth to the bottom line we've seen in our margin expansion for the year. This combination of pure organic revenue growth with margin expansion is a key takeaway from our 2015 consolidated results.  Now to explain our results in more detail, let's turn to Slide 9, and I will cover our North America segment first. The key headline on the North America segment is the same as it has been all year, and that is mid-to-high teen organic revenue growth. Revenue before reimbursables for the segment was up 17.5% for the quarter to $300.3 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. As you can see on the chart, the business has had an impressive string of positive revenue growth and the 20.2% organic revenue growth for the year is the highest yearly revenue growth for this business since 1999. We have started the year expecting this business to grow in the mid-teen range of organic growth, so the 20.2% growth level exceeded our expectations for the year, which was largely driven by the successful conversion of a large client and better organic growth with our customers. Also, contributing was the growth in our core offerings as well as other services to include fraud, loyalty, card production and managed services. We began the year expecting this revenue growth to be achieved at roughly the same margin levels that we saw in 2014 but to perform at a tighter quarterly band, and that's exactly what happened in 2015. Segment margin expanded from 36.8% in 2014 to 37.4% in 2015. 
On the volume front, total accounts on file for the quarter increased 18.9% with our traditional accounts on file increasing 37.3%, taking us to an all-time high of $415 million traditional accounts on file. I mentioned on our last call that the total accounts on file will start showing some declines due to the previously announced de-conversions of RushCard and Green Dot. This is why we continue to discuss the traditional accounts on file metric, which excludes prepaid, government services and single-use accounts that can vary substantially and unless correlated to revenue.  We couldn't be more pleased with the performance of this North American segment both on a quarterly and full year basis. The business is positioned well for 2016 as we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for this segment in 2016 with slightly expanding margins. 
Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on Slide 10, where the key headline, as Troy discussed, is the achievement of a full year margin of 18.1%. We announced this as a target 4 years ago, and the management team in this segment has had a laser-focus to not only improve margins but to enhance the business model as well, and we are proud of this achievement. Segment revenue for the quarter was $87.1 million, down 6.2% on a reported basis and down 0.6% on a constant currency basis. I highlighted in our third quarter call that the last 6 quarters of solid constant currency revenue growth would likely not continue in the fourth quarter due to a onetime item in the fourth quarter of 2014 that provides a challenging grow over compression. Excluding the impact of this onetime item, constant currency revenue was up 6.3% which is a better reflection of the performance of the segment. The revenue growth for the quarter was again fueled by the 4 new clients we converted since 2014, and these new clients, coupled with our existing client base, are outperforming the market. And as we mentioned on previous calls, they are lifting the segment from being a roughly flat constant currency growth picture to one of low to mid-single digits. 
On the margin front, I called out on our last call that we expected the margin to decline in the fourth quarter from fourth quarter 2014 levels due to the onetime item in 4Q in '14 that I mentioned earlier. And from a volume perspective, accounts on file grew $11.9 million compared to the same quarter of last year, over half of which was due to new clients. This means we continue to break records for the number of accounts processed in this segment now standing at $78.5 million accounts on file. I would like to emphasize again that most of this growth is in commercial card and single-use accounts. As in previous quarters, we also experienced significant growth in the debit portfolios we process. The segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth with same client transactions growing by 6.7%.  In summary, on international, we're pleased with the continued execution of margin improvement, coupled with a steady constant currency revenue growth picture, and for 2016 for this segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth in the flat to low single-digit range, with a slightly improving margin picture. 
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 11, where the key headlines for the segment is organic growth driven by both lines of business shifting their direct line of business from being a headwind to finally being a tailwind for this segment during the quarter. The split in our revenue mix is now 61% direct and 39% indirect. Revenue in the direct line of business increased 15.4% for the quarter from last year with SBS sales volume also experiencing double-digit growth of 11.3% for the quarter. On the indirect side, we continue to retain our core customers renewing  2 of our top 25 this quarter, while also bringing on new customers signing 2 new full service agreements during the quarter. A key takeaway is that we achieved positive growth in our direct business for the quarter and year, and that is a major accomplishment for the side of the business given the pressures it has had over the last several years. Segment margins declined 210 basis points for the fourth quarter due to some onetime expenses we chose to make around efficiency improvement in this segment. Overall, it was a strong quarter and year for the Merchant segment, and we are well-positioned on this front to capture more market share in the future and expect that 2016 revenue growth for this segment to be in the mid-single-digit range for the year with slightly improving margins from 2015 levels. 
Now I want to talk about the fantastic performance of the NetSpend segment starting on Slide 12. The highlight for the segment is the 20.9% organic revenue growth for the quarter, bringing the overall revenue growth of NetSpend for the year over the 20% mark at 20.2%. The strength in NetSpend's organic growth is derived from a combination of its winning management team, coupled with market differentiated channel offerings and excellent strategic execution to produce these outstanding results in this competitive and fast-moving sector of the payments industry. While this business outperformed our revenue growth expectations, we did comment this time last year that we would invest in our business for growth that could cause some margin pressure, and that's exactly what happened in our fourth quarter with our quarterly adjusted operating margin of 19.9%, delivering a yearly margin of 23.7%, which is down from the 26.6% in 2014. I want to point out that these are investment cycle decisions that we're glad to make to support the business growth, and we will continue to make these decisions on a go-forward basis as long as we see the line of sight path to growth. 
The volume growth behind these results is equally as impressive. We saw 17.7% growth in our direct deposit active cards to $1.9 million for the quarter. We finished the quarter with $5.7 billion in GDV, up 21.3%. While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we also constantly focus on expanding our distribution reach by adding approximately 7,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 96,000. One of the most noteworthy contributors to the fourth quarter increase in distributing locations and employers was our launch in Rite Aid stores, a multiyear distribution relationship that we signed last quarter.  Overall, 2015 was a banner year for NetSpend. Our expectation right now for this business is for the revenue growth for 2016 to be in the low double-digit growth range on a full year basis, with a slightly expanding margin, although we could choose to make investment decisions for growth later in the year in '16 as we did this year that could impact margin. 
Turning back to the consolidated results on Slide 13, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 23.4%, and we finished the year with an adjusted operating margin of 26.7% as seen on Page 14, which was primarily fueled by the improving year-over-year margins in 3 of our 4 segments. This consolidated margin falls into the range that we anticipated at the beginning of the year, and we expect the consolidated operating margin in 2016 to slightly improve from this current level. I want to state that Slides 13 and 14 provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, NetSpend M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. 
Now let's talk about our cash position for moment. We ended the year with $389 million in cash, a $59 million decrease from the third quarter of last year. Our largest cash outflow of $159 million was related to our stock repurchase with the mix being $67 million of CapEx, of which about 12%which  related to contract acquisition costs, with 27% related to property and equipment, and the remaining 61% being related to internally developed and licensed software. 
On cash flow on Slide 16, our free cash flow for the quarter was $72.5 million, resulting in a full year free cash flow of $397 million and slightly below the $420 million to $440 million we have projected. But as I said on our last call, we had some decisions that we made regarding CapEx in the fourth quarter that were good for the business long-term so we made them. For 2016, we expect our capital expenditures to be in a similar range as 2015 levels, and we estimate that free cash flow will be in the $470 million to $500 million range for the full year of 2016, an approximate increase of 18% to 26% from 2015 levels. This growing level of free cash flow is another strong indicator of the health of the business and ability of our businesses to generate strong free cash flow. As it relates to shares, as Troy mentioned, we repurchased 3 million shares for $158.6 million during the quarter, which resulted in a total amount of shares repurchased in 2015 of $5.2 million. As a result, we ended the year with $182.8 million of common shares outstanding, with the average basic weighted shares outstanding at $184.1 million. On taxes, we ended the year at an effective tax rate of 29.9%, which was about 300 basis points better than we expected at the start of the year, and we believe our estimated tax rate for 2016 to return to the more historical range of 32% to 34%. I want to point out that this 300 basis point increase in tax rate change in 2016 expected levels from 2015 levels is the main drivers to why our expected adjusted EPS growth rate is not in the same range as the expected growth rate and adjusted EBITDA or operating income. 
And speaking of 2016, as it relates to guidance on Page 17, we highlight our full year consolidated guidance of total revenue growth of 46% [ph] revenues before reimbursables growth, 4% to 7%; and adjusted EPS from continuing operations, of 4% [ph] to 7% [ph] growth. We also expect consolidated adjusted margin to increase by approximately 100 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin to increase by approximately 100 basis points. Obviously, this guidance hinges upon the assumptions I've already mentioned and the ones mentioned on Page 44 in the presentation. And I want to highlight that this guidance reflects the excellent operating leverage we continue to get as you remove the 300 basis point increase in our tax line, you see the growth from the bottom line exceeding our revenue growth by several percentage points. Also, this expected margin expansion is driven by expanding margins in all our businesses continuing the trend of cross-segment delivery of performance we saw in 2015. 
And finally, I want to mention some full year callouts that I think are key takeaways from today. The first callout is on organic growth. The fourth quarter was similar to the third quarter, and that with no acquisitions completed during the quarter, it allows for organic growth clarity in our results. When you look at the 17.5% quarterly revenue growth in North America, the constant currency revenue revenue growth net of onetime item comparisons in International, the 15% direct acquiring revenue growth in Merchant and the 20.9% revenue growth in NetSpend all coming from non-acquisition activity, you see a strong picture of organic revenue growth that played out throughout the year. While the overall organic growth number is strong, we're equally pleased with the cross segment delivery of organic growth that each of our businesses has delivered. The second major callout is on margins. Each of our 4 segments delivered margins that were either in excess or generally met are previously communicated expectations for the year. The margin profile of our segments are strong relative to their respective competitors and the ability to draw -- drive margin expansion or stability while also investing in the business was a big accomplishment for 2015. And the third and final callout is related to how the performance of 2015 positions us for 2016 and beyond. Our North American organic growth story, with a platform now of $415 million traditional accounts on file, our International margin progress, coupled now with the strengthening growth effort, our improving segment revenue picture in Merchant and strong double-digit revenue growth at NetSpend all delivered with competitively strong margins all at the same time paints a picture of TSYS that is unlike any in our history. It is a unique time for our company to have all business performing in the manner that our segments were performing, and specifically, we want to thank each and every team member from across the globe who work so hard to deliver the performance we have announced today.  Without their daily efforts and commitment, none of these would be possible. 
Now I want to turn it back over to Troy to discuss this exciting transaction that we announced today."

I'll provide some additional transaction details beginning on Slide 20. As all of you know, our intent over the past year or so has been to grow the scale and position of our Merchant business through accretive M&A. With the acquisition of TransFirst, we will have a winning combination of technology, scale and partner-centric distribution capabilities that propels us to a leadership position in the acquiring market. Importantly, TransFirst's focus on partner-centric, vertically specialized distribution will accelerate our growth within the highly attractive integrated payments space. Post-closing, this specific distribution model will comprise approximately 20% of the revenue of the combined businesses. Based on our analysis by First Annapolis Consulting, on a pro forma basis, this would make TSYS the third-largest integrated payment provider in the U.S. As I have said before, I believe the winners in Merchant acquiring will be the scale players with integrated capabilities and a diverse distribution network. This transaction with TransFirst strengthens our sales and distribution network, with the addition of over 1,300 partners and more than 350 sales professionals, enhancing our excess to high growth, strategically attractive vertical markets such as healthcare, B2B and not-for-profit. 
In addition to the many strategic benefits, the transaction is financially attractive for both an earnings and valuation perspective. We currently expect the transaction to be accretive in the low double digits to adjusted EPS for the first full year post closing. The transaction will be an all-cash transaction, with an implied multiple of 13.8x estimated 2016 adjusted EBITDA. 
On a pro forma basis, our balance sheet will continue to remain strong as our investment grade rating is important to us. We are confident that the combined valuation and synergies will drive material shareholder value. A contributing factor to these financial benefits is the size and attractive growth profile of the industry itself. As you can see, on Slide 21, the U.S. acquiring market is a very large market. It is the largest addressable market in which TSYS participates. A materially significant portion of the $13 billion addressable market is in small and medium-sized business  segment which represents approximately 75% of the total acquiring revenue pool. This segment of the market is currently and will continue to be our primary focus. 
The overall acquiring market is growing, almost twice the projected growth rate of U.S. GDP. Driving that attractive growth are e-commerce and integrated payments, which are growing at 10% and 12% respectively. This acquisition, coupled with our existing business, dramatically improves our competitive position within these 2 important areas, as you can see on Slide 22 how they will contribute to our Merchant transformation. At the end of the day, TSYS made it to enhance its Merchant business in order to remain competitive in the rapidly changing acquiring landscape. Today, with the acquisition of TransFirst, we are transforming our Merchant business to one which has a strong competitive position in high-growth areas of the market, a business mix where over 80% of the segment's revenue will come from direct acquiring and scale across all key metrics, Merchants, transactions and sales volume. Together, these attributes contribute to an improved growth profile and leadership position for the Merchant segment. We believe it is a strategic imperative to hold a leadership position in the markets in which we play. Slide 23 shows that this combination positions us as the sixth largest U.S. Merchant acquirer based on net revenue, with 3 strategically important benefits. One, an expanded sales distribution network; two, a stronger integrated payments channel; and three, enhanced bolt-on channel payments solutions. 
With this established leadership position in all of our businesses, we have created a strong, unique and balanced portfolio positioned across the payment spectrum as indicated on Slide 24. We have incredible strength in our issuer processing business, touching more than 700 million cardholders and 400 payment providers around the globe. Our market share reaches almost 40% of all credit cards in the United States, and we are the #1 provider of these services in the United States, in China, and #2 in Europe. Through our combination with TransFirst, we will serve as more than 645,000 Merchant outfits, process approximately 117 billion in annual volume and leverage over 2,300 distribution partners. In our NetSpend business, we are ranked #1 based on gross dollar volume and #2 based on revenue. 
TSYS now reaches several hundred banks, hundreds of thousands of businesses and millions of consumers. The scale, reach and distribution network we are creating positions us to serve as a single destination for unparalleled payment technologies and enhanced services to the constituents we serve in a space undergoing massive change. We are excited to have John and the TransFirst team on board, and are confident that through our combined talents, expertise and strengths, we will continue to win in the market. 
Now I would like to turn it over to John Shlonsky to make a few comments."

TransFirst has and still utilizes TSYS' front end, back end and gateway services. The combination of the 2 organizations makes perfect sense and gives us a strong leadership position in acquiring. I can tell you firsthand, our main interaction with TSYS and particularly with the exciting team makes me feel confident that our values and how we treat each other and our clients are firmly aligned. On Slide 26, let me tell you a little bit about TransFirst and how our value proposition will be further enhanced as part of TSYS. First, we operate a partner-centric model. This model enables us to gain access to a large number of SNB merchants in scalable and cost-effective manner. Joining TSYS will enable us to bring an even stronger solution to these partners. Second, we operate a single integrated platform. This platform actually evolved from our utilization of TSYS payment solutions. Our mission with TSYS is to leverage our joint capabilities and products to our customers in a seamless way so they can rely on just one provider for all their processing requirements. Third, it will be increasingly important to develop customized and user-friendly solutions that enable our Merchant customers to sell our products in the store, on the Internet or remotely to our mobile device on a platform. And lastly, all information used has been built around a single database. This really provides customers with a high level of technical and customer service and support. For example, we provide error-free boarding in minutes, automatic credit approval, one call resolution 85% of the time. We will strive to leverage best practices across both Merchant segment as we integrate these 2 already great companies. 
Slide 27 really illustrates how fortunate we are with this new partnership to have some businesses had that overlap and some that complement our total addressable market. This is of the clearest example of our go-to-market strategy. TransFirst goes to market with  2 distinct models, an integrated and a referral partnership model. Our integrated model is where partners really require more vertical expertise in technical specialization. Our referral partners will focus more on our service model and our product capabilities. Both of these models leverage our platform and our product set. Similar to TSYS, we work with financial institutions, trade associations, national business service providers to provide payments and solutions to their base and new Merchant customers. These solutions provide enhanced brand loyalty and revenue opportunities for all of our combined referral partners. TransFirst and TSYS will combine automation and technology to support an integrated platform that will seamlessly deliver relevant products and solution to our partners and merchants, not just process transactions. Our goal is for any merchant or any partner to have complete access to relevant and easy to use payment solutions. 
So on Slide 28, why are we so excited? This is a strong cultural fit. Both companies showed deep ethic of volumes in doing the right thing and treating people right with shared values around integrity, trust, innovation and partnerships, relationships. Ease of integration, the flexibility of TransFirst single platform that we developed working with TSYS technology will allow for this easier transition. Our enhanced offerings by leveraging each other's strengths will allow us to bring best-in-class products and solutions to all of our partners and merchants. And most importantly, really foster a holistic growth. On this transaction will provide TSYS significant scale and strength across Asian processing, Merchant Serivces and prepaid program management. 
We're very, very happy about this partnership. We have some work to do but couldn't be more excited to merge these 2 great organizations. I would now like to turn it back over to Paul."

At closing on a pro forma basis, we will have approximately $3.8 billion of debt and pro forma leverage for our company is expected to be approximately 3.9x debt to trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA. The strong cash flow generation of the business allows us to get back to our long-term target leverage ratio of the low- to mid-2s within 24 months of closing. We will limit our share buyback and acquisition activity during this period until we achieve our more targeted leverage ratios, and we are committed to our investment grade rating. We're excited about the leadership of John and his team as they will be able to expand upon the great results we talked about from our Merchant segment earlier. We're also excited about the expense synergy opportunity from the efficiencies we can realize in our combined businesses. As such, we currently estimate we would generate at least $15 million of cost synergies in calendar year 2017, with that almost doubling to the range of $25 million to $30 million in calendar year 2018. And as I said, we expect to be able to produce low double-digit adjusted EPS accretion in the first 12 months after close net of onetime related expenses with $5 million of synergies and move to the mid to high double-digit range over the longer term as larger synergies are captured over time. This also does not reflect the anticipated revenue synergies that we believe are attainable from this new payments platform company. This new combined Merchant segment will be able to work with our strong issuer processing business, specifically with the bank referral partner business of TransFirst, and with NetSpend specifically with their PayCard business. While these revenue synergies may take some time to materialize given the strong organic growth nature of each of these businesses on their own, there clearly is an opportunity set of revenue growth here that we expect to achieve. And this is a unique combination of capabilities and payments for one company to leverage. 
Given the strong historical track record of non-acquisition fueled organic growth from TransFirst, coupled with our Merchant segment's embedded organic growth capabilities and the overall organic growth of TSYS, we believe the combined organic growth profile of the company will be improved and will be unique in the payments industry as to its balance and diversification of payments-related growth. While we provided revenue before reimbursable guidance today in the 5% to 7% range all organically, we expect the combination of TransFirst's historically organic double-digit organic growth to improve TSYS' revenue growth profile by approximately 100 basis points annually on a pro forma basis. After closing, we are allowed to see come back and revise our 2016 guidance to reflect the positive impact we expect this combination to have on our 2016 financial results. 
Now on Slide 31, I hope you can see why this acquisition is so compelling as it establishes TSYS as a clear leader in this highly attractive market, accelerating our growth in integrated payments and strengthening our partnership distribution capabilities. These, coupled with the expected financial benefits I just reviewed and under John's leadership, signal that we have completed another step in fulfilling our strategic vision of being the leading global payments solutions provider. 
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

So it's kind a combination of factors, but the strongest factor was the organic growth of the processing customers that are in that indirect side of the business. And as it relates to margins, I think as it relates '16 margins, I commented on the prepared remarks on all the different segment margins that we are expecting yearly margins to increase slightly in each one of our segments and certainly would address the North America segment margin story. I think as I also commented as it relates to fourth quarter margin, we did see given the banner years that we had, really all of the segments in the fourth quarter, we did have some incentive compensation and some pay relative to the team members delivering this great performance that impacted the fourth quarter margin. But I think the bigger story that you want to take away from a margin standpoint is strong margins, certainly in North America, and we see that margin picture expanding in 2016."

And as I said, about our margin expanding on a year-over-year basis between '15 and '16 for NetSpend, obviously there is a higher expense base that's already now built into the 2015 numbers related to that higher level of marketing spend. So we'll continue to look at that as we progress in '16. We expect, as I said, the margin to expand in '16. But also said if an opportunity presents itself like it did this year in the latter part of '16 for us to invest for future growth in this business, we may make that decision. I think I'd point out that that's one of the benefits of having strong businesses altogether inside at TSYS is we're able to make decisions around pro growth things that on one specific segment might depress a segment margin. But on the overall basis, we're still very margin strong. And so that's exactly the situation that we had with NetSpend.

And I think it's important to point out that this is a growth-based acquisition. It is not an acquisition where it's around kind of making the financials work due to expense cuts. The TransFirst historical organic growth model is a double-digit organic growth model and what we now have in our Merchant business also is primed for by strong organic growth and so, including these businesses together, we want to make sure that we are maximizing that organic growth capabilities while also, obviously, taking the expense synergies that are available to take. As it relates to platform, there is platform synergies today because the TransFirst business is already using predominantly, our front end platform. So it isn't like typical acquisition. Sometimes we have 2 different platforms and you're kind of shutting down 1 platform to get the lion's share of the synergy, but instead one, we're trying to make sure we maximize the efficiencies while not trying to hurt the revenue growth trajectory. And so this is the synergy on the surface might look relatively smaller compared to maybe some other things that you compare it against.

Number two, I think John touched on this in his prepared remarks that there are some overlaps, but there are also some complementary areas in his business. But I think one of the things that we find strengthening to us, it is a very strong in the FI side, and as you know, we're very strong on the FI side of the issuing. So we see that as a complement. We both were in the ISP business. Ours began approximately a year ago on a de novo basis. As we've indicated earlier, John is pushing 30% of his revenues in that space. So I think over the next 60 to 90 days, we obviously will have to take some real quality time to understand all of our go-to-market dynamics as we look at our sales force, his sales force, his partners and our partners.

So it's not one of those situations where we're providing a trade-off where you happen to not invest on the growth side because you got some higher synergy number to try to kind of make deal economics. That's one of the beauties of this transaction is the high accretive nature of the transaction without having to have a very high synergy number that can then cost you on the growth side because you happen to chase the synergies on the expense side and starve the growth profile.  So with that kind of being the overall wrapper, that's the machination of how we got to those relevant amounts. But in general, I'd say, that, obviously, we'll be investing on the higher growth side of the business, which John has done in his business, and we've been doing in our business around the integrated side, the e-commerce side and those differentiated distribution capabilities in high-growth verticals.

Good afternoon, and happy new year. Without a doubt, this is a type of earnings call a CEO dreams about: reporting a great quarter, performing with operational excellence during the holiday shopping period, reporting a record earnings year and, from a shareholder perspective, producing a 47.8% total shareholder return for 2015, making TSYS the ninth best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the year. And of course, the icing on the cake is the announcement earlier today of the strategic and transformative acquisition of TransFirst, a leading U.S. acquirer of payment solutions. This will be the largest acquisition in our history at $2.35 billion. This is truly a watershed event for our company, team members and shareholders, and we are all very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We are also very pleased to have John Shlonsky, CEO of TransFirst, here with us this afternoon. And he, Paul and I will provide additional details on the strategic rationale for this new partnership and take questions a little later in our presentation. 
Before we get to that, I want to take a few minutes to call out some significant highlights for the quarter and for the year. The fourth quarter was our best quarter in our 33-year history. We produced record-setting transactions, authorizations and volumes. Holiday authorizations on same-client basis were up 12.7% in North America and 10% in our International segment. We repurchased 3 million shares of our stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our total repurchases for the year to 5.2 million shares for $242.1 million. These repurchases, coupled with dividends, represented a return in excess of 92% of our available free cash flow to shareholders in 2015, a 31% increase over last year. 
On the segment front, there are a few callouts I would like to mention. First is North America. The North America segment produced record revenues, operating income and transactions for the year. Our traditional accounts on file increased 37% on a year-over-year quarter basis, and we ended the year with $654.1 million total accounts on file. Our EMV chip card production soared in the fourth quarter, increasing over 400% over the fourth quarter of 2014. All in all, it was another exceptional quarter for our North America segment. 
Turning our attention to the International segment. Perhaps the biggest achievement for the International segment was the attainment of its 4-year goal to achieve a minimum 18% margin by year-end 2015. We ended the year at 18.1%. The outstanding 24.5% fourth quarter margin was a catalyst to achieving our goal. We are very proud of the team for their relentless focus and determination to reach this very important goal by year-end. 
On the business development front in the International segment, we signed a letter of intent to provide processing solutions in 2 regional markets in Latin America. This processing will be performed in Brazil, generating scale by leveraging our platform investment that currently supports the market-leading retail cards business of Carrefour. 
As we move to Merchant, a few quick callouts. For the quarter, direct revenue increased 15.4% and indirect revenue increased 10.4%. The excellent fourth quarter helped propel overall revenue growth for the segment of 8.8% for the year. Continued momentum in our ISV channel, new product offerings like OptBlue improved sales productivity, and EMV terminal activity all contributed to our strong growth for the quarter. 
And lastly, a few important comments about NetSpend. NetSpend produced its 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth of 20.9%. We were successful in introducing our payroll, incentive and disbursement cards program within Capital One, the 10th largest bank in the United States. Also during the quarter, we expanded our products and our relationship with both Rite Aid and Walmart. 
All in all, it was good execution and performance by all segments in the fourth quarter, providing a good foundation and momentum as we move into 2016. After today's announcement, our reach and distribution uniquely positions us to provide innovative products and solutions that our clients and customers need to adapt to the evolving payment landscape. Now is our moment to unlock these opportunities in payments and continue to deliver strong results for TSYS, our customers and our shareholders. 
I'll now ask Paul Todd to provide additional detailed financial information on our quarter, the year-end and review our guidance for 2016. Paul?"

Each of our segments performed better than we expected when we started the year and provide us with a good launching pad as we entered 2016. I want to point out at the start that any guidance or expectations I give regarding segment, our consolidated performance for '16 does not include the transaction we have announced today. 
Now digging into the results, starting on Slide 7. At the consolidated level, our revenue before reimbursables increased 13.3% for the quarter, resulting in a full year increase for 2015 of 14%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $195 million and $833.9 million for the year, representing a year-over-year increase of $121.7 million or 17.1%. 
Finally, on an adjusted EPS from continuing operations, the $0.57 for the quarter allowed for $2.46 adjusted EPS on a yearly basis, which represents a 25.5% increase from prior year and in line with our guidance range we provided last quarter of $2.43 to $2.47. This EPS performance was driven by the fantastic results from our segments, the tax benefits that I mentioned last quarter as well as other drivers. On a comparative basis for the quarter, the $0.01 decline from last year was primarily due to a onetime item in 4Q of '14 in our International segment, higher incentive compensation in 2015 versus 2014 and strategic investments in NetSpend, among other items. 
Before I leave the consolidated financial highlights, I want to point out that our quarterly revenue growth of 13.3% and the yearly revenue growth of 14% is all organic and was driven by cross-segment organic performance across our businesses throughout the year, and our ability to take that revenue growth to the bottom line was seen in our margin expansion for the year. This combination of pure organic revenue growth with margin expansion is a key takeaway from our 2015 consolidated results.  
Now to explain our results in more detail, let's turn to Slide 9 and I will cover our North America segment first. The key headline on the North America segment is the same as it has been all year, and that is mid- to high-teen organic revenue growth. Revenue before reimbursables for the segment was up 17.5% for the quarter to $300.3 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. As you can see on the chart, the business has had an impressive string of positive revenue growth and the 20.2% organic revenue growth for the year is the highest yearly revenue growth for this business since 1999. We have started the year expecting this business to grow in the mid-teen range of organic growth, so the 20.2% growth level exceeded our expectations for the year, which was largely driven by the successful conversion of a large client and better organic growth with our customers. Also contributing was the growth in our core offerings as well as other services to include fraud, loyalty, card production and managed services. We began the year expecting this revenue growth to be achieved at roughly the same margin levels that we saw in 2014 but to perform in a tighter quarterly band, and that's exactly what happened in 2015: Segment margin expanded from 36.8% in 2014 to 37.4% in 2015. 
On the volume front, total accounts on file for the quarter increased 18.9% with our traditional accounts on file increasing 37.3%, taking us to an all-time high of $415 million traditional accounts on file. I mentioned on our last call that the total accounts on file would start showing some declines due to the previously announced de-conversions of RushCard and Green Dot. This is why we continue to discuss the traditional accounts on file metric, which excludes prepaid, government services and single-use accounts that can vary substantially and are less correlated to revenue. We couldn't be more pleased with the performance of this North America segment both on a quarterly and full year basis. The business is positioned well for 2016 as we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for this segment in 2016 with slightly expanding margins. 
Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on Slide 10, where the key headline, as Troy discussed, is the achievement of a full year margin of 18.1%. We announced this as a target 4 years ago, and the management team in this segment has had a laser focus to not only improve margins but to enhance the business model as well, and we are proud of this achievement. 
Segment revenue for the quarter was $87.1 million, down 6.2% on a reported basis and down 0.6% on a constant-currency basis. I highlighted in our third quarter call that the last 6 quarters of solid constant-currency revenue growth would likely not continue in the fourth quarter due to a onetime item in the fourth quarter of 2014 that provides a challenging grow [ph] over comparison. Excluding the impact of this onetime item, constant-currency revenue was up 6.3%, which is a better reflection of the performance of the segment. The revenue growth for the quarter was, again, fueled by the 4 new clients we've converted since 2014. And these new clients, coupled with our existing client base, are outperforming the market. And as we mentioned on previous calls, they are lifting this segment from being a roughly flat constant-currency growth picture to one of low to mid-single digits. 
On the margin front, I called out on our last call that we expected the margin to decline in the fourth quarter from fourth quarter 2014 levels due to the onetime item in 4Q of '14 that I mentioned earlier. And from a volume perspective, accounts on file grew 11.9 million compared to the same quarter of last year, over half of which was due to new clients. This means we continue to break records for the number of accounts processed in this segment now standing at 78.5 million accounts on file. I would like to emphasize, again, that most of this growth is in commercial card and single-use accounts. As in previous quarters, we also experienced significant growth in the debit portfolios we process. The segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth with same-client transactions growing by 6.7%.  
In summary, on International, we're pleased with the continued execution of margin improvement, coupled with a steady constant-currency revenue growth picture, and for 2016 for this segment, we expect constant-currency revenue growth in the flat to low single-digit range, with a slightly improving margin picture. 
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 11, where the key headline for this segment is organic growth, driven by both lines of business shifting the indirect line of business from being a headwind to finally being a tailwind for this segment during the quarter. The split in our revenue mix is now 61% direct and 39% indirect. 
Revenue in the direct line of business increased 15.4% for the quarter from last year, with SBS sales volume also experiencing double-digit growth of 11.3% for the quarter. 
On the indirect side, we continue to retain our core customers, renewing 2 of our top 25 this quarter while also bringing on new customers signing 2 new full service agreements during the quarter. A key takeaway is that we achieved positive growth in our indirect business for the quarter and year, and that is a major accomplishment for this side of the business, given the pressures it has had over the last several years. Segment margins declined 210 basis points for the fourth quarter due to some onetime expenses we chose to make around efficiency improvement in this segment. 
Overall, it was a strong quarter and year for the Merchant segment, and we are well positioned on this front to capture more market share in the future and expect that 2016 revenue growth for this segment to be in the mid-single-digit range for the year with slightly improving margins from 2015 levels. 
Now I want to talk about the fantastic performance of the NetSpend segment, starting on Slide 12. The highlight for the segment is the 20.9% organic revenue growth for the quarter, bringing the overall revenue growth of NetSpend for the year over the 20% mark at 20.2%. The strength in NetSpend's organic growth is derived from a combination of its winning management team, coupled with market differentiated channel offerings and excellent strategic execution to produce these outstanding results in this competitive and fast-moving sector of the payments industry. While this business outperformed our revenue growth expectations, we did comment this time last year that we would invest in our business for growth that could cause some margin pressure, and that's exactly what happened in our fourth quarter with our quarterly adjusted operating margin of 19.9%, delivering a yearly margin of 23.7%, which is down from the 26.6% in 2014. I want to point out that these are investment cycle decisions that we're glad to make to support the business growth, and we will continue to make these decisions on a go-forward basis as long as we see the line-of-sight path to growth. 
The volume growth behind these results is equally as impressive. We saw a 17.7% growth in our direct deposit active cards to 1.9 million for the quarter. We finished the quarter with $5.7 billion in GDV, up 21.3%. While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we're also constantly focused on expanding our distribution reach by adding approximately 7,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 96,000. One of the most noteworthy contributors to the fourth quarter increase in distributing locations and employers was our launch in Rite Aid stores, a multiyear distribution relationship that we signed last quarter. 
Overall, 2015 was a banner year for NetSpend. Our expectation right now for this business is for the revenue growth for 2016 to be in the low double-digit growth range on a full year basis, with a slightly expanding margin, although we could choose to make investment decisions for growth later in the year in '16 as we did this year that could impact margin. 
Turning back to the consolidated results on Slide 13. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 23.4%, and we finished the year with an adjusted operating margin of 26.7% as seen on Page 14, which was primarily fueled by the improving year-over-year margins in 3 of our 4 segments. This consolidated margin falls into the range that we anticipated at the beginning of the year, and we expect the consolidated operating margin in 2016 to slightly improve from this current level. I want to state that Slides 13 and 14 provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, NetSpend M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. 
Now let's talk about our cash position for a moment. We ended the year at $389 million in cash, a $59 million decrease from the third quarter of last year. Our largest cash outflow of $159 million was related to our stock repurchase, with the next being about $67 million of CapEx, of which about 12% was related to contract acquisition costs, with 27% related to property and equipment and the remaining 61% being related to internally developed and licensed software. 
On cash flow on Slide 16, our free cash flow for the quarter was $72.5 million, resulting in a full year free cash flow of $397 million and slightly below the $420 million to $440 million we have projected. But as I said on our last call, we had some decisions that we made regarding CapEx in the fourth quarter that were good for the business long term so we made them. 
For 2016, we expect our capital expenditures to be in a similar range as 2015 levels, and we estimate that free cash flow will be in the $470 million to $500 million range for the full year of 2016, an approximate increase of 18% to 26% from 2015 levels. This growing level of free cash flow is another strong indicator of the health of the business and the ability of our businesses to generate strong free cash flow. 
As it relates to shares, as Troy mentioned, we repurchased 3 million shares for $158.6 million during the quarter, which resulted in the total amount of shares repurchased in 2015 of 5.2 million. As a result, we ended the year with 182.8 million of common shares outstanding, with the average basic weighted shares outstanding at 184.1 million. 
On taxes, we ended the year at an effective tax rate of 29.9%, which was about 300 basis points better than we expected at the start of the year, and we believe our estimated tax rate for 2016 to return to the more historical range of 32% to 34%. I want to point out that this 300 basis point increase in tax rate change in 2016 expected levels from 2015 levels is the main driver as to why our expected adjusted EPS growth rate is not in the same range as the expected growth rate and adjusted EBITDA or operating income. 
And speaking of 2016, as it relates to guidance on Page 17, we highlight our full year consolidated guidance of total revenue growth of 4% to 6%, revenues before reimbursables growth of 5% to 7% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of 4% to 7% growth. We also expect consolidated adjusted margin to increase by approximately 100 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin to increase by approximately 100 basis points. Obviously, this guidance hinges upon the assumptions I've already mentioned and the ones mentioned on Page 44 in the presentation. And I want to highlight that this guidance reflects the excellent operating leverage we continue to get. As [ph] if you remove the 300 basis point increase in our tax line, you see the growth from the bottom line exceeding our revenue growth by several percentage points. Also, this expected margin expansion is driven by expanding margins in all our businesses continuing the trend of cross-segment delivery of performance we saw in 2015. 
And finally, I want to mention some full year callouts that I think are key takeaways from today. The first callout is on organic growth. The fourth quarter was similar to the third quarter, and that with no acquisitions completed during the quarter, it allows for organic growth clarity in our results. When you look at the 17.5% quarterly revenue growth in North America, the constant-currency revenue growth net of onetime item comparisons in International, the 15% direct acquiring revenue growth in Merchant and the 20.9% revenue growth in NetSpend all coming from non-acquisition activity, you see a strong picture of organic revenue growth that played out throughout the year. While the overall organic growth number is strong, we're equally pleased with the cross-segment delivery of organic growth that each of our businesses has delivered. 
The second major callout is on margins. Each of our 4 segments delivered margins that were either in excess or generally met are previously communicated expectations for the year. The margin profile of our segments are strong relative to their respective competitors and the ability to draw -- drive margin expansion or stability while also investing in the business was a big accomplishment for 2015. And the third and final callout is related to how the performance of 2015 positions us for 2016 and beyond. Our North American organic growth story, with a platform now of 415 million traditional accounts on file, our International margin progress coupled now with the strengthening growth effort, our improving segment revenue picture in Merchant and strong double-digit revenue growth at NetSpend all delivered with competitively strong margins all at the same time paints a picture of TSYS that is unlike any in our history. It is a unique time for our company to have all businesses performing in the manner that our segments are performing, and specifically, we want to thank each and every team member from across the globe who worked so hard to deliver the performance we have announced today.  Without their daily efforts and commitment, none of these would be possible. 
Now I want to turn it back over to Troy to discuss this exciting transaction that we announced today."

I'll provide some additional transaction details beginning on Slide 20. As all of you know, our intent over the past year or so has been to grow the scale and position of our Merchant business through accretive M&A. With the acquisition of TransFirst, we will have a winning combination of technology, scale and partner-centric distribution capabilities that propels us to a leadership position in the acquiring market. Importantly, TransFirst's focus on partner-centric, vertically specialized distribution will accelerate our growth within the highly attractive integrated payments space. 
Post-closing, this specific distribution model will comprise approximately 20% of the revenue of the combined businesses. Based on an analysis by First Annapolis Consulting, on a pro forma basis, this would make TSYS the third largest integrated payments provider in the U.S. As I have said before, I believe the winners in Merchant acquiring will be the scale players with integrated capabilities and a diverse distribution network. This transaction with TransFirst strengthens our sales and distribution network, with the addition of over 1,300 partners and more than 350 sales professionals, enhancing our access to high growth, strategically attractive vertical markets such as health care, B2B and not-for-profit. 
In addition to the many strategic benefits, the transaction is financially attractive from both an earnings and valuation perspective. We currently expect the transaction to be accretive in the low double digits to adjusted EPS for the first full year post-closing. The transaction will be an all-cash transaction, with an implied multiple of 13.8x estimated 2016 adjusted EBITDA. 
On a pro forma basis, our balance sheet will continue to remain strong as our investment-grade rating is important to us. We are confident that the combined valuation and synergies will drive material shareholder value. A contributing factor to these financial benefits is the size and attractive growth profile of the industry itself. As you can see, on Slide 21, the U.S. acquiring market is a very large market. It is the largest addressable market in which TSYS participates. A materially significant portion of the $13 billion addressable market is the small and medium-sized business segment, which represents approximately 75% of the total acquiring revenue pool. This segment of the market is currently and will continue to be our primary focus. 
The overall acquiring market is growing, almost twice the projected growth rate of U.S. GDP. Driving that attractive growth are e-commerce and integrated payments, which are growing at 10% and 12%, respectively. This acquisition, coupled with our existing business, dramatically improves our competitive position within these 2 important areas. As you can see on Slide 22, how they will contribute to our Merchant transformation. At the end of the day, TSYS made it to enhance its Merchant business in order to remain competitive in the rapidly changing acquiring landscape. Today, with the acquisition of TransFirst, we are transforming our Merchant business to one which has a strong competitive position in high-growth areas of the market, a business mix where over 80% of the segment's revenue will come from direct acquiring and scale across all key metrics, Merchants, transactions and sales volume. Together, these attributes contribute to an improved growth profile and leadership position for the Merchant segment. We believe it is a strategic imperative to hold a leadership position in the markets in which we play. Slide 23 shows that this combination positions us as the sixth largest U.S. Merchant acquirer based on net revenue, with 3 strategically important benefits: one, an expanded sales and distribution network; two, a stronger integrated payments channel; and three, enhanced multichannel payment solutions. 
With this established leadership position in all of our businesses, we have created a strong, unique and balanced portfolio positioned across the payment spectrum as indicated on Slide 24. We have incredible strength in our issuer processing business, touching more than 700 million cardholders and 400 payment providers around the globe. Our market share reaches almost 40% of all credit cards in the United States, and we are the #1 provider of these services in the United States, in China and #2 in Europe. Through our combination with TransFirst, we will serve as more than 645,000 merchant outlets, process approximately $117 billion in annual volume and leverage over 2,300 distribution partners. In our NetSpend business, we're ranked #1 based on gross dollar volume and #2 based on revenue. 
TSYS now reaches several hundred banks, hundreds of thousands of businesses and millions of consumers. The scale, reach and distribution network we are creating positions us to serve as a single destination for unparalleled payment technologies and enhanced services to the constituents we serve in a space undergoing massive change. We are excited to have John and the TransFirst team on board and are confident that through our combined talents, expertise and strengths, we will continue to win in the market. 
Now I would like to turn it over to John Shlonsky to make a few comments."

TransFirst has and still utilizes TSYS for front-end, back-end and gateway services. The combination of the 2 organizations makes perfect sense and gives us a strong leadership position in acquiring. I can tell you firsthand, our main interaction with TSYS and particularly with the executive team makes me feel confident that our values and how we treat each other and our clients are firmly aligned. 
On Slide 26, let me tell you a little bit about TransFirst and how our value proposition will be further enhanced as part of TSYS. First, we operate a partner-centric model. This model enables us to gain access to a large number of SMB merchants in a scalable and cost-effective manner. Joining TSYS will enable us to bring even stronger solution to these partners. 
Second, we operate a single integrated platform. This platform actually evolved from our utilization of TSYS payment solutions. Our mission with TSYS is to leverage our joint capabilities and products to our customers in a seamless way so they can rely on just one provider for all their processing requirements. 
Third, it will be increasingly important to develop customized and user-friendly solutions that enable our Merchant customers to sell our products in a store, on the Internet or remotely through a mobile device on our platform. 
And lastly, all of the information used has been built around a single database. This really provides customers with a high level of technical and customer service and support. For example, we provide error-free boarding in minutes, automatic credit approval, one-call resolution 85% of the time. We will strive to leverage best practices across both Merchant segments as we integrate these 2 already great companies. 
Slide 27 really illustrates how fortunate we are with this new partnership to have some businesses that overlap and some that complement our total addressable market. This is the clearest example of our go-to-market strategy. TransFirst goes to market with 2 distinct models: an integrated and a referral partnership model. Our integrated model is where partners really require more vertical expertise and technical specialization. Our referral partners will focus more on our service model and our product capabilities. Both of these models leverage our platform and our product set. Similar to TSYS, we work with financial institutions, trade associations, national business service providers to provide payments and solutions to their base and new Merchant customers. These solutions provide enhanced brand loyalty and revenue opportunities for all of our combined referral partners. TransFirst and TSYS will combine automation and technology to support an integrated platform that will seamlessly deliver relevant products and solution to our partners and merchants, not just process transactions. Our goal is for any merchant, for many partners to have complete access to relevant and easy-to-use payment solutions. 
So on Slide 28, why are we so excited? This is a strong cultural fit. Both companies show a deep ethical values of doing the right thing and treating people right with shared values around integrity, trust, innovation and partnerships, relationships. Ease of integration, the flexibility of TransFirst's single platform that we developed working with TSYS technology will allow for this easier transition. Our enhanced offerings by leveraging each other's strengths, this allows us to bring best-in-class products and solutions to all of our partners and merchants. And most importantly, really foster a holistic growth. And this transaction will provide TSYS significant scale and strength across issuing processing, Merchant Services and prepaid program management. We are very, very happy about this partnership. We have some work to do but couldn't be more excited to merge these 2 great organizations. 
I would now like to turn it back over to Paul."

And I want to reiterate my excitement about this transformational acquisition. 
Looking at Slide 30, as Troy said, we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TransFirst for $2.35 billion in an all-cash transaction. We anticipate the transaction will produce low, double-digit adjusted EPS accretion in the first 12 months, excluding onetime deal-related expenses. The transaction will be funded with fully committed debt financing. At closing on a pro forma basis, we will have approximately $3.8 billion of debt, and pro forma leverage for our company is expected to be approximately 3.9x debt to trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA. The strong cash flow generation of the business allows us to get back to our long-term target leverage ratio of the low- to mid-2s within 24 months of closing. We will limit our share buyback and acquisition activity during this period until we achieve our more targeted leverage ratios, and we are committed to our investment-grade rating. We're excited about the leadership of John and his team, as they will be able to expand upon the great results I talked about from our Merchant segment earlier. We're also excited about the expense synergy opportunity from the efficiencies we can realize in our combined businesses. As such, we currently estimate we would generate at least $15 million of cost synergies in calendar year 2017, with that almost doubling to the range of $25 million to $30 million in calendar year 2018. And as I said, we expect the deal to produce low double-digit adjusted EPS accretion in the first 12 months after close net of onetime related expenses with $5 million of synergies and move to the mid to high double-digit range over the longer term as larger synergies are captured over time. This also does not reflect the anticipated revenue synergies that we believe are attainable from this new payments platform company. This new combined Merchant segment will be able to work with our strong issuer processing business, specifically with the bank referral partner business of TransFirst, and with NetSpend specifically with their PayCard business. While these revenue synergies may take some time to materialize, given the strong organic growth nature of each of these businesses on their own, there clearly is an opportunity set of revenue growth here that we expect to achieve. And this is a unique combination of capabilities and payments for one company to leverage. 
Given the strong historical track record of non-acquisition-fueled organic growth from TransFirst, coupled with our Merchant segment's embedded organic growth capabilities and the overall organic growth of TSYS, we believe the combined organic growth profile of the company will be improved and will be unique in the payments industry as to its balance and diversification of payments-related growth. While we provided revenue before reimbursable guidance today in the 5% to 7% range all organically, we expect the combination of TransFirst's historically organic double-digit revenue growth to improve TSYS' revenue growth profile by approximately 100 basis points annually on a pro forma basis. After closing, we will obviously come back and revise our 2016 guidance to reflect the positive impact we expect this combination to have on our 2016 financial results. 
Now on Slide 31, I hope you can see why this acquisition is so compelling as it establishes TSYS as a clear leader in this highly attractive market, accelerating our growth in integrated payments and strengthening our partnership distribution capabilities. These, coupled with the expected financial benefits I just reviewed and under John's leadership, signal that we have completed another step in fulfilling our strategic vision of being the leading global payments solutions provider. 
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

One, we saw good organic growth in our indirect customers that was the primary driver for that growth. We also had some good product growth in that business that came through as well as a few other items. So it's kind of a combination of factors, but the strongest factor was the organic growth of the processing customers that are in that indirect side of the business. And as it relates to margins, I think as it relates '16 margins, I commented in my prepared remarks on all of the different segment margins that we are expecting yearly margins to increase slightly in each one of our segments and, certainly, would address the North America segment margin story. I think as I also commented as it relates to fourth quarter margin, we did see, given the banner years that we had in really all of the segments in the fourth quarter, we did have some incentive compensation and some pay relative to the team members delivering this great performance that impacted the fourth quarter margin. But I think the bigger story that you want to take away from a margin standpoint is strong margins, certainly in North America, and we see that margin picture expanding in 2016."

So we'll continue to look at that as we progress in '16. We expect, as I said, the margin to expand in '16. But I also said if an opportunity presents itself, like it did this year in the latter part of '16 for us to invest for future growth in this business, we may make that decision. I think I'd point out that, that's one of the benefits of having strong businesses altogether inside of TSYS is, we're able to make decisions around pro growth things that on one specific segment might depress a segment margin, but on the overall basis were still very margin strong.

I wasn't referencing the overall consolidated picture. What we have said is, on a stand-alone basis, we expected mid-single-digit growth for our Merchant segment on a stand-alone basis. And you are right in what the kind of double-digit organic growth picture of TransFirst has been historically. They have a very strong track record of double-digit organic growth. And when you put all that together on kind of a pro forma basis, we do believe that on a total company basis, that additive growth will lift our revenue growth rate by roughly about 100 basis points annually."

And I think it's important to point out that this is a growth-based acquisition. It is not an acquisition where it's around kind of making the financials work due to expense cuts. The TransFirst historical organic growth model is a double-digit organic growth model. And what we now have in our Merchant business also is primed for very strong organic growth. And so in putting these businesses together, we want to make sure that we're maximizing the organic growth capabilities while also, obviously, taking the expense synergies that are available to take. As it relates to platform, there is platform synergies today because the TransFirst business is already using predominantly our front end platform. So it isn't like typical acquisition. Sometimes we have 2 different platforms and you're kind of shutting down one platform to get a lion's share of the synergy, but instead one where we're trying to make sure we maximize the efficiencies while not trying to hurt the revenue growth trajectory. And so this is -- the synergy on the surface might look relatively smaller compared to maybe some other things that you compared against. But when you put it in that framework, that's one that deals very right, obviously, there's some upside as we dig into this. And if there's some upside, we'll obviously take that upside.

Geographically, when we look at the geographical disbursement of their business, it's not too dissimilar from what you find when you look at the geographical disbursement of our business on our direct business. The states that you find contributing the most are typically the same top 5 or 6 states, number one. Number two, I think John touched on this in his prepared remarks that there are some overlaps, but there are also some complementary areas of his business. But I think one of the things that we find strengthening to us, it is very strong in the FI side. And as you know, we're very strong on the FI side of the issuing. So we see that as a complement. We both are in the ISV business. Ours began approximately a year ago on a de novo basis. As we've indicated earlier, John's business is pushing 30% of his revenues in that space. So I think over the next 60 to 90 days, we obviously will have to take some real quality time to understand all of our go-to-market dynamics as we look at our sales force, his sales force, his partners and our partners. And I think we can shed a lot more light on that at our first quarter call. John, do want to add to that?"

So it's not one of those situations where we're providing a trade-off where you happen to not invest on the growth side because you've got some higher synergy number to try to kind of make deal economics. That's one of the beauties of this transaction is the high accretive nature of the transaction without having to have a very high synergy number that can then cost you on the growth side because you happen to chase the synergies on the expense side and starve the growth profile. So with that kind of being the overall wrapper, that's the machination of how we got to those relevant amounts. But in general, I'd say, that, obviously, we'll be investing on the higher growth side of the business, which John has done in his business, and we've been doing in our business around the integrated side, the e-commerce side and those differentiated distribution capabilities in high-growth verticals.

Thank you, Shawn. Good afternoon, and happy new year. Without a doubt, this is a type of earnings call a CEO dreams about: reporting a great quarter, performing with operational excellence during the holiday shopping period, reporting a record earnings year and, from a shareholder perspective, producing a 47.8% total shareholder return for 2015, making TSYS the ninth best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the year. And of course, the icing on the cake is the announcement earlier today of the strategic and transformative acquisition of TransFirst, a leading U.S. acquirer of payment solutions. This will be the largest acquisition in our history at $2.35 billion. This is truly a watershed event for our company, team members and shareholders, and we are all very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We are also very pleased to have John Shlonsky, CEO of TransFirst, here with us this afternoon. And he, Paul and I will provide additional details on the strategic rationale for this new partnership and take questions a little later in our presentation. 
Before we get to that, I want to take a few minutes to call out some significant highlights for the quarter and for the year. The fourth quarter was our best quarter in our 33-year history. We produced record-setting transactions, authorizations and volumes. Holiday authorizations on same-client basis were up 12.7% in North America and 10% in our International segment. We repurchased 3 million shares of our stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our total repurchases for the year to 5.2 million shares for $242.1 million. These repurchases, coupled with dividends, represented a return in excess of 92% of our available free cash flow to shareholders in 2015, a 31% increase over last year. 
On the segment front, there are a few callouts I would like to mention. First is North America. The North America segment produced record revenues, operating income and transactions for the year. Our traditional accounts on file increased 37% on a year-over-year quarter basis, and we ended the year with 654.1 million total accounts on file. Our EMV chip card production soared in the fourth quarter, increasing over 400% over the fourth quarter of 2014. All in all, it was another exceptional quarter for our North America segment. 
Turning our attention to the International segment. Perhaps the biggest achievement for the International segment was the attainment of its 4-year goal to achieve a minimum 18% margin by year-end 2015. We ended the year at 18.1%. The outstanding 24.5% fourth quarter margin was a catalyst to achieving our goal. We are very proud of the team for their relentless focus and determination to reach this very important goal by year-end. 
On the business development front in the International segment, we signed a letter of intent to provide processing solutions in 2 regional markets in Latin America. This processing will be performed in Brazil, generating scale by leveraging our platform investment that currently supports the market-leading retail cards business of Carrefour. 
As we move to Merchant, a few quick callouts. For the quarter, direct revenue increased 15.4% and indirect revenue increased 10.4%. The excellent fourth quarter helped propel overall revenue growth for the segment of 8.8% for the year. Continued momentum in our ISV channel, new product offerings like OptBlue improved sales productivity, and EMV terminal activity all contributed to our strong growth for the quarter. 
And lastly, a few important comments about NetSpend. NetSpend produced its 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth of 20.9%. We were successful in introducing our payroll, incentive and disbursement cards program within Capital One, the 10th largest bank in the United States. Also during the quarter, we expanded our products and our relationship with both Rite Aid and Walmart. 
All in all, it was good execution and performance by all segments in the fourth quarter, providing a good foundation and momentum as we move into 2016. After today's announcement, our reach and distribution uniquely positions us to provide innovative products and solutions that our clients and customers need to adapt to the evolving payment landscape. Now is our moment to unlock these opportunities in payments and continue to deliver strong results for TSYS, our customers and our shareholders. 
I'll now ask Paul Todd to provide additional detailed financial information on our quarter, the year-end and review our guidance for 2016. Paul?"

I want to point out at the start that any guidance or expectations I give regarding segment or consolidated performance for '16 does not include the transaction we have announced today. 
Now digging into the results, starting on Slide 7. At the consolidated level, our revenue before reimbursables increased 13.3% for the quarter, resulting in a full year increase for 2015 of 14%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $195 million and $833.9 million for the year, representing a year-over-year increase of $121.7 million or 17.1%. 
Finally, on adjusted EPS from continuing operations, the $0.57 for the quarter allowed for $2.46 adjusted EPS on a yearly basis, which represents a 25.5% increase from prior year and in line with our guidance range we provided last quarter of $2.43 to $2.47. This EPS performance was driven by the fantastic results from our segments, the tax benefits that I mentioned last quarter as well as other drivers. On a comparative basis for the quarter, the $0.01 decline from last year was primarily due to a onetime item in 4Q of '14 in our International segment, higher incentive compensation in 2015 versus 2014 and strategic investments in NetSpend, among other items. 
Before I leave the consolidated financial highlights, I want to point out that our quarterly revenue growth of 13.3% and the yearly revenue growth of 14% is all organic and was driven by cross-segment organic performance across our businesses throughout the year, and our ability to take that revenue growth to the bottom line was seen in our margin expansion for the year. This combination of pure organic revenue growth with margin expansion is a key takeaway from our 2015 consolidated results.  
Now to explain our results in more detail, let's turn to Slide 9 and I will cover our North America segment first. The key headline on the North America segment is the same as it has been all year, and that is mid- to high-teen organic revenue growth. Revenue before reimbursables for the segment was up 17.5% for the quarter to $300.3 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. As you can see on the chart, the business has had an impressive string of positive revenue growth and the 20.2% organic revenue growth for the year is the highest yearly revenue growth for this business since 1999. We have started the year expecting this business to grow in the mid-teen range of organic growth, so the 20.2% growth level exceeded our expectations for the year, which was largely driven by the successful conversion of a large client and better organic growth with our customers. Also contributing was the growth in our core offerings as well as other services to include fraud, loyalty, card production and managed services. We began the year expecting this revenue growth to be achieved at roughly the same margin levels that we saw in 2014 but to perform in a tighter quarterly band, and that's exactly what happened in 2015: Segment margin expanded from 36.8% in 2014 to 37.4% in 2015. 
On the volume front, total accounts on file for the quarter increased 18.9% with our traditional accounts on file increasing 37.3%, taking us to an all-time high of 415 million traditional accounts on file. I mentioned on our last call that the total accounts on file would start showing some declines due to the previously announced de-conversions of RushCard and Green Dot. This is why we continue to discuss the traditional accounts on file metric, which excludes prepaid, government services and single-use accounts that can vary substantially and are less correlated to revenue. We couldn't be more pleased with the performance of this North America segment both on a quarterly and full year basis. The business is positioned well for 2016 as we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for this segment in 2016 with slightly expanding margins. 
Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on Slide 10, where the key headline, as Troy discussed, is the achievement of a full year margin of 18.1%. We announced this as a target 4 years ago, and the management team in this segment has had a laser focus to not only improve margins but to enhance the business model as well, and we are proud of this achievement. 
Segment revenue for the quarter was $87.1 million, down 6.2% on a reported basis and down 0.6% on a constant-currency basis. I highlighted in our third quarter call that the last 6 quarters of solid constant-currency revenue growth would likely not continue in the fourth quarter due to a onetime item in the fourth quarter of 2014 that provides a challenging grow [ph] over comparison. Excluding the impact of this onetime item, constant-currency revenue was up 6.3%, which is a better reflection of the performance of the segment. The revenue growth for the quarter was, again, fueled by the 4 new clients we've converted since 2014. And these new clients, coupled with our existing client base, are outperforming the market. And as we mentioned on previous calls, they are lifting this segment from being a roughly flat constant-currency growth picture to one of low to mid-single digits. 
On the margin front, I called out on our last call that we expected the margin to decline in the fourth quarter from fourth quarter 2014 levels due to the onetime item in 4Q of '14 that I mentioned earlier. And from a volume perspective, accounts on file grew 11.9 million compared to the same quarter of last year, over half of which was due to new clients. This means we continue to break records for the number of accounts processed in this segment now standing at 78.5 million accounts on file. I would like to emphasize, again, that most of this growth is in commercial card and single-use accounts. As in previous quarters, we also experienced significant growth in the debit portfolios we process. The segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth with same-client transactions growing by 6.7%.  
In summary, on International, we're pleased with the continued execution of margin improvement, coupled with a steady constant-currency revenue growth picture, and for 2016 for this segment, we expect constant-currency revenue growth in the flat to low single-digit range, with a slightly improving margin picture. 
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 11, where the key headline for this segment is organic growth, driven by both lines of business shifting the indirect line of business from being a headwind to finally being a tailwind for this segment during the quarter. The split in our revenue mix is now 61% direct and 39% indirect. 
Revenue in the direct line of business increased 15.4% for the quarter from last year, with SBS sales volume also experiencing double-digit growth of 11.3% for the quarter. 
On the indirect side, we continue to retain our core customers, renewing 2 of our top 25 this quarter while also bringing on new customers signing 2 new full service agreements during the quarter. A key takeaway is that we achieved positive growth in our indirect business for the quarter and year, and that is a major accomplishment for this side of the business, given the pressures it has had over the last several years. Segment margins declined 210 basis points for the fourth quarter due to some onetime expenses we chose to make around efficiency improvement in this segment. 
Overall, it was a strong quarter and year for the Merchant segment, and we are well positioned on this front to capture more market share in the future and expect that 2016 revenue growth for this segment to be in the mid-single-digit range for the year with slightly improving margins from 2015 levels. 
Now I want to talk about the fantastic performance of the NetSpend segment, starting on Slide 12. The highlight for the segment is the 20.9% organic revenue growth for the quarter, bringing the overall revenue growth of NetSpend for the year over the 20% mark at 20.2%. The strength in NetSpend's organic growth is derived from a combination of its winning management team, coupled with market differentiated channel offerings and excellent strategic execution to produce these outstanding results in this competitive and fast-moving sector of the payments industry. While this business outperformed our revenue growth expectations, we did comment this time last year that we would invest in our business for growth that could cause some margin pressure, and that's exactly what happened in our fourth quarter with our quarterly adjusted operating margin of 19.9%, delivering a yearly margin of 23.7%, which is down from the 26.6% in 2014. I want to point out that these are investment cycle decisions that we're glad to make to support the business growth, and we will continue to make these decisions on a go-forward basis as long as we see the line-of-sight path to growth. 
The volume growth behind these results is equally as impressive. We saw a 17.7% growth in our direct deposit active cards to 1.9 million for the quarter. We finished the quarter with $5.7 billion in GDV, up 21.3%. While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we're also constantly focused on expanding our distribution reach by adding approximately 7,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 96,000. One of the most noteworthy contributors to the fourth quarter increase in distributing locations and employers was our launch in Rite Aid stores, a multiyear distribution relationship that we signed last quarter. 
Overall, 2015 was a banner year for NetSpend. Our expectation right now for this business is for the revenue growth for 2016 to be in the low double-digit growth range on a full year basis, with a slightly expanding margin, although we could choose to make investment decisions for growth later in the year in '16 as we did this year that could impact margin. 
Turning back to the consolidated results on Slide 13. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 23.4%, and we finished the year with an adjusted operating margin of 26.7% as seen on Page 14, which was primarily fueled by the improving year-over-year margins in 3 of our 4 segments. This consolidated margin falls into the range that we anticipated at the beginning of the year, and we expect the consolidated operating margin in 2016 to slightly improve from this current level. I want to state that Slides 13 and 14 provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, NetSpend M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. 
Now let's talk about our cash position for a moment. We ended the year at $389 million in cash, a $59 million decrease from the third quarter of last year. Our largest cash outflow of $159 million was related to our stock repurchase, with the next being about $67 million of CapEx, of which about 12% was related to contract acquisition costs, with 27% related to property and equipment and the remaining 61% being related to internally developed and licensed software. 
On cash flow on Slide 16, our free cash flow for the quarter was $72.5 million, resulting in a full year free cash flow of $397 million and slightly below the $420 million to $440 million we have projected. But as I said on our last call, we had some decisions that we made regarding CapEx in the fourth quarter that were good for the business long term so we made them. 
For 2016, we expect our capital expenditures to be in a similar range as 2015 levels, and we estimate that free cash flow will be in the $470 million to $500 million range for the full year of 2016, an approximate increase of 18% to 26% from 2015 levels. This growing level of free cash flow is another strong indicator of the health of the business and the ability of our businesses to generate strong free cash flow. 
As it relates to shares, as Troy mentioned, we repurchased 3 million shares for $158.6 million during the quarter, which resulted in the total amount of shares repurchased in 2015 of 5.2 million. As a result, we ended the year with 182.8 million of common shares outstanding, with the average basic weighted shares outstanding at 184.1 million. 
On taxes, we ended the year at an effective tax rate of 29.9%, which was about 300 basis points better than we expected at the start of the year, and we believe our estimated tax rate for 2016 to return to the more historical range of 32% to 34%. I want to point out that this 300 basis point increase in tax rate change in 2016 expected levels from 2015 levels is the main driver as to why our expected adjusted EPS growth rate is not in the same range as the expected growth rate and adjusted EBITDA or operating income. 
And speaking of 2016, as it relates to guidance on Page 17, we highlight our full year consolidated guidance of total revenue growth of 4% to 6%, revenues before reimbursables growth of 5% to 7% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of 4% to 7% growth. We also expect consolidated adjusted margin to increase by approximately 100 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin to increase by approximately 100 basis points. Obviously, this guidance hinges upon the assumptions I've already mentioned and the ones mentioned on Page 44 in the presentation. And I want to highlight that this guidance reflects the excellent operating leverage we continue to get because if you remove the 300 basis point increase in our tax line, you see the growth from the bottom line exceeding our revenue growth by several percentage points. Also, this expected margin expansion is driven by expanding margins in all our businesses continuing the trend of cross-segment delivery of performance we saw in 2015. 
And finally, I want to mention some full year callouts that I think are key takeaways from today. The first callout is on organic growth. The fourth quarter was similar to the third quarter, in that with no acquisitions completed during the quarter, it allows for organic growth clarity in our results. When you look at the 17.5% quarterly revenue growth in North America, the constant-currency revenue growth net of onetime item comparisons in International, the 15% direct acquiring revenue growth in Merchant and the 20.9% revenue growth in NetSpend all coming from non-acquisition activity, you see a strong picture of organic revenue growth that played out throughout the year. While the overall organic growth number is strong, we're equally pleased with the cross-segment delivery of organic growth that each of our businesses has delivered. 
The second major callout is on margins. Each of our 4 segments delivered margins that were either in excess or generally met are previously communicated expectations for the year. The margin profile of our segments are strong relative to their respective competitors and the ability to draw -- drive margin expansion or stability while also investing in the business was a big accomplishment for 2015. And the third and final callout is related to how the performance of 2015 positions us for 2016 and beyond. Our North American organic growth story, with a platform now of 415 million traditional accounts on file, our International margin progress coupled now with the strengthening growth effort, our improving segment revenue picture in Merchant and strong double-digit revenue growth at NetSpend all delivered with competitively strong margins all at the same time paints a picture of TSYS that is unlike any in our history. It is a unique time for our company to have all businesses performing in the manner that our segments are performing, and specifically, we want to thank each and every team member from across the globe who worked so hard to deliver the performance we've announced today.  Without their daily efforts and commitment, none of these would be possible. 
Now I want to turn it back over to Troy to discuss this exciting transaction that we announced today."

Thank you, Paul. I'll provide some additional transaction details beginning on Slide 20. As all of you know, our intent over the past year or so has been to grow the scale and position of our Merchant business through accretive M&A. With the acquisition of TransFirst, we will have a winning combination of technology, scale and partner-centric distribution capabilities that propels us to a leadership position in the acquiring market. Importantly, TransFirst's focus on partner-centric, vertically specialized distribution will accelerate our growth within the highly attractive integrated payments space. 
Post-closing, this specific distribution model will comprise approximately 20% of the revenue of the combined businesses. Based on an analysis by First Annapolis Consulting, on a pro forma basis, this would make TSYS the third largest integrated payments provider in the U.S. As I have said before, I believe the winners in Merchant acquiring will be the scale players with integrated capabilities and a diverse distribution network. This transaction with TransFirst strengthens our sales and distribution network, with the addition of over 1,300 partners and more than 350 sales professionals, enhancing our access to high growth, strategically attractive vertical markets such as health care, B2B and not-for-profit. 
In addition to the many strategic benefits, the transaction is financially attractive from both an earnings and valuation perspective. We currently expect the transaction to be accretive in the low double digits to adjusted EPS for the first full year post-closing. The transaction will be an all-cash transaction, with an implied multiple of 13.8x estimated 2016 adjusted EBITDA. 
On a pro forma basis, our balance sheet will continue to remain strong as our investment-grade rating is important to us. We are confident that the combined valuation and synergies will drive material shareholder value. A contributing factor to these financial benefits is the size and attractive growth profile of the industry itself. As you can see, on Slide 21, the U.S. acquiring market is a very large market. It is the largest addressable market in which TSYS participates. A materially significant portion of the $13 billion addressable market is the small and medium-sized business segment, which represents approximately 75% of the total acquiring revenue pool. This segment of the market is currently and will continue to be our primary focus. 
The overall acquiring market is growing, almost twice the projected growth rate of U.S. GDP. Driving that attractive growth are e-commerce and integrated payments, which are growing at 10% and 12%, respectively. This acquisition, coupled with our existing business, dramatically improves our competitive position within these 2 important areas. As you can see on Slide 22, how they will contribute to our Merchant transformation. At the end of the day, TSYS made it to enhance its Merchant business in order to remain competitive in the rapidly changing acquiring landscape. Today, with the acquisition of TransFirst, we are transforming our Merchant business to one which has a strong competitive position in high-growth areas of the market, a business mix where over 80% of the segment's revenue will come from direct acquiring and scale across all key metrics, Merchants, transactions and sales volume. Together, these attributes contribute to an improved growth profile and leadership position for the Merchant segment. We believe it is a strategic imperative to hold a leadership position in the markets in which we play. Slide 23 shows that this combination positions us as the sixth largest U.S. Merchant acquirer based on net revenue, with 3 strategically important benefits: one, an expanded sales and distribution network; two, a stronger integrated payments channel; and three, enhanced multichannel payment solutions. 
With this established leadership position in all of our businesses, we have created a strong, unique and balanced portfolio positioned across the payment spectrum as indicated on Slide 24. We have incredible strength in our issuer processing business, touching more than 700 million cardholders and 400 payment providers around the globe. Our market share reaches almost 40% of all credit cards in the United States, and we are the #1 provider of these services in the United States, in China and #2 in Europe. Through our combination with TransFirst, we will serve as more than 645,000 merchant outlets, process approximately $117 billion in annual volume and leverage over 2,300 distribution partners. In our NetSpend business, we're ranked #1 based on gross dollar volume and #2 based on revenue. 
TSYS now reaches several hundred banks, hundreds of thousands of businesses and millions of consumers. The scale, reach and distribution network we are creating positions us to serve as a single destination for unparalleled payment technologies and enhanced services to the constituents we serve in a space undergoing massive change. We are excited to have John and the TransFirst team on board and are confident that through our combined talents, expertise and strengths, we will continue to win in the market. 
Now I would like to turn it over to John Shlonsky to make a few comments."

Thank you, Troy, I'm so excited for all of us here at TransFirst and TSYS. We have actually been partners for quite some time. TransFirst has and still utilizes TSYS for front-end, back-end and gateway services. The combination of the 2 organizations makes perfect sense and gives us a strong leadership position in acquiring. I can tell you firsthand, our main interaction with TSYS and particularly with the executive team makes me feel confident that our values and how we treat each other and our clients are firmly aligned. 
On Slide 26, let me tell you a little bit about TransFirst and how our value proposition will be further enhanced as part of TSYS. First, we operate a partner-centric model. This model enables us to gain access to a large number of SMB merchants in a scalable and cost-effective manner. Joining TSYS will enable us to bring even stronger solutions to these partners. 
Second, we operate a single integrated platform. This platform actually evolved from our utilization of TSYS payment solutions. Our mission with TSYS is to leverage our joint capabilities and products to our customers in a seamless way so they can rely on just one provider for all their processing requirements. 
Third, it will be increasingly important to develop customized and user-friendly solutions that enable our Merchant customers to sell our products in a store, on the Internet or remotely through a mobile device on our platform. 
And lastly, all of the information used has been built around a single database. This really provides customers with a high level of technical and customer service and support. For example, we provide error-free boarding in minutes, automatic credit approval, one-call resolution 85% of the time. We will strive to leverage best practices across both Merchant segments as we integrate these 2 already great companies. 
Slide 27 really illustrates how fortunate we are with this new partnership to have some businesses that overlap and some that complement our total addressable market. This is the clearest example of our go-to-market strategy. TransFirst goes to market with 2 distinct models: an integrated and a referral partnership model. Our integrated model is where partners really require more vertical expertise and technical specialization. Our referral partners will focus more on our service model and our product capabilities. Both of these models leverage our platform and our product set. Similar to TSYS, we work with financial institutions, trade associations, national business service providers to provide payments and solutions to their base and new Merchant customers. These solutions provide enhanced brand loyalty and revenue opportunities for all of our combined referral partners. TransFirst and TSYS will combine automation and technology to support an integrated platform that will seamlessly deliver relevant products and solution to our partners and merchants, not just process transactions. Our goal is for any merchant, for many partners to have complete access to relevant and easy-to-use payment solutions. 
So on Slide 28, why are we so excited? This is a strong cultural fit. Both companies show a deep ethical values of doing the right thing and treating people right with shared values around integrity, trust, innovation and partnerships, relationships. Ease of integration, the flexibility of TransFirst's single platform that we developed working with TSYS technology will allow for this easier transition. Our enhanced offerings by leveraging each other's strengths, this allows us to bring best-in-class products and solutions to all of our partners and merchants. And most importantly, really foster a holistic growth. And this transaction will provide TSYS significant scale and strength across issuing processing, Merchant Services and prepaid program management. We are very, very happy about this partnership. We have some work to do but couldn't be more excited to merge these 2 great organizations. 
I would now like to turn it back over to Paul."

And I want to reiterate my excitement about this transformational acquisition. 
Looking at Slide 30, as Troy said, we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TransFirst for $2.35 billion in an all-cash transaction. We anticipate the transaction will produce low, double-digit adjusted EPS accretion in the first 12 months, excluding onetime deal-related expenses. The transaction will be funded with fully committed debt financing. At closing on a pro forma basis, we will have approximately $3.8 billion of debt, and pro forma leverage for our company is expected to be approximately 3.9x debt to trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA. The strong cash flow generation of the business allows us to get back to our long-term target leverage ratio of the low- to mid-2s within 24 months of closing. We will limit our share buyback and acquisition activity during this period until we achieve our more targeted leverage ratios, and we are committed to our investment-grade rating. We're excited about the leadership of John and his team, as they will be able to expand upon the great results I talked about from our Merchant segment earlier. We're also excited about the expense synergy opportunity from the efficiencies we can realize in our combined businesses. As such, we currently estimate we would generate at least $15 million of cost synergies in calendar year 2017, with that almost doubling to the range of $25 million to $30 million in calendar year 2018. And as I said, we expect the deal to produce low double-digit adjusted EPS accretion in the first 12 months after close net of onetime related expenses with $5 million of synergies and move to the mid to high double-digit range over the longer term as larger synergies are captured over time. This also does not reflect the anticipated revenue synergies that we believe are attainable from this new payments platform company. This new combined Merchant segment will be able to work with our strong issuer processing business, specifically with the bank referral partner business of TransFirst, and with NetSpend specifically with their PayCard business. While these revenue synergies may take some time to materialize, given the strong organic growth nature of each of these businesses on their own, there clearly is an opportunity set of revenue growth here that we expect to achieve. And this is a unique combination of capabilities and payments for one company to leverage. 
Given the strong historical track record of non-acquisition-fueled organic growth from TransFirst, coupled with our Merchant segment's embedded organic growth capabilities and the overall organic growth of TSYS, we believe the combined organic growth profile of the company will be improved and will be unique in the payments industry as to its balance and diversification of payments-related growth. While we provided revenue before reimbursable guidance today in the 5% to 7% range all organically, we expect the combination of TransFirst's historically organic double-digit revenue growth to improve TSYS' revenue growth profile by approximately 100 basis points annually on a pro forma basis. After closing, we will obviously come back and revise our 2016 guidance to reflect the positive impact we expect this combination to have on our 2016 financial results. 
Now on Slide 31, I hope you can see why this acquisition is so compelling as it establishes TSYS as a clear leader in this highly attractive market, accelerating our growth in integrated payments and strengthening our partnership distribution capabilities. These, coupled with the expected financial benefits I just reviewed and under John's leadership, signal that we have completed another step in fulfilling our strategic vision of being the leading global payments solutions provider. 
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

And then second, if could you just talk on the quarter and help us understand going forward how we should think about -- I know you gave some guidance on margins, in particular, going forward in the North America Merchant Services segment, et cetera, but just -- we saw some contraction there, I think about 200 basis points in the Merchant Services and then 400 or so on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter in North America. And I think you saw extremely strong top line growth, but I think just that contraction there just maybe drove EPS a little bit lower than we had personally anticipated."

Yes. James, so this is Paul. On both of those questions, on the indirect side, on the Merchant business, 2 things there. One, we saw good organic growth in our indirect customers that was the primary driver for that growth. We also had some good product growth in that business that came through as well as a few other items. So it's kind of a combination of factors, but the strongest factor was the organic growth of the processing customers that are in that indirect side of the business. And as it relates to margins, I think as it relates '16 margins, I commented in my prepared remarks on all of the different segment margins that we are expecting yearly margins to increase slightly in each one of our segments and, certainly, would address the North America segment margin story. I think as I also commented as it relates to fourth quarter margin, we did see, given the banner years that we had in really all of the segments in the fourth quarter, we did have some incentive compensation and some pay relative to the team members delivering this great performance that impacted the fourth quarter margin. But I think the bigger story that you want to take away from a margin standpoint is strong margins, certainly in North America, and we see that margin picture expanding in 2016."

Yes. I think the only thing I would add on the final part of that question as it relates to the North America organic growth picture, we did say mid-single digits. But I think it's important to remember that we do have the full effect of the 2 previously announced de-conversions of Green Dot and Rush that are providing some headwind on that growth rate for the North America segment. So as I've commented before, over a longer period, we still think that's a mid- to high single-digit revenue growth picture for North America, but it trends toward the middle side with these 2 headwinds of the de-conversions on the prepaid processing side."

Clearly, had we decided not to make those investments in the fourth quarter, the margin profile for the fourth quarter would have been very commensurate with the margin for the third quarter. So yes, they did -- that was -- those marketing investments were the central driver between the margin drop between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And as I said about our margin expanding on a year-over-year basis between '15 and '16 for NetSpend, obviously, there is a higher expense base that's already now built into the 2015 numbers related to that higher level of marketing spend. So we'll continue to look at that as we progress in '16. We expect, as I said, the margin to expand in '16. But I also said if an opportunity presents itself, like it did this year in the latter part of '16 for us to invest for future growth in this business, we may make that decision. I think I'd point out that, that's one of the benefits of having strong businesses altogether inside of TSYS is, we're able to make decisions around pro growth things that on one specific segment might depress a segment margin, but on the overall basis were still very margin strong. And so that's exactly the situation that we had with NetSpend. I've commented on this in the earlier part of the year that we might make those investment decisions.

          Okay. So on my comments around the mid-single digit to high single digit was specifically earlier around our North America segment where we had made comments around what's kind of a longer-term growth rate of the North America segment. I wasn't referencing the overall consolidated picture. What we have said is, on a stand-alone basis, we expected mid-single-digit growth for our Merchant segment on a stand-alone basis. And you are right in what the kind of double-digit organic growth picture of TransFirst has been historically. They have a very strong track record of double-digit organic growth. And when you put all that together on kind of a pro forma basis, we do believe that on a total company basis, that additive growth will lift our revenue growth rate by roughly about 100 basis points annually."

          Sure. So on that $25 million number, if you kind of look at that on a combined cost base, it's just a little over 3% of the combined cost base of the 2 Merchant businesses. And I think it's important to point out that this is a growth-based acquisition. It is not an acquisition where it's around kind of making the financials work due to expense cuts. The TransFirst historical organic growth model is a double-digit organic growth model. And what we now have in our Merchant business also is primed for very strong organic growth. And so in putting these businesses together, we want to make sure that we're maximizing the organic growth capabilities while also, obviously, taking the expense synergies that are available to take. As it relates to platform, there is platform synergies today because the TransFirst business is already using predominantly our front end platform. So it isn't like typical acquisition sometimes where you have 2 different platforms and you're kind of shutting down one platform to get a lion's share of the synergy, but instead one where we're trying to make sure we maximize the efficiencies while not trying to hurt the revenue growth trajectory. And so this is -- the synergy on the surface might look relatively smaller compared to maybe some other things that you compare it against. But when you put it in that framework, that's one that deals very right, obviously, there's some upside as we dig into this. And if there's some upside, we'll obviously take that upside. This is very comfortable with what we've done to work with to support the growth profile of the business."

I think a perfect example of that is the way where we started at the beginning of the year with our revenue expectations and how we have outperformed that. And as we continue to invest in the business throughout the year, we got more confidence around investing more to be able to grab some share there. So I will say that the earlier comment that Troy made, we do not, in that revenue growth for this year, have any impact related to the CFPB.

          Let me take the first part of that, Jim, and I'm sure John can add to it. Geographically, when we look at the geographical disbursement of their business, it's not too dissimilar from what you find when you look at the geographical disbursement of our business on our direct business. The states that you find contributing the most are typically the same top 5 or 6 states, number one. Number two, I think John touched on this in his prepared remarks that there are some overlaps, but there are also some complementary areas of his business. But I think one of the things that we find strengthening to us, it is very strong in the FI side. And as you know, we're very strong on the FI side of the issuing. So we see that as a complement. We both are in the ISV business. Ours began approximately a year ago on a de novo basis. As we've indicated earlier, John's business is pushing 30% of his revenues in that space. So I think over the next 60 to 90 days, we obviously will have to take some real quality time to understand all of our go-to-market dynamics as we look at our sales force, his sales force, his partners and our partners. And I think we can shed a lot more light on that at our first quarter call. John, do want to add to that?"

I think the second portion of that strong and selling more is really leveraging multichannel solutions for all merchants and really extending the products in a holistic way for all that TSYS has to offer. The second prong is really about losing less, leveraging great operating excellence and really what Troy was touching on with the integrated division, continue to change the mix of our business to more integrated and high-growth verticals really will kind of change the business over time long-term both again U.S. and again, long-term internationally as well."

It's not something that we're highlighting that has dramatically shifted in the overall margin of the business.

So it's not one of those situations where we're providing a trade-off where you happen to not invest on the growth side because you've got some higher synergy number to try to kind of make deal economics. That's one of the beauties of this transaction is the high accretive nature of the transaction without having to have a very high synergy number that can then cost you on the growth side because you happen to chase the synergies on the expense side and starve the growth profile. So with that kind of being the overall wrapper, that's the machination of how we got to those relevant amounts. But in general, I'd say, that, obviously, we'll be investing on the higher growth side of the business, which John has done in his business, and we've been doing in our business around the integrated side, the e-commerce side and those differentiated distribution capabilities in high-growth verticals.

This transaction because of the like-kind clients and other business units, really affords us the benefit to kind of cross-sell and get introductions across the company. I mean, I think it's longer term, but it's really unique to be one of the few companies that have a long-term potential to leverage issuing, acquiring and prepaid in one location with like-kind clients so we'll be taking advantage of that."

After that, we'll open the call up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] 
I'll now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about our future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS' actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that are set forth in TSYS' reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Troy Woods."

Good afternoon, and happy new year. Without a doubt, this is a type of earnings call a CEO dreams about: reporting a great quarter, performing with operational excellence during the holiday shopping period, reporting a record earnings year and, from a shareholder perspective, producing a 47.8% total shareholder return for 2015, making TSYS the ninth best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the year. And of course, the icing on the cake is the announcement earlier today of the strategic and transformative acquisition of TransFirst, a leading U.S. acquirer of payment solutions. This will be the largest acquisition in our history at $2.35 billion. This is truly a watershed event for our company, team members and shareholders, and we are all very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We are also very pleased to have John Shlonsky, CEO of TransFirst, here with us this afternoon. And he, Paul and I will provide additional details on the strategic rationale for this new partnership and take questions a little later in our presentation. 
Before we get to that, I want to take a few minutes to call out some significant highlights for the quarter and for the year. The fourth quarter was our best quarter in our 33-year history. We produced record-setting transactions, authorizations and volumes. Holiday authorizations on same-client basis were up 12.7% in North America and 10% in our International segment. We repurchased 3 million shares of our stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our total repurchases for the year to 5.2 million shares for $242.1 million. These repurchases, coupled with dividends, represented a return in excess of 92% of our available free cash flow to shareholders in 2015, a 31% increase over last year. 
On the segment front, there are a few callouts I would like to mention. First is North America. The North America segment produced record revenues, operating income and transactions for the year. Our traditional accounts on file increased 37% on a year-over-year quarter basis, and we ended the year with 654.1 million total accounts on file. Our EMV chip card production soared in the fourth quarter, increasing over 400% over the fourth quarter of 2014. All in all, it was another exceptional quarter for our North America segment. 
Turning our attention to the International segment. Perhaps the biggest achievement for the International segment was the attainment of its 4-year goal to achieve a minimum 18% margin by year-end 2015. We ended the year at 18.1%. The outstanding 24.5% fourth quarter margin was a catalyst to achieving our goal. We are very proud of the team for their relentless focus and determination to reach this very important goal by year-end. 
On the business development front in the International segment, we signed a letter of intent to provide processing solutions in 2 regional markets in Latin America. This processing will be performed in Brazil, generating scale by leveraging our platform investment that currently supports the market-leading retail cards business of Carrefour. 
As we move to Merchant, a few quick callouts. For the quarter, direct revenue increased 15.4% and indirect revenue increased 10.4%. The excellent fourth quarter helped propel overall revenue growth for the segment of 8.8% for the year. Continued momentum in our ISV channel, new product offerings like OptBlue improved sales productivity, and EMV terminal activity all contributed to our strong growth for the quarter. 
And lastly, a few important comments about NetSpend. NetSpend produced its 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth of 20.9%. We were successful in introducing our payroll, incentive and disbursement cards program within Capital One, the 10th largest bank in the United States. Also during the quarter, we expanded our products and our relationship with both Rite Aid and Walmart. 
All in all, it was good execution and performance by all segments in the fourth quarter, providing a good foundation and momentum as we move into 2016. After today's announcement, our reach and distribution uniquely positions us to provide innovative products and solutions that our clients and customers need to adapt to the evolving payment landscape. Now is our moment to unlock these opportunities in payments and continue to deliver strong results for TSYS, our customers and our shareholders. 
I'll now ask Paul Todd to provide additional detailed financial information on our quarter, the year-end and review our guidance for 2016. Paul?"
308973,320953462,921970,"Total System Services, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Total System Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Troy, and before we review the transaction we are announcing today, I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the performance of the company this year specifically related to the achievement of our strategic and financial goals on an in",2777,"Thank you, Troy, and before we review the transaction we are announcing today, I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the performance of the company this year specifically related to the achievement of our strategic and financial goals on an individual segment and corporate basis. Each of our segments performed better than we expected when we started the year and provide us with a good launching pad as we entered 2016. I want to point out at the start that any guidance or expectations I give regarding segment or consolidated performance for '16 does not include the transaction we have announced today. 
Now digging into the results, starting on Slide 7. At the consolidated level, our revenue before reimbursables increased 13.3% for the quarter, resulting in a full year increase for 2015 of 14%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $195 million and $833.9 million for the year, representing a year-over-year increase of $121.7 million or 17.1%. 
Finally, on adjusted EPS from continuing operations, the $0.57 for the quarter allowed for $2.46 adjusted EPS on a yearly basis, which represents a 25.5% increase from prior year and in line with our guidance range we provided last quarter of $2.43 to $2.47. This EPS performance was driven by the fantastic results from our segments, the tax benefits that I mentioned last quarter as well as other drivers. On a comparative basis for the quarter, the $0.01 decline from last year was primarily due to a onetime item in 4Q of '14 in our International segment, higher incentive compensation in 2015 versus 2014 and strategic investments in NetSpend, among other items. 
Before I leave the consolidated financial highlights, I want to point out that our quarterly revenue growth of 13.3% and the yearly revenue growth of 14% is all organic and was driven by cross-segment organic performance across our businesses throughout the year, and our ability to take that revenue growth to the bottom line was seen in our margin expansion for the year. This combination of pure organic revenue growth with margin expansion is a key takeaway from our 2015 consolidated results.  
Now to explain our results in more detail, let's turn to Slide 9 and I will cover our North America segment first. The key headline on the North America segment is the same as it has been all year, and that is mid- to high-teen organic revenue growth. Revenue before reimbursables for the segment was up 17.5% for the quarter to $300.3 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. As you can see on the chart, the business has had an impressive string of positive revenue growth and the 20.2% organic revenue growth for the year is the highest yearly revenue growth for this business since 1999. We have started the year expecting this business to grow in the mid-teen range of organic growth, so the 20.2% growth level exceeded our expectations for the year, which was largely driven by the successful conversion of a large client and better organic growth with our customers. Also contributing was the growth in our core offerings as well as other services to include fraud, loyalty, card production and managed services. We began the year expecting this revenue growth to be achieved at roughly the same margin levels that we saw in 2014 but to perform in a tighter quarterly band, and that's exactly what happened in 2015: Segment margin expanded from 36.8% in 2014 to 37.4% in 2015. 
On the volume front, total accounts on file for the quarter increased 18.9% with our traditional accounts on file increasing 37.3%, taking us to an all-time high of 415 million traditional accounts on file. I mentioned on our last call that the total accounts on file would start showing some declines due to the previously announced de-conversions of RushCard and Green Dot. This is why we continue to discuss the traditional accounts on file metric, which excludes prepaid, government services and single-use accounts that can vary substantially and are less correlated to revenue. We couldn't be more pleased with the performance of this North America segment both on a quarterly and full year basis. The business is positioned well for 2016 as we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for this segment in 2016 with slightly expanding margins. 
Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on Slide 10, where the key headline, as Troy discussed, is the achievement of a full year margin of 18.1%. We announced this as a target 4 years ago, and the management team in this segment has had a laser focus to not only improve margins but to enhance the business model as well, and we are proud of this achievement. 
Segment revenue for the quarter was $87.1 million, down 6.2% on a reported basis and down 0.6% on a constant-currency basis. I highlighted in our third quarter call that the last 6 quarters of solid constant-currency revenue growth would likely not continue in the fourth quarter due to a onetime item in the fourth quarter of 2014 that provides a challenging grow [ph] over comparison. Excluding the impact of this onetime item, constant-currency revenue was up 6.3%, which is a better reflection of the performance of the segment. The revenue growth for the quarter was, again, fueled by the 4 new clients we've converted since 2014. And these new clients, coupled with our existing client base, are outperforming the market. And as we mentioned on previous calls, they are lifting this segment from being a roughly flat constant-currency growth picture to one of low to mid-single digits. 
On the margin front, I called out on our last call that we expected the margin to decline in the fourth quarter from fourth quarter 2014 levels due to the onetime item in 4Q of '14 that I mentioned earlier. And from a volume perspective, accounts on file grew 11.9 million compared to the same quarter of last year, over half of which was due to new clients. This means we continue to break records for the number of accounts processed in this segment now standing at 78.5 million accounts on file. I would like to emphasize, again, that most of this growth is in commercial card and single-use accounts. As in previous quarters, we also experienced significant growth in the debit portfolios we process. The segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth with same-client transactions growing by 6.7%.  
In summary, on International, we're pleased with the continued execution of margin improvement, coupled with a steady constant-currency revenue growth picture, and for 2016 for this segment, we expect constant-currency revenue growth in the flat to low single-digit range, with a slightly improving margin picture. 
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 11, where the key headline for this segment is organic growth, driven by both lines of business shifting the indirect line of business from being a headwind to finally being a tailwind for this segment during the quarter. The split in our revenue mix is now 61% direct and 39% indirect. 
Revenue in the direct line of business increased 15.4% for the quarter from last year, with SBS sales volume also experiencing double-digit growth of 11.3% for the quarter. 
On the indirect side, we continue to retain our core customers, renewing 2 of our top 25 this quarter while also bringing on new customers signing 2 new full service agreements during the quarter. A key takeaway is that we achieved positive growth in our indirect business for the quarter and year, and that is a major accomplishment for this side of the business, given the pressures it has had over the last several years. Segment margins declined 210 basis points for the fourth quarter due to some onetime expenses we chose to make around efficiency improvement in this segment. 
Overall, it was a strong quarter and year for the Merchant segment, and we are well positioned on this front to capture more market share in the future and expect that 2016 revenue growth for this segment to be in the mid-single-digit range for the year with slightly improving margins from 2015 levels. 
Now I want to talk about the fantastic performance of the NetSpend segment, starting on Slide 12. The highlight for the segment is the 20.9% organic revenue growth for the quarter, bringing the overall revenue growth of NetSpend for the year over the 20% mark at 20.2%. The strength in NetSpend's organic growth is derived from a combination of its winning management team, coupled with market differentiated channel offerings and excellent strategic execution to produce these outstanding results in this competitive and fast-moving sector of the payments industry. While this business outperformed our revenue growth expectations, we did comment this time last year that we would invest in our business for growth that could cause some margin pressure, and that's exactly what happened in our fourth quarter with our quarterly adjusted operating margin of 19.9%, delivering a yearly margin of 23.7%, which is down from the 26.6% in 2014. I want to point out that these are investment cycle decisions that we're glad to make to support the business growth, and we will continue to make these decisions on a go-forward basis as long as we see the line-of-sight path to growth. 
The volume growth behind these results is equally as impressive. We saw a 17.7% growth in our direct deposit active cards to 1.9 million for the quarter. We finished the quarter with $5.7 billion in GDV, up 21.3%. While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we're also constantly focused on expanding our distribution reach by adding approximately 7,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 96,000. One of the most noteworthy contributors to the fourth quarter increase in distributing locations and employers was our launch in Rite Aid stores, a multiyear distribution relationship that we signed last quarter. 
Overall, 2015 was a banner year for NetSpend. Our expectation right now for this business is for the revenue growth for 2016 to be in the low double-digit growth range on a full year basis, with a slightly expanding margin, although we could choose to make investment decisions for growth later in the year in '16 as we did this year that could impact margin. 
Turning back to the consolidated results on Slide 13. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 23.4%, and we finished the year with an adjusted operating margin of 26.7% as seen on Page 14, which was primarily fueled by the improving year-over-year margins in 3 of our 4 segments. This consolidated margin falls into the range that we anticipated at the beginning of the year, and we expect the consolidated operating margin in 2016 to slightly improve from this current level. I want to state that Slides 13 and 14 provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, NetSpend M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. 
Now let's talk about our cash position for a moment. We ended the year at $389 million in cash, a $59 million decrease from the third quarter of last year. Our largest cash outflow of $159 million was related to our stock repurchase, with the next being about $67 million of CapEx, of which about 12% was related to contract acquisition costs, with 27% related to property and equipment and the remaining 61% being related to internally developed and licensed software. 
On cash flow on Slide 16, our free cash flow for the quarter was $72.5 million, resulting in a full year free cash flow of $397 million and slightly below the $420 million to $440 million we have projected. But as I said on our last call, we had some decisions that we made regarding CapEx in the fourth quarter that were good for the business long term so we made them. 
For 2016, we expect our capital expenditures to be in a similar range as 2015 levels, and we estimate that free cash flow will be in the $470 million to $500 million range for the full year of 2016, an approximate increase of 18% to 26% from 2015 levels. This growing level of free cash flow is another strong indicator of the health of the business and the ability of our businesses to generate strong free cash flow. 
As it relates to shares, as Troy mentioned, we repurchased 3 million shares for $158.6 million during the quarter, which resulted in the total amount of shares repurchased in 2015 of 5.2 million. As a result, we ended the year with 182.8 million of common shares outstanding, with the average basic weighted shares outstanding at 184.1 million. 
On taxes, we ended the year at an effective tax rate of 29.9%, which was about 300 basis points better than we expected at the start of the year, and we believe our estimated tax rate for 2016 to return to the more historical range of 32% to 34%. I want to point out that this 300 basis point increase in tax rate change in 2016 expected levels from 2015 levels is the main driver as to why our expected adjusted EPS growth rate is not in the same range as the expected growth rate and adjusted EBITDA or operating income. 
And speaking of 2016, as it relates to guidance on Page 17, we highlight our full year consolidated guidance of total revenue growth of 4% to 6%, revenues before reimbursables growth of 5% to 7% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of 4% to 7% growth. We also expect consolidated adjusted margin to increase by approximately 100 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin to increase by approximately 100 basis points. Obviously, this guidance hinges upon the assumptions I've already mentioned and the ones mentioned on Page 44 in the presentation. And I want to highlight that this guidance reflects the excellent operating leverage we continue to get because if you remove the 300 basis point increase in our tax line, you see the growth from the bottom line exceeding our revenue growth by several percentage points. Also, this expected margin expansion is driven by expanding margins in all our businesses continuing the trend of cross-segment delivery of performance we saw in 2015. 
And finally, I want to mention some full year callouts that I think are key takeaways from today. The first callout is on organic growth. The fourth quarter was similar to the third quarter, in that with no acquisitions completed during the quarter, it allows for organic growth clarity in our results. When you look at the 17.5% quarterly revenue growth in North America, the constant-currency revenue growth net of onetime item comparisons in International, the 15% direct acquiring revenue growth in Merchant and the 20.9% revenue growth in NetSpend all coming from non-acquisition activity, you see a strong picture of organic revenue growth that played out throughout the year. While the overall organic growth number is strong, we're equally pleased with the cross-segment delivery of organic growth that each of our businesses has delivered. 
The second major callout is on margins. Each of our 4 segments delivered margins that were either in excess or generally met are previously communicated expectations for the year. The margin profile of our segments are strong relative to their respective competitors and the ability to draw -- drive margin expansion or stability while also investing in the business was a big accomplishment for 2015. And the third and final callout is related to how the performance of 2015 positions us for 2016 and beyond. Our North American organic growth story, with a platform now of 415 million traditional accounts on file, our International margin progress coupled now with the strengthening growth effort, our improving segment revenue picture in Merchant and strong double-digit revenue growth at NetSpend all delivered with competitively strong margins all at the same time paints a picture of TSYS that is unlike any in our history. It is a unique time for our company to have all businesses performing in the manner that our segments are performing, and specifically, we want to thank each and every team member from across the globe who worked so hard to deliver the performance we've announced today.  Without their daily efforts and commitment, none of these would be possible. 
Now I want to turn it back over to Troy to discuss this exciting transaction that we announced today."

I'll provide some additional transaction details beginning on Slide 20. As all of you know, our intent over the past year or so has been to grow the scale and position of our Merchant business through accretive M&A. With the acquisition of TransFirst, we will have a winning combination of technology, scale and partner-centric distribution capabilities that propels us to a leadership position in the acquiring market. Importantly, TransFirst's focus on partner-centric, vertically specialized distribution will accelerate our growth within the highly attractive integrated payments space. 
Post-closing, this specific distribution model will comprise approximately 20% of the revenue of the combined businesses. Based on an analysis by First Annapolis Consulting, on a pro forma basis, this would make TSYS the third largest integrated payments provider in the U.S. As I have said before, I believe the winners in Merchant acquiring will be the scale players with integrated capabilities and a diverse distribution network. This transaction with TransFirst strengthens our sales and distribution network, with the addition of over 1,300 partners and more than 350 sales professionals, enhancing our access to high growth, strategically attractive vertical markets such as health care, B2B and not-for-profit. 
In addition to the many strategic benefits, the transaction is financially attractive from both an earnings and valuation perspective. We currently expect the transaction to be accretive in the low double digits to adjusted EPS for the first full year post-closing. The transaction will be an all-cash transaction, with an implied multiple of 13.8x estimated 2016 adjusted EBITDA. 
On a pro forma basis, our balance sheet will continue to remain strong as our investment-grade rating is important to us. We are confident that the combined valuation and synergies will drive material shareholder value. A contributing factor to these financial benefits is the size and attractive growth profile of the industry itself. As you can see, on Slide 21, the U.S. acquiring market is a very large market. It is the largest addressable market in which TSYS participates. A materially significant portion of the $13 billion addressable market is the small and medium-sized business segment, which represents approximately 75% of the total acquiring revenue pool. This segment of the market is currently and will continue to be our primary focus. 
The overall acquiring market is growing, almost twice the projected growth rate of U.S. GDP. Driving that attractive growth are e-commerce and integrated payments, which are growing at 10% and 12%, respectively. This acquisition, coupled with our existing business, dramatically improves our competitive position within these 2 important areas. As you can see on Slide 22, how they will contribute to our Merchant transformation. At the end of the day, TSYS made it to enhance its Merchant business in order to remain competitive in the rapidly changing acquiring landscape. Today, with the acquisition of TransFirst, we are transforming our Merchant business to one which has a strong competitive position in high-growth areas of the market, a business mix where over 80% of the segment's revenue will come from direct acquiring and scale across all key metrics, Merchants, transactions and sales volume. Together, these attributes contribute to an improved growth profile and leadership position for the Merchant segment. We believe it is a strategic imperative to hold a leadership position in the markets in which we play. Slide 23 shows that this combination positions us as the sixth largest U.S. Merchant acquirer based on net revenue, with 3 strategically important benefits: one, an expanded sales and distribution network; two, a stronger integrated payments channel; and three, enhanced multichannel payment solutions. 
With this established leadership position in all of our businesses, we have created a strong, unique and balanced portfolio positioned across the payment spectrum as indicated on Slide 24. We have incredible strength in our issuer processing business, touching more than 700 million cardholders and 400 payment providers around the globe. Our market share reaches almost 40% of all credit cards in the United States, and we are the #1 provider of these services in the United States, in China and #2 in Europe. Through our combination with TransFirst, we will serve as more than 645,000 merchant outlets, process approximately $117 billion in annual volume and leverage over 2,300 distribution partners. In our NetSpend business, we're ranked #1 based on gross dollar volume and #2 based on revenue. 
TSYS now reaches several hundred banks, hundreds of thousands of businesses and millions of consumers. The scale, reach and distribution network we are creating positions us to serve as a single destination for unparalleled payment technologies and enhanced services to the constituents we serve in a space undergoing massive change. We are excited to have John and the TransFirst team on board and are confident that through our combined talents, expertise and strengths, we will continue to win in the market. 
Now I would like to turn it over to John Shlonsky to make a few comments."

TransFirst has and still utilizes TSYS for front-end, back-end and gateway services. The combination of the 2 organizations makes perfect sense and gives us a strong leadership position in acquiring. I can tell you firsthand, our main interaction with TSYS and particularly with the executive team makes me feel confident that our values and how we treat each other and our clients are firmly aligned. 
On Slide 26, let me tell you a little bit about TransFirst and how our value proposition will be further enhanced as part of TSYS. First, we operate a partner-centric model. This model enables us to gain access to a large number of SMB merchants in a scalable and cost-effective manner. Joining TSYS will enable us to bring even stronger solutions to these partners. 
Second, we operate a single integrated platform. This platform actually evolved from our utilization of TSYS payment solutions. Our mission with TSYS is to leverage our joint capabilities and products to our customers in a seamless way so they can rely on just one provider for all their processing requirements. 
Third, it will be increasingly important to develop customized and user-friendly solutions that enable our Merchant customers to sell our products in a store, on the Internet or remotely through a mobile device on our platform. 
And lastly, all of the information used has been built around a single database. This really provides customers with a high level of technical and customer service and support. For example, we provide error-free boarding in minutes, automatic credit approval, one-call resolution 85% of the time. We will strive to leverage best practices across both Merchant segments as we integrate these 2 already great companies. 
Slide 27 really illustrates how fortunate we are with this new partnership to have some businesses that overlap and some that complement our total addressable market. This is the clearest example of our go-to-market strategy. TransFirst goes to market with 2 distinct models: an integrated and a referral partnership model. Our integrated model is where partners really require more vertical expertise and technical specialization. Our referral partners will focus more on our service model and our product capabilities. Both of these models leverage our platform and our product set. Similar to TSYS, we work with financial institutions, trade associations, national business service providers to provide payments and solutions to their base and new Merchant customers. These solutions provide enhanced brand loyalty and revenue opportunities for all of our combined referral partners. TransFirst and TSYS will combine automation and technology to support an integrated platform that will seamlessly deliver relevant products and solution to our partners and merchants, not just process transactions. Our goal is for any merchant, for many partners to have complete access to relevant and easy-to-use payment solutions. 
So on Slide 28, why are we so excited? This is a strong cultural fit. Both companies show a deep ethical values of doing the right thing and treating people right with shared values around integrity, trust, innovation and partnerships, relationships. Ease of integration, the flexibility of TransFirst's single platform that we developed working with TSYS technology will allow for this easier transition. Our enhanced offerings by leveraging each other's strengths, this allows us to bring best-in-class products and solutions to all of our partners and merchants. And most importantly, really foster a holistic growth. And this transaction will provide TSYS significant scale and strength across issuing processing, Merchant Services and prepaid program management. We are very, very happy about this partnership. We have some work to do but couldn't be more excited to merge these 2 great organizations. 
I would now like to turn it back over to Paul."

And I want to reiterate my excitement about this transformational acquisition. 
Looking at Slide 30, as Troy said, we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TransFirst for $2.35 billion in an all-cash transaction. We anticipate the transaction will produce low, double-digit adjusted EPS accretion in the first 12 months, excluding onetime deal-related expenses. The transaction will be funded with fully committed debt financing. At closing on a pro forma basis, we will have approximately $3.8 billion of debt, and pro forma leverage for our company is expected to be approximately 3.9x debt to trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA. The strong cash flow generation of the business allows us to get back to our long-term target leverage ratio of the low- to mid-2s within 24 months of closing. We will limit our share buyback and acquisition activity during this period until we achieve our more targeted leverage ratios, and we are committed to our investment-grade rating. We're excited about the leadership of John and his team, as they will be able to expand upon the great results I talked about from our Merchant segment earlier. We're also excited about the expense synergy opportunity from the efficiencies we can realize in our combined businesses. As such, we currently estimate we would generate at least $15 million of cost synergies in calendar year 2017, with that almost doubling to the range of $25 million to $30 million in calendar year 2018. And as I said, we expect the deal to produce low double-digit adjusted EPS accretion in the first 12 months after close net of onetime related expenses with $5 million of synergies and move to the mid to high double-digit range over the longer term as larger synergies are captured over time. This also does not reflect the anticipated revenue synergies that we believe are attainable from this new payments platform company. This new combined Merchant segment will be able to work with our strong issuer processing business, specifically with the bank referral partner business of TransFirst, and with NetSpend specifically with their PayCard business. While these revenue synergies may take some time to materialize, given the strong organic growth nature of each of these businesses on their own, there clearly is an opportunity set of revenue growth here that we expect to achieve. And this is a unique combination of capabilities and payments for one company to leverage. 
Given the strong historical track record of non-acquisition-fueled organic growth from TransFirst, coupled with our Merchant segment's embedded organic growth capabilities and the overall organic growth of TSYS, we believe the combined organic growth profile of the company will be improved and will be unique in the payments industry as to its balance and diversification of payments-related growth. While we provided revenue before reimbursable guidance today in the 5% to 7% range all organically, we expect the combination of TransFirst's historically organic double-digit revenue growth to improve TSYS' revenue growth profile by approximately 100 basis points annually on a pro forma basis. After closing, we will obviously come back and revise our 2016 guidance to reflect the positive impact we expect this combination to have on our 2016 financial results. 
Now on Slide 31, I hope you can see why this acquisition is so compelling as it establishes TSYS as a clear leader in this highly attractive market, accelerating our growth in integrated payments and strengthening our partnership distribution capabilities. These, coupled with the expected financial benefits I just reviewed and under John's leadership, signal that we have completed another step in fulfilling our strategic vision of being the leading global payments solutions provider. 
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

And then second, if could you just talk on the quarter and help us understand going forward how we should think about -- I know you gave some guidance on margins, in particular, going forward in the North America Merchant Services segment, et cetera, but just -- we saw some contraction there, I think about 200 basis points in the Merchant Services and then 400 or so on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter in North America. And I think you saw extremely strong top line growth, but I think just that contraction there just maybe drove EPS a little bit lower than we had personally anticipated."

So it's kind of a combination of factors, but the strongest factor was the organic growth of the processing customers that are in that indirect side of the business. And as it relates to margins, I think as it relates '16 margins, I commented in my prepared remarks on all of the different segment margins that we are expecting yearly margins to increase slightly in each one of our segments and, certainly, would address the North America segment margin story. I think as I also commented as it relates to fourth quarter margin, we did see, given the banner years that we had in really all of the segments in the fourth quarter, we did have some incentive compensation and some pay relative to the team members delivering this great performance that impacted the fourth quarter margin. But I think the bigger story that you want to take away from a margin standpoint is strong margins, certainly in North America, and we see that margin picture expanding in 2016."

So we'll continue to look at that as we progress in '16. We expect, as I said, the margin to expand in '16. But I also said if an opportunity presents itself, like it did this year in the latter part of '16 for us to invest for future growth in this business, we may make that decision. I think I'd point out that, that's one of the benefits of having strong businesses altogether inside of TSYS is, we're able to make decisions around pro-growth things that on one specific segment might depress a segment margin, but on the overall basis were still very margin strong.

And I think it's important to point out that this is a growth-based acquisition. It is not an acquisition where it's around kind of making the financials work due to expense cuts. The TransFirst historical organic growth model is a double-digit organic growth model. And what we now have in our Merchant business also is primed for very strong organic growth. And so in putting these businesses together, we want to make sure that we're maximizing the organic growth capabilities while also, obviously, taking the expense synergies that are available to take. As it relates to platform, there is platform synergies today because the TransFirst business is already using predominantly our front end platform. So it isn't like typical acquisition sometimes where you have 2 different platforms and you're kind of shutting down one platform to get a lion's share of the synergy, but instead one where we're trying to make sure we maximize the efficiencies while not trying to hurt the revenue growth trajectory. And so this is -- the synergy on the surface might look relatively smaller compared to maybe some other things that you compare it against. But when you put it in that framework, that's one that deals very right, obviously, there's some upside as we dig into this. And if there's some upside, we'll obviously take that upside.

And obviously, that is something that we would like to be able to see in 2016 as well."

The states that you find contributing the most are typically the same top 5 or 6 states, number one. Number two, I think John touched on this in his prepared remarks that there are some overlaps, but there are also some complementary areas of his business. But I think one of the things that we find strengthening to us, it is very strong in the FI side. And as you know, we're very strong on the FI side of the issuing. So we see that as a complement. We both are in the ISV business. Ours began approximately a year ago on a de novo basis. As we've indicated earlier, John's business is pushing 30% of his revenues in that space. So I think over the next 60 to 90 days, we obviously will have to take some real quality time to understand all of our go-to-market dynamics as we look at our sales force, his sales force, his partners and our partners. And I think we can shed a lot more light on that at our first quarter call. John, do want to add to that?"

So it's not one of those situations where we're providing a trade-off where you happen to not invest on the growth side because you've got some higher synergy number to try to kind of make deal economics. That's one of the beauties of this transaction is the high accretive nature of the transaction without having to have a very high synergy number that can then cost you on the growth side because you happen to chase the synergies on the expense side and starve the growth profile. So with that kind of being the overall wrapper, that's the machination of how we got to those relevant amounts. But in general, I'd say, that, obviously, we'll be investing on the higher growth side of the business, which John has done in his business, and we've been doing in our business around the integrated side, the e-commerce side and those differentiated distribution capabilities in high-growth verticals.

This has been a terrific first quarter for TSYS and a very busy start of the year for all of us. Almost any measure, the first quarter exceeded our expectations. Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are net revenue up 12.7%, adjusted EPS increased 22.8% and overall margin expanded 178 basis points. These results are further confirmation that executing on our strategy is delivering exceptional results. 
On another high note, we were delighted to complete the acquisition of TransFirst on April 1, just 64 days from our announcement. I'm very proud of the teams who worked tirelessly to make this happen. And the more time we spent with John and his team at TransFirst, the more impressed we are. TransFirst is going to provide us the additional scale and reach in merchant acquiring to approach that of our issuer processing and prepaid businesses. Combining TSYS's Merchant business with TransFirst positions us as the sixth largest U.S. merchant acquirer and the third largest integrated payments provider. John and his leadership team are well underway with integration, positioning our new Merchant segment to deliver on dynamic strategies that will be implemented over the next 6 to 18 months. 
With our exceptional performance in the first quarter and with the addition of TransFirst, we are increasing our guidance for 2016. Paul will provide additional details on all of our revised guidance metrics later in our presentation.

I thought it might be appropriate to take a moment to share my perspectives on a few of the topics that have been shared with us. The 3 most discussed topics have been, one, capital allocation plans; two, go-forward growth in our North American issuance segment; and three, the potential impact of the proposed CFPB Prepaid rules with respect to overdraft. 
In terms of our capital allocation strategy, we have previously discussed our principle of returning approximately 75% of our available free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2014 and 2015, we returned 94.4% and 92.3%, [ph] respectively. This principle has always been balanced against the need to deploy capital to fund M&A opportunities. Our immediate priority and plan over the next 24 months is to use our strong free cash flow generation to delever our balance sheet until we get back to our long-term target leverage ratio, stock buybacks, M&A activities along with ongoing investments the drive exceptional business results, are all part of our capital allocation strategy to drive long-term shareholder value. 
As to our North America issuer processing growth prospects, in 2015, we performed a strategic analysis of our business and corporate strategy for long-term sustained growth. Among other things, we determined that we have significant potential for growth in our core issuer processing business, both North America and International in the form of delivering and cross-selling new products and services that clients both the need and would prefer to buy from us as a trusted provider than from someone else. As such, we have made and continue to make significant investments with the goal of enhancing our technology infrastructure and modernizing the technology framework that sits on top of our core processing platforms. We are building an open real-time platform that allows developers, partners and the greater tech community to easily commit and leverage TSYS's platforms so that we deliver innovative products and services faster and with greater quality so our teams can prototype, deploy and iterate faster than ever before. Today, just under 18% of our revenue is delivered from value-added products and services across our core issuer processing business. By aggressively developing and deploying new products and services, expanding our footprint and continuing to win new business, we believe we can continue to lever growth in our core issuer processing business. 
And lastly, on the subject of the proposed rules on prepaid from the CFPB and how they may impact mix spend and its overdraft feature. The CFPB has not yet deliver their final rules relative to prepaid products, so we really don't have much of an update to what we previously disclosed. I will remind you, however, that nearly 6,000 consumers have commented to the CFPB regarding the proposed rules. Recently, cardholders in 5 states visit Washington, D.C, to make their voices heard and asking Congress to engage with the CFPB to ensure that new regulations do not eliminate their access to [indiscernible] overdraft protection, which would lead hundreds of thousands of cardholders with very limited alternatives to meet their small short-term liquidity needs. 
We also continue our discussions with the CFPB as well. Since the proposed rules were published in 2014, we have considered multiple scenarios and possible outcomes. When the final rules are published and after an adequate review period, we will share with you what it means to our business and what our mitigation plans are. 
Let me now shift to a quick review of our business from a global perspective. In North America, where nearly 70% of economic activity is consumer generated, the economy's heath is a direct measure of an improving employment market, relatively strong auto sales, some of the lowest gas prices in 12 years and improved consumer confidence. These are the real catalysts for sustained growth. Generally, our customers in both the United States and Canada are performing better than expected and better than many of their peers. And when they grow, we grow with them. 
Against this macroeconomic backdrop, our North America issuing business in the first quarter produced record quarterly revenues, record operating income and record traditional accounts on file, and they also expanded margin by 257 basis points. Our Merchant segment increased sales volume and direct revenue by double digits and also increased their margin by 90 basis points. And NetSpend delivered record quarterly revenues, record GDV and record operating income. They also exceeded 100,000 distributing locations and employers for the quarter. We were very pleased with the performance of all of our North American businesses in the first quarter. 
Now let's take a look at the other economies around the globe, where we do business. China's $11 trillion economy is moving away from its reliance on manufacturing toward services and consumer spending. This is a good news for TSYS. China's bankcard industry is growing at a fast pace. At the end of 2015, bankcards issued in China ranked the #1 in the world and bankcard consumption rates have accelerated to the same level of those in other developed markets. Innovative payment initiatives are thriving, particularly in the mobile and Internet payment space. Overall, TSYS's joint venture with CUP Data is performing extremely well and we do not see a slowdown in their business. We still expect double-digit revenue and double-digit net income growth in 2016. 
Brazil's economy is facing one of the longest and harshest recessions in history, with growing unemployment, rising inflation, a weakening currency and political unrest. However, our steadfast client, Carrefour, maintains a strong motivation for investment and they continue to outperform the Brazilian market in both their retail and consumer credit businesses. 
Looking at Europe, the payments market continues to be challenged by regulation and competition. The level of change in the market is unprecedented and is allowing progressive issuers of credit and debit products to be creative in pursuing growth strategies. Again, we do change and disruption as a driver of new opportunities for TSYS clients and their customers. 
[indiscernible] in Asia-Pacific region is one of the fastest-growing regions in a slowing world economy. The payments market is relatively underpenetrated across most countries in the region, but growing fast. This contributes to the region having one of the highest growth rates in noncash payments in the world, averaging over 20% annual growth in areas of cards, acquiring, online and mobile. Third-party processing and hosting is a corresponding emerging need in the region. To take advantage of these opportunities, TSYS is working to upgrade clients in the regions to its PRIME system and promoting it as a consolidated platform for all issuing and acquiring. 
Across our International footprints in the first quarter, we produced strong revenue and transaction growth and ended the quarter with record accounts on file. 
Now I would like to take the opportunity to mention a few changes within the TSYS family. Later this week, we'll hold our annual shareholders' meeting, where we will recognize 2 founding members of the TSYS board: Gartner Gerard and Lynn Paise, who will retire. Gartner and Lynn have shared and served on almost all of the various TSYS board committees over the years and have been 2 of our most loyal supporters, esteemed advisers and greatest champions. We thank each of them for their 33 years of service and wish them all the best in the future. 
Also, at the shareholders' meeting, we will welcome Pam Joseph, who was elected to our board in March and will become a member of the TSYS executive leadership team serving as President and Chief Operating Officer beginning next Monday. We are very excited to have Pam join our executive leadership team. Her experience, vision and direction will help shape the future of TSYS. 
I'll now ask Paul Todd to provide additional detail and financial information and review our revised guidance for 2016. Paul?"

And I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the company's exceptional performance for the first quarter, specifically related to the strength across each of our reporting segments, the closing of TransFirst and our revised guida",3126,"Thank you, Troy. And I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the company's exceptional performance for the first quarter, specifically related to the strength across each of our reporting segments, the closing of TransFirst and our revised guidance, which incorporates the TransFirst business into our expected performance for the remainder of the year. 
Digging into the results starting on Slide 6. At the consolidated level, our net revenue increased 12.7% for the quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $230.8 million, representing a year-over-year increase of $37.4 million or 19.3%.  Finally, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.66 for the quarter, which represents a 22.8% increase from prior year. This EPS performance was driven by strong segment performance across all of our segments as well as strong performance by CUP Data. 
One thing we discussed throughout last year was the growth across all of our segments occurring at the same time and the first quarter was a continuation of this trend. Before I leave the consolidated financial results, turning to Slide 7, I want to point out that our quarterly net revenue growth of 12.7% is all organic. And our ability to take that revenue growth to the bottom line was seen in the adjusted operating income growth of 20.5% [ph] to $186.2 million and adjusted operating margin of 27.7% representing a margin improvement of 178 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This combination of pure organic revenue growth with this margin expansion is a key takeaway from our first quarter consolidated results. 
Now to explain our results in more detail, let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our North American segment first, where the key headline for this segment is the strong organic revenue growth of 14.1%. As you will remember, this quarter marks the anniversary of the largest client conversion history that happened mid-first quarter last year. The incremental impact from this conversion plus continued organic growth for much of our client base and a few onetime revenue items drove revenue before reimbursables up 14.1% over quarter 1 of 2015 to $303.6 [ph] million. This amount represents another record highs for revenues in the quarter, surpassing that of the fourth quarter of 2015. 
During the quarter, we signed 4 contract extensions that included commercial, consumer and managed services as well as a healthcare contract renewal. 
As it's been the recent pattern, this double-digit revenue growth was driven by the large conversion as well as by broad-based growth in our core offerings as well as growth in our Value Added Services, managed services and loyalty services. However, I think it is important for you to remember that in the quarters ahead, we will begin to see the year-over-year impact of our departure from the prepaid processing space within this segment due to the loss of UniRush and ongoing deconversion of Green Dot. But to reiterate our statement in our last call, we still expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for this segment for the full year. 
As for this segment's operating income, it also reached at historical level of $124.8 million, up 21.7% over last year, resulting in a segment operating margin of 41.1%. This growth rate was aided by the onetime revenue items mentioned earlier and a onetime favorable impact of state R&D tax credit with flow-through operations. Without these onetime items, this 1Q margin is consistent with the 1Q 2015 margin of 38.5%. And we expect the margins of this segment to remain in the approximate range of 37% to 39% for the rest of the year and still expect the margin on a full year basis in this segment to expand slightly from the 37.4% margin in calendar year 2015. 
From a volume perspective, you can see from the slide that our traditional accounts on file continue to show steady growth and we reached a new record level of 423.3 million accounts. The higher percentage growth rates reflected in previous quarters is obviously due to the large conversion last year. And I'll point out that we were -- we provided these bar charts to focus on our traditional accounts on file levels and growth rates, which we consistently stated are a better metric of our revenue performance. Historically, these charts have shown total accounts on file that are the sum of both our traditional accounts on file as well as prepaid government services and single-use accounts. As we've said in the past, these nontraditional accounts can vary substantially and the numbers of accounts are less correlated to revenue. We've rolled out some new formatting changes to our report this quarter and our graphs will now show traditional accounts on file, given its tighter connection to revenue, but we will continue to provide information on both. 
As Troy mentioned, we believe we have growth potential within our by driving additional growth in profits from the sale of innovative products and related services that our clients need. We are committed to being a more product-driven organization, and we are redeploying and refocusing resources within our issuer product group and across our IT teams. Overall, we're pleased with the strong first quarter performance of the North American segment. 
Now I want to move International segment highlights on Slide 9, where the key highlight is the continuing expanding margin with an improving constant currency revenue growth picture. During the fourth quarter call, we shared that the segment achieved a full year margin of 18.1% [ph] based on the target announced 4 years ago. If this is a base, the segment will continue to strive for margin expansion with an improving revenue growth picture. The first quarter of 2016 saw strong results for the segment with net revenue of $75.4 million, up 2.2% on a reported basis and up 9.2% on a constant currency basis. The revenue growth for the quarter was again fueled by the 4 new clients converted last year, coupled with strong organic growth from existing clients. We start to annualize these new client in the March, April time frame, and this is why we still anticipate segment revenue growth to be in the low single-digit range on a constant currency basis for full year 2016. 
On the margin front, our Q1 margin of 13.7% was up 420 basis point improvement over Q1 of '15, and we still expect some margin improvement in 2016 net of any negative currency impact. From a volume perspective, traditional accounts on file grew 4 million to a record level of 65.5 million, up 6.6% from the prior year. And we continue to break records for the number of accounts processed in this segment, now standing at 80.8 [ph] million accounts on file. I would like to emphasize that most of this growth is in the single-use and debit account areas. This segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth of 8.1% with same-client transactions growing by 7.6%. 
While not included in the segment's financial results, our results from our CUP Data partnership were also strong for Q1. Our joint venture with CUP continues to be expectations for both of our organizations and we expect continued growth in this business, despite the slowdown of the Chinese economy's growth rate. Overall, we were pleased with our International segment's performance for the quarter. 
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10, where the key headline for this segment was a strong performance leading up to the announcement of our closing of the TransFirst acquisition. Our revenue grew 9.3% for the quarter versus the first quarter of 2015. The direct business saw 10.6% growth and our indirect business had 7.2% year-over-year growth. The growth of our small and medium business sales volume was up 9 point -- 11.9% year-over-year and our indirect business grew POS transactions by 10.8% year-over-year. 
Within our indirect business, we continue to retain our core customers renewing 2 of our top 25, while also signing a new full service agreements during the quarter. We remain committed to our indirect partners, in this line of business will continue to be important for the combined TSYS TransFirst business on a go-forward basis as it generates strong margins and cash flow and creates a platform that powers our direct business. 
On the direct side, we have continued to gain traction on the integrated payments front with ISPs. And with integration of TransFirst, we can further expand across the entire merchant base we serve. 
From a margin perspective, we experienced an overall increase of 90 basis points for the first quarter, which is important in our plans to expand the margin in this segment in 2016. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the Merchant segment and we still believe success in this space will require the first distribution channels and scale for operating leverage. With TransFirst, we are now well-positioned with a robust partner-centric distribution model that yields access to millions of SMB merchants in a scalable and cost-efficient way. We're pleased with the Merchant segment's performance in the first quarter, and we are merging the TSYS and TransFirst businesses from positions of strength. 
Now I want to talk about the strong performance of the NetSpend segment starting on Slide 11. The highlights for this segment is the 19.3% organic revenue growth for the quarter. Revenue of $185 million represents a record-setting tax season and this is the highest quarterly revenue in NetSpend's history. As you remember, we made significant investments for growth in this business during the fourth quarter of 2015. This resulted in excellent organic Q1 revenue growth in 2016 tax season volumes. The first quarter had over $9 billion [ph] of gross dollar volume or spend, up 19.6% over the prior year. We exited the quarter with almost 4.9 million active cards, almost 2.8 million of which are on direct deposits, which continues to be a relentless focus for the NetSpend team. First quarter margin [indiscernible] consistent with the prior year of 22.8%. I will remind you that NetSpend's first quarter margins tend to be the lowest quarter of the year because of our investments in marketing and customer acquisition efforts to support a successful tax season. 
While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we're also consistently focus on expanding our distribution network by adding approximately 3,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 100,000. The 2016 tax season has been one of continued excellent performance by our NetSpend segment and we're pleased with the way we are positioned coming out of Q1. Our expectation for this business continues to be for revenue growth to be in the low double digits on a full year basis with expanding margins for 2016 versus 2015. 
Now back to the consolidated financial results starting on Slide 12. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 27.7%, consistent with the expanding margin story I mentioned on our last call. Also, I want to state that Slide 12 provides a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, TransFirst M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. 
Now let's talk about our cash position on Slide 13 for a moment. We ended the quarter at $445 million in cash, excluding $1.5 billion received from our notes offering, a $55.8 million increase from the fourth quarter of last year. Our largest outflow of cash of $44.4 million was related to CapEx, of which $9.9 million was related to property and equipment, $21 million related to contract acquisition costs, with the remaining $13.5 million related to internally developed and licensed software. We've shown our cash position on this slide net of the outflow for the acquisition of TransFirst. 
On cash flow on Slide 14, our free cash flow for the quarter was $101.4 million. And with the addition of TransFirst, net of the additional bond expenses and onetime items, we expect free cash flow for the year to be in the $510 million to $514 million range. 
I want to make one comment on leverage. With the closing of TransFirst, our debt ended where we were anticipating at approximately $3.8 [ph] billion and pro forma leverage moved to approximately 3.8x debt to trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA, excluding onetime items. Our $1.5 billion notes offering in March was extremely well received, and we drew an additional $870 million of our credit facility to close the transaction. We anticipate our weighted average blended interest rate for our overall debt to be in the range of 3.15% to 3.4%, which is in line with our prior expectations of about 50 basis points higher than our pre-transaction rate. 
As Troy mentioned, regarding our capital allocation strategy, our immediate priority and plan is to use our strong free cash flow over the next 24 months to delever our balance sheet so we get back to our longer-term target leverage ratio of the low to mid- 2x range. 
From a share count perspective, we ended the quarter with 183.4 million of common shares outstanding with the average basic weighted shares outstanding at 183.3 million. On taxes, we ended the quarter at an effective tax rate of 33.6%, what is about 150 basis points lower than in Q1 of 2015. And we expect our estimated tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 33% to 34%, with it being closer to the high end of this range and expecting it to stay in that high 33% or low 34% range for each of the next 3 quarters. I want to point out that this effective tax rate increase from 2015 levels is the main driver as to why our adjusted expected EPS growth rate is not consistent with our expected growth rate in adjusted EBITDA or adjusted operating income. 
Now on guidance. We are raising our full year consolidated guidance based on the closing of the TransFirst acquisition and stronger-than-expected performance in the first quarter. On Page 15, we highlight our full year consolidated guidance of total revenue growth of 50% to 53%; net revenue growth of 2% to 24%; and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of 13% to 16% growth. We are introducing a new adjusted revenue disclosure, net revenue that better aligns our reporting with how the company measures performance internally. A reconciliation of net revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure to GAAP revenues, is included in the detailed schedules of our press release. We also expect consolidated adjusted margin to increase approximately 100 basis points over 2015, which is consistent with the margin expansion I mentioned on our last call. 
Finally, I want to mention some call outs that I think are the key takeaways from today. The first call out is on organic growth. The first quarter was another impressive quarter of purely organic growth for our company and for each of our segments and continues a stream of strong quarterly organic revenue growth in our businesses. With the closing of TransFirst, we will now have acquisition-related growth in our results on a go-forward basis, but this period of ongoing success and organic growth across all of our businesses at the same time speaks to the strength of the TSYS platform of businesses. 
The second major callout is on margins, and we will be talking a lot about margins in 2016 with our goals to increase our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 100 basis points, coming off the yield of a similar level of margin expansion in 2015. However, our goal is to expand each of our segments's margin profile to deliver a cross segment margin expansion similar to the cross segment organic revenue growth theme that we saw in 2015. Our first quarter's performance on the margin front strengthens our resolve around this goal. 
And the third and final call out is related to expected performance for the remainder of the year. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to call out 2 key points given the moving parts present in 2016. The first point is on North America. As I mentioned when I was covering the North America segment, we still expect this segment to grow in the mid-single-digit range that I mentioned in our last call. I also mentioned on our last call that the second half of the year will have lower growth than the first half, given the expected of the prepaid processing clients previously mentioned as well as other effects. We have stated we expect this segment to grow in the mid-to high single-digit range over a longer-term horizon, with expected growth being closer to the mid-single-digit range. And while we expect to achieve that in 2016, the path to that level is heavily weighted on the front half of the year. 
The second point is on our third quarter and specifically related to tax comparisons. In the third quarter of 2015, we had $0.13 of tax benefits in the quarter that we detailed in our 3Q, 2015, earnings call in schedules. Given that we have significant positive impact in 3Q of 2015, extra care must be used in modeling our 3Q expected 2016 results as the $0.13 doesn't repeat and, in fact, are expected effective tax rate for 2016 approaches the high end of our 33% to 34% range, which is higher than our 30.5% effective rate in 2015 with a significant change in the third quarter this year over the third quarter of 2015. While there are other effects in the third quarter this year versus the third quarter of last year, specifically in North America, this effect of the $0.13 in the third quarter of last year has to be properly handled in modeling to better approximate the expected performance of the third quarter of '16. And as I said on our 3Q call last year, there was a $15 million operating benefit and a net $8.5 million benefit on the tax line that has to be adjusted for in last year's three [ph] quarter results to better model 3Q of '16.  
Finally, I will wrap up by expressing how pleased we are to be raising our full year guidance or 2016 and the strength of our performance in the first quarter across all of our businesses. This strength is complemented with the addition of the outstanding colleagues and business from TransFirst. And we look forward to reporting on these combined efforts on our next call. Our team members from around the world anyone a result we have discussed today, in the have proven again that they will deliver. 
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

Yes, we -- as I talked about in the prepared remarks, obviously, coming off this very strong first quarter that had the impact of the large conversion that we did last year, we got some added growth there. The biggest single driver of kind of the growth story after that as you look forward to the remaining part of the year is, is this prepaid affect of exiting the prepaid processing side. And so that was why I mentioned the second half being lowered than the first half, and we continue to kind of see a mid to high single-digit organic revenue growth story for the North America business when we look at the fundamentals of the business. But this year, because of the dynamics that we had at play with this large conversion of scale as this exiting of the prepaid side in the second half, it presents kind of a two-sided story that lands to kind of more single-digit revenue growth picture. I think the key point around the organic growth side is that we are going to continue to focus on the processing side and seeing the growth there. And that as we mentioned, and Troy may want to add to this, on the product side, you're going to see a spend more and more time focused on the growth that we can get from the value-added product side."

But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are really several moving parts that without thinking I'll drive that. and you're right, we did some outside help in 2015 to help us look at our corporate strategy and our product deliver strategies. And one of the things that came out of that without mention was we truly believe that we have some significant runway, not only just North America, but all of our issuing processing business to continue to build out value-added products and services that our customers want and need, and according to our feedback from our customers, they prefer to get from us as their trusted adviser. So, one, additional products and services to be built. You'll hear more about this in the coming months; number two, cross-selling more aggressively the products and services that we already have. You're right, I think same-store transaction -- not store, the same transactions for the quarter were up 12.7% in North America, so very strong robust there. We also had some -- continue to have good robust growth in our EMV output services area for card personalization. It was up several hundred percent over the first quarter of 2015. So Paul, you may want to add to that?"

As I commented on our last call and reiterated again today, we still expect to see an expanding margin picture there. I think in our last call, when I said kind of slightly expanding margin picture, I think I brand it as between 25 to 100 basis points. And so that would still be to buy kind of range to be thinking about. Frankly. I'm going to make that same commentary as we walk out to kind of the band of range that I'm talking about. So from the North American standpoint, that is the margin expansion that we expect to get out of that business. But 1 point I would make about North America is -- and I made it in the prepared remarks that although we were 41%, when you kind of check out the onetime items, that pulls it down to about 38.5%. And we expect that dent to be more of the consistent bend across the quarters than maybe what we've had historically whether it's been more movement around the target. So as you move to International, same type of margin expanding story. The only caveat I would add is the currency impacts that could have some negative impact there. But on a constant currency basis, we look for the similar kind of margin expansion in that band. When we move down the merchant, it's the same kind of the story. And as I commented in our last call and what we reiterate today, the TransFirst business with the guidance we provided and on that revenue provides for an exactly almost similar margin picture. So our margin expansion story that we had pre-transFirst continues over and kind of a post-TransFirst acquisition scenario. And then finally on NetSpend, the same kind of commentary. If you kind of wrap all of that around overall 100 basis point expansion of the margin for adjusted EBITDA and overall consolidated adjusted margin, and you look at kind of how that can kind of build up, given that commentary, that's a this margin called out I made up of every and will be one of the key things we're focused on this year and we'll continue to talk about as the year progresses."

I think as it relates to the adjusted segment margin for the Merchant business, yes, I mean, that's based off of the adjusted segment margin for the merchant of when you pull the TransFirst business in, it's on our revenue conventions and you look at it on a segmented basis, the margin profile is very similar to what it was on the business pre-TransFirst. And then also, as I said, we are expecting to expand that margin in that segment. So I think the way you characterize the guidance and change that we've laid out today is generally accurate."

I think I did kind of comment earlier, we don't expect this business to grow, so I wouldn't want my confidence around the first quarter to kind of parlay itself into the kind of an improving overall growth picture of the indirect business. I think what I was trying to hit on in my prepared remarks is that the indirect side of the business is going to be a important component of the combined pieces TSYS business on a go-forward basis. It's got strong margins. As I said, it fuels our direct business from a positive standpoint. And so it's a good business that we have scale efficiencies and, which improve our cost basis and generates a lot of cash. It's got strong margins. It just doesn't have the same type of revenue growth potential that the direct side of the business had. Obviously, with the TransFirst business added, it takes a lesser contribution of the revenue going forward. So if you look, I think, it was about 39% of the revenue this quarter, that will diminish down to sub [ph] 20% on a go-forward basis. So we'll probably talk about it less moving forward just because of the smaller percentage of the whole, but I did want to make sure that from a strategic standpoint, I place the proper amount of it because it's being an important business on a go-forward basis."

This has been a terrific first quarter for TSYS and a very busy start of the year for all of us. Almost any measure, the first quarter exceeded our expectations. Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are net revenue up 12.7%, adjusted EPS increased 22.8% and overall margin expanded 178 basis points. These results are further confirmation that executing on our strategy is delivering exceptional results. 
On another high note, we were delighted to complete the acquisition of TransFirst on April 1, just 64 days from our announcement. I'm very proud of the teams who worked tirelessly to make this happen. And the more time we spent with John and his team at TransFirst, the more impressed we are. TransFirst is going to provide us the additional scale and reach in merchant acquiring to approach that of our issuer processing and prepaid businesses. Combining TSYS' Merchant business with TransFirst positions us as the sixth largest U.S. merchant acquirer and the third largest integrated payments provider. John and his leadership team are well underway with integration, positioning our new Merchant segment to deliver on dynamic strategies that will be implemented over the next 6 to 18 months. 
With our exceptional performance in the first quarter and with the addition of TransFirst, we are increasing our guidance for 2016. Paul will provide additional details on all of our revised guidance metrics later in our presentation. 
Since our fourth quarter call, Paul and I have had opportunity to connect with many of you directly to hear what's on your mind. I thought it might be appropriate to take a moment to share my perspectives on a few of the topics that have been shared with us. The 3 most discussed topics have been, one, capital allocation plans; two, go-forward growth in our North America issuing segment; and three, the potential impact of the proposed CFPB Prepaid rules with respect to overdraft. 
In terms of our capital allocation strategy, we have previously discussed our principle of returning approximately 75% of our available free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2014 and 2015, we returned 94.4% and 92.3%, respectively. This principle has always been balanced against the need to deploy capital to fund M&A opportunities. Our immediate priority and plan over the next 24 months is to use our strong free cash flow generation to delever our balance sheet until we get back to our long-term target leverage ratio, stock buybacks, M&A activities along with ongoing investments to drive exceptional business results, are all part of our capital allocation strategy to drive long-term shareholder value. 
As to our North America issuer processing growth prospects, in 2015, we performed a strategic analysis of our business and corporate strategy for long-term sustained growth. Among other things, we determined that we have significant potential for growth in our core issuer processing business, both North America and International in the form of delivering and cross-selling new products and services that clients both need and would prefer to buy from us as a trusted provider than from someone else. As such, we have made and continue to make significant investments with the goal of enhancing our technology infrastructure and modernizing the technology framework that sits on top of our core processing platforms. We are building an open real-time platform that allows developers, partners and the greater fintech community to easily commit and leverage TSYS' platforms so that we deliver innovative products and services faster and with greater quality, so our teams can prototype, deploy and iterate faster than ever before. Today, just under 18% of our revenue is delivered from value-added products and services across our core issuer processing business. By aggressively developing and deploying new products and services, expanding our footprint and continuing to win new business, we believe we can continue to lever growth in our core issuer processing business. 
And lastly, on the subject of the proposed rules on prepaid from the CFPB and how they may impact NetSpend and its overdraft feature. The CFPB has not yet deliver their final rules relative to prepaid products, so we really don't have much of an update to what we previously disclosed. I will remind you, however, that nearly 6,000 consumers have commented to the CFPB regarding the proposed rules. Recently, cardholders from 5 states visited Washington, D.C., to make their voices heard and asking congress to engage with the CFPB to ensure that new regulations do not eliminate their access to opt in overdraft protection, which would lead hundreds of thousands of cardholders with very limited alternatives to meet their small short-term liquidity needs. 
We also continue our discussions with the CFPB as well. Since the proposed rules were published in 2014, we have considered multiple scenarios and possible outcomes. When the final rules are published and after an adequate review period, we will share with you what it means to our business and what our mitigation plans are. 
Let me now shift to a quick review of our business from a global perspective. In North America, where nearly 70% of economic activity is consumer generated, the economy's heath is a direct measure of an improving employment market, relatively strong auto sales, some of the lowest gas prices in 12 years and improved consumer confidence. These are the real catalysts for sustained growth. Generally, our customers in both the United States and Canada are performing better than expected and better than many of their peers. And when they grow, we grow with them. 
Against this macroeconomic backdrop, our North America issuing business in the first quarter produced record quarterly revenues, record operating income and record traditional accounts on file, and they also expanded margin by 257 basis points. Our Merchant segment increased sales volume and direct revenue by double digits and also increased their margin by 90 basis points. And NetSpend delivered record quarterly revenues, record GDV and record operating income. They also exceeded 100,000 distributing locations and employers for the quarter. We were very pleased with the performance of all of our North American businesses in the first quarter. 
Now let's take a look at the other economies around the globe, where we do business. China's $11 trillion economy is moving away from its reliance on manufacturing toward services and consumer spending. This is good news for TSYS. China's bankcard industry is growing at a fast pace. At the end of 2015, bankcards issued in China ranked #1 in the world and bankcard consumption rates have accelerated to the same level of those in other developed markets. Innovative payment initiatives are thriving, particularly in the mobile and Internet payment space. Overall, TSYS' joint venture with CUP Data is performing extremely well and we do not see a slowdown in their business. We still expect double-digit revenue and double-digit net income growth in 2016. 
Brazil's economy is facing one of the longest and harshest recessions in history, with growing unemployment, rising inflation, a weakening currency and political unrest. However, our steadfast client, Carrefour, maintains a strong motivation for investment and they continue to outperform the Brazilian market in both their retail and consumer credit businesses. 
Looking at Europe, the payments market continues to be challenged by regulation and competition. The level of change in the market is unprecedented and is allowing progressive issuers of credit and debit products to be creative in pursuing growth strategies. Again, we view change and disruption as a driver of new opportunities for TSYS' clients and their customers. 
Beginning the year [ph] in Asia-Pacific region is one of the fastest-growing regions in a slowing-world economy. The payments market is relatively under penetrated across most countries in the region, but growing fast. This contributes to the region having one of the highest growth rates in noncash payments in the world, averaging over 20% annual growth in areas of cards, acquiring, online and mobile. Third-party processing and hosting is a corresponding emerging need in the region. To take advantage of these opportunities, TSYS is working to upgrade clients in the regions to its latest PRIME system and promoting it as a consolidated platform for all issuing and acquiring. Across our International footprints in the first quarter, we produced strong revenue and transaction growth and ended the quarter with record accounts on file. 
Now I would like to take the opportunity to mention a few changes within the TSYS family. Later this week, we'll hold our annual shareholders' meeting, where we will recognize 2 founding members of the TSYS board: Gardiner Garrard and Lynn Page, who will retire. Gardiner and Lynn have shared and served on almost all of the various TSYS board committees over the years and have been 2 of our most loyal supporters, astute advisers and greatest champions. We thank each of them for their 33 years of service and wish them all the best in the future. 
Also, at the shareholders' meeting, we will welcome Pam Joseph, who was elected to our board in March and will become a member of the TSYS executive leadership team serving as President and Chief Operating Officer beginning next Monday. We are very excited to have Pam join our executive leadership team. Her experience, vision and direction will help shape the future of TSYS. 
I'll now ask Paul Todd to provide additional detail and financial information and review our revised guidance for 2016. Paul?"
308973,329679701,963674,"Total System Services, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Total System Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Troy. And I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the company's exceptional performance for the first quarter, specifically related to the strength across each of our reporting segments, the closing of TransFirst and our revised guida",3130,"Thank you, Troy. And I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the company's exceptional performance for the first quarter, specifically related to the strength across each of our reporting segments, the closing of TransFirst and our revised guidance, which incorporates the TransFirst business into our expected performance for the remainder of the year. 
Digging into the results starting on Slide 6. At the consolidated level, our net revenue increased 12.7% for the quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $230.8 million, representing a year-over-year increase of $37.4 million or 19.3%.  Finally, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.66 for the quarter, which represents a 22.8% increase from prior year. This EPS performance was driven by strong segment performance across all of our segments as well as strong performance by CUP Data. 
One thing we discussed throughout last year was the growth across all of our segments occurring at the same time and the first quarter was a continuation of this trend. Before I leave the consolidated financial results, turning to Slide 7, I want to point out that our quarterly net revenue growth of 12.7% is all organic. And our ability to take that revenue growth to the bottom line was seen in the adjusted operating income growth of 20.5% to $186.2 million and adjusted operating margin of 27.7%, representing a margin improvement of 178 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This combination of pure organic revenue growth with this margin expansion is a key takeaway from our first quarter consolidated results. 
Now to explain our results in more detail, let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our North America segment first, where the key headline for this segment is the strong organic revenue growth of 14.1%. As you will remember, this quarter marks the anniversary of the largest client conversion in history that happened mid-first quarter last year. The incremental impact from this conversion plus continued organic growth for much of our client base and a few onetime revenue items drove revenue before reimbursables up 14.1% over quarter 1 of 2015 to $303.6 million. This amount represents another record highs for revenues in the quarter, surpassing that of the fourth quarter of 2015. 
During the quarter, we signed 4 contract extensions that included commercial, consumer and managed services as well as a healthcare contract renewal. As it's been the recent pattern, this double-digit revenue growth was driven by the large conversion as well as by broad-based growth in our core offerings as well as growth in our Value Added Services, managed services and loyalty services. However, I think it is important for you to remember that in the quarters ahead, we will begin to see the year-over-year impact of our departure from the prepaid processing space within this segment due to the loss of UniRush and ongoing de-conversion of Green Dot. But to reiterate our statement on our last call, we still expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for this segment for the full year. 
As for the segment's operating income, it also reached at historical level of $124.8 million, up 21.7% over last year, resulting in a segment operating margin of 41.1%. This growth rate was aided by the onetime revenue items mentioned earlier and a onetime favorable impact of state R&D tax credit that flowed through operations. Without these onetime items, this 1Q margin is consistent with the 1Q 2015 margin of 38.5%. And we expect the margins of this segment to remain in the approximate range of 37% to 39% for the rest of the year and still expect the margin on a full year basis in this segment to expand slightly from the 37.4% margin in calendar year 2015. 
From a volume perspective, you can see from the slide that our traditional accounts on file continue to show steady growth and we reached a new record level of 423.3 million accounts. The higher percentage growth rates reflected in previous quarters is obviously due to the large conversion last year. And I'll point out that we raised the -- we revised these bar charts to focus on our traditional accounts on file levels and growth rates, which we consistently stated are a better metric of our revenue performance. Historically, these charts have shown total accounts on file that are the sum of both our traditional accounts on file as well as prepaid government services and single-use accounts. As we've said in the past, these nontraditional accounts can vary substantially and the numbers of accounts are less correlated to revenue. We've rolled out some new formatting changes to our report this quarter and our graphs will now show traditional accounts on file, given its tighter connection to revenue, but we will continue to provide information on both. 
As Troy mentioned, we believe we have growth potential within our issuer processing business by driving additional growth in profits through the sale of innovative products and related services that our clients need. We are committed to being a more product-driven organization, and we are redeploying and refocusing resources within our issuer product group and across our IT teams. Overall, we're pleased with the strong first quarter performance of the North American segment. 
Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on Slide 9, where the key highlight is the continuing expanding margin with an improving constant currency revenue growth picture. During the fourth quarter call, we shared that the segment achieved a full year margin of 18.1% based on the target announced 4 years ago. With this as a base, the segment will continue to drive for margin expansion with an improving revenue growth picture. The first quarter of 2016 saw strong results for the segment with net revenue of $75.4 million, up 2.2% on a reported basis and up 9.2% on a constant currency basis. The revenue growth for the quarter was again fueled by the 4 new clients converted last year, coupled with strong organic growth from existing clients. We start to annualize these new client in the March, April time frame, and this is why we still anticipate segment revenue growth to be in the low single-digit range on a constant currency basis for full year 2016. 
On the margin front, our Q1 margin of 13.7% was up 420 basis point improvement over Q1 of '15, and we still expect some margin improvement in 2016 net of any negative currency impact. From a volume perspective, traditional accounts on file grew 4 million to a record level of 65.5 million, up 6.6% from the prior year. And we continue to break records for the number of accounts processed in this segment, now standing at 80.8 million accounts on file. I would like to emphasize that most of this growth is in the single-use and debit account areas. This segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth of 8.1% with same-client transactions growing by 7.6%. 
While not included in the segment's financial results, our results from our CUP Data partnership were also strong for Q1. Our joint venture with CUP continues to meet expectations for both of our organizations, and we expect continued growth in this business, despite the slowdown of the Chinese economy's growth rate. Overall, we were pleased with our International segment's performance for the quarter. 
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10, where the key headline for this segment was a strong performance leading up to the announcement of our closing of the TransFirst acquisition. Our revenue grew 9.3% for the quarter versus the first quarter of 2015. The direct business saw 10.6% growth and our indirect business had 7.2% year-over-year growth. The growth of our small and medium business sales volume was up 9 point -- 11.9% year-over-year and our indirect business grew POS transactions by 10.8% year-over-year. 
Within our indirect business, we continue to retain our core customers renewing 2 of our top 25, while also signing a new full service agreements during the quarter. We remain committed to our indirect partners, and this line of business will continue to be important to the combined TSYS, TransFirst business on a go-forward basis as it generates strong margins and cash flow and creates a platform that powers our direct business. 
On the direct side, we have continued to gain traction on the integrated payments front with ISVs. And with integration of TransFirst, we can further expand across the entire merchant base we serve. 
From a margin perspective, we experienced an overall increase of 90 basis points for the first quarter, which is important in our plans to expand the margin in this segment in 2016. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the Merchant segment, and we still believe success in this space will require the first distribution channels and scale for operating leverage. With TransFirst, we are now well-positioned with a robust partner-centric distribution model that yields access to millions of SMB merchants in a scalable and cost-efficient way. We're pleased with the Merchant segment's performance in the first quarter, and we are merging the TSYS and TransFirst businesses from positions of strength. 
Now I want to talk about the strong performance of the NetSpend segment starting on Slide 11. The highlights for this segment is the 19.3% organic revenue growth for the quarter. Revenue of $185 million represents a record-setting tax season and this is the highest quarterly revenue in NetSpend's history. As you remember, we made significant investments for growth in this business during the fourth quarter of 2015. This resulted in excellent organic Q1 revenue growth in 2016 tax season volumes. The first quarter had over $9 billion of gross dollar volume or spend, up 19.6% over the prior year. We exited the quarter with almost 4.9 million active cards, almost 2.8 million of which are on direct deposits, which continues to be a relentless focus for the NetSpend team. First quarter margin held consistent with the prior year of 22.8%. I will remind you that NetSpend's first quarter margins tend to be the lowest quarter of the year because of our investments in marketing and customer acquisition efforts to support a successful tax season. 
While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we're also consistently focus on expanding our distribution network by adding approximately 3,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 100,000. The 2016 tax season has been one of continued excellent performance by our NetSpend segment, and we're pleased with the way we are positioned coming out of Q1. Our expectation for this business continues to be for revenue growth to be in the low double digits on a full year basis with expanding margins for 2016 versus 2015. 
Now back to the consolidated financial results starting on Slide 12. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 27.7%, consistent with the expanding margin story I mentioned on our last call. Also, I want to state that Slide 12 provides a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, TransFirst M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. 
Now let's talk about our cash position on Slide 13 for a moment. We ended the quarter at $445 million in cash, excluding $1.5 billion received from our notes offering, a $55.8 million increase from the fourth quarter of last year. Our largest outflow of cash of $44.4 million was related to CapEx, of which $9.9 million was related to property and equipment, $21 million related to contract acquisition costs, with the remaining $13.5 million related to internally developed and licensed software. We've shown our cash position on this slide net of the outflow for the acquisition of TransFirst. 
On cash flow on Slide 14, our free cash flow for the quarter was $101.4 million. And with the addition of TransFirst, net of the additional bond expenses and onetime items, we expect free cash flow for the year to be in the $510 million to $540 million range. 
I want to make one comment on leverage. With the closing of TransFirst, our debt ended where we were anticipating at approximately $3.8 billion and pro forma leverage moved to approximately 3.8x debt to trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA, excluding onetime items. Our $1.5 billion notes offering in March was extremely well received, and we drew an additional $870 million from our credit facility to close the transaction. We anticipate our weighted average blended interest rate for our overall debt to be in the range of 3.15% to 3.4%, which is in line with our prior expectations of about 50 basis points higher than our pre-transaction rate. 
As Troy mentioned, regarding our capital allocation strategy, our immediate priority and plan is to use our strong free cash flow over the next 24 months to delever our balance sheet, so we get back to our longer-term target leverage ratio of the low to mid- 2x range. 
From a share count perspective, we ended the quarter with 183.4 million of common shares outstanding with the average basic weighted shares outstanding at 183.3 million. On taxes, we ended the quarter at an effective tax rate of 33.6%, which is about 150 basis points lower than in Q1 of 2015. And we expect our estimated tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 33% to 34%, with it being closer to the high end of this range and expecting it to stay in that high 33% or low 34% range for each of the next 3 quarters. I want to point out that this effective tax rate increase from 2015 levels is the main driver as to why our adjusted expected EPS growth rate is not consistent with our expected growth rate in adjusted EBITDA or adjusted operating income. 
Now on guidance. We are raising our full year consolidated guidance based on the closing of the TransFirst acquisition and stronger-than-expected performance in the first quarter. On Page 15, we highlight our full year consolidated guidance of total revenue growth of 50% to 53%; net revenue growth of 20% (sic) [ 22% ] to 24%; and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of 13% to 16% growth. We are introducing a new adjusted revenue disclosure, net revenue that better aligns our reporting with how the company measures performance internally. A reconciliation of net revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure to GAAP revenues, is included in the detailed schedules of our press release. We also expect consolidated adjusted margin to increase approximately 100 basis points over 2015, which is consistent with the margin expansion I mentioned on our last call. 
Finally, I want to mention some callouts that I think are the key takeaways from today. The first call out is on organic growth. The first quarter was another impressive quarter of purely organic growth for our company and for each of our segments and continues a string of strong quarterly organic revenue growth in our businesses. With the closing of TransFirst, we will now have acquisition-related growth in our results on a go-forward basis, but this period of ongoing success and organic growth across all of our businesses at the same time speaks to the strength of the TSYS platform of businesses. 
The second major callout is on margins, and we will be talking a lot about margins in 2016 with our goal to increase our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 100 basis points, coming off the heels of a similar level of margin expansion in 2015. However, our goal is to expand each of our segments' margin profile to deliver a cross segment margin expansion similar to the cross segment organic revenue growth theme that we saw in 2015. Our first quarter's performance on the margin front strengthens our resolve around this goal. 
And the third and final callout is related to expected performance for the remainder of the year. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to call out 2 key points given the moving parts present in 2016. The first point is on North America. As I mentioned when I was covering the North America segment, we still expect this segment to grow in the mid-single-digit range that I mentioned on our last call. I also mentioned on our last call that the second half of the year will have lower growth than the first half, given the expected runoff of the prepaid processing clients previously mentioned as well as other effects. We have stated we expect this segment to grow in the mid-to high single-digit range over a longer-term horizon, with expected growth being closer to the mid-single-digit range. And while we expect to achieve that in 2016, the path to that level is heavily weighted on the front half of the year. 
The second point is on our third quarter and specifically related to tax comparisons. In the third quarter of 2015, we had $0.13 of tax benefits in the quarter that we detailed in our 3Q 2015 earnings call in schedules. Given that we have significant positive impact in 3Q of 2015, extra care must be used in modeling our 3Q expected 2016 results as the $0.13 doesn't repeat and, in fact, our expected effective tax rate for 2016 approaches the high end of our 33% to 34% range, which is higher than our 30.5% effective rate in 2015 with a significant change in the third quarter this year over the third quarter of 2015. While there are other effects in the third quarter of this year versus the third quarter of last year, specifically in North America, this effect of the $0.13 in the third quarter of last year has to be properly handled in modeling to better approximate the expected performance of the third quarter of '16. And as I said on our 3Q call last year, there was a $15 million operating benefit and a net $8.5 million benefit on the tax line that has to be adjusted for in last year's three-quarter results to better model 3Q of '16.  
Finally, I will wrap up by expressing how pleased we are to be raising our full year guidance for 2016 and the strength of our performance in the first quarter across all of our businesses. This strength is complemented with the addition of the outstanding colleagues and business from TransFirst, and we look forward to reporting on these combined efforts on our next call. Our team members from around the world enabled the results we have discussed today and they have proven again that they will deliver. 
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

Yes, we -- as I talked about in the prepared remarks, obviously, coming off this very strong first quarter that had the impact of the large conversion that we did last year, we got some additive growth there. The biggest single driver of kind of the growth story after that, as you look forward to the remaining part of the year is, is this prepaid effect of exiting the prepaid processing side. And so that was why I mentioned the second half being lowered than the first half, and we continue to kind of see a mid to high single-digit organic revenue growth story for the North America business when we look at the fundamentals of the business. But this year, because of the dynamics that we had at play with this large conversion as well as this exiting of the prepaid side in the second half, it presents kind of a two-sided story that lands to kind of more of a mid-single-digit revenue growth picture. I think the key point around the organic growth side is, is that we are going to continue to focus on the processing side and seeing the growth there. And then as we mentioned, and Troy may want to add to this, on the product side, you're going to see us spend more and more time focused on the growth that we can get from the value-added product side."

And you're right, we did bring in some outside help in 2015 to help us look at our corporate strategy and our product delivery strategies.

So, one, additional products and services to be built. You'll hear more about this in the coming months; number two, cross selling more aggressively the products and services that we already have. You're right, I think same-store transaction -- not store, the same transactions for the quarter were up 12.7% in North America, so very strong robust there.

As I commented on our last call and reiterated again today, we still expect to see an expanding margin picture there. I think in our last call, when I said kind of slightly expanding margin picture, I think I brand it as between 25 to 100 basis points. And so that would still be the right kind of range to be thinking about. And frankly, I'm going to make that same commentary as we walk down to that kind of the band of range that I'm talking about. So from a North America standpoint, that is the margin expansion that we expect to get out of that business. The one point I would make about North America is -- and I made it in the prepared remarks that although we were at 41%, when you kind of check out the onetime items, that pulls it down to about 38.5%. And we expect that band to be more of the consistent band across the quarters than maybe what we've had historically whether it's been more movement around the target. So as we move to International, same type of margin expanding story. The only caveat I would add is the currency impacts that could have some negative impact there. But on a constant currency basis, we look for the similar kind of margin expansion in that band. When we move down the merchant, it's the same kind of story. And as I commented on our last call and what we reiterate today, the TransFirst business with the guidance we provided and on net revenue provides for an exactly almost similar margin picture. So our margin expansion story that we had pre-TransFirst continues over and kind of a post-TransFirst acquisition scenario. And then finally on NetSpend, the same kind of commentary. And if you kind of wrap all of that around, the overall 100 basis point expansion of the margin for adjusted EBITDA and overall consolidated adjusted margin, and you look at kind of how that can kind of build up, given that commentary, that's this margin callout I made at the very end and will be one of the key things we're focused on this year and we'll continue to talk about as the year progresses."

I think what I was trying to hit on in my prepared remarks is that the indirect side of the business is going to be an important component of the combined pieces, TransFirst business on a go-forward basis. It's got strong margins. As I said, it fuels our direct business from a processing standpoint. And so it's a good business that we have scale efficiencies in, which improve our cost basis and generates a lot of cash. It's got strong margins. It just doesn't have the same type of revenue growth potential that the direct side of the business had. Obviously, with the TransFirst business added, it takes a lesser contribution of the revenue going forward. So if you look, I think, it was about 39% of the revenue this quarter, that will diminish down to sub 20% on a go-forward basis. So we'll probably talk about it less moving forward just because of the smaller percentage of the whole, but I did want to make sure that from a strategic standpoint, I place the proper amount of emphasis of it being an important business on a go-forward basis."

Good evening, and welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings call. This has been a terrific first quarter for TSYS and a very busy start of the year for all of us. Almost any measure, the first quarter exceeded our expectations. Some of",1587,"Thank you, Shawn. Good evening, and welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings call. This has been a terrific first quarter for TSYS and a very busy start of the year for all of us. Almost any measure, the first quarter exceeded our expectations. Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are net revenue up 12.7%, adjusted EPS increased 22.8% and overall margin expanded 178 basis points. These results are further confirmation that executing on our strategy is delivering exceptional results. 
On another high note, we were delighted to complete the acquisition of TransFirst on April 1, just 64 days from our announcement. I'm very proud of the teams who worked tirelessly to make this happen. And the more time we spent with John and his team at TransFirst, the more impressed we are. TransFirst is going to provide us the additional scale and reach in merchant acquiring to approach that of our issuer processing and prepaid businesses. Combining TSYS' Merchant business with TransFirst positions us as the sixth largest U.S. merchant acquirer and the third largest integrated payments provider. John and his leadership team are well underway with integration, positioning our new Merchant segment to deliver on dynamic strategies that will be implemented over the next 6 to 18 months. 
With our exceptional performance in the first quarter and with the addition of TransFirst, we are increasing our guidance for 2016. Paul will provide additional details on all of our revised guidance metrics later in our presentation. 
Since our fourth quarter call, Paul and I have had opportunity to connect with many of you directly to hear what's on your mind. I thought it might be appropriate to take a moment to share my perspectives on a few of the topics that have been shared with us. The 3 most discussed topics have been, one, capital allocation plans; two, go-forward growth in our North America issuing segment; and three, the potential impact of the proposed CFPB Prepaid rules with respect to overdraft. 
In terms of our capital allocation strategy, we have previously discussed our principle of returning approximately 75% of our available free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2014 and 2015, we returned 94.4% and 92.3%, respectively. This principle has always been balanced against the need to deploy capital to fund M&A opportunities. Our immediate priority and plan over the next 24 months is to use our strong free cash flow generation to delever our balance sheet until we get back to our long-term target leverage ratio, stock buybacks, M&A activities along with ongoing investments to drive exceptional business results, are all part of our capital allocation strategy to drive long-term shareholder value. 
As to our North America issuer processing growth prospects, in 2015, we performed a strategic analysis of our business and corporate strategy for long-term sustained growth. Among other things, we determined that we have significant potential for growth in our core issuer processing business, both North America and International in the form of delivering and cross-selling new products and services that clients both need and would prefer to buy from us as a trusted provider than from someone else. As such, we have made and continue to make significant investments with the goal of enhancing our technology infrastructure and modernizing the technology framework that sits on top of our core processing platforms. We are building an open real-time platform that allows developers, partners and the greater fintech community to easily commit and leverage TSYS' platforms so that we deliver innovative products and services faster and with greater quality, so our teams can prototype, deploy and iterate faster than ever before. Today, just under 18% of our revenue is delivered from value-added products and services across our core issuer processing business. By aggressively developing and deploying new products and services, expanding our footprint and continuing to win new business, we believe we can continue to lever growth in our core issuer processing business. 
And lastly, on the subject of the proposed rules on prepaid from the CFPB and how they may impact NetSpend and its overdraft feature. The CFPB has not yet deliver their final rules relative to prepaid products, so we really don't have much of an update to what we previously disclosed. I will remind you, however, that nearly 6,000 consumers have commented to the CFPB regarding the proposed rules. Recently, cardholders from 5 states visited Washington, D.C., to make their voices heard and asking congress to engage with the CFPB to ensure that new regulations do not eliminate their access to opt in overdraft protection, which would lead hundreds of thousands of cardholders with very limited alternatives to meet their small short-term liquidity needs. 
We also continue our discussions with the CFPB as well. Since the proposed rules were published in 2014, we have considered multiple scenarios and possible outcomes. When the final rules are published and after an adequate review period, we will share with you what it means to our business and what our mitigation plans are. 
Let me now shift to a quick review of our business from a global perspective. In North America, where nearly 70% of economic activity is consumer generated, the economy's health is a direct measure of an improving employment market, relatively strong auto sales, some of the lowest gas prices in 12 years and improved consumer confidence. These are the real catalysts for sustained growth. Generally, our customers in both the United States and Canada are performing better than expected and better than many of their peers. And when they grow, we grow with them. 
Against this macroeconomic backdrop, our North America issuing business in the first quarter produced record quarterly revenues, record operating income and record traditional accounts on file, and they also expanded margin by 257 basis points. Our Merchant segment increased sales volume and direct revenue by double digits and also increased their margin by 90 basis points. And NetSpend delivered record quarterly revenues, record GDV and record operating income. They also exceeded 100,000 distributing locations and employers for the quarter. We were very pleased with the performance of all of our North American businesses in the first quarter. 
Now let's take a look at the other economies around the globe, where we do business. China's $11 trillion economy is moving away from its reliance on manufacturing toward services and consumer spending. This is good news for TSYS. China's bankcard industry is growing at a fast pace. At the end of 2015, bankcards issued in China ranked #1 in the world and bankcard consumption rates have accelerated to the same level of those in other developed markets. Innovative payment initiatives are thriving, particularly in the mobile and Internet payment space. Overall, TSYS' joint venture with CUP Data is performing extremely well and we do not see a slowdown in their business. We still expect double-digit revenue and double-digit net income growth in 2016. 
Brazil's economy is facing one of the longest and harshest recessions in history, with growing unemployment, rising inflation, a weakening currency and political unrest. However, our steadfast client, Carrefour, maintains a strong motivation for investment and they continue to outperform the Brazilian market in both their retail and consumer credit businesses. 
Looking at Europe, the payments market continues to be challenged by regulation and competition. The level of change in the market is unprecedented and is allowing progressive issuers of credit and debit products to be creative in pursuing growth strategies. Again, we view change and disruption as a driver of new opportunities for TSYS' clients and their customers. 
Beginning the year [ph] in Asia-Pacific region is one of the fastest-growing regions in a slowing-world economy. The payments market is relatively under penetrated across most countries in the region, but growing fast. This contributes to the region having one of the highest growth rates in noncash payments in the world, averaging over 20% annual growth in areas of cards, acquiring, online and mobile. Third-party processing and hosting is a corresponding emerging need in the region. To take advantage of these opportunities, TSYS is working to upgrade clients in the regions to its latest PRIME system and promoting it as a consolidated platform for all issuing and acquiring. Across our International footprints in the first quarter, we produced strong revenue and transaction growth and ended the quarter with record accounts on file. 
Now I would like to take the opportunity to mention a few changes within the TSYS family. Later this week, we'll hold our annual shareholders' meeting, where we will recognize 2 founding members of the TSYS board: Gardiner Garrard and Lynn Page, who will retire. Gardiner and Lynn have shared and served on almost all of the various TSYS board committees over the years and have been 2 of our most loyal supporters, astute advisers and greatest champions. We thank each of them for their 33 years of service and wish them all the best in the future. 
Also, at the shareholders' meeting, we will welcome Pam Joseph, who was elected to our board in March and will become a member of the TSYS executive leadership team serving as President and Chief Operating Officer beginning next Monday. We are very excited to have Pam join our executive leadership team. Her experience, vision and direction will help shape the future of TSYS. 
I'll now ask Paul Todd to provide additional detail and financial information and review our revised guidance for 2016. Paul?"

And I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the company's exceptional performance for the first quarter, specifically related to the strength across each of our reporting segments, the closing of TransFirst and our revised guida",3130,"Thank you, Troy. And I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the company's exceptional performance for the first quarter, specifically related to the strength across each of our reporting segments, the closing of TransFirst and our revised guidance, which incorporates the TransFirst business into our expected performance for the remainder of the year. 
Digging into the results starting on Slide 6. At the consolidated level, our net revenue increased 12.7% for the quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $230.8 million, representing a year-over-year increase of $37.4 million or 19.3%.  Finally, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.66 for the quarter, which represents a 22.8% increase from prior year. This EPS performance was driven by strong segment performance across all of our segments as well as strong performance by CUP Data. 
One thing we discussed throughout last year was the growth across all of our segments occurring at the same time and the first quarter was a continuation of this trend. Before I leave the consolidated financial results, turning to Slide 7, I want to point out that our quarterly net revenue growth of 12.7% is all organic. And our ability to take that revenue growth to the bottom line was seen in the adjusted operating income growth of 20.5% to $186.2 million and adjusted operating margin of 27.7%, representing a margin improvement of 178 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This combination of pure organic revenue growth with this margin expansion is a key takeaway from our first quarter consolidated results. 
Now to explain our results in more detail, let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our North America segment first, where the key headline for this segment is the strong organic revenue growth of 14.1%. As you will remember, this quarter marks the anniversary of the largest client conversion in history that happened mid-first quarter last year. The incremental impact from this conversion plus continued organic growth for much of our client base and a few onetime revenue items drove revenue before reimbursables up 14.1% over quarter 1 of 2015 to $303.6 million. This amount represents another record highs for revenues in the quarter, surpassing that of the fourth quarter of 2015. 
During the quarter, we signed 4 contract extensions that included commercial, consumer and managed services as well as a healthcare contract renewal. As it's been the recent pattern, this double-digit revenue growth was driven by the large conversion as well as by broad-based growth in our core offerings as well as growth in our Value Added Services, managed services and loyalty services. However, I think it is important for you to remember that in the quarters ahead, we will begin to see the year-over-year impact of our departure from the prepaid processing space within this segment due to the loss of UniRush and ongoing de-conversion of Green Dot. But to reiterate our statement on our last call, we still expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for this segment for the full year. 
As for the segment's operating income, it also reached at historical level of $124.8 million, up 21.7% over last year, resulting in a segment operating margin of 41.1%. This growth rate was aided by the onetime revenue items mentioned earlier and a onetime favorable impact of state R&D tax credit that flowed through operations. Without these onetime items, this 1Q margin is consistent with the 1Q 2015 margin of 38.5%. And we expect the margins of this segment to remain in the approximate range of 37% to 39% for the rest of the year and still expect the margin on a full year basis in this segment to expand slightly from the 37.4% margin in calendar year 2015. 
From a volume perspective, you can see from the slide that our traditional accounts on file continue to show steady growth and we reached a new record level of 423.3 million accounts. The higher percentage growth rates reflected in previous quarters is obviously due to the large conversion last year. And I'll point out that we raised the -- we revised these bar charts to focus on our traditional accounts on file levels and growth rates, which we consistently stated are a better metric of our revenue performance. Historically, these charts have shown total accounts on file that are the sum of both our traditional accounts on file as well as prepaid government services and single-use accounts. As we've said in the past, these nontraditional accounts can vary substantially and the numbers of accounts are less correlated to revenue. We've rolled out some new formatting changes to our report this quarter and our graphs will now show traditional accounts on file, given its tighter connection to revenue, but we will continue to provide information on both. 
As Troy mentioned, we believe we have growth potential within our issuer processing business by driving additional growth in profits through the sale of innovative products and related services that our clients need. We are committed to being a more product-driven organization, and we are redeploying and refocusing resources within our issuer product group and across our IT teams. Overall, we're pleased with the strong first quarter performance of the North American segment. 
Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on Slide 9, where the key highlight is the continuing expanding margin with an improving constant currency revenue growth picture. During the fourth quarter call, we shared that the segment achieved a full year margin of 18.1% based on the target announced 4 years ago. With this as a base, the segment will continue to drive for margin expansion with an improving revenue growth picture. The first quarter of 2016 saw strong results for the segment with net revenue of $75.4 million, up 2.2% on a reported basis and up 9.2% on a constant currency basis. The revenue growth for the quarter was again fueled by the 4 new clients converted last year, coupled with strong organic growth from existing clients. We start to annualize these new client in the March, April time frame, and this is why we still anticipate segment revenue growth to be in the low single-digit range on a constant currency basis for full year 2016. 
On the margin front, our Q1 margin of 13.7% was up 420 basis point improvement over Q1 of '15, and we still expect some margin improvement in 2016 net of any negative currency impact. From a volume perspective, traditional accounts on file grew 4 million to a record level of 65.5 million, up 6.6% from the prior year. And we continue to break records for the number of accounts processed in this segment, now standing at 80.8 million accounts on file. I would like to emphasize that most of this growth is in the single-use and debit account areas. This segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth of 8.1% with same-client transactions growing by 7.6%. 
While not included in the segment's financial results, our results from our CUP Data partnership were also strong for Q1. Our joint venture with CUP continues to meet expectations for both of our organizations, and we expect continued growth in this business, despite the slowdown of the Chinese economy's growth rate. Overall, we were pleased with our International segment's performance for the quarter. 
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10, where the key headline for this segment was a strong performance leading up to the announcement of our closing of the TransFirst acquisition. Our revenue grew 9.3% for the quarter versus the first quarter of 2015. The direct business saw 10.6% growth and our indirect business had 7.2% year-over-year growth. The growth of our small and medium business sales volume was up 9 point -- 11.9% year-over-year and our indirect business grew POS transactions by 10.8% year-over-year. 
Within our indirect business, we continue to retain our core customers renewing 2 of our top 25, while also signing a new full service agreements during the quarter. We remain committed to our indirect partners, and this line of business will continue to be important to the combined TSYS, TransFirst business on a go-forward basis as it generates strong margins and cash flow and creates a platform that powers our direct business. 
On the direct side, we have continued to gain traction on the integrated payments front with ISVs. And with integration of TransFirst, we can further expand across the entire merchant base we serve. 
From a margin perspective, we experienced an overall increase of 90 basis points for the first quarter, which is important in our plans to expand the margin in this segment in 2016. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the Merchant segment, and we still believe success in this space will require the first distribution channels and scale for operating leverage. With TransFirst, we are now well-positioned with a robust partner-centric distribution model that yields access to millions of SMB merchants in a scalable and cost-efficient way. We're pleased with the Merchant segment's performance in the first quarter, and we are merging the TSYS and TransFirst businesses from positions of strength. 
Now I want to talk about the strong performance of the NetSpend segment starting on Slide 11. The highlights for this segment is the 19.3% organic revenue growth for the quarter. Revenue of $185 million represents a record-setting tax season and this is the highest quarterly revenue in NetSpend's history. As you remember, we made significant investments for growth in this business during the fourth quarter of 2015. This resulted in excellent organic Q1 revenue growth in 2016 tax season volumes. The first quarter had over $9 billion of gross dollar volume or spend, up 19.6% over the prior year. We exited the quarter with almost 4.9 million active cards, almost 2.8 million of which are on direct deposits, which continues to be a relentless focus for the NetSpend team. First quarter margin held consistent with the prior year of 22.8%. I will remind you that NetSpend's first quarter margins tend to be the lowest quarter of the year because of our investments in marketing and customer acquisition efforts to support a successful tax season. 
While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we're also consistently focus on expanding our distribution network by adding approximately 3,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 100,000. The 2016 tax season has been one of continued excellent performance by our NetSpend segment, and we're pleased with the way we are positioned coming out of Q1. Our expectation for this business continues to be for revenue growth to be in the low double digits on a full year basis with expanding margins for 2016 versus 2015. 
Now back to the consolidated financial results starting on Slide 12. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 27.7%, consistent with the expanding margin story I mentioned on our last call. Also, I want to state that Slide 12 provides a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, TransFirst M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. 
Now let's talk about our cash position on Slide 13 for a moment. We ended the quarter at $445 million in cash, excluding $1.5 billion received from our notes offering, a $55.8 million increase from the fourth quarter of last year. Our largest outflow of cash of $44.4 million was related to CapEx, of which $9.9 million was related to property and equipment, $21 million related to contract acquisition costs, with the remaining $13.5 million related to internally developed and licensed software. We've shown our cash position on this slide net of the outflow for the acquisition of TransFirst. 
On cash flow on Slide 14, our free cash flow for the quarter was $101.4 million. And with the addition of TransFirst, net of the additional bond expenses and onetime items, we expect free cash flow for the year to be in the $510 million to $540 million range. 
I want to make one comment on leverage. With the closing of TransFirst, our debt ended where we were anticipating at approximately $3.8 billion and pro forma leverage moved to approximately 3.8x debt to trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA, excluding onetime items. Our $1.5 billion notes offering in March was extremely well received, and we drew an additional $870 million from our credit facility to close the transaction. We anticipate our weighted average blended interest rate for our overall debt to be in the range of 3.15% to 3.4%, which is in line with our prior expectations of about 50 basis points higher than our pre-transaction rate. 
As Troy mentioned, regarding our capital allocation strategy, our immediate priority and plan is to use our strong free cash flow over the next 24 months to delever our balance sheet, so we get back to our longer-term target leverage ratio of the low to mid- 2x range. 
From a share count perspective, we ended the quarter with 183.4 million of common shares outstanding with the average basic weighted shares outstanding at 183.3 million. On taxes, we ended the quarter at an effective tax rate of 33.6%, which is about 150 basis points lower than in Q1 of 2015. And we expect our estimated tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 33% to 34%, with it being closer to the high end of this range and expecting it to stay in that high 33% or low 34% range for each of the next 3 quarters. I want to point out that this effective tax rate increase from 2015 levels is the main driver as to why our adjusted expected EPS growth rate is not consistent with our expected growth rate in adjusted EBITDA or adjusted operating income. 
Now on guidance. We are raising our full year consolidated guidance based on the closing of the TransFirst acquisition and stronger-than-expected performance in the first quarter. On Page 15, we highlight our full year consolidated guidance of total revenue growth of 50% to 53%; net revenue growth of 20% (sic) [ 22% ] to 24%; and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of 13% to 16% growth. We are introducing a new adjusted revenue disclosure, net revenue that better aligns our reporting with how the company measures performance internally. A reconciliation of net revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure to GAAP revenues, is included in the detailed schedules of our press release. We also expect consolidated adjusted margin to increase approximately 100 basis points over 2015, which is consistent with the margin expansion I mentioned on our last call. 
Finally, I want to mention some callouts that I think are the key takeaways from today. The first call out is on organic growth. The first quarter was another impressive quarter of purely organic growth for our company and for each of our segments and continues a string of strong quarterly organic revenue growth in our businesses. With the closing of TransFirst, we will now have acquisition-related growth in our results on a go-forward basis, but this period of ongoing success and organic growth across all of our businesses at the same time speaks to the strength of the TSYS platform of businesses. 
The second major callout is on margins, and we will be talking a lot about margins in 2016 with our goal to increase our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 100 basis points, coming off the heels of a similar level of margin expansion in 2015. However, our goal is to expand each of our segments' margin profile to deliver a cross segment margin expansion similar to the cross segment organic revenue growth theme that we saw in 2015. Our first quarter's performance on the margin front strengthens our resolve around this goal. 
And the third and final callout is related to expected performance for the remainder of the year. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to call out 2 key points given the moving parts present in 2016. The first point is on North America. As I mentioned when I was covering the North America segment, we still expect this segment to grow in the mid-single-digit range that I mentioned on our last call. I also mentioned on our last call that the second half of the year will have lower growth than the first half, given the expected runoff of the prepaid processing clients previously mentioned as well as other effects. We have stated we expect this segment to grow in the mid-to high single-digit range over a longer-term horizon, with expected growth being closer to the mid-single-digit range. And while we expect to achieve that in 2016, the path to that level is heavily weighted on the front half of the year. 
The second point is on our third quarter and specifically related to tax comparisons. In the third quarter of 2015, we had $0.13 of tax benefits in the quarter that we detailed in our 3Q 2015 earnings call in schedules. Given that we have significant positive impact in 3Q of 2015, extra care must be used in modeling our 3Q expected 2016 results as the $0.13 doesn't repeat and, in fact, our expected effective tax rate for 2016 approaches the high end of our 33% to 34% range, which is higher than our 30.5% effective rate in 2015 with a significant change in the third quarter this year over the third quarter of 2015. While there are other effects in the third quarter of this year versus the third quarter of last year, specifically in North America, this effect of the $0.13 in the third quarter of last year has to be properly handled in modeling to better approximate the expected performance of the third quarter of '16. And as I said on our 3Q call last year, there was a $15 million operating benefit and a net $8.5 million benefit on the tax line that has to be adjusted for in last year's three-quarter results to better model 3Q of '16.  
Finally, I will wrap up by expressing how pleased we are to be raising our full year guidance for 2016 and the strength of our performance in the first quarter across all of our businesses. This strength is complemented with the addition of the outstanding colleagues and business from TransFirst, and we look forward to reporting on these combined efforts on our next call. Our team members from around the world enabled the results we have discussed today and they have proven again that they will deliver. 
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

But this year, because of the dynamics that we had at play with this large conversion as well as this exiting of the prepaid side in the second half, it presents kind of a two-sided story that lands to kind of more of a mid-single-digit revenue growth picture. I think the key point around the organic growth side is, is that we are going to continue to focus on the processing side and seeing the growth there. And then as we mentioned, and Troy may want to add to this, on the product side, you're going to see us spend more and more time focused on the growth that we can get from the value-added product side."

So, one, additional products and services to be built. You'll hear more about this in the coming months; number two, cross selling more aggressively the products and services that we already have. You're right, I think same-store transaction -- not store, the same transactions for the quarter were up 12.7% in North America, so very strong robust there.

As I commented on our last call and reiterated again today, we still expect to see an expanding margin picture there. I think in our last call, when I said kind of slightly expanding margin picture, I think I brand it as between 25 to 100 basis points. And so that would still be the right kind of range to be thinking about. And frankly, I'm going to make that same commentary as we walk down to that kind of the band of range that I'm talking about. So from a North America standpoint, that is the margin expansion that we expect to get out of that business. The one point I would make about North America is -- and I made it in the prepared remarks that although we were at 41%, when you kind of check out the onetime items, that pulls it down to about 38.5%. And we expect that band to be more of the consistent band across the quarters than maybe what we've had historically whether it's been more movement around the target. So as we move to International, same type of margin expanding story. The only caveat I would add is the currency impacts that could have some negative impact there. But on a constant currency basis, we look for the similar kind of margin expansion in that band. When we move down the merchant, it's the same kind of story. And as I commented on our last call and what we reiterate today, the TransFirst business with the guidance we provided and on net revenue provides for an exactly almost similar margin picture. So our margin expansion story that we had pre-TransFirst continues over and kind of a post-TransFirst acquisition scenario. And then finally on NetSpend, the same kind of commentary. And if you kind of wrap all of that around, the overall 100 basis point expansion of the margin for adjusted EBITDA and overall consolidated adjusted margin, and you look at kind of how that can kind of buildup, given that commentary, that's this margin callout I made at the very end and will be one of the key things we're focused on this year and we'll continue to talk about as the year progresses."

I think what I was trying to hit on in my prepared remarks is that the indirect side of the business is going to be an important component of the combined pieces, TransFirst business on a go-forward basis. It's got strong margins. As I said, it fuels our direct business from a processing standpoint. And so it's a good business that we have scale efficiencies in, which improve our cost basis and generates a lot of cash. It's got strong margins. It just doesn't have the same type of revenue growth potential that the direct side of the business had. Obviously, with the TransFirst business added, it takes a lesser contribution of the revenue going forward. So if you look, I think, it was about 39% of the revenue this quarter that will diminish down to sub 20% on a go-forward basis. So we'll probably talk about it less moving forward just because of the smaller percentage of the whole, but I did want to make sure that from a strategic standpoint, I place the proper amount of emphasis of it being an important business on a go-forward basis."

Good evening, and welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings call. This has been a terrific first quarter for TSYS and a very busy start of the year for all of us.

This has been a terrific first quarter for TSYS and a very busy start of the year for all of us. By almost any measure, the first quarter exceeded our expectations. Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are net revenue up 12.7%, adjusted EPS increased 22.8% and overall margin expanded 178 basis points. These results are further confirmation that executing on our strategy is delivering exceptional results. 
On another high note, we were delighted to complete the acquisition of TransFirst on April 1, just 64 days from our announcement. I'm very proud of the teams who worked tirelessly to make this happen. And the more time we spend with John and his team at TransFirst the more impressed we are. TransFirst is going to provide us the additional scale and reach in merchant acquiring to approach that of our issuer processing and prepaid businesses. Combining TSYS' Merchant business with TransFirst positions us as the sixth largest U.S. merchant acquirer and the third largest integrated payments provider. John and his leadership team are well underway with integration, positioning our new Merchant segment to deliver on dynamic strategies that will be implemented over the next 6 to 18 months. 
With our exceptional performance in the first quarter and with the addition of TransFirst, we are increasing our guidance for 2016. Paul will provide additional details on all of our revised guidance metrics later in our presentation. 
Since our fourth quarter call, Paul and I have had opportunity to connect with many of you directly to hear what's on your mind. I thought it might be appropriate to take a moment to share my perspectives on a few of the topics that have been shared with us. The 3 most discussed topics have been, one, capital allocation plans; two, go-forward growth in our North America issuing segment; and three, the potential impact of the proposed CFPB Prepaid rules with respect to overdraft. 
In terms of our capital allocation strategy, we have previously discussed our principle of returning approximately 75% of our available free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2014 and 2015, we returned 94.4% and 92.3%, respectively. This principle has always been balanced against the need to deploy capital to fund M&A opportunities. Our immediate priority and plan over the next 24 months is to use our strong free cash flow generation to delever our balance sheet until we get back to our long-term target leverage ratio. Stock buybacks, M&A activities along with ongoing investments to drive exceptional business results, are all part of our capital allocation strategy to drive long-term shareholder value. 
As to our North America issuer processing growth prospects, in 2015, we performed a strategic analysis of our business and corporate strategy for long-term sustained growth. Among other things, we determined that we have significant potential for growth in our core issuer processing business, both North America and International in the form of delivering and cross-selling new products and services that clients both need and would prefer to buy from us as a trusted provider than from someone else. As such, we have made and continue to make significant investments with the goal of enhancing our technology infrastructure and modernizing the technology framework that sits on top of our core processing platforms. We are building an open real-time platform that allows developers, partners and the greater fintech community to easily connect and leverage TSYS' platforms so that we deliver innovative products and services faster and with greater quality, so our teams can prototype, deploy and iterate faster than ever before. Today, just under 18% of our revenue is delivered from value-added products and services across our core issuer processing businesses. By aggressively developing and deploying new products and services, expanding our footprint and continuing to win new business, we believe we can continue to lever growth in our core issuer processing business. 
And lastly, on the subject of the proposed rules on prepaid from the CFPB and how they may impact NetSpend and its overdraft feature. The CFPB has not yet delivered their final rules relative to prepaid products, so we really don't have much of an update to what we previously disclosed. I will remind you, however, that nearly 6,000 consumers have commented to the CFPB regarding the proposed rules. Recently, cardholders from 5 states visited Washington, D.C., to make their voices heard in asking congress to engage with the CFPB to ensure that new regulations do not eliminate their access to opt-in overdraft protection, which would leave hundreds of thousands of cardholders with very limited alternatives to meet their small short-term liquidity needs. 
We also continue our discussions with the CFPB as well. Since the proposed rules were published in 2014, we have considered multiple scenarios and possible outcomes. When the final rules are published and after an adequate review period, we will share with you what it means to our business and what our mitigation plans are. 
Let me now shift to a quick review of our business from a global perspective. In North America, where nearly 70% of economic activity is consumer-generated, the economy's health is a direct measure of an improving employment market, relatively strong auto sales, some of the lowest gas prices in 12 years and improved consumer confidence. These are the real catalysts for sustained growth. Generally, our customers in both the United States and Canada are performing better than expected and better than many of their peers. And when they grow, we grow with them. 
Against this macroeconomic backdrop, our North America issuing business in the first quarter produced record quarterly revenues, record operating income and record traditional accounts on file, and they also expanded margin by 257 basis points. Our Merchant segment increased sales volume and direct revenue by double digits and also increased their margin by 90 basis points. And NetSpend delivered record quarterly revenues, record GDV and record operating income. They also exceeded 100,000 distributing locations and employers for the quarter. We were very pleased with the performance of all of our North American businesses in the first quarter. 
Now let's take a look at the other economies around the globe where we do business. China's $11 trillion economy is moving away from its reliance on manufacturing toward services and consumer spending. This is good news for TSYS. China's bankcard industry is growing at a fast pace. At the end of 2015, bankcards issued in China ranked #1 in the world and bankcard consumption rates have accelerated to the same level of those in other developed markets. Innovative payment initiatives are thriving, particularly in the mobile and Internet payment space. Overall, TSYS' joint venture with CUP Data is performing extremely well and we do not see a slowdown in that business. We still expect double-digit revenue and double-digit net income growth in 2016. 
Brazil's economy is facing one of the longest and harshest recessions in history, with growing unemployment, rising inflation, a weakening currency and political unrest. However, our steadfast client, Carrefour, maintains a strong motivation for investment and they continue to outperform the Brazilian market in both their retail and consumer credit businesses. 
Looking at Europe, the payments market continues to be challenged by regulation and competition. The level of change in the market is unprecedented and is allowing progressive issuers of credit and debit products to be creative in pursuing growth strategies. Again, we view change and disruption as a driver of new opportunities for TSYS' clients and their customers. 
The India and Asia-Pacific region is one of the fastest-growing regions in a slowing-world economy. The payments market is relatively underpenetrated across most countries in the region, but growing fast. This contributes to the region having one of the highest growth rates in noncash payments in the world, averaging over 20% annual growth in areas of cards, acquiring, online and mobile. Third-party processing and hosting is a corresponding emerging need in the region. To take advantage of these opportunities, TSYS is working to upgrade clients in the region to its latest PRIME system and promoting it as a consolidated platform for all issuing and acquiring. Across our International footprint in the first quarter, we produced strong revenue and transaction growth and ended the quarter with record accounts on file. 
Now I would like to take the opportunity to mention a few changes within the TSYS family. Later this week, we hold our annual shareholders' meeting, where we will recognize 2 founding members of the TSYS board: Gardiner Garrard and Lynn Page, who will retire. Gardiner and Lynn have chaired and served on almost all of the various TSYS board committees over the years and have been 2 of our most loyal supporters, astute advisers and greatest champions. We thank each of them for their 33 years of service and wish them all the best in the future. 
Also, at the shareholders' meeting, we will welcome Pam Joseph, who was elected to our board in March and will become a member of the TSYS executive leadership team serving as President and Chief Operating Officer beginning next Monday. We are very excited to have Pam join our executive leadership team. Her experience, vision and direction will help shape the future of TSYS. 
I'll now ask Paul Todd to provide additional detailed financial information and review our revised guidance for 2016. Paul?"

And I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the company's exceptional performance for the first quarter, specifically related to the strength across each of our reporting segments, the closing of TransFirst and our revised guidance, which incorporates the TransFirst business into our expected performance for the remainder of the year. 
Digging into the results starting on Slide 6. At the consolidated level, our net revenue increased 12.7% for the quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $230.8 million, representing a year-over-year increase of $37.4 million or 19.3%.  Finally, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.66 for the quarter, which represents a 22.8% increase from prior year. This EPS performance was driven by strong segment performances across all of our segments as well as strong performance by CUP Data. 
One thing we discussed throughout last year was the growth across all of our segments occurring at the same time, and the first quarter was a continuation of this trend. Before I leave the consolidated financial results, turning to Slide 7, I want to point out that our quarterly net revenue growth of 12.7% is all organic. And our ability to take that revenue growth to the bottom line was seen in the adjusted operating income growth of 20.5% to $186.2 million and adjusted operating margin of 27.7%, representing a margin improvement of 178 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This combination of pure organic revenue growth with this margin expansion is a key takeaway from our first quarter consolidated results. 
Now to explain our results in more detail, let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our North America segment first, where the key headline for the segment is the strong organic revenue growth of 14.1%. As you will remember, this quarter marks the anniversary of the largest client conversion in history that happened mid-first quarter last year. The incremental impact from this conversion plus continued organic growth for much of our client base and a few onetime revenue items drove revenue before reimbursables up 14.1% over quarter 1 of 2015 to $303.6 million. This amount represents another record high for revenues in a quarter surpassing that of the fourth quarter of 2015. 
During the quarter, we signed 4 contract extensions that included commercial, consumer and managed services as well as a healthcare contract renewal. As has been the recent pattern, this double-digit revenue growth was driven by the large conversion as well as by broad-based growth in our core offerings as well as growth in our Value Added Services, managed services and loyalty services. However, I think it is important for you to remember that in the quarters ahead, we will begin to see the year-over-year impact of our departure from the prepaid processing space within this segment due to the loss of UniRush and ongoing de-conversion of Green Dot. But to reiterate our statement on our last call, we still expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for this segment for the full year. 
As for the segment's operating income, it also reached a historical level of $124.8 million, up 21.7% over last year, resulting in a segment operating margin of 41.1%. This growth rate was aided by the onetime revenue items mentioned earlier and a onetime favorable impact of state R&D tax credits that flow through operations. Without these onetime items, this 1Q margin is consistent with the 1Q 2015 margin of 38.5%. And we expect the margins of this segment to remain in the approximate range of 37% to 39% for the rest of the year and still expect the margin on a full year basis for this segment to expand slightly from the 37.4% margin in calendar year 2015. 
From a volume perspective, you can see from the slide that our traditional accounts on file continue to show steady growth and we've reached a new record level of 423.3 million accounts. The higher percentage growth rates reflected in previous quarters is obviously due to the large conversion last year. And I'll point out that we've raised the -- we've revised these bar charts to focus on our traditional accounts on file levels and growth rates, which we've consistently stated are a better metric of our revenue performance. Historically, these charts have shown total accounts on file that are the sum of both our traditional accounts on file as well as prepaid government services and single-use accounts. As we've said in the past, these nontraditional accounts can vary substantially and the numbers of accounts are less correlated to revenue. We've rolled out some new formatting changes to our report this quarter and our graphs will now show traditional accounts on file, given its tighter connection to revenue, but we will continue to provide information on both. 
As Troy mentioned, we believe we have growth potential within our issuer processing business by driving additional growth in profits through the sale of innovative products and related services that our clients need. We are committed to being a more product-driven organization, and we are redeploying and refocusing resources within our issuer product group and across our IT teams. Overall, we're pleased with the strong first quarter performance of the North American segment. 
Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on Slide 9, where the key highlight is the continuing expanding margin with an improving constant currency revenue growth picture. During the fourth quarter call, we shared that the segment achieved a full year margin of 18.1% based on the target announced 4 years ago. With this as a base, the segment will continue to drive for margin expansion with an improving revenue growth picture. The first quarter of 2016 saw strong results for the segment with net revenue of $75.4 million, up 2.2% on a reported basis and up 9.2% on a constant currency basis. The revenue growth for the quarter was again fueled by the 4 new clients converted last year, coupled with strong organic growth from existing clients. We start to annualize these new clients in the March, April time frame, and this is why we still anticipate segment revenue growth to be in the low single-digit range on a constant currency basis for full year 2016. 
On the margin front, our Q1 margin of 13.7% was a 420 basis point improvement over Q1 of '15, and we still expect some margin improvement in 2016 net of any negative currency impact. From a volume perspective, traditional accounts on file grew 4 million to a record level of 65.5 million, up 6.6% from the prior year. And we continue to break records for the number of accounts processed in this segment, now standing at 80.8 million accounts on file. I would like to emphasize that most of this growth is in the single-use and debit account areas. This segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth of 8.1% with same-client transactions growing by 7.6%. 
While not included in the segment's financial results, our results from our CUP Data partnership were also strong for Q1. Our joint venture with CUP continues to meet expectations for both of our organizations, and we expect continued growth in this business, despite the slowdown of the Chinese economy's growth rate. Overall, we were pleased with our International segment's performance for the quarter. 
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10, where the key headline for this segment was the strong performance leading up to the announcement of our closing of the TransFirst acquisition. Our revenue grew 9.3% for the quarter versus the first quarter of 2015. The direct business saw 10.6% growth and our indirect business had 7.2% year-over-year growth. The growth of our small and medium business sales volume was up 9 point -- 11.9% year-over-year and our indirect business grew POS transactions by 10.8% year-over-year. 
Within our indirect business, we continue to retain our core customers, renewing 2 of our top 25 while also signing a new full service agreement during the quarter. We remain committed to our indirect partners, and this line of business will continue to be important to the combined TSYS, TransFirst business on a go-forward basis as it generates strong margins and cash flow and creates a platform that powers our direct business. 
On the direct side, we have continued to gain traction on the integrated payments front with ISVs. And with integration of TransFirst, we can further expand across the entire merchant base we serve. 
From a margin perspective, we experienced an overall increase of 90 basis points for the first quarter, which is important in our plans to expand the margin in this segment in 2016. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the Merchant segment, and we still believe success in this space will require diverse distribution channels and scale for operating leverage. With TransFirst, we are now well-positioned with a robust partner-centric distribution model that yields access to millions of SMB merchants in a scalable and cost-efficient way. We're pleased with the Merchant segment's performance in the first quarter, and we are merging the TSYS and TransFirst businesses from positions of strength. 
Now I want to talk about the strong performance of the NetSpend segment starting on Slide 11. The highlight for this segment is the 19.3% organic revenue growth for the quarter. Revenue of $185 million represents a record-setting tax season and this is the highest quarterly revenue in NetSpend's history. As you remember, we made significant investments for growth in this business during the fourth quarter of 2015. This resulted in excellent organic Q1 revenue growth and 2016 tax season volumes. The first quarter had over $9 billion of gross dollar volume or spend, up 19.6% over the prior year. We exited the quarter with almost 4.9 million active cards, almost 2.8 million of which are on direct deposit, which continues to be a relentless focus for the NetSpend team. First quarter margins held consistent with the prior year at 22.8%. I will remind you that NetSpend's first quarter margins tend to be the lowest quarter of the year because of our investments in marketing and customer acquisition efforts to support a successful tax season. 
While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we're also consistently focused on expanding our distribution network by adding approximately 3,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 100,000. The 2016 tax season has been one of continued excellent performance by our NetSpend segment, and we're pleased with the way we are positioned coming out of Q1. Our expectation for this business continues to be for revenue growth to be in the low double digits on a full year basis with expanding margins for 2016 versus 2015. 
Now back to the consolidated financial results starting on Slide 12. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 27.7%, consistent with the expanding margin story I mentioned on our last call. Also, I want to state that Slide 12 provides a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, TransFirst M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. 
Now let's talk about our cash position on Slide 13 for a moment. We ended the quarter at $445 million in cash, excluding $1.5 billion received from our notes offering, a $55.8 million increase from the fourth quarter of last year. Our largest outflow of cash of $44.4 million was related to CapEx, of which $9.9 million was related to property and equipment, $21 million related to contract acquisition cost, with the remaining $13.5 million related to internally-developed and licensed software. We've shown our cash position on this slide net of the outflow for the acquisition of TransFirst. 
On cash flow on Slide 14, our free cash flow for the quarter was $101.4 million. And with the addition of TransFirst, net of the additional bond expenses and onetime items, we expect free cash flow for the year to be in the $510 million to $540 million range. 
I want to make one comment on leverage. With the closing of TransFirst, our debt ended where we were anticipating at approximately $3.8 billion and pro forma leverage moved to approximately 3.8x debt to trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA, excluding onetime items. Our $1.5 billion notes offering in March was extremely well received, and we drew an additional $870 million from our credit facility to close the transaction. We anticipate our weighted average blended interest rate for our overall debt to be in a range of 3.15% to 3.4%, which is in line with our prior expectations of about 50 basis points higher than our pre-transaction rate. 
As Troy mentioned, regarding our capital allocation strategy, our immediate priority and plan is to use our strong free cash flow over the next 24 months to delever our balance sheet, so we get back to our longer-term target leverage ratio of the low to mid-2x range. 
From a share count perspective, we ended the quarter with 183.4 million of common shares outstanding with the average basic weighted shares outstanding at 183.3 million. On taxes, we ended the quarter at an effective tax rate of 33.6%, which is about 150 basis points lower than in Q1 of 2015. And we expect our estimated tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 33% to 34%, with it being closer to the high end of this range and expecting it to stay in that high 33% or low 34% range for each of the next 3 quarters. I want to point out that this effective tax rate increase from 2015 levels is the main driver as to why our adjusted expected EPS growth rate is not consistent with our expected growth rates in adjusted EBITDA or adjusted operating income. 
Now on guidance. We are raising our full year consolidated guidance based on the closing of the TransFirst acquisition and stronger-than-expected performance in the first quarter. On Page 15, we highlight our full year consolidated guidance of total revenue growth of 50% to 53%; net revenue growth of 20% (sic) [ 22% ] to 24%; and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of 13% to 16% growth. We are introducing a new adjusted revenue disclosure, net revenue, that better aligns our reporting with how the company measures performance internally. A reconciliation of net revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure, to GAAP revenues is included in the detailed schedules of our press release. We also expect consolidated adjusted margin to increase approximately 100 basis points over 2015, which is consistent with the margin expansion I mentioned on our last call. 
Finally, I want to mention some callouts that I think are the key takeaways from today. The first call out is on organic growth. The first quarter was another impressive quarter of purely organic growth for our company and for each of our segments and continues a string of strong quarterly organic revenue growth in our businesses. With the closing of TransFirst, we will now have acquisition-related growth in our results on a go-forward basis, but this period of ongoing success in organic growth across all of our businesses at the same time speaks to the strength of the TSYS platform of businesses. 
The second major callout is on margins, and we will be talking a lot about margins in 2016 with our goal to increase our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 100 basis points, coming off the heels of a similar level of margin expansion in 2015. However, our goal is to expand each of our segments' margin profile to deliver a cross segment margin expansion similar to the cross segment organic revenue growth theme that we saw in 2015. Our first quarter's performance on the margin front strengthens our resolve around this goal. 
And the third and final callout is related to expected performance for the remainder of the year. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to call out 2 key points given the moving parts present in 2016. The first point is on North America. As I mentioned when I was covering the North America segment, we still expect this segment to grow in the mid-single-digit range that I mentioned on our last call. I also mentioned on our last call that the second half of the year will have lower growth than the first half, given the expected runoff of the prepaid processing clients previously mentioned as well as other effects. We have stated we expect this segment to grow in the mid- to high single-digit range over a longer-term horizon, with expected growth being closer to the mid-single-digit range. And while we expect to achieve that in 2016, the path to that level is heavily weighted on the front half of the year. 
The second point is on our third quarter and specifically related to tax comparisons. In the third quarter of 2015, we had $0.13 of tax benefits in the quarter that we detailed in our 3Q 2015 earnings call and schedules. Given that we have significant positive impact in 3Q of 2015, extra care must be used in modeling our 3Q expected 2016 results as the $0.13 doesn't repeat and, in fact, our expected effective tax rate for 2016 approaches the high end of our 33% to 34% range, which is higher than our 30.5% effective rate in 2015 with a significant change in the third quarter of this year over the third quarter of 2015. While there are other effects in the third quarter of this year versus the third quarter of last year, specifically in North America, this effect of the $0.13 in the third quarter of last year has to be properly handled in modeling to better approximate the expected performance of the third quarter of '16. And as I said on our 3Q call last year, there was a $15 million operating benefit and a net $8.5 million benefit on the tax line that have to be adjusted for in last year's three-quarter results to better model 3Q of '16.  
Finally, I will wrap up by expressing how pleased we are to be raising our full year guidance for 2016 and the strength of our performance in the first quarter across all of our businesses. This strength is complemented with the addition of the outstanding colleagues and business from TransFirst, and we look forward to reporting on these combined efforts on our next call. Our team members from around the world enabled the results we have discussed today and they have proven again that they will deliver. 
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

Yes, we -- as I talked about in the prepared remarks, obviously, coming off this very strong first quarter that had the impact of the large conversion that we did last year, we got some additive growth there. The biggest single driver of kind of the growth story after that, as you look forward and the remaining part of the year is this prepaid effect of exiting the prepaid processing side. And so that was why I mentioned the second half being lower than the first half, and we continue to kind of see a mid- to high single-digit organic revenue growth story for the North America business when we look at the fundamentals of the business. But this year, because of the dynamics that we had at play with this large conversion as well as this exiting of the prepaid side in the second half, it presents kind of a two-sided story that lands to kind of more of a mid-single-digit revenue growth picture. I think the key point around the organic growth side is, is that we are going to continue to focus on the processing side and seeing the growth there. And then as we mentioned, and Troy may want to add to this, on the product side, you're going to see us spend more and more time focused on the growth that we can get from the value-added product side."

So, one, additional products and services to be built. You'll hear more about that in the coming months. Number two, cross selling more aggressively the products and services that we already have. You're right, I think same-store transaction -- not store, the same transactions for the quarter were up 12.7% in North America, so very strong robust there.

As I commented on our last call and reiterated again today, we still expect to see an expanding margin picture there. I think in our last call, when I said kind of slightly expanding margin picture, I think I framed it as between 25 to 100 basis points. And so that would still be the right kind of range to be thinking about. And frankly, I'm going to make that same commentary as we walk down to that kind of the band of range that I'm talking about. So from a North America standpoint, that is the margin expansion that we expect to get out of that business. The one point I would make about North America is -- and I made it in the prepared remarks that although we were at 41%, when you kind of take out the onetime items, that pulls it down to about 38.5%. And we expect that band to be more of the consistent band across the quarters than maybe what we've had historically where there's been more movement around the target. So as we move to International, same type of margin expanding story. The only caveat I would add is the currency impacts that could have some negative impact there. But on a constant currency basis, we look for the similar kind of margin expansion in that band. When we move down to merchant, it's the same kind of story. And as I commented on our last call and will reiterate today, the TransFirst business with the guidance we provided and on net revenue provides for an exactly almost similar margin picture. So our margin expansion story that we had pre-TransFirst continues over in kind of a post-TransFirst acquisition scenario. And then finally on NetSpend, the same kind of commentary. And if you kind of wrap all of that around the overall 100 basis point expansion of the margin for adjusted EBITDA and overall consolidated adjusted margin, and you look at kind of how that can kind of build up, given that commentary, that's this margin callout I made at the very end and will be one of the key things we're focused on this year and we'll continue to talk about as the year progresses."

And so for the quarter, that helped fuel the stronger kind of than expected growth on the indirect side. I think I did kind of comment earlier, we don't expect this business to grow, so I wouldn't want my confidence around the first quarter to kind of parlay itself into kind of an improving overall growth picture of the indirect business. I think what I was trying to hit on in my prepared remarks is, is that the indirect side of the business is going to be a important component of the combined TSYS TransFirst business on a go-forward basis. It's got strong margins. As I said, it fuels our direct business from a processing standpoint. And so it's a good business that we have scale efficiencies in, which improve our cost basis. It generates a lot of cash. It's got strong margins. It just doesn't have the same type of revenue growth potential that the direct side of the business had. Obviously, with the TransFirst business added, it takes a lesser contribution of the revenue going forward. So if you look, I think, it was about 39% of the revenue this quarter, that will diminish down to sub 20% on a go-forward basis. So we'll probably talk about it less moving forward just because of the smaller percentage of the whole. But I did want to make sure that from a strategic standpoint, I placed the proper amount of emphasis of it being an important business on a go-forward basis."

Good evening, and welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings call. This has been a terrific first quarter for TSYS and a very busy start of the year for all of us.

This has been a terrific first quarter for TSYS and a very busy start of the year for all of us. By almost any measure, the first quarter exceeded our expectations. Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are net revenue up 12.7%, adjusted EPS increased 22.8% and overall margin expanded 178 basis points. These results are further confirmation that executing on our strategy is delivering exceptional results. 
On another high note, we were delighted to complete the acquisition of TransFirst on April 1, just 64 days from our announcement. I'm very proud of the teams who worked tirelessly to make this happen. And the more time we spend with John and his team at TransFirst the more impressed we are. TransFirst is going to provide us the additional scale and reach in merchant acquiring to approach that of our issuer processing and prepaid businesses. Combining TSYS' Merchant business with TransFirst positions us as the sixth largest U.S. merchant acquirer and the third largest integrated payments provider. John and his leadership team are well underway with integration, positioning our new Merchant segment to deliver on dynamic strategies that will be implemented over the next 6 to 18 months. 
With our exceptional performance in the first quarter and with the addition of TransFirst, we are increasing our guidance for 2016. Paul will provide additional details on all of our revised guidance metrics later in our presentation. 
Since our fourth quarter call, Paul and I have had opportunity to connect with many of you directly to hear what's on your mind. I thought it might be appropriate to take a moment to share my perspectives on a few of the topics that have been shared with us. The 3 most discussed topics have been, one, capital allocation plans; two, go-forward growth in our North America issuing segment; and three, the potential impact of the proposed CFPB Prepaid rules with respect to overdraft. 
In terms of our capital allocation strategy, we have previously discussed our principle of returning approximately 75% of our available free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2014 and 2015, we returned 94.4% and 92.3%, respectively. This principle has always been balanced against the need to deploy capital to fund M&A opportunities. Our immediate priority and plan over the next 24 months is to use our strong free cash flow generation to delever our balance sheet until we get back to our long-term target leverage ratio. Stock buybacks, M&A activities along with ongoing investments to drive exceptional business results, are all part of our capital allocation strategy to drive long-term shareholder value. 
As to our North America issuer processing growth prospects, in 2015, we performed a strategic analysis of our business and corporate strategy for long-term sustained growth. Among other things, we determined that we have significant potential for growth in our core issuer processing business, both North America and International in the form of delivering and cross-selling new products and services that clients both need and would prefer to buy from us as a trusted provider than from someone else. As such, we have made and continue to make significant investments with the goal of enhancing our technology infrastructure and modernizing the technology framework that sits on top of our core processing platforms. We are building an open real-time platform that allows developers, partners and the greater fintech community to easily connect and leverage TSYS' platforms so that we deliver innovative products and services faster and with greater quality, so our teams can prototype, deploy and iterate faster than ever before. Today, just under 18% of our revenue is delivered from value-added products and services across our core issuer processing businesses. By aggressively developing and deploying new products and services, expanding our footprint and continuing to win new business, we believe we can continue to lever growth in our core issuer processing business. 
And lastly, on the subject of the proposed rules on prepaid from the CFPB and how they may impact NetSpend and its overdraft feature. The CFPB has not yet delivered their final rules relative to prepaid products, so we really don't have much of an update to what we previously disclosed. I will remind you, however, that nearly 6,000 consumers have commented to the CFPB regarding the proposed rules. Recently, cardholders from 5 states visited Washington, D.C., to make their voices heard in asking congress to engage with the CFPB to ensure that new regulations do not eliminate their access to opt-in overdraft protection, which would leave hundreds of thousands of cardholders with very limited alternatives to meet their small short-term liquidity needs. 
We also continue our discussions with the CFPB as well. Since the proposed rules were published in 2014, we have considered multiple scenarios and possible outcomes. When the final rules are published and after an adequate review period, we will share with you what it means to our business and what our mitigation plans are. 
Let me now shift to a quick review of our business from a global perspective. In North America, where nearly 70% of economic activity is consumer-generated, the economy's health is a direct measure of an improving employment market, relatively strong auto sales, some of the lowest gas prices in 12 years and improved consumer confidence. These are the real catalysts for sustained growth. Generally, our customers in both the United States and Canada are performing better than expected and better than many of their peers. And when they grow, we grow with them. 
Against this macroeconomic backdrop, our North America issuing business in the first quarter produced record quarterly revenues, record operating income and record traditional accounts on file, and they also expanded margin by 257 basis points. Our Merchant segment increased sales volume and direct revenue by double digits and also increased their margin by 90 basis points. And NetSpend delivered record quarterly revenues, record GDV and record operating income. They also exceeded 100,000 distributing locations and employers for the quarter. We were very pleased with the performance of all of our North American businesses in the first quarter. 
Now let's take a look at the other economies around the globe where we do business. China's $11 trillion economy is moving away from its reliance on manufacturing toward services and consumer spending. This is good news for TSYS. China's bankcard industry is growing at a fast pace. At the end of 2015, bankcards issued in China ranked #1 in the world and bankcard consumption rates have accelerated to the same level of those in other developed markets. Innovative payment initiatives are thriving, particularly in the mobile and Internet payment space. Overall, TSYS' joint venture with CUP Data is performing extremely well and we do not see a slowdown in that business. We still expect double-digit revenue and double-digit net income growth in 2016. 
Brazil's economy is facing one of the longest and harshest recessions in history, with growing unemployment, rising inflation, a weakening currency and political unrest. However, our steadfast client, Carrefour, maintains a strong motivation for investment and they continue to outperform the Brazilian market in both their retail and consumer credit businesses. 
Looking at Europe, the payments market continues to be challenged by regulation and competition. The level of change in the market is unprecedented and is allowing progressive issuers of credit and debit products to be creative in pursuing growth strategies. Again, we view change and disruption as a driver of new opportunities for TSYS' clients and their customers. 
The India and Asia-Pacific region is one of the fastest-growing regions in a slowing-world economy. The payments market is relatively underpenetrated across most countries in the region, but growing fast. This contributes to the region having one of the highest growth rates in noncash payments in the world, averaging over 20% annual growth in areas of cards, acquiring, online and mobile. Third-party processing and hosting is a corresponding emerging need in the region. To take advantage of these opportunities, TSYS is working to upgrade clients in the region to its latest PRIME system and promoting it as a consolidated platform for all issuing and acquiring. Across our International footprint in the first quarter, we produced strong revenue and transaction growth and ended the quarter with record accounts on file. 
Now I would like to take the opportunity to mention a few changes within the TSYS family. Later this week, we hold our annual shareholders' meeting, where we will recognize 2 founding members of the TSYS board: Gardiner Garrard and Lynn Page, who will retire. Gardiner and Lynn have chaired and served on almost all of the various TSYS board committees over the years and have been 2 of our most loyal supporters, astute advisers and greatest champions. We thank each of them for their 33 years of service and wish them all the best in the future. 
Also, at the shareholders' meeting, we will welcome Pam Joseph, who was elected to our board in March and will become a member of the TSYS executive leadership team serving as President and Chief Operating Officer beginning next Monday. We are very excited to have Pam join our executive leadership team. Her experience, vision and direction will help shape the future of TSYS. 
I'll now ask Paul Todd to provide additional detailed financial information and review our revised guidance for 2016. Paul?"
308973,329679701,963997,"Total System Services, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Total System Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Troy. And I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the company's exceptional performance for the first quarter, specifically related to the strength across each of our reporting segments, the closing of TransFirst and our revised guida",3129,"Thank you, Troy. And I, too, want to reiterate how pleased we are with the company's exceptional performance for the first quarter, specifically related to the strength across each of our reporting segments, the closing of TransFirst and our revised guidance, which incorporates the TransFirst business into our expected performance for the remainder of the year. 
Digging into the results starting on Slide 6. At the consolidated level, our net revenue increased 12.7% for the quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $230.8 million, representing a year-over-year increase of $37.4 million or 19.3%. Finally, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.66 for the quarter, which represents a 22.8% increase from prior year. This EPS performance was driven by strong segment performances across all of our segments as well as strong performance by CUP Data. 
One thing we discussed throughout last year was the growth across all of our segments occurring at the same time, and the first quarter was a continuation of this trend. Before I leave the consolidated financial results, turning to Slide 7, I want to point out that our quarterly net revenue growth of 12.7% is all organic. And our ability to take that revenue growth to the bottom line was seen in the adjusted operating income growth of 20.5% to $186.2 million and adjusted operating margin of 27.7%, representing a margin improvement of 178 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This combination of pure organic revenue growth with this margin expansion is a key takeaway from our first quarter consolidated results. 
Now to explain our results in more detail, let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our North America segment first, where the key headline for the segment is the strong organic revenue growth of 14.1%. As you will remember, this quarter marks the anniversary of the largest client conversion in history that happened mid-first quarter last year. The incremental impact from this conversion plus continued organic growth for much of our client base and a few onetime revenue items drove revenue before reimbursables up 14.1% over quarter 1 of 2015 to $303.6 million. This amount represents another record high for revenues in a quarter surpassing that of the fourth quarter of 2015. 
During the quarter, we signed 4 contract extensions that included commercial, consumer and managed services as well as a healthcare contract renewal. As has been the recent pattern, this double-digit revenue growth was driven by the large conversion as well as by broad-based growth in our core offerings as well as growth in our Value Added Services, managed services and loyalty services. However, I think it is important for you to remember that in the quarters ahead, we will begin to see the year-over-year impact of our departure from the prepaid processing space within this segment due to the loss of UniRush and ongoing de-conversion of Green Dot. But to reiterate our statement on our last call, we still expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for this segment for the full year. 
As for the segment's operating income, it also reached a historical level of $124.8 million, up 21.7% over last year, resulting in a segment operating margin of 41.1%. This growth rate was aided by the onetime revenue items mentioned earlier and a onetime favorable impact of state R&D tax credits that flow through operations. Without these onetime items, this 1Q margin is consistent with the 1Q 2015 margin of 38.5%. And we expect the margins of this segment to remain in the approximate range of 37% to 39% for the rest of the year and still expect the margin on a full year basis for this segment to expand slightly from the 37.4% margin in calendar year 2015. 
From a volume perspective, you can see from the slide that our traditional accounts on file continue to show steady growth and we've reached a new record level of 423.3 million accounts. The higher percentage growth rates reflected in previous quarters is obviously due to the large conversion last year. And I'll point out that we've raised the -- we've revised these bar charts to focus on our traditional accounts on file levels and growth rates, which we've consistently stated are a better metric of our revenue performance. Historically, these charts have shown total accounts on file that are the sum of both our traditional accounts on file as well as prepaid government services and single-use accounts. As we've said in the past, these nontraditional accounts can vary substantially and the numbers of accounts are less correlated to revenue. We've rolled out some new formatting changes to our report this quarter and our graphs will now show traditional accounts on file, given its tighter connection to revenue, but we will continue to provide information on both. 
As Troy mentioned, we believe we have growth potential within our issuer processing business by driving additional growth in profits through the sale of innovative products and related services that our clients need. We are committed to being a more product-driven organization, and we are redeploying and refocusing resources within our issuer product group and across our IT teams. Overall, we're pleased with the strong first quarter performance of the North American segment. 
Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on Slide 9, where the key highlight is the continuing expanding margin with an improving constant currency revenue growth picture. During the fourth quarter call, we shared that the segment achieved a full year margin of 18.1% based on the target announced 4 years ago. With this as a base, the segment will continue to drive for margin expansion with an improving revenue growth picture. The first quarter of 2016 saw strong results for the segment with net revenue of $75.4 million, up 2.2% on a reported basis and up 9.2% on a constant currency basis. The revenue growth for the quarter was again fueled by the 4 new clients converted last year, coupled with strong organic growth from existing clients. We start to annualize these new clients in the March, April time frame, and this is why we still anticipate segment revenue growth to be in the low single-digit range on a constant currency basis for full year 2016. 
On the margin front, our Q1 margin of 13.7% was a 420 basis point improvement over Q1 of '15, and we still expect some margin improvement in 2016 net of any negative currency impact. From a volume perspective, traditional accounts on file grew 4 million to a record level of 65.5 million, up 6.6% from the prior year. And we continue to break records for the number of accounts processed in this segment, now standing at 80.8 million accounts on file. I would like to emphasize that most of this growth is in the single-use and debit account areas. This segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth of 8.1% with same-client transactions growing by 7.6%. 
While not included in the segment's financial results, our results from our CUP Data partnership were also strong for Q1. Our joint venture with CUP continues to meet expectations for both of our organizations, and we expect continued growth in this business, despite the slowdown of the Chinese economy's growth rate. Overall, we were pleased with our International segment's performance for the quarter. 
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10, where the key headline for this segment was the strong performance leading up to the announcement of our closing of the TransFirst acquisition. Our revenue grew 9.3% for the quarter versus the first quarter of 2015. The direct business saw 10.6% growth and our indirect business had 7.2% year-over-year growth. The growth of our small and medium business sales volume was up 9 point -- 11.9% year-over-year and our indirect business grew POS transactions by 10.8% year-over-year. 
Within our indirect business, we continue to retain our core customers, renewing 2 of our top 25 while also signing a new full service agreement during the quarter. We remain committed to our indirect partners, and this line of business will continue to be important to the combined TSYS, TransFirst business on a go-forward basis as it generates strong margins and cash flow and creates a platform that powers our direct business. 
On the direct side, we have continued to gain traction on the integrated payments front with ISVs. And with integration of TransFirst, we can further expand across the entire merchant base we serve. 
From a margin perspective, we experienced an overall increase of 90 basis points for the first quarter, which is important in our plans to expand the margin in this segment in 2016. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the Merchant segment, and we still believe success in this space will require diverse distribution channels and scale for operating leverage. With TransFirst, we are now well-positioned with a robust partner-centric distribution model that yields access to millions of SMB merchants in a scalable and cost-efficient way. We're pleased with the Merchant segment's performance in the first quarter, and we are merging the TSYS and TransFirst businesses from positions of strength. 
Now I want to talk about the strong performance of the NetSpend segment starting on Slide 11. The highlight for this segment is the 19.3% organic revenue growth for the quarter. Revenue of $185 million represents a record-setting tax season and this is the highest quarterly revenue in NetSpend's history. As you remember, we made significant investments for growth in this business during the fourth quarter of 2015. This resulted in excellent organic Q1 revenue growth and 2016 tax season volumes. The first quarter had over $9 billion of gross dollar volume or spend, up 19.6% over the prior year. We exited the quarter with almost 4.9 million active cards, almost 2.8 million of which are on direct deposit, which continues to be a relentless focus for the NetSpend team. First quarter margins held consistent with the prior year at 22.8%. I will remind you that NetSpend's first quarter margins tend to be the lowest quarter of the year because of our investments in marketing and customer acquisition efforts to support a successful tax season. 
While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we're also consistently focused on expanding our distribution network by adding approximately 3,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 100,000. The 2016 tax season has been one of continued excellent performance by our NetSpend segment, and we're pleased with the way we are positioned coming out of Q1. Our expectation for this business continues to be for revenue growth to be in the low double digits on a full year basis with expanding margins for 2016 versus 2015. 
Now back to the consolidated financial results starting on Slide 12. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 27.7%, consistent with the expanding margin story I mentioned on our last call. Also, I want to state that Slide 12 provides a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, TransFirst M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. 
Now let's talk about our cash position on Slide 13 for a moment. We ended the quarter at $445 million in cash, excluding $1.5 billion received from our notes offering, a $55.8 million increase from the fourth quarter of last year. Our largest outflow of cash of $44.4 million was related to CapEx, of which $9.9 million was related to property and equipment, $21 million related to contract acquisition cost, with the remaining $13.5 million related to internally-developed and licensed software. We've shown our cash position on this slide net of the outflow for the acquisition of TransFirst. 
On cash flow on Slide 14, our free cash flow for the quarter was $101.4 million. And with the addition of TransFirst, net of the additional bond expenses and onetime items, we expect free cash flow for the year to be in the $510 million to $540 million range. 
I want to make one comment on leverage. With the closing of TransFirst, our debt ended where we were anticipating at approximately $3.8 billion and pro forma leverage moved to approximately 3.8x debt to trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA, excluding onetime items. Our $1.5 billion notes offering in March was extremely well received, and we drew an additional $870 million from our credit facility to close the transaction. We anticipate our weighted average blended interest rate for our overall debt to be in a range of 3.15% to 3.4%, which is in line with our prior expectations of about 50 basis points higher than our pre-transaction rate. 
As Troy mentioned, regarding our capital allocation strategy, our immediate priority and plan is to use our strong free cash flow over the next 24 months to delever our balance sheet, so we get back to our longer-term target leverage ratio of the low to mid-2x range. 
From a share count perspective, we ended the quarter with 183.4 million of common shares outstanding with the average basic weighted shares outstanding at 183.3 million. On taxes, we ended the quarter at an effective tax rate of 33.6%, which is about 150 basis points lower than in Q1 of 2015. And we expect our estimated tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 33% to 34%, with it being closer to the high end of this range and expecting it to stay in that high 33% or low 34% range for each of the next 3 quarters. I want to point out that this effective tax rate increase from 2015 levels is the main driver as to why our adjusted expected EPS growth rate is not consistent with our expected growth rates in adjusted EBITDA or adjusted operating income. 
Now on guidance. We are raising our full year consolidated guidance based on the closing of the TransFirst acquisition and stronger-than-expected performance in the first quarter. On Page 15, we highlight our full year consolidated guidance of total revenue growth of 50% to 53%; net revenue growth of 20% (sic) [ 22% ] to 24%; and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of 13% to 16% growth. We are introducing a new adjusted revenue disclosure, net revenue, that better aligns our reporting with how the company measures performance internally. A reconciliation of net revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure, to GAAP revenues is included in the detailed schedules of our press release. We also expect consolidated adjusted margin to increase approximately 100 basis points over 2015, which is consistent with the margin expansion I mentioned on our last call. 
Finally, I want to mention some callouts that I think are the key takeaways from today. The first call out is on organic growth. The first quarter was another impressive quarter of purely organic growth for our company and for each of our segments and continues a string of strong quarterly organic revenue growth in our businesses. With the closing of TransFirst, we will now have acquisition-related growth in our results on a go-forward basis, but this period of ongoing success in organic growth across all of our businesses at the same time speaks to the strength of the TSYS platform of businesses. 
The second major callout is on margins, and we will be talking a lot about margins in 2016 with our goal to increase our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 100 basis points, coming off the heels of a similar level of margin expansion in 2015. However, our goal is to expand each of our segments' margin profile to deliver a cross segment margin expansion similar to the cross segment organic revenue growth theme that we saw in 2015. Our first quarter's performance on the margin front strengthens our resolve around this goal. 
And the third and final callout is related to expected performance for the remainder of the year. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to call out 2 key points given the moving parts present in 2016. The first point is on North America. As I mentioned when I was covering the North America segment, we still expect this segment to grow in the mid-single-digit range that I mentioned on our last call. I also mentioned on our last call that the second half of the year will have lower growth than the first half, given the expected runoff of the prepaid processing clients previously mentioned as well as other effects. We have stated we expect this segment to grow in the mid- to high single-digit range over a longer-term horizon, with expected growth being closer to the mid-single-digit range. And while we expect to achieve that in 2016, the path to that level is heavily weighted on the front half of the year. 
The second point is on our third quarter and specifically related to tax comparisons. In the third quarter of 2015, we had $0.13 of tax benefits in the quarter that we detailed in our 3Q 2015 earnings call and schedules. Given that we have significant positive impact in 3Q of 2015, extra care must be used in modeling our 3Q expected 2016 results as the $0.13 doesn't repeat and, in fact, our expected effective tax rate for 2016 approaches the high end of our 33% to 34% range, which is higher than our 30.5% effective rate in 2015 with a significant change in the third quarter of this year over the third quarter of 2015. While there are other effects in the third quarter of this year versus the third quarter of last year, specifically in North America, this effect of the $0.13 in the third quarter of last year has to be properly handled in modeling to better approximate the expected performance of the third quarter of '16. And as I said on our 3Q call last year, there was a $15 million operating benefit and a net $8.5 million benefit on the tax line that have to be adjusted for in last year's three-quarter results to better model 3Q of '16. 
Finally, I will wrap up by expressing how pleased we are to be raising our full year guidance for 2016 and the strength of our performance in the first quarter across all of our businesses. This strength is complemented with the addition of the outstanding colleagues and business from TransFirst, and we look forward to reporting on these combined efforts on our next call. Our team members from around the world enabled the results we have discussed today and they have proven again that they will deliver. 
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

Yes, we -- as I talked about in the prepared remarks, obviously, coming off this very strong first quarter that had the impact of the large conversion that we did last year, we got some additive growth there. The biggest single driver of kind of the growth story after that, as you look forward and the remaining part of the year is this prepaid effect of exiting the prepaid processing side. And so that was why I mentioned the second half being lower than the first half, and we continue to kind of see a mid- to high single-digit organic revenue growth story for the North America business when we look at the fundamentals of the business. But this year, because of the dynamics that we had at play with this large conversion as well as this exiting of the prepaid side in the second half, it presents kind of a two-sided story that lands to kind of more of a mid-single-digit revenue growth picture. I think the key point around the organic growth side is, is that we are going to continue to focus on the processing side and seeing the growth there. And then as we mentioned, and Troy may want to add to this, on the product side, you're going to see us spend more and more time focused on the growth that we can get from the value-added product side."

And you're right, we did bring in some outside help in 2015 to help us look at our corporate strategy and our product delivery strategies. And one of the things that came out of that, that I mentioned was we truly believe that we have some significant runway, not only in just North America, but all of our issuing processing business to continue to build out value-added products and services that our customers want and need, and according to our feedback from our customers, they prefer to get from us as their trusted adviser. So one, additional products and services to be built. You'll hear more about that in the coming months. Number two, cross selling more aggressively the products and services that we already have. You're right, I think same-store transaction -- not store, the same transactions for the quarter were up 12.7% in North America, so very strong robust there. We also had some -- continued to have good robust growth in our EMV output services area for card personalization. It was up several hundred percent over the first quarter of 2015.

As I commented on our last call and reiterated again today, we still expect to see an expanding margin picture there. I think in our last call, when I said kind of slightly expanding margin picture, I think I framed it as between 25 to 100 basis points. And so that would still be the right kind of range to be thinking about. And frankly, I'm going to make that same commentary as we walk down to that kind of the band of range that I'm talking about. So from a North America standpoint, that is the margin expansion that we expect to get out of that business. The one point I would make about North America is -- and I made it in the prepared remarks that although we were at 41%, when you kind of take out the onetime items, that pulls it down to about 38.5%. And we expect that band to be more of the consistent band across the quarters than maybe what we've had historically where there's been more movement around the target. So as we move to International, same type of margin expanding story. The only caveat I would add is the currency impacts that could have some negative impact there. But on a constant currency basis, we look for the similar kind of margin expansion in that band. When we move down to merchant, it's the same kind of story. And as I commented on our last call and will reiterate today, the TransFirst business with the guidance we provided and on net revenue provides for an exactly almost similar margin picture. So our margin expansion story that we had pre-TransFirst continues over in kind of a post-TransFirst acquisition scenario. And then finally on NetSpend, the same kind of commentary. And if you kind of wrap all of that around the overall 100 basis point expansion of the margin for adjusted EBITDA and overall consolidated adjusted margin, and you look at kind of how that can kind of buildup, given that commentary, that's this margin callout I made at the very end and will be one of the key things we're focused on this year and we'll continue to talk about as the year progresses."

And so for the quarter, that helped fuel the stronger kind of than expected growth on the indirect side. I think I did kind of comment earlier, we don't expect this business to grow, so I wouldn't want my confidence around the first quarter to kind of parlay itself into kind of an improving overall growth picture of the indirect business. I think what I was trying to hit on in my prepared remarks is, is that the indirect side of the business is going to be a important component of the combined TSYS TransFirst business on a go-forward basis. It's got strong margins. As I said, it fuels our direct business from a processing standpoint. And so it's a good business that we have scale efficiencies in, which improve our cost basis. It generates a lot of cash. It's got strong margins. It just doesn't have the same type of revenue growth potential that the direct side of the business had. Obviously, with the TransFirst business added, it takes a lesser contribution of the revenue going forward. So if you look, I think, it was about 39% of the revenue this quarter, that will diminish down to sub 20% on a go-forward basis. So we'll probably talk about it less moving forward just because of the smaller percentage of the whole. But I did want to make sure that from a strategic standpoint, I placed the proper amount of emphasis of it being an important business on a go-forward basis."

Good evening, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This is another excellent quarter for TSYS. Our team members across our global footprint delivered an outstanding performance for the quarter and for the first half of the year. As a reminder, this quarter's results include a full quarter of transfers. I will address our integration activities with respect to TransFirst later. But by almost any measure, our first quarter together has been very successful and we are pleased with our progress and the new team. Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are: consolidated net revenue was up 27.8%; adjusted earnings per share increased 27.9%; and consolidated operating margin expanded 202 basis points. All 4 of our operating segments contributed to these exceptional metrics for the quarter. I want to congratulate and thank all of our team members for their dedication, commitment and focus as we continue to deliver on our strategic plan. One final highlight before we move into the specific results for our segments. While we measure our success with our financials, we also take great pride in our community improvement and servant leadership. In June, we were recognized as one of America's Most Community Minded Companies by Civic 50 [ph], an initiative that identifies companies with their commitment to improve the quality of life in the communities where they do business. This is the third consecutive time we have been honored with this award and it is a compliment to our dedicated team members who give back in the communities where they work and live. I now would like to address the highlights for each of our segments, beginning with North America. Our strong financial performance in North America is partially a result of a positive U.S. economy, which posted job gains and overall strength in consumer spending during the quarter. April produced the largest increase in consumer spending in 6 years and May and June were also robust, pointing to a reasonably off the American consumer. We still expect a significant portion of our growth in our North America segment to come from the cross-sell of products and services. We continue to play significant focus on cross-selling existing products and services to current plans, as well as a longer-term view of delivering and cross-selling new products and services. These new products and services will be delivered through the transformation technologies and innovation currently underway at TSYS. To this point during the quarter, we saw a 13.1% increase over the same quarter last year from the sale of services across our value-added, loyalty and managed services groups in this segment. On the business development front, we signed a new long-term agreement with the Bank of Montreal to process their Mastercard-branded debit accounts and we also renewed 3 issuing contracts. We have previously indicated that Green Dot would be de-converted from TSYS during the second half of 2016. Green Dot has executed on 3 of their planned 4 conversions from TSYS. However, the final wave of accounts is not expected to be de-converted from TSYS this year. 
Now let's turn to the International segment. Of course, the headline-grabbing news from the International segment was the Brexit vote in the U.K. The early reaction certainly negatively impacted both the currency and equity markets. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union has created an overall air of uncertainty in political, social and economic circles across the globe. Following this vote, we spoke with many executives across our European client base and their current position is business as usual with TSYS. One of our clients published a report which indicated that U.K. consumer spending remained resilient both before and after the Brexit EU referendum. There are many different views on Brexit's longer-term impact and the potential implication that it may or may not cause. We will continue to monitor these developments closely and we'll take appropriate actions when and if deemed necessary. Also during the quarter, our International managed services business became financial conduct authority, or SCA authorized. This puts TSYS in unique position against our competitors and enables us to extend our current service offering to include broad customer care support and engagement across Europe. As I mentioned, last quarter, our Brazilian business continues to make significant financial and operational progress. Although the Brazilian market remains challenging due to political and economic uncertainty, and the run-up to the Rio Olympic Games, we are optimistic over the interest in our market-leading payments platform from across the broader Latin and South America regions. In China, the economy has slowed to mid to mid-high single-digit growth. However, the underlying electronic payment transaction growth and overall upward trend in consumer spending and this $8.3 trillion credit card payments market continues to fuel our CUP Data joint venture above expectations. In our PRIME business, we continued to see progress in the licensing and processing business lines with many new prospects in each area. Our focus will continue to be on leveraging our recently transformed international upgrading platforms to deliver cost-effective solutions on both TS2 [ph] and prime around the globe. For our combined issuing segments, we added over 13 million traditional accounts during the quarter, which is further proof of the health of our issuing business. Our focus will continue to be on client retention, cross-selling products and services, as well as new targeted prospects around the globe. 
Now let's address our Merchant business. As I indicated earlier, TransFirst is included in our second quarter numbers. We have just completed our first quarter of the TransFirst acquisition and we are pleased to report that the integration work and synergy goals were both on track. As we've indicated from the beginning regarding this acquisition, our goal is to optimize of capabilities, products and services across our combined entities that will enable our customers to allow 1 single provider from all of their processing needs. We believe this is a key market differentiator. Although there is significant integration work still must take place, we will remain relentlessly focused on growing the business. Today, over 80% of our Merchant net revenue is derived from our direct channels. We believe the scale and diverse distribution network that we upgraded in our Merchant business is one of the keys to our success. Our combined Merchant businesses now gives us leadership positions in all 3 of our lines of business. 
And finally, I would like to address NetSpend. Our NetSpend segment had another great quarter of small. Quarterly revenues were up almost 15%. Margins improved slightly year-over-year and 330 basis points sequentially and we surpassed 101,000 distributing locations and employers for the quarter. On the business development front, I am happy to announce that our long-standing distribution partner and industry leader, Blackhawk Network, has entered a 10-year strategic partnership that builds upon more than a decade of work we've done together. This new partnership will provide significant expansion of placings for NetSpend and Blackhawk's impressive U.S. retail network and potentially provide additional distribution locations in grocery stores and other retailers. another great win for our retail presence this quarter, was a 3-year extension of the NetSpend partnership with CVS. Our PayCard channel was also very active during the quarter. We signed a new 3-year agreements with the Gap and with JCPenney to be there exclusive PayCard provider. This new and growing partnerships saw the manifestation of NetSpend's goals to meet consumers where they work and shop to provide them with a great solution, fulfilling their financial needs. As to the CFPB, we now expect the final rules to be published sometime in September. When the final rules are published and after we have had an adequate review period, we will share with you what it means to our business and what our mitigation strategies are. All in all, it was a great quarter with all 4 segments growing revenue, expanding our consolidated margin, executing on the TransFirst acquisition and winning new business. 
At our Investor Day conference in May, I discussed the launching of our TSYS 2020 initiative. This is an enterprisewide initiative to bring clarity and focus to our future business model. As a reminder, one of the tenets of TSYS 2020 was to provide us with an assessment of the ideal operating structure to maximize efficiencies and the scale of our operations. As I mentioned earlier, this process is built in the way on our Merchant segment primarily as a result of the TransFirst acquisition. Through organizational consolidation, job eliminations and other efficiency initiatives, we are ahead of schedule to achieve our $15 million synergy goal from merchants in 2017. We are now in the process of taking this efficiency initiative to the rest of our company. As a result of this process, we do expect to have some one-time-related expenses in the third quarter, primarily related to severance. We are convinced that these moves will ensure we are operating in our full potential and will allow us to improve and strengthen our already very successful business model. Paul will provide additional color on this in his remarks. With that, I'll ask Paul with an additional detail and financial information of our second quarter and outlook for the remainder of 2016. Paul?"

As I mentioned, on our last 2 calls regarding 2016 expected performance, we would be executing on improving margins in our company while being focused on the integration of TransFirst and that is exactly what occurred during the second quarter. We couldn't be more pleased with the TransFirst acquisition. As John Shlonsky and team have already started to reorganize and are successfully down the integration path to position the TSYS Merchant segment in a unique way. When we announced the transaction, our goal is to achieve double-digit percentage accretion with the the transaction which we achieved in the second quarter and our synergy attainment goals are on track. So see very positive momentum with TransFirst. 
Now turning to Slide 6 and the review of the numbers. Total revenues were $1.15 billion, a 66.3% increase from the second quarter of last year and net revenue was up 27.8% from 2Q '15 to $794.9 million. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 32.7% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 27.9%, both in line with our net revenue increase. On a GAAP basis, basic EPS was down $0.07 to $0.38 as a result of the effect of the TransFirst acquisition. On a year-to-date basis, total revenues were $1.89 billion, a 39.6% increase and net revenue was $1.47 billion, representing a 20.4% growth over 2015. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $504.9  million is 26.2% higher than through this time last year and year-to-date adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.40 is a 25.5% increase. On a GAAP basis, basic EPS was flat at $0.87 from prior year, once again, reflecting the effects of the TransFirst acquisition. I mentioned on our last 2 calls about our goal to increase our adjusted EBITDA margin by 100 basis points this year and we achieve this goal in the quarter with an approximate 130 basis points increase for the quarter and 160 basis point expansion through 6 months. It is still our goal to achieve this 100 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the year, building upon the strong adjusted EBITDA margin expansion we have last year. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that our diversification strategy around the contribution of revenue continues with the TransFirst acquisition included in our results for the first time in our Merchant segment now represents 1/3 of our net revenue, up from approximately 19% from this time last year. We believe this diversified revenue mix provides strength for and is a unique dynamic in the TSYS' investment story as we continue to diversify our revenue mix to be more heavily weighted to the higher growth areas of payments. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 28.6%, an increase of over 200 basis points versus Q2 of 2015 and our 28.2% year-to-date margin is also an increase of roughly 200 basis points. Importantly, 3 of our 4 segments saw their adjusted segment operating margin expand for the quarter from the second quarter of last year and speaks to the strength of the cross segment delivery of performance that I mentioned as our goal on our last 2 calls. Clearly, we're pleased with our consolidated results but we are equally pleased with the impressive segment results that are behind the consolidated numbers. 
Now let's dig into the segment results for North America, starting on Slide 8. As I mentioned, on our last call, we expect the North America segment full year revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range in 2016, and that is still our expectation. Revenue for the quarter was up 3.5% and we saw a crossover growth in our value-added managed services and loyalty services up and combined 13.1% over the same quarter last year. This sequential quarter decline in net revenue growth from the 14.1% last quarter is largely due to the anniversary of a large client conversion in mid-Q1 of 2015, along with our outlook services area returning to more normalized levels as we begin to anniversary some of the elevated growth we've seen in recent quarters related to EMV, other projects and some onetime items. As for this segment's operating income, it grew 4% over last year resulting in a segment operating margin of 37.9%, up 20 basis points. From a volume perspective, you can see from this slide that our traditional accounts on file continues to show steady growth and has reached yet another new record of $435.1 million. I'll remind you that this excludes prepaid, government services and single-use accounts. We continue to redeploy and refocus resources in our issuer product group, our client experience initiatives and across our IT landscape to provide a more proactive and focused delivery model, as well as focus on cross-selling existing products into the market-leading distribution channel that we spent years cultivating. Overall, we continue to expect this business to grow in the mid-single-digit range for the year with slightly expanding margins. Now I'll
[Audio Gap]
want to move to the International segment highlights on Slide 9 where we continued to experience revenue growth, and, more importantly, operating income and margin growth. Net revenue of $81.8 million was down 2.5% on a reported basis but up 4.2% on a constant-currency basis. The constant-currency revenue growth of 4.2% is consistent with the low-single digit constant-currency revenue growth we expect for this segment this year. We continue to see solid growth from our existing client base in Europe, which was partially offset by previously expected loss client revenue. The segment's margin continues to grow in line with our margin improvement plan, delivering over 330 basis points in margin improvement over Q2 of '15 at 19.3%. We still expect this segment is like expand its margin this year net of any currency effects. From a volume perspective, traditional accounts on file, grew $2.9 million to a record level of $66 million, a 4.7% from prior year and the segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth of 7.3%. As I mentioned in our Q1 call, our CUP joint venture continues to meet expectations for both of our organizations and we expect continued growth from this business despite the slowdown of the Chinese economy's growth rate. 
Overall, we're pleased with our International segment's performance for the quarter as the business continues to deliver against its strategic plans. 
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10. First, as I mentioned earlier, we're pleased with integration and synergy plans for TransFirst are on track. With the acquisition of TransFirst, net revenue for this segment was $261.5 million, up 121.8% and as I mentioned earlier, our Merchant segment now represents roughly 1/3 of the net revenue of the company. While TransFirst, our legacy Merchant business or meeting profit expectations but given the success of the integration and the movements between our businesses to competitively align our offerings, we already view this business as 1 entity as opposed to 2 separate businesses. As we discussed last quarter, our direct business is now more than 80% of segment net revenue, achieving our long-term strategic goal of having over 75% of our net revenue derived from direct Merchant acquiring. Our focus on the SMB State and ongoing traction in integrated payments continues to drive double-digit SPS volume growth. Combined, our integrated payments channels I know approximately 30% of our total direct businesses net revenue. While we still view our indirect business has a lower flat growth business, we did see positive net revenue growth of 5.7% year-over-year, driven by POS transaction growth of 6.4% year-over-year. We do expect this to return to more of a flat growth picture for the remaining part of the year. However, similar to the comments I made last quarter within our indirect business, we continue to retain our core customers, renewing 4 full service agreements, including 1 of our top 5 customers. I've mentioned on several occasions that the margin picture of the Merchant segment would likely remain unchanged with the integration of TransFirst and that was the case in this quarter, with margins at a strong 34.4%, in line with the 2Q margin of '15. As I mentioned, John and his team are quickly integrating the 2 businesses and as the integration seasons, we will likely provide new metrics that will best measure and drive performance on a go-forward basis. We are not likely to continue to report on a direct and indirect basis given the smaller impact of indirect in the way we are now managing the combined businesses but wanted to continue to provide this breakout this quarter to complete the picture that we had outlined at the time of the acquisition around revenue contribution mix. In all, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of both the underlying Merchant businesses, the integration that is occurring, the revenue contribution mix we now have, specifically in integrated payments, and the opportunities that we see ahead for this segment. 
Now I want to talk about strong performance of the NetSpend segment, starting on Slide 11. Revenue for NetSpend topped $162.6 million, representing 14.8% year-over-year organic revenue growth for the quarter. Revenue growth is strong both in total and by acquisition channel with 3 of our 4 distribution channels delivering double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. This shows the result of a diversified distribution model where we continue to win new business, as well as expand and extend our existing relationships. The second quarter had more than $6.6 billion of gross dollar volume or spend, up 19.6% over prior year. We exited the quarter with 4.4 million active cards, almost 2.2 million of which were on direct deposits, which represents a 16.6% year-over-year increase. While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we are also consistently focused on expanding our distribution network by adding approximately 1,000 distributing employers and locations in the country, bringing the current total to more than 101,000. This count does not include new distribution locations that we could add with the expanded Blackhawk relationship that Troy discussed earlier. Second quarter margins expanded slightly from the prior year of 26.1% and we are preparing for some larger card and marketing cost in the second half of the year associated with merchandising additional facing at Blackhawk distribution locations. We're pleased with NetSpend's position coming out of Q2. Our expectation for this business continues to be for revenue growth in the low double digits on a full year basis with slightly expanding margins for 2016 versus 2015. 
Leaving NetSpend and moving to the consolidated level again, you can see on Slide 12 how each of our segments margins contributed to our overall adjusted operating margin of 28.6%, up over 200 basis points from last year's 2Q level. The story is similar on a year-to-date basis with a 28.2% adjusted operating margin, as seen on Slide 13. Also, I want to state that these slides provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. This slide also provides reconciliation to GAAP operating income of $287.5 million. As it relates to our cash position, we ended the quarter at $465 million in cash, up $20 million from the end of the first quarter which excluded the proceeds from the $1.49 billion we borrowed that we used for the TransFirst acquisition. We have $37 million of CapEx for the quarter, up which about 29% was related to property and equipment, 27% was related to contract acquisition cost, with the remaining 44% related to internally developed and licensed software. When we announced the TransFirst acquisition, I highlighted our deleveraging plan of approximately $800 million of deleveraging in the first 24 months post acquisition. We deployed $125 million during the quarter for accelerated repayments on our bank credit facility as part of our deleveraging plan and we remain committed to this plan and our investment-grade rating. Our average basic weighted shares outstanding for the quarter were over 183.7  million and 183.5 million on a year-to-date basis. 
Now I'm here on cash flow. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $157.6 million and our year-to-date free cash flow of $259 million is at 37.3% increase from the year-to-date levels of last year. And based on this performance, we continue to believe that our annual free cash flow estimate of $510 million to $540 [ph] million for 2016 is still valid. Although I want to remind you that as demonstrated in our history, cash will not flow in a linear manner on a quarterly basis. On taxes, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.1%, which is higher than our normal levels due to some acquisition-related effects that are onetime in nature and we expect the last half of the year to return to the 34% range. But on a reported basis, this second quarter increase will move our expected full year rate from the 34% range closer to 35%. And finally, on guidance. While our guidance remains unchanged at this time, I do want to mention that the surprise Brexit vote and its impact on the pound and euro to the dollar could negatively impact our International results in the back half of the year. If the 2 currencies remain at current levels, we can see an approximate 100 basis point decline or greater and our estimated revenue growth for the full year and adjusted EPS pressure in the $0.02 range. It's too early to tell at this point, but I want to share that commentary with you and we'll update you further in 3Q on this effect. 
And finally, I want to summarize with 3 primary callouts that I think are the key takeaways from today. The first callout is on margins. I mentioned on our January call that our focus for 2016 was going to be on margins following the strong year of organic revenue growth and margin expansion in 2015. Our goal going into the year was to expand our adjusted EBITDA margin by roughly 100 basis points and we wanted this margin expansion to be delivered in a cross-segment way. To the first 6 months, we've delivered against this goal with adjusted EBITDA margins increasing 130 basis points on a quarterly basis and 160 basis points on a year-to-date basis. With some investments made in the back half of the year, we still expect to expand this important metric by 100 basis points for the year, roughly in line with what we achieved last year. Also, we will be making margin improvement moves over the coming quarters to expand the story for the longer term. Continuing on what Troy mentioned about our TSYS 2020 efficiency and margin improvement initiatives, we expect to have approximately $5 million to $7 million of onetime-related expenses in the third quarter, primarily related to severance that will be partially offset by salary and benefit savings in the fourth quarter. 
The second callout is related to the upcoming comparison in our third quarter. If you recall, in 2015, during the third quarter, we experienced a onetime-related EPS tax benefit of $0.13, which we detailed in our Q3 2015 earnings call and schedules. This $0.13 included a $15 million operating income benefit and a net $8.5 million benefit on the tax line which have to be adjusted out on the 2015 results for a proper comparison to 3Q 2016 results and extra care on this should be applied to arrive at a better approximation of expected performance in Q3 of 2016. I want to continue to stress this point as stated I did on our last call and our latest Analyst Day to allow for the proper handling of the compassion results of Q3 2016 versus Q3 of 2015. So there are 3 moving parts expected in the third quarter. First, you should consider the tax effects from the prior year needing adjustment. Second are the expected non-TransFirst onetime expenses of $5 million to $7 million primarily related to severance which would reduced 3Q adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02. And third, the potential currency impacts in the back half of the year that I mentioned earlier which could reduce our net revenue yearly growth rate by approximately 100 basis points with a potential $0.02 of negative EPS impact. The third and final callout is the continued execution against our strategic plan of creating a diversified payments company and platform. With the completion of TransFirst, we have largely completed a multiyear strategic goal of diversifying the revenue contribution to a more strategic balance of higher growth revenue streams and payments. We believe that balance we now have of 37% of net revenue from North America issuer of processing, 33% from Merchant acquiring with the acquisition of TransFirst; 20% from NetSpend and the remaining 10% for our International opportunities not including our China UnionPay JV to provide TSYS the strength and diversification that is unique in payments. When you couple this revenue diversification with our recent margin improvement plan that will continue into 2017 and beyond, you can see that the changing phase of TSYS provides for a stronger and better position company in the future. None of this execution would it be possible without the extreme dedication of our team members and we specifically thank our new team members from TransFirst who joined us during the quarter and made strong contributions to the success of this quarter. With thank our entire team for delivering another successful quarter of outstanding results. And with that, we will open it up for questions."

And I would just kind of reinforce that the strategic nature of getting this partnership, if you think back to kind of the late '14 time frame where we had several strategic partnerships that we announced in that timeframe, we didn't have those in '15 and that's actually kind of providing some of the rollover challenge in the second half of the year for NetSpend.

We kind of got an elevated level there that we're then dealing with this year and  over time, that will all kind of mute itself out. As it relates to Green Dot specifically, there is some decline there that plays out on a kind of year-over-year basis. But outside of that, I wouldn't characterize anything else that's dramatically playing out there. As it relates to their account on file on the North America revenue piece, yes, as we have gotten to be kind of have a more bundled piece with this new base that we're at, the connection points between the accounts on file and revenue growth is looser, and specifically when you have Value Added Services and you have a bigger portion coming from kind of the non-account on file-based fees, then you get into that kind of disconnect.

So there's some partial offsetting there. And as we look at kind of in the business and how it's performed and you kind of put it all together, it does kind of push us to a little bit of over-performance that we've had in the first half of the year that didn't get kind of netted against some of these pressure points in the second half of the year.

We do that business primarily as a service to our customers and while it is -- it's causing some comparison challenges on a year-over-year basis, that is a lower margin business than our overall segment. Now as we Bill mentioned on our Analyst Day, that is a business that potentially has upside to it to the degree that we are more successful in cross-selling into our installed base. And so from a future growth expectation standpoint, there is some there but without that piece, and with that higher EMV elevation that has occurred throughout last year that we're dealing with now in the second, it will increase in the third, in the fourth quarter, we are having that rollover piece. As it relates to your second question, it is mid-single digit revenue growth expectation both for this year and as I look out on a longer-term basis, right now, everything I see still points us to mid-single digits. I think 2 years ago at our Analyst Day, we kind of said mid-to-high but that was before we had the benefit of the seasoning of this large conversion that came into the base. I think did say at that time we were closer to mid-than hybrid I wanted to see the large conversion come into the base and relook at the portfolio with that in there.

Good evening, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This has been another excellent quarter for TSYS.

Good evening, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This has been another excellent quarter for TSYS. Our team members across our global footprint delivered an outstanding performance for the quarter and for the first half of the year. As a reminder, this quarter's results include a full quarter of TransFirst. I will address our integration activities with respect to TransFirst later. But by almost any measure, our first quarter together has been very successful, and we are pleased with our progress and the new team.
Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are: consolidated net revenue was up 27.8%; adjusted earnings per share increased 27.9%; and consolidated operating margin expanded 202 basis points. All 4 of our operating segments contributed to these exceptional metrics for the quarter. I want to congratulate and thank all of our team members for their dedication, commitment and focus as we continue to deliver on our strategic plan.
One final highlight before we move into the specific results for our segments. While we measure our success with our financials, we also take great pride in our community involvement and servant leadership. In June, we were recognized as one of America's most community-minded companies by Civic 50, an initiative that identifies companies for their commitment to improve the quality of life in the communities where they do business. This is the third consecutive time we have been honored with this award, and it is a compliment to our dedicated team members who give back to the communities where they work and live.
I now would like to address the highlights for each of our segments, beginning with North America. Our strong financial performance in North America is partially a result of a positive U.S. economy, which posted job gains and overall strength in consumer spending during the quarter. April produced the largest increase in consumer spending in 6 years, and May and June were also robust, pointing to a reasonably healthy American consumer.
We still expect a significant portion of our growth in our North America segment to come from the cross-sell of products and services. We continue to place significant focus on cross-selling existing products and services to current clients as well as a longer-term view of delivering and cross-selling new products and services. These new products and services will be delivered through the transformation of technologies and innovation currently underway at TSYS. To this point, during the quarter, we saw a 13.1% increase over the same quarter last year from the sale of services across our Value-Added, Loyalty and Managed Services groups in this segment.
On the business development front, we signed a new long-term agreement with the Bank of Montreal to process their Mastercard-branded debit accounts, and we also renewed 3 issuing contracts. We have previously indicated that Green Dot would be de-converted from TSYS during the second half of 2016. Green Dot has executed on 3 of their planned 4 de-conversions from TSYS. However, the final wave of accounts is not expected to be de-converted from TSYS this year.
Now let's turn to the International segment. Of course, the headline-grabbing news from the International segment was the Brexit vote in the U.K. The early reaction certainly negatively impacted both the currency and the equity markets. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union has created an overall air of uncertainty in political, social and economic circles across the globe. Following this vote, we spoke with many executives across our European client base, and their current position is business as usual with TSYS. One of our clients published a report which indicated that U.K. consumer spending remained resilient both before and after the Brexit EU referendum. There are many different views on Brexit's longer-term impact and the potential implications that it may or may not cause. We will continue to monitor these developments closely, and we'll take appropriate actions when and if deemed necessary.
Also during the quarter, our International Managed Services business became Financial Conduct Authority or FCA authorized. This puts TSYS in a unique position against our competitors and enables us to extend our current service offering to include broad customer care support and engagement across Europe.
As I mentioned last quarter, our Brazilian business continues to make significant financial and operational progress. Although the Brazilian market remains challenging due to political and economic uncertainty and the run-up to the Rio Olympic Games, we are optimistic over the interest in our market-leading payments platform from across the broader Latin and South America regions.
In China, the economy has slowed to the mid to mid-high single-digit growth. However, the underlying electronic payment transaction growth and overall upward trend in consumer spending and this $8.3 trillion card payment market continues to fuel our CUP Data joint venture above expectations.
In our PRIME business, we continued to see progress in the licensing and processing business lines with many new prospects in each area. Our focus will continue to be on leveraging our recently transformed international upgrading platforms to deliver cost-effective solutions on both TS2 and PRIME around the globe.
For our combined issuing segments, we added over 13 million traditional accounts during the quarter, which is further proof of the health of our issuing business. Our focus will continue to be on client retention, cross-selling products and services as well as new targeted prospects around the globe.
Now let's address our Merchant business. As I indicated earlier, TransFirst is included in our second quarter numbers. We have just completed our first quarter of the TransFirst acquisition, and we are pleased to report that the integration work and synergy goals were both on track. As we've indicated from the beginning regarding this acquisition, our goal is to optimize the capabilities, products and services across our combined entities that will enable our customers to rely on one single provider for all of their processing needs. We believe this is a key market differentiator.
Although there is significant integration work that still must take place, we will remain relentlessly focused on growing the business. Today, over 80% of our Merchant net revenue is derived from our direct channels. We believe the scale and diverse distribution network that we have created in our Merchant business is one of the keys to our success. Our combined Merchant businesses now gives us leadership positions in all 3 of our lines of business.
And finally, I would like to address NetSpend. Our NetSpend segment had another great quarter as well. Quarterly revenues were up almost 15%. Margins improved slightly year-over-year and 330 basis points sequentially. And we surpassed 101,000 distributing locations and employers for the quarter.
On the business development front, I am happy to announce that our long-standing distribution partner and industry leader, Blackhawk Network, has entered a 10-year strategic partnership that builds upon more than a decade of work we've done together. This new partnership will provide significant expansion of facings for NetSpend and Blackhawk's impressive U.S. retail network and potentially provide additional distribution locations in grocery stores and other retailers.
Another great win for our retail presence this quarter was a 3-year extension of the NetSpend partnership with CVS.
Our PayCard channel was also very active during the quarter. We signed new 3-year agreements with the Gap and with JCPenney to be their exclusive PayCard provider. This new and growing partnerships saw the manifestation of NetSpend's goal to meet consumers where they work and shop to provide them with a great solution, fulfilling their financial needs.
As to the CFPB, we now expect the final rules to be published sometime in September. When the final rules are published and after we have had an adequate review period, we will share with you what it means to our business and what our mitigation strategies are. All in all, it was a great quarter with all 4 segments growing revenue, expanding our consolidated margin, executing on the TransFirst acquisition and winning new business.
At our Investor Day conference in May, I discussed the launching of our TSYS 20/20 initiatives. This is an enterprise-wide initiative to bring clarity and focus to our future business model. As a reminder, one of the tenets of TSYS 20/20 was to provide us with an assessment of the ideal operating structure to maximize efficiencies and the scale of our operations. As I mentioned earlier, this process is well underway on our Merchant segment primarily as a result of the TransFirst acquisition. Through organizational consolidation, job eliminations and other efficiency initiatives, we are ahead of schedule to achieve our $15 million synergy goal for Merchant in 2017. We are now in the process of taking this efficiency initiative to the rest of our company. As a result of this process, we do expect to have some onetime-related expenses in the third quarter primarily related to severance. We are convinced that these moves will ensure we are operating in our full potential and will allow us to improve and strengthen our already very successful business model. Paul will provide additional color on this in his remarks.
With that, I'll ask Paul to provide additional detail and financial information for the second quarter and outlook for the remainder of 2016. Paul?"
308973,370157974,1012898,"Total System Services, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Total System Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Troy. And I want to reemphasize how pleased we are with the second quarter performance of our company as we continue to execute against our strategic plans. As I mentioned on our last 2 calls regarding 2016 expected performance, we would be exe",2966,"Thank you, Troy. And I want to reemphasize how pleased we are with the second quarter performance of our company as we continue to execute against our strategic plans. As I mentioned on our last 2 calls regarding 2016 expected performance, we would be executing on improving margins in our company while being focused on the integration of TransFirst, and that is exactly what occurred during the second quarter. We couldn't be more pleased with the TransFirst acquisition as John Shlonsky and team have already started to reorganize and are successfully down the integration path to position the TSYS Merchant segment in a unique way. When we announced the transaction, our goal was to achieve double-digit percentage accretion with the transaction, which we achieved in the second quarter, and our synergy attainment goals are on track. So we see very positive momentum with TransFirst.
Now turning to Slide 6 and a review of the numbers. Total revenues were $1.15 billion, a 66.3% increase from the second quarter of last year. And net revenue was up 27.8% from 2Q '15 to $794.9 million. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 32.7% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 27.9%, both in line with our net revenue increase. On a GAAP basis, basic EPS was down $0.07 to $0.38 as a result of the effect of the TransFirst acquisition.
On a year-to-date basis, total revenues were $1.89 billion, a 39.6% increase. And net revenue was $1.47 billion, representing a 20.4% growth over 2015. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $504.9  million is 26.2% higher than through this time last year, and year-to-date adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.40 is a 25.5% increase. On a GAAP basis, basic EPS was flat at $0.87 from prior year, once again, reflecting the effect of the TransFirst acquisition.
I mentioned on our last 2 calls about our goal to increase our adjusted EBITDA margin by 100 basis points this year, and we achieved this goal in the quarter with an approximate 130 basis point increase for the quarter and 160 basis point expansion through 6 months. It is still our goal to achieve this 100 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the year, building upon the strong adjusted EBITDA margin expansion we have last year.
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that our diversification strategy around the contribution of revenue continues with the TransFirst acquisition included in our results for the first time in our Merchant segment now represents 1/3 of our net revenue, up from approximately 19% from this time last year. We believe this diversified revenue mix provides for strength and is a unique dynamic in the TSYS investment story as we continue to diversify our revenue mix to be more heavily weighted to the higher growth areas of payments.
Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 28.6%, an increase of over 200 basis points versus Q2 of 2015, and our 28.2% year-to-date margin is also an increase of roughly 200 basis points. Importantly, 3 of our 4 segments saw their adjusted segment operating margins expand for the quarter from the second quarter of last year and speaks to the strength of the cross-segment delivery of performance that I've mentioned as our goal on our last 2 calls. Clearly, we're pleased with our consolidated results, but we are equally pleased with the impressive segment results that are behind the consolidated numbers.
Now let's dig into the segment results for North America, starting on Slide 8. As I mentioned on our last call, we expect the North America segment full year revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range in 2016, and that is still our expectation. Revenue for the quarter was up 3.5%, and we saw cross-sell growth in our Value-Added, Managed Services and Loyalty Services up a combined 13.1% over the same quarter last year. The sequential quarter decline in net revenue growth from the 14.1% last quarter is largely due to the anniversary of a large client conversion in mid-Q1 2015, along with our Output Services area returning to more normalized levels as we begin to anniversary some of the elevated growth we've seen in recent quarters related to EMV, other projects and some onetime items.
As for this segment's operating income, it grew 4% over last year, resulting in a segment operating margin of 37.9%, up 20 basis points. From a volume perspective, you can see from this slide that our traditional accounts on file continues to show steady growth and has reached yet another new record of $435.1 million. I'll remind you that this excludes prepaid, government services and single-use accounts.
We continue to redeploy and refocus resources in our issuer product group, our client experience initiatives and across our IT landscape to provide a more proactive and focused delivery model as well as focus on cross-selling existing products into the market-leading distribution channel that we spent years cultivating. Overall, we continue to expect this business to grow in the mid-single-digit range for the year with slightly expanding margins. 
Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on Slide 9, where we continued to experience revenue growth, and more importantly, operating income and margin growth. Net revenue of $81.8 million was down 2.5% on a reported basis but up 4.2% on a constant currency basis. The constant currency revenue growth of 4.2% is consistent with the low single-digit constant currency revenue growth we expect for this segment this year. We continue to see solid growth from our existing client base in Europe, which was partially offset by previously expected lost client revenue.
The segment's margin continues to grow in line with our margin improvement plan, delivering over 330 basis points in margin improvement over Q2 of '15 at 19.3%. We still expect this segment to slightly expand its margin this year net of any currency effects. From a volume perspective, traditional accounts on file grew $2.9 million to a record level of $66 million, up 4.7% from prior year. And the segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth of 7.3%.
As I mentioned in our Q1 call, our CUP Data joint venture continues to meet expectations for both of our organizations, and we expect continued growth from this business despite the slowdown of the Chinese economy's growth rate. Overall, we're pleased with our International segment's performance for the quarter as the business continues to deliver against its strategic plans.
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10. First, as I mentioned earlier, we're pleased that the integration and synergy plans for TransFirst are on track. With the acquisition of TransFirst, net revenue for this segment was $261.5 million, up 121.8%. And as I mentioned earlier, our Merchant segment now represents roughly 1/3 of the net revenue of the company. Both TransFirst and our legacy Merchant business are meeting our profit expectations, but given the success of the integration and the movements between our businesses to competitively align our offerings, we already view this business as one entity as opposed to 2 separate businesses.
As we discussed last quarter, our direct business is now more than 80% of segment net revenue, achieving our long-term strategic goal of having over 75% of our net revenue derived from direct Merchant acquiring. Our focus on the SMB stays, and ongoing traction in integrated payments continues to drive double-digit SBS volume growth. Combined, our integrated payments channels are now approximately 30% of our total direct business' net revenue.
While we still view our indirect business has a lower flat growth business, we did see positive net revenue growth of 5.7% year-over-year, driven by POS transaction growth of 6.4% year-over-year. We do expect this to return to more of a flat growth picture for the remaining part of the year. However, similar to the comments I made last quarter within our indirect business, we continue to retain our core customers, renewing 4 full service agreements, including 1 of our top 5 customers.
I've mentioned on several occasions that the margin picture of the Merchant segment would likely remain unchanged with the integration of TransFirst. And that was the case in this quarter with margins at a strong 34.4%, in line with the 2Q margin of '15. As I mentioned, John and his team are quickly integrating the 2 businesses, and as the integration seasons, we will likely be providing new metrics that will best measure and drive performance on a go-forward basis. We are not likely to continue to report on a direct and indirect basis given the smaller impact of indirect and the way we are now managing the combined businesses but wanted to continue to provide this breakout this quarter to complete the picture that we had outlined at the time of the acquisition around revenue contribution mix. In all, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of both the underlying Merchant businesses, the integration that is occurring, the revenue contribution mix we now have, specifically in integrated payments, and the opportunities that we see ahead for this segment.
Now I want to talk about the strong performance of the NetSpend segment, starting on Slide 11. Revenue for NetSpend topped $162.6 million, representing 14.8% year-over-year organic revenue growth for the quarter. Revenue growth is strong both in total and by acquisition channel with 3 of our 4 distribution channels delivering double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. This shows the result of a diversified distribution model where we continue to win new business as well as expand and extend our existing relationships.
The second quarter had more than $6.6 billion of gross dollar volume or spend, up 19.6% over prior year. We exited the quarter with 4.4 million active cards, almost 2.2 million of which were on direct deposits, which represents a 16.6% year-over-year increase. While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we are also consistently focused on expanding our distribution network by adding approximately 1,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 101,000. This count does not include new distribution locations that we could add with the expanded Blackhawk relationship that Troy discussed earlier.
Second quarter margins expanded slightly from the prior year of 26.1%, and we are preparing for some larger card and marketing cost in the second half of the year associated with merchandising additional facing at Blackhawk distribution locations. We're pleased with NetSpend's position coming out of Q2. Our expectation for this business continues to be for revenue growth in the low double digits on a full year basis with slightly expanding margins for 2016 versus 2015.
Leaving NetSpend and moving to the consolidated level again. You can see on Slide 12 how each of our segments' margins contributed to our overall adjusted operating margin of 28.6%, up over 200 basis points from last year's 2Q level. The story is similar on a year-to-date basis with a 28.2% adjusted operating margin, as seen on Slide 13. Also, I want to state that these slides provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles, M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. This slide also provides reconciliation to GAAP operating income of $287.5 million.
As it relates to our cash position, we ended the quarter at $465 million in cash, up $20 million from the end of the first quarter, which excluded the proceeds from the $1.49 billion we borrowed that we used for the TransFirst acquisition. We have $37 million of CapEx for the quarter, of which about 29% was related to property and equipment, 27% was related to contract acquisition cost, with the remaining 44% related to internally developed and licensed software.
When we announced the TransFirst acquisition, I highlighted our deleveraging plan of approximately $800 million of deleveraging in the first 24 months post acquisition. We deployed $125 million during the quarter for accelerated repayments on our bank credit facility as part of our deleveraging plan, and we remain committed to this plan and our investment-grade rating. Our average basic weighted shares outstanding for the quarter were 183.7  million and 183.5 million on a year-to-date basis.
Now a minute on cash flow. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $157.6 million, and our year-to-date free cash flow of $259 million is a 37.3% increase from the year-to-date levels of last year. And based on this performance, we continue to believe that our annual free cash flow estimate of $510 million to $540 million for 2016 is still valid. Although I want to remind you that as demonstrated in our history, cash will not flow in a linear manner on a quarterly basis.
On taxes, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.1%, which is higher than our normal levels due to some acquisition-related effects that are onetime in nature, and we expect the last half of the year to return to the 34% range. But on a reported basis, this second quarter increase will move our expected full year rate from the 34% range closer to 35%.
And finally, on guidance. While our guidance remains unchanged at this time, I do want to mention that the surprise Brexit vote and its impact on the pound and euro to the dollar could negatively impact our International results in the back half of the year. If the 2 currencies remain at current levels, we could see an approximate 100 basis point decline or greater in our estimated revenue growth for the full year and adjusted EPS pressure in the $0.02 range. It's too early to tell at this point, but I wanted to share that commentary with you, and we'll update you further in 3Q on this effect.
And finally, I want to summarize with 3 primary callouts that I think are the key takeaways from today. The first callout is on margins. I mentioned on our January call that our focus for 2016 was going to be on margins following the strong year of organic revenue growth and margin expansion in 2015. Our goal going into the year was to expand our adjusted EBITDA margin by roughly 100 basis points, and we wanted this margin expansion to be delivered in a cross-segment way. Through the first 6 months, we've delivered against this goal with adjusted EBITDA margins increasing 130 basis points on a quarterly basis and 160 basis points on a year-to-date basis. With some investments made in the back half of the year, we still expect to expand this important metric by 100 basis points for the year, roughly in line with what we achieved last year. Also, we will be making margin improvement moves over the coming quarters to expand the story for the longer term. Continuing on what Troy mentioned about our TSYS 20/20 efficiency and margin improvement initiatives, we expect to have approximately $5 million to $7 million of onetime-related expenses in the third quarter primarily related to severance that will be partially offset by salary and benefit savings in the fourth quarter.
The second callout is related to the upcoming comparison in our third quarter. If you will recall, in 2015, during the third quarter, we experienced a onetime-related EPS tax benefit of $0.13, which we detailed in our Q3 2015 earnings call and schedules. This $0.13 included a $15 million operating income benefit and a net $8.5 million benefit on the tax line, which have to be adjusted out of the 2015 results for a proper comparison to 3Q 2016 results, and extra care on this should be applied to arrive at a better approximation of expected performance in Q3 of 2016. I want to continue to stress this point, as I did on our last call and at our latest Analyst Day, to allow for the proper handling of the compassion results of Q3 2016 versus Q3 of 2015.
So there are 3 moving parts expected in the third quarter. First, you should consider the tax effects from the prior year needing adjustment. Second are the expected non-TransFirst onetime expenses of $5 million to $7 million primarily related to severance which would reduce 3Q adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02. And third, the potential currency impacts in the back half of the year that I mentioned earlier, which could reduce our net revenue yearly growth rate by approximately 100 basis points with a potential $0.02 of negative EPS impact.
The third and final callout is the continued execution against our strategic plan of creating a diversified payments company and platform. With the completion of TransFirst, we have largely completed our multiyear strategic goal of diversifying the revenue contribution to a more strategic balance of higher growth revenue streams and payments. We believe the balance we now have of 37% of net revenue from North America issuer processing, 33% from Merchant acquiring with the acquisition of TransFirst, 20% from NetSpend and the remaining 10% for our International opportunities not including our China UnionPay JV provides TSYS the strength and diversification that is unique in payments. When you couple this revenue diversification with our recent margin improvement plan that will continue into 2017 and beyond, you can see that the changing face of TSYS provides for a stronger and better positioned company in the future.
None of this execution would be possible without the extreme dedication of our team members, and we specifically thank our new team members from TransFirst who joined us during the quarter and made strong contributions to the success of this quarter. We thank our entire team for delivering another successful quarter of outstanding results.
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

And I would just kind of reinforce that the strategic nature of getting this partnership, if you think back to kind of the late '14 time frame where we had several strategic partnerships that we announced in that time frame, we didn't have those in '15 and that's actually kind of providing some of the rollover challenge in the second half of the year for NetSpend. So it's nice to have a strategic win a bit, so some meaningful size that will get benefit far in the '17 time frame."

We do have the comp issue with a large conversion from that sequential quarter comparison. But we are -- from a kind of a year-over-year basis, the single biggest kind of to grow over challenge is in Output Services where we had a higher elevated of revenue from Output Services last year related to EMV. And you'll recall, last year throughout the year, I was saying that those services were coming in at higher-than-expected ranges. So we kind of got an elevated level there that we're then dealing with this year, and over time, that will all kind of mute itself out. As it relates to Green Dot specifically, there is some decline there that plays out on a kind of year-over-year basis. But outside of that, I wouldn't characterize anything else that's dramatically playing out there. As it relates to the account on file on the North America revenue piece, yes, I mean, as we have gotten to be -- kind of have a more bundled piece with this new base that we're at, the connection points between the accounts on file and revenue growth is looser. And specifically when you have Value-Added Services and you have a bigger portion coming from kind of the non-account-on-file-based fees, then you get into that kind of disconnect.

And so that has created some -- when you look at second half to first half, the comparison challenges that exist there. I'd also point to the second half of NetSpend relative to the first half. And due to some of the investments that we make in the back half of the year, that -- at our pretax season in nature, that also kind of plays things out. Although we do expect the second half of the year NetSpend margin on a year-over-year basis to be favorable, when you look at the first half to the second half, that's playing in there as well. So those would be the 2 from a segment standpoint. There's other kind of things that play out.

We do that business primarily as a service to our customers. And while it is -- it's causing some comparison challenges on a year-over-year basis, that is a lower margin business than our overall segment. Now as Bill Pruett mentioned on our Analyst Day, that is a business that potentially has some upside to it to the degree that we are more successful in cross-selling into our installed base. And so from a future growth potential standpoint, there is some there. But without that piece and with that higher EMV elevation that has occurred throughout last year that we're dealing with now in the second, it will increase in the third. And in the fourth quarter, we are having that rollover piece. As it relates to your second question, it is mid-single-digit revenue growth expectation both for this year. And as I look out on a longer-term basis, right now, everything I see still points us to mid-single digit. I think 2 years ago at our Analyst Day, we kind of said mid to high, but that was before we had the benefit of the seasoning of this large conversion that came into the base. I think I did set at the same -- at that time we were closer to mid than high, but I wanted to see the large conversion come into the base and relook at the portfolio with that in there.

It's not just an act. I think we'll just have to, as I said earlier, continue to monitor it and watch it. Some of our customers' stock took quite a beating there over the coming -- over the few weeks after the Brexit vote, down anywhere from 10% to 50%. I think as it relates to making a decision, as I indicated in my remarks, in talking to some of our customers across Europe, they've indicated that business as usual with respect to TSYS. But I really think over time, we'll just have to see what kind of varying degrees of disruption that may bring. I think it's just going to take a long time to figure it all out, sort it all out."

As it relates to what we're dealing with on kind of the current year or even as you look into the more nearer term is that kind of mid-single-digit revenue growth that we're still expecting for this year. And specifically as it relates to this Output Services, that's really more of a 2016 impact that we're seeing from a 2015 kind of inflated base due to EMV primarily, although there are some other moving pieces in there, which will always going to have onetime items and moving pieces in this business. So you almost need to think of them in 2 buckets: one, kind of what's the current run rate of the business and what's that looking like; and two, then what's the longer-term future opportunity set of higher penetration of cross-sell of our services into our installed base."

Good evening, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This has been another excellent quarter for TSYS. Our team members across our global footprint delivered an outstanding performance for the quarter and for the first half of the year. As a reminder, this quarter's results include a full quarter of TransFirst. I will address our integration activities with respect to TransFirst later. But by almost any measure, our first quarter together has been very successful, and we are pleased with our progress and the new team.
Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are: consolidated net revenue was up 27.8%; adjusted earnings per share increased 27.9%; and consolidated operating margin expanded 202 basis points. All 4 of our operating segments contributed to these exceptional metrics for the quarter. I want to congratulate and thank all of our team members for their dedication, commitment and focus as we continue to deliver on our strategic plan.
One final highlight before we move into the specific results for our segments. While we measure our success with our financials, we also take great pride in our community involvement and servant leadership. In June, we were recognized as one of America's most community-minded companies by Civic 50, an initiative that identifies companies for their commitment to improving the quality of life in the communities where they do business. This is the third consecutive time we have been honored with this award, and it is a compliment to our dedicated team members who give back to the communities where they work and live.
I now would like to address the highlights for each of our segments, beginning with North America. Our strong financial performance in North America is partially a result of a positive U.S. economy, which posted job gains and overall strength in consumer spending during the quarter. April produced the largest increase in consumer spending in 6 years, and May and June were also robust, pointing to a reasonably healthy American consumer.
We still expect a significant portion of our growth in our North America segment to come from the cross-sale of products and services. We continue to place significant focus on cross-selling existing products and services to current clients as well as a longer-term view of delivering and cross-selling new products and services. These new products and services will be delivered through the transformation of technologies and innovation currently underway at TSYS. To this point, during the quarter, we saw a 13.1% increase over the same quarter last year from the sale of services across our Value-Added, Loyalty and Managed Services groups in this segment.
On the business development front, we signed a new long-term agreement with the Bank of Montreal to process their Mastercard-branded debit accounts, and we also renewed 3 issuing contracts. We have previously indicated that Green Dot would be de-converted from TSYS during the second half of 2016. Green Dot has executed on 3 of their planned 4 de-conversions from TSYS. However, the final wave of accounts is not expected to be de-converted from TSYS this year.
Now let's turn to the International segment. Of course, the headline-grabbing news from our International segment was the Brexit vote in the U.K. The early reaction certainly negatively impacted both the currency and the equity markets. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union has created an overall air of uncertainty in political, social and economic circles across the globe. Following this vote, we spoke with many executives across our European client base, and their current position is business as usual with TSYS. One of our clients published a report which indicated that U.K. consumer spending remained resilient both before and after the Brexit EU referendum. There are many different views on Brexit's longer-term impact and the potential implications that it may or may not cause. We will continue to monitor these developments closely, and we'll take appropriate actions when and if deemed necessary.
Also during the quarter, our International Managed Services business became Financial Conduct Authority or FCA authorized. This puts TSYS in a unique position against our competitors and enables us to extend our current service offering to include broad customer care support and engagement across Europe.
As I mentioned last quarter, our Brazilian business continues to make significant financial and operational progress. Although the Brazilian market remains challenging due to political and economic uncertainty and the run-up to the Rio Olympic Games, we are optimistic over the interest in our market-leading payments platform from across the broader Latin and South America regions.
In China, the economy has slowed to mid to mid-high single-digit growth. However, the underlying electronic payment transaction growth and overall upward trend in consumer spending in this $8.3 trillion card payment market continues to fuel our CUP Data joint venture above expectations.
In our PRIME business, we continued to see progress in the licensing and processing business lines with many new prospects in each area. Our focus will continue to be on leveraging our recently transformed international upgrading platforms to deliver cost-effective solutions on both TS2 and PRIME around the globe.
For our combined issuing segments, we added over 13 million traditional accounts during the quarter, which is further proof of the health of our issuing business. Our focus will continue to be on client retention, cross-selling products and services as well as new targeted prospects around the globe.
Now let's address our Merchant business. As I indicated earlier, TransFirst is included in our second quarter numbers. We have just completed our first quarter of the TransFirst acquisition, and we are pleased to report that the integration work and synergy goals were both on track. As we've indicated from the beginning regarding this acquisition, our goal is to optimize the capabilities, products and services across our combined entities that will enable our customers to rely on one single provider for all of their processing needs. We believe this is a key market differentiator.
Although there is significant integration work that still must take place, we will remain relentlessly focused on growing the business. Today, over 80% of our Merchant net revenue is derived from our direct channels. We believe the scale and diverse distribution network that we have created in our Merchants business is one of the keys to our success. Our combined Merchant businesses now gives us leadership positions in all 3 of our lines of business.
And finally, I would like to address NetSpend. Our NetSpend segment had another great quarter as well. Quarterly revenues were up almost 15%. Margins improved slightly year-over-year and 330 basis points sequentially. And we surpassed 101,000 distributing locations and employers for the quarter.
On the business development front, I am happy to announce that our long-standing distribution partner and industry leader, Blackhawk Network, has entered a 10-year strategic partnership that builds upon more than a decade of work we've done together. This new partnership will provide significant expansion of facings for NetSpend in Blackhawk's impressive U.S. retail network and potentially provide additional distribution locations in grocery stores and other retailers.
Another great win for our retail presence this quarter was a 3-year extension of the NetSpend partnership with CVS.
Our PayCard channel was also very active during the quarter. We signed new 3-year agreements with the Gap and with JCPenney to be their exclusive PayCard provider. These new and growing partnerships saw the manifestation of NetSpend's goal to meet consumers where they work and shop to provide them with a great solution, fulfilling their financial needs.
As to the CFPB, we now expect the final rules to be published sometime in September. When the final rules are published and after we have had an adequate review period, we will share with you what it means to our business and what our mitigation strategies are. All in all, it was a great quarter with all 4 segments growing revenue, expanding our consolidated margin, executing on the TransFirst acquisition and winning new business.
At our Investor Day conference in May, I discussed the launching of our TSYS 20/20 initiatives. This is an enterprise-wide initiative to bring clarity and focus to our future business model. As a reminder, one of the tenets of TSYS 20/20 was to provide us with an assessment of the ideal operating structure to maximize efficiencies and the scale of our operations. As I mentioned earlier, this process is well underway in our Merchant segment primarily as a result of the TransFirst acquisition. Through organizational consolidation, job eliminations and other efficiency initiatives, we are ahead of schedule to achieve our $15 million synergy goal for Merchants in 2017. We are now in the process of taking this efficiency initiative to the rest of our company. As a result of this process, we do expect to have some onetime-related expenses in the third quarter primarily related to severance. We are convinced that these moves will ensure we are operating in our full potential and will allow us to improve and strengthen our already very successful business model. Paul will provide additional color on this in his remarks.
With that, I'll ask Paul to provide additional detail and financial information for the second quarter and outlook for the remainder of 2016. Paul?"
308973,370157974,1012945,"Total System Services, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Total System Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Troy. And I want to reemphasize how pleased we are with the second quarter performance of our company as we continue to execute against our strategic plans. As I mentioned on our last 2 calls regarding 2016 expected performance, we would be exe",2966,"Thank you, Troy. And I want to reemphasize how pleased we are with the second quarter performance of our company as we continue to execute against our strategic plans. As I mentioned on our last 2 calls regarding 2016 expected performance, we would be executing on improving margins in our company while being focused on the integration of TransFirst, and that is exactly what occurred during the second quarter. We couldn't be more pleased with the TransFirst acquisition as John Shlonsky and team have already started to reorganize and are successfully down the integration path to position the TSYS Merchant segment in a unique way. When we announced the transaction, our goal was to achieve double-digit percentage accretion with the transaction, which we achieved in the second quarter, and our synergy attainment goals are on track. So we see very positive momentum with TransFirst.
Now turning to Slide 6 and a review of the numbers. Total revenues were $1.15 billion, a 66.3% increase from the second quarter of last year. And net revenue was up 27.8% from 2Q '15 to $794.9 million. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 32.7% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 27.9%, both in line with our net revenue increase. On a GAAP basis, basic EPS was down $0.07 to $0.38 as a result of the effect of the TransFirst acquisition.
On a year-to-date basis, total revenues were $1.89 billion, a 39.6% increase. And net revenue was $1.47 billion, representing a 20.4% growth over 2015. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $504.9  million is 26.2% higher than through this time last year, and year-to-date adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.40 is a 25.5% increase. On a GAAP basis, basic EPS was flat at $0.87 from prior year, once again, reflecting the effect of the TransFirst acquisition.
I mentioned on our last 2 calls about our goal to increase our adjusted EBITDA margin by 100 basis points this year, and we achieved this goal in the quarter with an approximate 130 basis point increase for the quarter and 160 basis point expansion through 6 months. It is still our goal to achieve this 100 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the year, building upon the strong adjusted EBITDA margin expansion we had last year.
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that our diversification strategy around the contribution of revenue continues with the TransFirst acquisition included in our results for the first time, and our Merchant segment now represents 1/3 of our net revenue, up from approximately 19% from this time last year. We believe this diversified revenue mix provides for strength and is a unique dynamic in the TSYS investment story as we continue to diversify our revenue mix to be more heavily weighted to the higher-growth areas of payments.
Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 28.6%, an increase of over 200 basis points versus Q2 of 2015, and our 28.2% year-to-date margin is also an increase of roughly 200 basis points. Importantly, 3 of our 4 segments saw their adjusted segment operating margins expand for the quarter from the second quarter of last year and it speaks to the strength of the cross-segment delivery of performance that I've mentioned as our goal on our last 2 calls. Clearly, we're pleased with our consolidated results, but we are equally pleased with the impressive segment results that are behind the consolidated numbers.
Now let's dig into the segment results for North America, starting on Slide 8. As I mentioned on our last call, we expect the North America segment full year revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range in 2016, and that is still our expectation. Revenue for the quarter was up 3.5%, and we saw cross-sell growth in our Value-Added, Managed Services and Loyalty Services up a combined 13.1% over the same quarter last year. The sequential quarter decline in net revenue growth from the 14.1% last quarter is largely due to the anniversary of a large client conversion in mid-Q1 2015, along with our Output Services area returning to more normalized levels as we begin to anniversary some of the elevated growth we've seen in recent quarters related to EMV, other projects and some onetime items.
As for this segment's operating income, it grew 4% over last year, resulting in a segment operating margin of 37.9%, up 20 basis points. From a volume perspective, you can see from this slide that our traditional accounts on file continues to show steady growth and has reached yet another new record of $435.1 million. I'll remind you that this excludes prepaid, government services and single-use accounts.
We continue to redeploy and refocus resources in our issuer product group, our client experience initiatives and across our IT landscape to provide a more proactive and focused delivery model as well as focus on cross-selling existing products into the market-leading distribution channel that we spent years cultivating. Overall, we continue to expect this business to grow in the mid-single-digit range for the year with slightly expanding margins. 
Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on Slide 9, where we continued to experience revenue growth, and more importantly, operating income and margin growth. Net revenue of $81.8 million was down 2.5% on a reported basis but up 4.2% on a constant currency basis. The constant currency revenue growth of 4.2% is consistent with the low single-digit constant currency revenue growth we expect for this segment this year. We continue to see solid growth from our existing client base in Europe, which was partially offset by previously expected lost client revenue.
The segment's margin continues to grow in line with our margin improvement plan, delivering over 330 basis points in margin improvement over Q2 of '15 at 19.3%. We still expect this segment to slightly expand its margin this year net of any currency effects. From a volume perspective, traditional accounts on file grew $2.9 million to a record level of $66 million, up 4.7% from prior year. And the segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth of 7.3%.
As I mentioned in our Q1 call, our CUP Data joint venture continues to meet expectations for both of our organizations, and we expect continued growth from this business despite the slowdown of the Chinese economy's growth rate. Overall, we're pleased with our International segment's performance for the quarter as the business continues to deliver against its strategic plans.
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10. First, as I mentioned earlier, we're pleased that the integration and synergy plans for TransFirst are on track. With the acquisition of TransFirst, net revenue for this segment was $261.5 million, up 121.8%. And as I mentioned earlier, our Merchant segment now represents roughly 1/3 of the net revenue of the company. Both TransFirst and our legacy Merchant business are meeting our profit expectations, but given the success of the integration and the movements between our businesses to competitively align our offerings, we already view this business as one entity as opposed to 2 separate businesses.
As we discussed last quarter, our direct business is now more than 80% of segment net revenue, achieving our long-term strategic goal of having over 75% of our net revenue derived from direct Merchant acquiring. Our focus on the SMB space and ongoing traction in integrated payments continues to drive double-digit SBS volume growth. Combined, our integrated payments channels are now approximately 30% of our total direct business' net revenue.
While we still view our indirect business as a low or flat growth business, we did see positive net revenue growth of 5.7% year-over-year, driven by POS transaction growth of 6.4% year-over-year. We do expect this to return to more of a flat growth picture for the remaining part of the year. However, similar to the comments I made last quarter within our indirect business, we continue to retain our core customers, renewing 4 full service agreements, including 1 of our top 5 customers.
I've mentioned on several occasions that the margin picture of the Merchant segment would likely remain unchanged with the integration of TransFirst. And that was the case in this quarter with margins at a strong 34.4%, in line with the 2Q margin of '15. As I mentioned, John and his team are quickly integrating the 2 businesses, and as the integration seasons, we will likely be providing new metrics that will best measure and drive performance on a go-forward basis. We are not likely to continue to report on a direct and indirect basis given the smaller impact of indirect and the way we are now managing the combined businesses, but wanted to continue to provide this breakout this quarter to complete the picture that we had outlined at the time of the acquisition around revenue contribution mix. In all, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of both the underlying Merchant businesses, the integration that is occurring, the revenue contribution mix we now have, specifically in integrated payments, and the opportunities that we see ahead for this segment.
Now I want to talk about the strong performance of the NetSpend segment, starting on Slide 11. Revenue for NetSpend topped $162.6 million, representing 14.8% year-over-year organic revenue growth for the quarter. Revenue growth is strong both in total and by acquisition channel with 3 of our 4 distribution channels delivering double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. This shows the result of a diversified distribution model where we continue to win new business as well as expand and extend our existing relationships.
The second quarter had more than $6.6 billion of gross dollar volume or spend, up 19.6% over prior year. We exited the quarter with 4.4 million active cards, almost 2.2 million of which were on direct deposit, which represents a 16.6% year-over-year increase. While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we are also consistently focused on expanding our distribution network by adding approximately 1,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 101,000. This count does not include new distribution locations that we could add with the expanded Blackhawk relationship that Troy discussed earlier.
Second quarter margins expanded slightly from the prior year's 26.1%, and we are preparing for some larger card and marketing cost in the second half of the year associated with merchandising additional facings at Blackhawk distribution locations. We're pleased with NetSpend's position coming out of Q2. Our expectation for this business continues to be for revenue growth in the low double digits on a full year basis with slightly expanding margins for 2016 versus 2015.
Leaving NetSpend and moving to the consolidated level again. You can see on Slide 12 how each of our segments' margins contributed to our overall adjusted operating margin of 28.6%, up over 200 basis points from last year's 2Q level. The story is similar on a year-to-date basis with a 28.2% adjusted operating margin, as seen on Slide 13. Also, I want to state that these slides provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes the amortization of acquisition intangibles, M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. This slide also provides reconciliation to GAAP operating income of $287.5 million.
As it relates to our cash position, we ended the quarter at $465 million in cash, up $20 million from the end of the first quarter, which excluded the proceeds from the $1.49 billion we borrowed that was used for the TransFirst acquisition. We have $37 million of CapEx for the quarter, of which about 29% was related to property and equipment, 27% was related to contract acquisition cost, with the remaining 44% related to internally developed and licensed software.
When we announced the TransFirst acquisition, I highlighted our deleveraging plan of approximately $800 million of deleveraging in the first 24 months post acquisition. We deployed $125 million during the quarter for accelerated repayments on our bank credit facility as part of our deleveraging plan, and we remain committed to this plan and our investment-grade rating. Our average basic weighted shares outstanding for the quarter were 183.7  million and 183.5 million on a year-to-date basis.
Now a minute on cash flow. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $157.6 million, and our year-to-date free cash flow of $259 million is a 37.3% increase from the year-to-date levels of last year. And based on this performance, we continue to believe that our annual free cash flow estimate of $510 million to $540 million for 2016 is still valid. Although I want to remind you that as demonstrated in our history, cash will not flow in a linear manner on a quarterly basis.
On taxes, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.1%, which is higher than our normal levels due to some acquisition-related effects that are onetime in nature, and we expect the last half of the year to return to the 34% range. But on a reported basis, this second quarter increase will move our expected full year rate from the 34% range closer to 35%.
And finally, on guidance. While our guidance remains unchanged at this time, I do want to mention that the surprise Brexit vote and its impact on the pound and euro to the dollar could negatively impact our International results in the back half of the year. If the 2 currencies remain at current levels, we could see an approximate 100 basis point decline or greater in our estimated revenue growth for the full year and adjusted EPS pressure in the $0.02 range. It's too early to tell at this point, but I wanted to share that commentary with you, and we'll update you further in 3Q on this effect.
And finally, I want to summarize with 3 primary callouts that I think are the key takeaways from today. The first callout is on margins. I mentioned on our January call that our focus for 2016 was going to be on margins following the strong year of organic revenue growth and margin expansion in 2015. Our goal going into the year was to expand our adjusted EBITDA margin by roughly 100 basis points, and we wanted this margin expansion to be delivered in a cross-segment way. Through the first 6 months, we've delivered against this goal with adjusted EBITDA margins increasing 130 basis points on a quarterly basis and 160 basis points on a year-to-date basis. With some investments made in the back half of the year, we still expect to expand this important metric by 100 basis points for the year, roughly in line with what we achieved last year. Also, we will be making margin improvement moves over the coming quarters to expand this story for the longer term. Continuing on what Troy mentioned about our TSYS 20/20 efficiency and margin improvement initiatives, we expect to have approximately $5 million to $7 million of onetime-related expenses in the third quarter primarily related to severance that will be partially offset by salary and benefit savings in the fourth quarter.
The second callout is related to the upcoming comparison in our third quarter. If you will recall, in 2015, during the third quarter, we experienced a onetime-related EPS tax benefit of $0.13, which we detailed in our Q3 2015 earnings call and schedules. This $0.13 included a $15 million operating income benefit and a net $8.5 million benefit on the tax line, which had to be adjusted out of the 2015 results for a proper comparison to 3Q 2016 results, and extra care on this should be applied to arrive at a better approximation of expected performance in Q3 of 2016. I want to continue to stress this point, as I did on our last call and at our latest Analyst Day, to allow for the proper handling of the compassion results of Q3 2016 versus Q3 of 2015.
So there are 3 moving parts expected in the third quarter. First, you should consider the tax effects from the prior year needing adjustment. Second are the expected non-TransFirst onetime expenses of $5 million to $7 million primarily related to severance which would reduce 3Q adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02. And third, the potential currency impacts in the back half of the year that I mentioned earlier, which could reduce our net revenue yearly growth rate by approximately 100 basis points with a potential $0.02 of negative EPS impact.
The third and final callout is the continued execution against our strategic plan of creating a diversified payments company and platform. With the completion of TransFirst, we have largely completed our multiyear strategic goal of diversifying the revenue contribution to a more strategic balance of higher-growth revenue streams and payments. We believe the balance we now have of 37% of net revenue from North American issuer processing, 33% from Merchant acquiring with the acquisition of TransFirst, 20% from NetSpend and the remaining 10% for our International opportunities not including our China UnionPay JV provides TSYS the strength and diversification that is unique in payments. When you couple this revenue diversification with our recent margin improvement plan that will continue into 2017 and beyond, you can see that the changing face of TSYS provides for a stronger and better positioned company in the future.
None of this execution would be possible without the extreme dedication of our team members, and we specifically thank our new team members from TransFirst who joined us during the quarter and made strong contributions to the success of this quarter. We thank our entire team for delivering another successful quarter of outstanding results.
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

And I would just kind of reinforce that the strategic nature of getting this partnership, if you think back to kind of the late '14 time frame where we had several strategic partnerships that we announced in that time frame, we didn't have those in '15 and that's actually kind of providing some of the rollover challenge in the second half of the year for NetSpend.

As it relates to the sequential quarter revenue growth rate, you're exactly right, and that's exactly what happened. And as I said, we still expect the North America business to be at that mid-single-digit revenue growth that we expected at the beginning of the year. We do have a comp issue with a large conversion from that sequential quarter comparison. But we are -- from a kind of a year-over-year basis, the single biggest kind of grow over challenge is in Output Services where we had a higher elevated of revenue from Output Services last year related to EMV. And you'll recall, last year throughout the year, I was saying that those services were coming in at higher-than-expected ranges. So we kind of got an elevated level there that we're then dealing with this year, and over time, that will all kind of mute itself out. As it relates to Green Dot specifically, there is some decline there that plays out on a kind of year-over-year basis. But outside of that, I wouldn't characterize anything else that's dramatically playing out there. As it relates to the account on file and the North America revenue piece, yes, I mean, as we have gotten to be -- kind of have a more bundled piece with this new base that we're at, the connection points between the accounts on file and revenue growth is looser. And specifically when you have Value-Added Services and you have a bigger portion coming from kind of the non-account-on-file-based fees, then you get into that kind of disconnect. So I would characterize it that way."

And we did call out, and Bryan, we captured 3 different sides of our business here, Value-Added being 1, Managed Services being 2 and Loyalty being 3 in that 13%, which is one of the ways that we look at the growth. And it is not actually an accelerating. In fact, it's actually a little bit of a decelerating picture on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and we'll continue to actually decel in the remaining third and fourth quarters as well as some of the componentry in that year-over-year, the growth rates aren't as robust off of this new elevated base as they were last year. And so the improvement from year-over-year is still very strong. It's still obviously much stronger than our overall growth rate of our business, which you would expect. Our cross-sell initiatives around those are as robust as ever, but it is not fair to say it's an accelerating picture. It'd be more fair to say it's a decelerating picture when you look at sequential quarters, and that will continue in the third and fourth quarter. Once again, that all comes together in a mid-single-digit revenue growth expectation for the segment for the year."

And so in the componentry there, that's just not something that, from a competitive standpoint, we break out. I would say this about Output Services. We do that business primarily as a service to our customers. And while it is -- it's causing some comparison challenges on a year-over-year basis, that is a lower margin business than our overall segment. Now as Bill Pruett mentioned on our Analyst Day, that is a business that potentially has some upside to it to the degree that we are more successful in cross-selling into our installed base. And so from a future growth potential standpoint, there is some there. But without that piece and with that higher EMV elevation that has occurred throughout last year that we're dealing with now in the second, it will increase in the third. And in the fourth quarter, we are having that rollover piece. As it relates to your second question, it is mid-single-digit revenue growth expectation both for this year. And as I look out on a longer-term basis, right now, everything I see still points us to mid-single digit. I think 2 years ago at our Analyst Day, we kind of said mid to high, but that was before we had the benefit of the seasoning of this large conversion that came into the base. I think I did say at the same -- at that time we were closer to mid than high, but I wanted to see the large conversion come into the base and relook at the portfolio with that in there. And now that we've done that, we're at that mid-single-digit rate right now."

It's not just an act. I think we'll just have to, as I said earlier, continue to monitor it and watch it. Some of our customers' stock took quite a beating there over the coming -- over the few weeks after the Brexit vote, down anywhere from 10% to 50%.

As it relates to what we're dealing with on kind of the current year or even as you look into the more nearer term is this kind of mid-single-digit revenue growth that we're still expecting for this year. And specifically as it relates to this Output Services, that's really more of a 2016 impact that we're seeing from a 2015 kind of inflated base due to EMV primarily, although there are some other moving pieces in there, which we're always going to have onetime items and moving pieces in this business.

Good evening, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This has been another excellent quarter for TSYS.

Good evening, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This has been another excellent quarter for TSYS. Our team members across our global footprint delivered an outstanding performance for the quarter and for the first half of the year. As a reminder, this quarter's results include a full quarter of TransFirst. I will address our integration activities with respect to TransFirst later. But by almost any measure, our first quarter together has been very successful, and we are pleased with our progress and the new team.
Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are: consolidated net revenue was up 27.8%; adjusted earnings per share increased 27.9%; and consolidated operating margin expanded 202 basis points. All 4 of our operating segments contributed to these exceptional metrics for the quarter. I want to congratulate and thank all of our team members for their dedication, commitment and focus as we continue to deliver on our strategic plan.
One final highlight before we move into the specific results for our segments. While we measure our success with our financials, we also take great pride in our community involvement and servant leadership. In June, we were recognized as one of America's most community-minded companies by Civic 50, an initiative that identifies companies for their commitment to improving the quality of life in the communities where they do business. This is the third consecutive time we have been honored with this award, and it is a compliment to our dedicated team members who give back to the communities where they work and live.
I now would like to address the highlights for each of our segments, beginning with North America. Our strong financial performance in North America is partially a result of a positive U.S. economy, which posted job gains and overall strength in consumer spending during the quarter. April produced the largest increase in consumer spending in 6 years, and May and June were also robust, pointing to a reasonably healthy American consumer.
We still expect a significant portion of our growth in our North America segment to come from the cross-sale of products and services. We continue to place significant focus on cross-selling existing products and services to current clients as well as a longer-term view of delivering and cross-selling new products and services. These new products and services will be delivered through the transformation of technologies and innovation currently underway at TSYS. To this point, during the quarter, we saw a 13.1% increase over the same quarter last year from the sale of services across our Value-Added, Loyalty and Managed Services groups in this segment.
On the business development front, we signed a new long-term agreement with the Bank of Montreal to process their Mastercard-branded debit accounts, and we also renewed 3 issuing contracts. We have previously indicated that Green Dot would be de-converted from TSYS during the second half of 2016. Green Dot has executed on 3 of their planned 4 de-conversions from TSYS. However, the final wave of accounts is not expected to be de-converted from TSYS this year.
Now let's turn to the International segment. Of course, the headline-grabbing news from our International segment was the Brexit vote in the U.K. The early reaction certainly negatively impacted both the currency and the equity markets. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union has created an overall air of uncertainty in political, social and economic circles across the globe. Following this vote, we spoke with many executives across our European client base, and their current position is business as usual with TSYS. One of our clients published a report which indicated that U.K. consumer spending remained resilient both before and after the Brexit EU referendum. There are many different views on Brexit's longer-term impact and the potential implications that it may or may not cause. We will continue to monitor these developments closely, and we'll take appropriate actions when and if deemed necessary.
Also during the quarter, our International Managed Services business became Financial Conduct Authority or FCA authorized. This puts TSYS in a unique position against our competitors and enables us to extend our current service offering to include broad customer care support and engagement across Europe.
As I mentioned last quarter, our Brazilian business continues to make significant financial and operational progress. Although the Brazilian market remains challenging due to political and economic uncertainty and the run-up to the Rio Olympic Games, we are optimistic over the interest in our market-leading payments platform from across the broader Latin and South America regions.
In China, the economy has slowed to  mid to mid-high single-digit growth. However, the underlying electronic payment transaction growth and overall upward trend in consumer spending in this $8.3 trillion card payment market continues to fuel our CUP Data joint venture above expectations.
In our PRIME business, we continued to see progress in the licensing and processing business lines with many new prospects in each area. Our focus will continue to be on leveraging our recently transformed international upgrading platforms to deliver cost-effective solutions on both TS2 and PRIME around the globe.
For our combined issuing segments, we added over 13 million traditional accounts during the quarter, which is further proof of the health of our issuing business. Our focus will continue to be on client retention, cross-selling products and services as well as new targeted prospects around the globe.
Now let's address our Merchant business. As I indicated earlier, TransFirst is included in our second quarter numbers. We have just completed our first quarter of the TransFirst acquisition, and we are pleased to report that the integration work and synergy goals were both on track. As we've indicated from the beginning regarding this acquisition, our goal is to optimize the capabilities, products and services across our combined entities that will enable our customers to rely on one single provider for all of their processing needs. We believe this is a key market differentiator.
Although there is significant integration work that still must take place, we will remain relentlessly focused on growing the business. Today, over 80% of our Merchant net revenue is derived from our direct channels. We believe the scale and diverse distribution network that we have created in our Merchants business is one of the keys to our success. Our combined Merchant businesses now gives us leadership positions in all 3 of our lines of business.
And finally, I would like to address NetSpend. Our NetSpend segment had another great quarter as well. Quarterly revenues were up almost 15%. Margins improved slightly year-over-year and 330 basis points sequentially. And we surpassed 101,000 distributing locations and employers for the quarter.
On the business development front, I am happy to announce that our long-standing distribution partner and industry leader, Blackhawk Network, has entered a 10-year strategic partnership that builds upon more than a decade of work we've done together. This new partnership will provide significant expansion of facings for NetSpend in Blackhawk's impressive U.S. retail network and potentially provide additional distribution locations in grocery stores and other retailers.
Another great win for our retail presence this quarter was a 3-year extension of the NetSpend partnership with CVS.
Our PayCard channel was also very active during the quarter. We signed new 3-year agreements with the Gap and with JCPenney to be their exclusive PayCard provider. These new and growing partnerships saw the manifestation of NetSpend's goal to meet consumers where they work and shop to provide them with a great solution, fulfilling their financial needs.
As to the CFPB, we now expect the final rules to be published sometime in September. When the final rules are published and after we have had an adequate review period, we will share with you what it means to our business and what our mitigation strategies are. All in all, it was a great quarter with all 4 segments growing revenue, expanding our consolidated margin, executing on the TransFirst acquisition and winning new business.
At our Investor Day conference in May, I discussed the launching of our TSYS 20/20 initiatives. This is an enterprise-wide initiative to bring clarity and focus to our future business model. As a reminder, one of the tenets of TSYS 20/20 was to provide us with an assessment of the ideal operating structure to maximize efficiencies and the scale of our operations. As I mentioned earlier, this process is well underway in our Merchant segment primarily as a result of the TransFirst acquisition. Through organizational consolidation, job eliminations and other efficiency initiatives, we are ahead of schedule to achieve our $15 million synergy goal for Merchants in 2017. We are now in the process of taking this efficiency initiative to the rest of our company. As a result of this process, we do expect to have some onetime-related expenses in the third quarter primarily related to severance. We are convinced that these moves will ensure we are operating in our full potential and will allow us to improve and strengthen our already very successful business model. Paul will provide additional color on this in his remarks.
With that, I'll ask Paul to provide additional detail and financial information for the second quarter and outlook for the remainder of 2016. Paul?"

And I want to reemphasize how pleased we are with the second quarter performance of our company as we continue to execute against our strategic plans. As I mentioned on our last 2 calls regarding 2016 expected performance, we would be exe",2966,"Thank you, Troy. And I want to reemphasize how pleased we are with the second quarter performance of our company as we continue to execute against our strategic plans. As I mentioned on our last 2 calls regarding 2016 expected performance, we would be executing on improving margins in our company while being focused on the integration of TransFirst, and that is exactly what occurred during the second quarter. We couldn't be more pleased with the TransFirst acquisition as John Shlonsky and team have already started to reorganize and are successfully down the integration path to position the TSYS Merchant segment in a unique way. When we announced the transaction, our goal was to achieve double-digit percentage accretion with the transaction, which we achieved in the second quarter, and our synergy attainment goals are on track. So we see very positive momentum with TransFirst.
Now turning to Slide 6 and a review of the numbers. Total revenues were $1.15 billion, a 66.3% increase from the second quarter of last year. And net revenue was up 27.8% from 2Q '15 to $794.9 million. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 32.7% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 27.9%, both in line with our net revenue increase. On a GAAP basis, basic EPS was down $0.07 to $0.38 as a result of the effect of the TransFirst acquisition.
On a year-to-date basis, total revenues were $1.89 billion, a 39.6% increase. And net revenue was $1.47 billion, representing a 20.4% growth over 2015. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $504.9  million is 26.2% higher than through this time last year, and year-to-date adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.40 is a 25.5% increase. On a GAAP basis, basic EPS was flat at $0.87 from prior year, once again, reflecting the effect of the TransFirst acquisition.
I mentioned on our last 2 calls about our goal to increase our adjusted EBITDA margin by 100 basis points this year, and we achieved this goal in the quarter with an approximate 130 basis point increase for the quarter and 160 basis point expansion through 6 months. It is still our goal to achieve this 100 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the year, building upon the strong adjusted EBITDA margin expansion we had last year.
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that our diversification strategy around the contribution of revenue continues with the TransFirst acquisition included in our results for the first time, and our Merchant segment now represents 1/3 of our net revenue, up from approximately 19% from this time last year. We believe this diversified revenue mix provides for strength and is a unique dynamic in the TSYS investment story as we continue to diversify our revenue mix to be more heavily weighted to the higher-growth  areas of payments.
Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 28.6%, an increase of over 200 basis points versus Q2 of 2015, and our 28.2% year-to-date margin is also an increase of roughly 200 basis points. Importantly, 3 of our 4 segments saw their adjusted segment operating margins expand for the quarter from the second quarter of last year and it speaks to the strength of the cross-segment delivery of performance that I've mentioned as our goal on our last 2 calls. Clearly, we're pleased with our consolidated results, but we are equally pleased with the impressive segment results that are behind the consolidated numbers.
Now let's dig into the segment results for North America, starting on Slide 8. As I mentioned on our last call, we expect the North America segment full year revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range in 2016, and that is still our expectation. Revenue for the quarter was up 3.5%, and we saw cross-sell growth in our Value-Added, Managed Services and Loyalty Services up a combined 13.1% over the same quarter last year. The sequential quarter decline in net revenue growth from the 14.1% last quarter is largely due to the anniversary of a large client conversion in mid-Q1 2015, along with our Output Services area returning to more normalized levels as we begin to anniversary some of the elevated growth we've seen in recent quarters related to EMV, other projects and some onetime items.
As for this segment's operating income, it grew 4% over last year, resulting in a segment operating margin of 37.9%, up 20 basis points. From a volume perspective, you can see from this slide that our traditional accounts on file continues to show steady growth and has reached yet another new record of $435.1 million. I'll remind you that this excludes prepaid, government services and single-use accounts.
We continue to redeploy and refocus resources in our issuer product group, our client experience initiatives and across our IT landscape to provide a more proactive and focused delivery model as well as focus on cross-selling existing products into the market-leading distribution channel that we spent years cultivating. Overall, we continue to expect this business to grow in the mid-single-digit range for the year with slightly expanding margins. 
Now I want to move to the International segment highlights on Slide 9, where we continued to experience revenue growth, and more importantly, operating income and margin growth. Net revenue of $81.8 million was down 2.5% on a reported basis but up 4.2% on a constant currency basis. The constant currency revenue growth of 4.2% is consistent with the low single-digit constant currency revenue growth we expect for this segment this year. We continue to see solid growth from our existing client base in Europe, which was partially offset by previously expected lost client revenue.
The segment's margin continues to grow in line with our margin improvement plan, delivering over 330 basis points in margin improvement over Q2 of '15 at 19.3%. We still expect this segment to slightly expand its margin this year net of any currency effects. From a volume perspective, traditional accounts on file grew $2.9 million to a record level of $66 million, up 4.7% from prior year. And the segment experienced high single-digit transaction growth of 7.3%.
As I mentioned in our Q1 call, our CUP Data joint venture continues to meet expectations for both of our organizations, and we expect continued growth from this business despite the slowdown of the Chinese economy's growth rate. Overall, we're pleased with our International segment's performance for the quarter as the business continues to deliver against its strategic plans.
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10. First, as I mentioned earlier, we're pleased that the integration and synergy plans for TransFirst are on track. With the acquisition of TransFirst, net revenue for this segment was $261.5 million, up 121.8%. And as I mentioned earlier, our Merchant segment now represents roughly 1/3 of the net revenue of the company. Both TransFirst and our legacy Merchant business are meeting our profit expectations, but given the success of the integration and the movements between our businesses to competitively align our offerings, we already view this business as one entity as opposed to 2 separate businesses.
As we discussed last quarter, our direct business is now more than 80% of segment net revenue, achieving our long-term strategic goal of having over 75% of our net revenue derived from direct Merchant acquiring. Our focus on the SMB space and ongoing traction in integrated payments continues to drive double-digit SBS volume growth. Combined, our integrated payments channels are now approximately 30% of our total direct business' net revenue.
While we still view our indirect business as a low or flat growth business, we did see positive net revenue growth of 5.7% year-over-year, driven by POS transaction growth of 6.4% year-over-year. We do expect this to return to more of a flat growth picture for the remaining part of the year. However, similar to the comments I made last quarter within our indirect business, we continue to retain our core customers, renewing 4 full service agreements, including 1 of our top 5 customers.
I've mentioned on several occasions that the margin picture of the Merchant segment would likely remain unchanged with the integration of TransFirst. And that was the case in this quarter with margins at a strong 34.4%, in line with the 2Q margin of '15. As I mentioned, John and his team are quickly integrating the 2 businesses, and as the integration seasons, we will likely be providing new metrics that will best measure and drive performance on a go-forward basis. We are not likely to continue to report on a direct and indirect basis given the smaller impact of indirect and the way we are now managing the combined businesses, but wanted to continue to provide this breakout this quarter to complete the picture that we had outlined at the time of the acquisition around revenue contribution mix. In all, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of both the underlying Merchant businesses, the integration that is occurring, the revenue contribution mix we now have, specifically in integrated payments, and the opportunities that we see ahead for this segment.
Now I want to talk about the strong performance of the NetSpend segment, starting on Slide 11. Revenue for NetSpend topped $162.6 million, representing 14.8% year-over-year organic revenue growth for the quarter. Revenue growth is strong both in total and by acquisition channel with 3 of our 4 distribution channels delivering double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. This shows the result of a diversified distribution model where we continue to win new business as well as expand and extend our existing relationships.
The second quarter had more than $6.6 billion of gross dollar volume or spend, up 19.6% over prior year. We exited the quarter with 4.4 million active cards, almost 2.2 million of which were on direct deposit, which represents a 16.6% year-over-year increase. While our card and volume levels continue to increase, we are also consistently focused on expanding our distribution network by adding approximately 1,000 distributing employers and locations in the quarter, bringing the current total to more than 101,000. This count does not include new distribution locations that we could add with the expanded Blackhawk relationship that Troy discussed earlier.
Second quarter margins expanded slightly from the prior year's  26.1%, and we are preparing for some larger card and marketing cost in the second half of the year associated with merchandising additional facings at Blackhawk distribution locations. We're pleased with NetSpend's position coming out of Q2. Our expectation for this business continues to be for revenue growth in the low double digits on a full year basis with slightly expanding margins for 2016 versus 2015.
Leaving NetSpend and moving to the consolidated level again. You can see on Slide 12 how each of our segments' margins contributed to our overall adjusted operating margin of 28.6%, up over 200 basis points from last year's 2Q level. The story is similar on a year-to-date basis with a 28.2% adjusted operating margin, as seen on Slide 13. Also, I want to state that these slides provide a bridge between the adjusted segment operating income for each of our segments and our consolidated adjusted operating income. We provide this because our segments report their results on an adjusted segment operating income basis, which excludes the amortization of acquisition intangibles, M&A expenses, corporate admin and stock-based compensation. This slide also provides reconciliation to GAAP operating income of $287.5 million.
As it relates to our cash position, we ended the quarter at $465 million in cash, up $20 million from the end of the first quarter, which excluded the proceeds from the $1.49 billion we borrowed that was used for the TransFirst acquisition. We have $37 million of CapEx for the quarter, of which about 29% was related to property and equipment, 27% was related to contract acquisition cost, with the remaining 44% related to internally developed and licensed software.
When we announced the TransFirst acquisition, I highlighted our deleveraging plan of approximately $800 million of deleveraging in the first 24 months post acquisition. We deployed $125 million during the quarter for accelerated repayments on our bank credit facility as part of our deleveraging plan, and we remain committed to this plan and our investment-grade rating. Our average basic weighted shares outstanding for the quarter were 183.7  million and 183.5 million on a year-to-date basis.
Now a minute on cash flow. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $157.6 million, and our year-to-date free cash flow of $259 million is a 37.3% increase from the year-to-date levels of last year. And based on this performance, we continue to believe that our annual free cash flow estimate of $510 million to $540 million for 2016 is still valid. Although I want to remind you that as demonstrated in our history, cash will not flow in a linear manner on a quarterly basis.
On taxes, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.1%, which is higher than our normal levels due to some acquisition-related effects that are onetime in nature, and we expect the last half of the year to return to the 34% range. But on a reported basis, this second quarter increase will move our expected full year rate from the 34% range closer to 35%.
And finally, on guidance. While our guidance remains unchanged at this time, I do want to mention that the surprise Brexit vote and its impact on the pound and euro to the dollar could negatively impact our International results in the back half of the year. If the 2 currencies remain at current levels, we could see an approximate 100 basis point decline or greater in our estimated revenue growth for the full year and adjusted EPS pressure in the $0.02 range. It's too early to tell at this point, but I wanted to share that commentary with you, and we'll update you further in 3Q on this effect.
And finally, I want to summarize with 3 primary callouts that I think are the key takeaways from today. The first callout is on margins. I mentioned on our January call that our focus for 2016 was going to be on margins following the strong year of organic revenue growth and margin expansion in 2015. Our goal going into the year was to expand our adjusted EBITDA margin by roughly 100 basis points, and we wanted this margin expansion to be delivered in a cross-segment way. Through the first 6 months, we've delivered against this goal with adjusted EBITDA margins increasing 130 basis points on a quarterly basis and 160 basis points on a year-to-date basis. With some investments made in the back half of the year, we still expect to expand this important metric by 100 basis points for the year, roughly in line with what we achieved last year. Also, we will be making margin improvement moves over the coming quarters to expand this story for the longer term. Continuing on what Troy mentioned about our TSYS 20/20 efficiency and margin improvement initiatives, we expect to have approximately $5 million to $7 million of onetime-related expenses in the third quarter primarily related to severance that will be partially offset by salary and benefit savings in the fourth quarter.
The second callout is related to the upcoming comparison in our third quarter. If you will recall, in 2015, during the third quarter, we experienced a onetime-related EPS tax benefit of $0.13, which we detailed in our Q3 2015 earnings call and schedules. This $0.13 included a $15 million operating income benefit and a net $8.5 million benefit on the tax line, which had to be adjusted out of the 2015 results for a proper comparison to 3Q 2016 results, and extra care on this should be applied to arrive at a better approximation of expected performance in Q3 of 2016. I want to continue to stress this point, as I did on our last call and at our latest Analyst Day, to allow for the proper handling of the compassion results of Q3 2016 versus Q3 of 2015.
So there are 3 moving parts expected in the third quarter. First, you should consider the tax effects from the prior year needing adjustment. Second are the expected non-TransFirst onetime expenses of $5 million to $7 million primarily related to severance which would reduce 3Q adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02. And third, the potential currency impacts in the back half of the year that I mentioned earlier, which could reduce our net revenue yearly growth rate by approximately 100 basis points with a potential $0.02 of negative EPS impact.
The third and final callout is the continued execution against our strategic plan of creating a diversified payments company and platform. With the completion of TransFirst, we have largely completed our multiyear strategic goal of diversifying the revenue contribution to a more strategic balance of higher-growth  revenue streams and payments. We believe the balance we now have of 37% of net revenue from North American issuer processing, 33% from Merchant acquiring with the acquisition of TransFirst, 20% from NetSpend and the remaining 10% for our International opportunities not including our China UnionPay JV provides TSYS the strength and diversification that is unique in payments. When you couple this revenue diversification with our recent margin improvement plan that will continue into 2017 and beyond, you can see that the changing face of TSYS provides for a stronger and better positioned company in the future.
None of this execution would be possible without the extreme dedication of our team members, and we specifically thank our new team members from TransFirst who joined us during the quarter and made strong contributions to the success of this quarter. We thank our entire team for delivering another successful quarter of outstanding results.
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

And I would just kind of reinforce that the strategic nature of getting this partnership, if you think back to kind of the late '14 time frame where we had several strategic partnerships that we announced in that time frame, we didn't have those in '15 and that's actually kind of providing some of the rollover challenge in the second half of the year for NetSpend.

We do have a comp issue with a large conversion from that sequential quarter comparison. But we are -- from a kind of a year-over-year basis, the single biggest kind of  grow over challenge is in Output Services where we had a higher elevated of revenue from Output Services last year related to EMV. And you'll recall, last year throughout the year, I was saying that those services were coming in at higher-than-expected ranges. So we kind of got an elevated level there that we're then dealing with this year, and over time, that will all kind of mute itself out. As it relates to Green Dot specifically, there is some decline there that plays out on a kind of year-over-year basis. But outside of that, I wouldn't characterize anything else that's dramatically playing out there. As it relates to the account on file and the North America revenue piece, yes, I mean, as we have gotten to be -- kind of have a more bundled piece with this new base that we're at, the connection points between the accounts on file and revenue growth is looser. And specifically when you have Value-Added Services and you have a bigger portion coming from kind of the non-account-on-file-based fees, then you get into that kind of disconnect. So I would characterize it that way."

One is on the onetime -- expected  kind of onetime-related kind of severance expenses in the third quarter. We do see some partial offset in the fourth quarter that I mentioned in the prepared remarks from the salary, kind of benefit savings that we would see in the fourth quarter. So there's some partial offsetting there. And as we look at kind of the business and how it's performed and you kind of put it all together, it does kind of push us to a little bit of over-performance that we've had in the first half of the year that didn't get kind of netted against some of these pressure points in the second half of the year. So you're exactly right. The biggest thing I wanted to call out was those impacts happening in the third quarter and then some of those impacts kind of beginning to mute  out some in the fourth quarter."

And when you look at our International segment now, once again, net of currency impact, it is in a much tighter band now that we've gotten to this kind of 18-plus percent margin goal as you look on a sequential-quarter basis is our expectation where in the past, you've seen ramp-ups quarter-to-quarter on a sequential basis. That ramping up effect is more normalizing out, and we don't see any type of kind of significant onetime things on the International side to kind of provide this challenge on a go-forward basis.

And so that has created some -- when you look at second half to first half, the comparison challenges that exist there. I'd also point to the second half of NetSpend relative to the first half. And due to some of the investments that we make in the back half of the year, that pre -- that are pretax season in nature, that also kind of plays things out. Although we do expect the second half of the year NetSpend margin on a year-over-year basis to be favorable, when you look at the first half to the second half, that's playing in there as well. So those would be the 2 from a segment standpoint. There's other kinds of things that play out.

We do that business primarily as a service to our customers. And while it is -- it's causing some comparison challenges on a year-over-year basis, that is a lower margin business than our overall segment. Now as Bill Pruett mentioned on our Analyst Day, that is a business that potentially has some upside to it to the degree that we are more successful in cross-selling into our installed base. And so from a future growth potential standpoint, there is some there. But without that piece and with that higher EMV elevation that has occurred throughout last year that we're dealing with now in the second, it will increase in the third. And in the fourth quarter, we are having that rollover piece. As it relates to your second question, it is mid-single-digit revenue growth expectation both for this year. And as I look out on a longer-term basis, right now, everything I see still points us to mid-single digit. I think 2 years ago at our Analyst Day, we kind of said mid to high, but that was before we had the benefit of the seasoning of this large conversion that came into the base. I think I did say at the same -- at that time we were closer to mid than high, but I wanted to see the large conversion come into the base and relook at the portfolio with that in there.

Those come with such a kind of a lower revenue concentration per account that it doesn't make that kind of a significant impact. We also have some purging activity on some of that single use that's also playing into that number. So nothing that I would call out from a significant standpoint."

We were very pleased with our financial performance, TransFirst integration activities, record free cash flow generation and our overall execution during the quarter.All 4 of our operatin",1072,"Thank you, Shawn, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We were very pleased with our financial performance, TransFirst integration activities, record free cash flow generation and our overall execution during the quarter.
All 4 of our operating segments exceeded our internal targets for the quarter, and I would like to thank all of our team members for their commitment, focus and dedication. It's because of this commitment, focus and dedication that we were ranked #9 on the 2016 Fintech Forum 100 list of leading technology providers in the world, and also recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of Fortune's fastest-growing companies of 2016.
I will focus my comments today on a few key initiatives across the enterprise, and Paul will provide the financial highlights for the segments and the enterprise during his presentation. 
Let's start with North America. During the quarter, we hired Karim Ahmad as our new Executive Vice President of Product and Innovation. As we have discussed on several occasions, accelerating our product capabilities will be crucial to our North America growth story. We are convinced that with Karim's knowledge, experience and leadership, we will get this done. 
During our second quarter earnings call, we may have created some confusion with respect to our 2016, 2018 North America net revenue guidance. I certainly apologize for that confusion, and I would like to take this opportunity to address it today.
Let's start with 2016 guidance. We have been consistent since providing North America segment revenue guidance in January that the segment would grow mid to single digits in 2016 but more toward the low end of this range.
It has also become apparent to me, subsequent to our earnings call and after a few conversations and visits with many of you, that the definition of low, mid and high means many different things to different people. To help clear this up going forward, we will no longer refer to our guidance in terms of low, mid or high ranges unless we have previously defined what these ranges are or we will simply provide numerical ranges with absolute numbers.
With just one quarter left in 2016, we expect our 2016 North America net revenue growth to be at or slightly above 5%.
Now let's address how we view 2017 and 2018. Based on what we know at this time, we believe the organic growth profile for our North America business will be in the 5% to 7% range for this period of time, and then sequential quarter growth improvement will begin in the first quarter 2017. Our North America business is our largest and most profitable segment and we believe the core fundamentals of this business are absolutely rock solid. Our technology, people and service capabilities, along with a world-class blue-chip customer base, gives us confidence we can continue to grow and expand this segment. 
I now would like to make a few comments about our Merchant business. We are now 6 months post the acquisition of TransFirst. We were very pleased that the integration activities and synergy goals remain solidly on track. Although there have been some leadership changes, we remain relentlessly focused on growing and expanding this business. Our team is very motivated and engaged, and we continue to expect good results from this segment going forward.
Now I would like to address NetSpend. Of course, the big news here this quarter is the publication of the CFPB's final rules on October 5 governing the prepaid industry, all 1,689 pages. As you know, there was a lot of public commentary on the proposed rules on prepaid. Some of the technical matters were addressed. However, we were disappointed with some of the positions the CFPB adopted in the final rules. We do welcome the certainty that these new rules bring to the prepaid industry and the CFPB's recognition of prepaid cards as safe and practical financial tools that serve a rapidly expanding consumer base. 
These new rules will require us to devote a significant amount of time and resources toward revising our printed, digital and telephonic disclosures and other compliance-related activities. As you might expect, it is taking a considerable amount of time to thoroughly review and analyze nearly 1,700 pages of regulation and commentary. 
Based on the current, but not yet complete analysis of these rules, we anticipate a loss of revenue between $80 million to $85 million based on expected 2016 revenues. This will be as a result of the elimination of certain fees and the decision to no longer offer optional overdraft protection on our current prepaid card programs.
As NetSpend prepares for the next evolution of its business, we will focus on product innovations that help us reach new customer segments, deepen our relationship with existing customer and attract new partners. This will include the launch of several new products to include a new demand deposit account product and a small business prepaid product.
Our new demand deposit account product will include features such as check-writing ability, enhanced savings features and optional overdraft protection. 
Paul will provide additional details on our revenue and EPS timing expectations in his presentation.
We continue to steadfastly believe that significant opportunities remain to grow our prepaid business. It is projected that over $112 billion will be loaded onto prepaid cards in 2018 alone, double the amount loaded in 2012. This is the growth profile that led us to acquire NetSpend in 2013 and we plan to continue to be a leader in this space.
And finally, I would like to make a comment regarding our capital allocation plans. As I previously mentioned, we generated record free cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date. This strong cash generation has allowed us to accelerate some of our debt-reduction plans that Paul will also address. This accelerated debt reduction, strong free cash flow generation and our confidence in our momentum provides us the opportunity to reenter the market in the coming quarters with respect to share repurchase.
All in all, it was a very good quarter. All 4 segments grew revenue. Three of our 4 segments expanded margins, notwithstanding severance costs, 10 million new traditional accounts on file were added during the quarter, and we continue to execute on our overall business strategy. 
I now would like to turn the call over to Paul to provide detailed financial information for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Paul?"
308973,403401228,1060762,"Total System Services, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Total System Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Troy. And I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the quarter's performance and our year-to-date results. Before I get into the segment results, I want to highlight a few things. First, each of our segments beat our internal projections",1747,"Thank you, Troy. And I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the quarter's performance and our year-to-date results. Before I get into the segment results, I want to highlight a few things. 
First, each of our segments beat our internal projections for the quarter and each is in line with the expectations we laid out at the beginning of the year. 
Second, our TransFirst acquisition integration continues on track, with our expense takeout synergies from the combined businesses meeting our expectations. 
Third, the deleveraging of our balance sheet is ahead of plan, with $175 million of debt paydown during the quarter, bringing our 2-quarter total of deleveraging to $300 million. You may recall, we said we plan to reduce our leverage by $800 million over 8 quarters, so the $300 million through 2 quarters reflects our progress on this target. 
Fourth, as we discussed on our last call, through planned organizational efficiencies, we incurred severance expenses of approximately $9 million during the quarter, which was higher than our original estimate, but we were more aggressive in addressing the expense base that will position us stronger going forward.
And finally, as we discussed on our last call, we absorbed some significant currency headwinds during the quarter that reduced our revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.03. With these items as a backdrop, I will move into our financial results, moving to Slide 6 and our consolidated financial performance. 
Quarterly total revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 62% from 3Q 2015. Quarterly net revenue was $790 million, up 24.1% from last year. GAAP net income was $85.4 million, down 29.2% from last year; and GAAP basic earnings per share was $0.46, also a decrease of 29.2% from last year.
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $269.1 million, an increase of 12.7% from last year; and adjusted EPS was $0.71, a decrease of $0.07 from last year. You may recall, we had a $0.13 adjusted EPS pickup in 3Q 2015 related to taxes, and isolating that impact on a comparative basis yields an increase of a much higher adjusted EPS impact than reported.
Also, the additional $0.03 of severance we experienced in the quarter, coupled with the approximately $0.03 of currency impact, point to an approximate $0.19 of items in the comparative third quarter 2016 versus 2015 adjusted EPS growth picture. 
Our free cash flow for the quarter grew by 37.5% and 36.8% through 9 months, showing that the cash flow generating strength of TSYS continues in the legacy business and is complemented by the strong contribution from TransFirst. This is the second straight quarter of double-digit free cash flow growth, and we expect our free cash flow to be in the $550 million to $570 million range for the year, which is higher than the $510 million to $540 million range we had previously expected.
Now onto our segments' results, starting on Slide 8 with North America. North America business performed slightly better in 3Q than we had planned, increasing revenue by 2.4% on record traditional accounts on file of $444.6 million. Our expectation for revenue growth for this business for 2016 continues to be at or slightly above 5%. This is exactly where we thought the business would be when we entered the year, and the core fundamentals of the business remain intact. 
Our margin for the quarter was 37.7% but included approximately $6 million of severance expense to this segment. And without this expense, segment margin would have been 39.7%.
Now on the International on Slide 9. The 7.4% constant currency growth continues the trend of an improving constant currency revenue growth picture for International. While this added growth has been more related to across-the-board volume gains, with the new record level of accounts on file, we are pleased that our pivot from margin focus to revenue growth is showing signs of success.
While we started the year expecting this segment to be largely flat on a constant currency basis, we now expect constant currency revenue growth for this segment for 2016 to be at or slightly above 5%. We are also seeing some improving prospect pipeline activity in International that, while too early to comment on, could help this growth picture going forward. 
On the margin front, while the 19.5% is in line with our long-term margin goal, it was negatively impacted by severance. And without this, the quarterly margin would have been 21.9%.
And finally, while not included in our International segment results, our CUP Data joint venture continued its historic trend of double-digit growth for the quarter.
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10, where we remain very pleased with the financial results of the newly combined segment, with the integration and synergy plans remaining solidly on track.
While the 112% reported growth is impressive, our core organic growth for our combined direct business continues to be in the high single-digits range, in line with the industry, and our focus in direct continues to be in the integrated channel, which represents approximately 30% of our direct business.
The indirect side had some contraction in the quarter due to some favorable items in 3Q of 2015 that I talked about previously. And without those, indirect growth would have been approximately 2%.
The margin for the segment remains stable at 34.6%. 
Finally, on the NetSpend on Slide 11. The revenue growth at NetSpend of 11.2% for the quarter continued the 4.5-year trend of double-digit revenue growth. We saw an 11% and 18.1% increase in GDV, and a 15.8% year-over-year increase in direct deposit active cards. 
Our margin of 26.3% was relatively consistent with last year's margins, and we continue to expect the business to grow in the low to mid-teens for 2016, which is better than what we had previously expected. 
However, we do expect 4Q revenue growth to be lower than 3Q levels partly due to not growing our marketing investment as significantly in the second half of '16 as we did in the second half of '15.
We also expect, as we have all year, to have slightly expanding margins for the segment for 2016. 
Before I leave NetSpend, I do want to comment on the CFPB's final rules on prepaid that Troy mentioned. While we will be talking more about this in the coming quarters, I do want to provide some baseline information regarding the potential effect to our NetSpend business related to the rules.
First, we expect no negative financial impact to our 2016 expected results related to the rules as they will not become effective until the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Second, we currently estimate that the 2016 total revenues that would have been impacted by the rules would be approximately $80 million to $85 million, with estimated EPS impact of $0.19 to $0.21, including compliance costs. The $80 million to $85 million of impacted revenue consists of overdraft revenue, which was roughly 10% to 12% of NetSpend's revenue and certain other fees that were disallowed by the rule. 
As it relates to 2017 and 2018, Troy mentioned that we have been, and will continue to work on our business-expansion strategies. 
Based in part on our current, but not yet complete analysis, of the prepaid rules and the CFPB's underlying intent, we currently estimate with the October 1, 2017 implementation date that our calendar year 2017 total revenues will be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million to $25 million. 
For 2018, we expect total revenues to also be impacted by an additional $20 million to $25 million. In other words, we expect to offset close to half of the negative revenue impact of the rules through our business-expansion strategies.
Regarding EPS, we currently expect a $0.06 to $0.08 negative EPS impact in 2017 and an additional $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact in 2018. In other words, we expect our business-expansion strategies to offset roughly 1/3 of the negative EPS impact of the rules.
I want to emphasize that these are preliminary estimates and are subject to change positively or negatively as we learn more and our strategies progress.
The success of our strategies depend on the rate of adoption of our new products, both by our consumers and our distribution partners; the rate of utilization of the various product features by cardholders, market and regulatory dynamics; and a host of other factors that will play out over time. And our estimated impact could vary  positively or negatively based on these and other factors. And we will comment more on these in our upcoming calls as we move closer to the October 2017 day. 
Also, I want to highlight that our NetSpend revenue growth for 2015 and 2016 would not change by more than 100 basis points positively or negatively if you excluded the revenue items impacted by the rules showing that the strong double-digit organic revenue growth has been delivered by the core fundamentals of the NetSpend business. 
Finally, as we mentioned in our press release, our guidance remains unchanged for adjusted EPS at $2.78 to $2.85, but we are no longer pointing to the low end of the range as we did on our last call due to the overperformance we have experienced. 
However, we are adjusting our total revenue and net revenue ranges down slightly to reflect the year-to-date currency impact as well as expected currency impact for the fourth quarter.
On a constant currency basis, however, our revenues on both the total revenue and net revenue basis would have remained in our original ranges, and our EPS would have likely exceeded the top end of our EPS range.
To wrap up, the segments are on track with our expectations, and we still expect our margins to slightly expand across all 4 segments. Our TransFirst acquisition, integration and synergy achievement is on track. Our deleveraging plan is ahead of schedule. Our work to define the optimal operating structure for the company yielded greater cost structure efficiencies on a go-forward basis than we had planned.
The uncertainty of the CFPB ruling is behind us and allows us to execute on our strategies in NetSpend on a go-forward basis with clarity as it relates to  the final rules.
And our core organic revenue growth targets for our businesses are on track.
In all, the third quarter was an important one on many fronts and we're pleased with the position we are in.
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

And then we've also seen a nice pickup on the Merchant side. And then as I commented earlier, our NetSpend revenue growth has improved. So kind of from a revenue standpoint and we already talked about North America being kind of at or just slightly better than what we had expected, the revenue of all 4 segments is either kind of at or slightly better, but I will say that from a margin standpoint, not only did we have kind of our onetime costs takeout as it relates to the severance but there's been downstream improvements as well on the margin that had kind of being ancillary to that as we've been looking at the cost basis across all of our segments and so we we've kind of had kind of additional lift across the don't necessarily 1 for 1 high of the severance but we've gotten that benefit as we've been looking and everything from people cost to vendor cost and as we look at kind of how we are delivering and getting the efficiencies in our business.

I would make a couple of points, is obviously on the North America side, to get to kind of the 5% number, you see a deceleration of growth between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we're 2.4% reported and it declines on a sequential-quarter basis down from that 2.4%. So that's kind of 1 test of the componentry that you might want to kind of start with. As I said, earlier, if you back out those credit 2 items as it relates to Prepaid, and the EMV piece that 2.4% looks more like the revenue guidance range that Troy talked about but as it relates to the fourth quarter, where those items are playing a significant impact, we do have sequential quarter deceleration. In the fourth quarter, from International, as we said, we would have just kind of commensurate expected level of currency on a reported basis to reflect the changes that we've seen in the pound primarily there. On the Merchant side, there isn't anything I would necessarily call out that's dramatically different between kind of third and fourth quarter, but I did say in my prepared remarks a deceleration sequentially between the third quarter and the fourth quarter for NetSpend due to a variety of factors but the one I called out was a lower level of increased spending as it relates to marketing. So using those kind of as the total guides at the segments, I do think that range that you'd get back to does kind of put us at the overall revised guidance revenue ranges that we provided on the call here today."

All 4 of our operating segments exceeded our internal targets for the quarter, and I would like to thank all of our team members for their commitment, focus and dedication. It's because of this commitment, focus and dedication that we were ranked #9 on the 2016 Fintech Forum 100 list of leading technology providers in the world, and also recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of Fortune's fastest-growing companies of 2016.
I will focus my comments today on a few key initiatives across the enterprise, and Paul will provide the financial highlights for the segments and the enterprise during his presentation. 
Let's start with North America. During the quarter, we hired Karim Ahmad as our new Executive Vice President of Product and Innovation. As we have discussed on several occasions, accelerating our product capabilities will be crucial to our North America growth story. We are convinced that with Karim's knowledge, experience and leadership, we will get this done. 
During our second quarter earnings call, we may have created some confusion with respect to our 2016, 2018 North America net revenue guidance. I certainly apologize for that confusion, and I would like to take this opportunity to address it today.
Let's start with 2016 guidance. We have been consistent since providing North America segment revenue guidance in January that the segment would grow mid to single digits in 2016 but more toward the low end of this range.
It has also become apparent to me, subsequent to our earnings call and after a few conversations and visits with many of you, that the definition of low, mid and high means many different things to different people. To help clear this up going forward, we will no longer refer to our guidance in terms of low, mid or high ranges unless we have previously defined what these ranges are or we will simply provide numerical ranges with absolute numbers.
With just one quarter left in 2016, we expect our 2016 North America net revenue growth to be at or slightly above 5%.
Now let's address how we view 2017 and 2018. Based on what we know at this time, we believe the organic growth profile for our North America business will be in the 5% to 7% range for this period of time, and then sequential quarter growth improvement will begin in the first quarter 2017. Our North America business is our largest and most profitable segment and we believe the core fundamentals of this business are absolutely rock solid. Our technology, people and service capabilities, along with a world-class blue-chip customer base, gives us confidence we can continue to grow and expand this segment. 
I now would like to make a few comments about our Merchant business. We are now 6 months post the acquisition of TransFirst. We were very pleased that the integration activities and synergy goals remain solidly on track. Although there have been some leadership changes, we remain relentlessly focused on growing and expanding this business. Our team is very motivated and engaged, and we continue to expect good results from this segment going forward.
Now I would like to address NetSpend. Of course, the big news here this quarter is the publication of the CFPB's final rules on October 5 governing the prepaid industry, all 1,689 pages. As you know, there was a lot of public commentary on the proposed rules on prepaid. Some of the technical matters were addressed. However, we were disappointed with some of the positions the CFPB adopted in the final rules. We do welcome the certainty that these new rules bring to the prepaid industry and the CFPB's recognition of prepaid cards as safe and practical financial tools that serve a rapidly expanding consumer base. 
These new rules will require us to devote a significant amount of time and resources toward revising our printed, digital and telephonic disclosures and other compliance-related activities. As you might expect, it is taking a considerable amount of time to thoroughly review and analyze nearly 1,700 pages of regulation and commentary. 
Based on the current, but not yet complete analysis of these rules, we anticipate a loss of revenue between $80 million to $85 million based on expected 2016 revenues. This will be as a result of the elimination of certain fees and the decision to no longer offer optional overdraft protection on our current prepaid card programs.
As NetSpend prepares for the next evolution of its business, we will focus on product innovations that help us reach new customer segments, deepen our relationship with existing customer and attract new partners. This will include the launch of several new products to include a new demand deposit account product and a small business prepaid product.
Our new demand deposit account product will include features such as check-writing ability, enhanced savings features and optional overdraft protection. 
Paul will provide additional details on our revenue and EPS timing expectations in his presentation.
We continue to steadfastly believe that significant opportunities remain to grow our prepaid business. It is projected that over $112 billion will be loaded onto prepaid cards in 2018 alone, double the amount loaded in 2012. This is the growth profile that led us to acquire NetSpend in 2013 and we plan to continue to be a leader in this space.
And finally, I would like to make a comment regarding our capital allocation plans. As I previously mentioned, we generated record free cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date. This strong cash generation has allowed us to accelerate some of our debt-reduction plans that Paul will also address. This accelerated debt reduction, strong free cash flow generation and our confidence in our momentum provides us the opportunity to reenter the market in the coming quarters with respect to share repurchase.
All in all, it was a very good quarter. All 4 segments grew revenue. Three of our 4 segments expanded margins, notwithstanding severance costs, 10 million new traditional accounts on file were added during the quarter, and we continue to execute on our overall business strategy. 
I now would like to turn the call over to Paul to provide detailed financial information for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Paul?"

And I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the quarter's performance and our year-to-date results. Before I get into the segment results, I want to highlight a few things. First, each of our segments beat our internal projections",1747,"Thank you, Troy. And I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the quarter's performance and our year-to-date results. Before I get into the segment results, I want to highlight a few things. 
First, each of our segments beat our internal projections for the quarter and each is in line with the expectations we laid out at the beginning of the year. 
Second, our TransFirst acquisition integration continues on track, with our expense takeout synergies from the combined businesses meeting our expectations. 
Third, the deleveraging of our balance sheet is ahead of plan, with $175 million of debt paydown during the quarter, bringing our 2-quarter total of deleveraging to $300 million. You may recall, we said we plan to reduce our leverage by $800 million over 8 quarters, so the $300 million through 2 quarters reflects our progress on this target. 
Fourth, as we discussed on our last call, through planned organizational efficiencies, we incurred severance expenses of approximately $9 million during the quarter, which was higher than our original estimate, but we were more aggressive in addressing the expense base that will position us stronger going forward.
And finally, as we discussed on our last call, we absorbed some significant currency headwinds during the quarter that reduced our revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.03. With these items as a backdrop, I will move into our financial results, moving to Slide 6 and our consolidated financial performance. 
Quarterly total revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 62% from 3Q 2015. Quarterly net revenue was $790 million, up 24.1% from last year. GAAP net income was $85.4 million, down 29.2% from last year; and GAAP basic earnings per share was $0.46, also a decrease of 29.2% from last year.
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $269.1 million, an increase of 12.7% from last year; and adjusted EPS was $0.71, a decrease of $0.07 from last year. You may recall, we had a $0.13 adjusted EPS pickup in 3Q 2015 related to taxes, and isolating that impact on a comparative basis yields an increase of a much higher adjusted EPS impact than reported.
Also, the additional $0.03 of severance we experienced in the quarter, coupled with the approximately $0.03 of currency impact, point to an approximate $0.19 of items in the comparative third quarter 2016 versus 2015 adjusted EPS growth picture. 
Our free cash flow for the quarter grew by 37.5% and 36.8% through 9 months, showing that the cash flow generating strength of TSYS continues in the legacy business and is complemented by the strong contribution from TransFirst. This is the second straight quarter of double-digit free cash flow growth, and we expect our free cash flow to be in the $550 million to $570 million range for the year, which is higher than the $510 million to $540 million range we had previously expected.
Now onto our segments' results, starting on Slide 8 with North America. North America business performed slightly better in 3Q than we had planned, increasing revenue by 2.4% on record traditional accounts on file of $444.6 million. Our expectation for revenue growth for this business for 2016 continues to be at or slightly above 5%. This is exactly where we thought the business would be when we entered the year, and the core fundamentals of the business remain intact. 
Our margin for the quarter was 37.7% but included approximately $6 million of severance expense to this segment. And without this expense, segment margin would have been 39.7%.
Now on the International on Slide 9. The 7.4% constant currency growth continues the trend of an improving constant currency revenue growth picture for International. While this added growth has been more related to across-the-board volume gains, with the new record level of accounts on file, we are pleased that our pivot from margin focus to revenue growth is showing signs of success.
While we started the year expecting this segment to be largely flat on a constant currency basis, we now expect constant currency revenue growth for this segment for 2016 to be at or slightly above 5%. We are also seeing some improving prospect pipeline activity in International that, while too early to comment on, could help this growth picture going forward. 
On the margin front, while the 19.5% is in line with our long-term margin goal, it was negatively impacted by severance. And without this, the quarterly margin would have been 21.9%.
And finally, while not included in our International segment results, our CUP Data joint venture continued its historic trend of double-digit growth for the quarter.
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10, where we remain very pleased with the financial results of the newly combined segment, with the integration and synergy plans remaining solidly on track.
While the 112% reported growth is impressive, our core organic growth for our combined direct business continues to be in the high single-digits range, in line with the industry, and our focus in direct continues to be in the integrated channel, which represents approximately 30% of our direct business.
The indirect side had some contraction in the quarter due to some favorable items in 3Q of 2015 that I talked about previously. And without those, indirect growth would have been approximately 2%.
The margin for the segment remains stable at 34.6%. 
Finally, on the NetSpend on Slide 11. The revenue growth at NetSpend of 11.2% for the quarter continued the 4.5-year trend of double-digit revenue growth. We saw an 11% and 18.1% increase in GDV, and a 15.8% year-over-year increase in direct deposit active cards. 
Our margin of 26.3% was relatively consistent with last year's margins, and we continue to expect the business to grow in the low to mid-teens for 2016, which is better than what we had previously expected. 
However, we do expect 4Q revenue growth to be lower than 3Q levels partly due to not growing our marketing investment as significantly in the second half of '16 as we did in the second half of '15.
We also expect, as we have all year, to have slightly expanding margins for the segment for 2016. 
Before I leave NetSpend, I do want to comment on the CFPB's final rules on prepaid that Troy mentioned. While we will be talking more about this in the coming quarters, I do want to provide some baseline information regarding the potential effect to our NetSpend business related to the rules.
First, we expect no negative financial impact to our 2016 expected results related to the rules as they will not become effective until the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Second, we currently estimate that the 2016 total revenues that would have been impacted by the rules would be approximately $80 million to $85 million, with estimated EPS impact of $0.19 to $0.21, including compliance costs. The $80 million to $85 million of impacted revenue consists of overdraft revenue, which was roughly 10% to 12% of NetSpend's revenue and certain other fees that were disallowed by the rule. 
As it relates to 2017 and 2018, Troy mentioned that we have been, and will continue to work on our business-expansion strategies. 
Based in part on our current, but not yet complete analysis, of the prepaid rules and the CFPB's underlying intent, we currently estimate with the October 1, 2017 implementation date that our calendar year 2017 total revenues will be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million to $25 million. 
For 2018, we expect total revenues to also be impacted by an additional $20 million to $25 million. In other words, we expect to offset close to half of the negative revenue impact of the rules through our business-expansion strategies.
Regarding EPS, we currently expect a $0.06 to $0.08 negative EPS impact in 2017 and an additional $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact in 2018. In other words, we expect our business-expansion strategies to offset roughly 1/3 of the negative EPS impact of the rules.
I want to emphasize that these are preliminary estimates and are subject to change positively or negatively as we learn more and our strategies progress.
The success of our strategies depend on the rate of adoption of our new products, both by our consumers and our distribution partners; the rate of utilization of the various product features by cardholders, market and regulatory dynamics; and a host of other factors that will play out over time. And our estimated impact could vary  positively or negatively based on these and other factors. And we will comment more on these in our upcoming calls as we move closer to the October 2017 day. 
Also, I want to highlight that our NetSpend revenue growth for 2015 and 2016 would not change by more than 100 basis points positively or negatively if you excluded the revenue items impacted by the rules showing that the strong double-digit organic revenue growth has been delivered by the core fundamentals of the NetSpend business. 
Finally, as we mentioned in our press release, our guidance remains unchanged for adjusted EPS at $2.78 to $2.85, but we are no longer pointing to the low end of the range as we did on our last call due to the overperformance we have experienced. 
However, we are adjusting our total revenue and net revenue ranges down slightly to reflect the year-to-date currency impact as well as expected currency impact for the fourth quarter.
On a constant currency basis, however, our revenues on both the total revenue and net revenue basis would have remained in our original ranges, and our EPS would have likely exceeded the top end of our EPS range.
To wrap up, the segments are on track with our expectations, and we still expect our margins to slightly expand across all 4 segments. Our TransFirst acquisition, integration and synergy achievement is on track. Our deleveraging plan is ahead of schedule. Our work to define the optimal operating structure for the company yielded greater cost structure efficiencies on a go-forward basis than we had planned.
The uncertainty of the CFPB ruling is behind us and allows us to execute on our strategies in NetSpend on a go-forward basis with clarity as it relates to  the final rules.
And our core organic revenue growth targets for our businesses are on track.
In all, the third quarter was an important one on many fronts and we're pleased with the position we are in.
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

We've been very targeted in our history of NetSpend to grow at faster than the growth of the industry, and so I think we would hold off as it relates to what we think specifically as it relates to '17.

Because I mean, obviously, the revenue guidance is coming down a little bit for FX, but you're protecting the bottom line here."

Is -- first of all, I mean, we are seeing this across all 4 segments. And so from your -- kind of from a sizing standpoint, the biggest impacts, relative to our projections, have been on our International side, which, obviously, from a revenue standpoint on a constant currency basis, has provided us some upside on -- once again, on a constant currency basis. And then we've also seen a nice pick up on the Merchant side. And then as I commented earlier, our NetSpend revenue growth has improved. So kind of from a revenue standpoint, and we already talked about North America being kind of at or just slightly better than what we had expected, the revenue of all 4 segments is either kind of at or slightly better. But I will say that from a margin standpoint, not only did we have kind of our onetime cost takeout as it relates to the severance but there's been downstream improvements as well on the margin that have kind of been ancillary to that as we've been looking at the cost basis across all of our segments. And so we we've kind of had kind of an additional lift across the segments that don't necessarily 1-for-1 high to the severance, but we've gotten that benefit as we've been looking at everything from people cost to vendor cost, and as we look at kind of how we're delivering and getting the efficiencies in our business. So those would be kind of the 2 things I'd point out. Troy, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add there."

I would make a couple of points is, obviously, on the North America side, to get to kind of the 5% number, you see a deceleration of growth between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we're 2.4% reported, and it declines on a sequential-quarter basis down from that 2.4%. So that's kind of one test of the componentry that you might want to kind of start with. As I said, earlier, if you back out those kind of 2 items, as it relates to prepaid, and the EMV piece, that 2.4% looks more like the revenue guidance range that Troy talked about. But as it relates to the fourth quarter, where those items are playing a significant impact, we do have sequential quarter deceleration. In the fourth quarter, from International, as we said, we would have just kind of commensurate expected level of currency on a reported basis to reflect the changes that we've seen in the pound, primarily, there. On the Merchant side, there isn't anything I would necessarily call out that's dramatically different between kind of third and fourth quarter. But I did say in my prepared remarks a deceleration sequentially between the third quarter and the fourth quarter for NetSpend due to a variety of factors. But the one I called out was a lower level of increased spending as it relates to marketing. So using those kind of as the tonal guides at the segments, I do think that range that you'd get back to does kind of put us at the overall revised guidance revenue ranges that we provided on the call here today."

We were very pleased with our financial performance, TransFirst integration activities, record free cash flow generation and our overall execution during the quarter.
All 4 of our operating segments exceeded our internal targets for the quarter, and I would like to thank all of our team members for their commitment, focus and dedication. It's because of this commitment, focus and dedication that we were ranked #9 on the 2016 FinTech Forum 100 list of leading technology providers in the world, and also recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of Fortune's fastest-growing companies of 2016.
I will focus my comments today on a few key initiatives across the enterprise, and Paul will provide the financial highlights for the segments and the enterprise during his presentation. 
Let's start with North America. During the quarter, we hired Karim Ahmad as our new Executive Vice President of Product and Innovation. As we have discussed on several occasions, accelerating our product capabilities will be crucial to our North America growth story. We are convinced that with Karim's knowledge, experience and leadership, we will get this done. 
During our second quarter earnings call, we may have created some confusion with respect to our 2016, 2018 North America net revenue guidance. I certainly apologize for that confusion, and would like to take this opportunity to address it today.
Let's start with 2016 guidance. We have been consistent since providing North America segment revenue guidance in January that the segment would grow mid to single digits in 2016 but more toward the low end of this range.
It has also become apparent to me, subsequent to our earnings call and after a few conversations and visits with many of you, that the definition of low, mid and high means many different things to different people. To help clear this up going forward, we will no longer refer to our guidance in terms of low, mid or high ranges unless we have previously defined what these ranges are or we will simply provide numerical ranges with absolute numbers.
With just one quarter left in 2016, we expect our 2016 North America net revenue growth to be at or slightly above 5%.
Now let's address how we view 2017 and 2018. Based on what we know at this time, we believe the organic growth profile for our North America business will be in the 5% to 7% range for this period of time, and then sequential quarter growth improvement will begin in the first quarter 2017. Our North America business is our largest and most profitable segment and we believe the core fundamentals of this business are absolutely rock solid. Our technology, people and service capabilities, along with a world-class blue-chip customer base, gives us confidence we can continue to grow and expand this segment. 
I now would like to make a few comments about our Merchant business. We are now 6 months post the acquisition of TransFirst. We were very pleased that the integration activities and synergy goals remain solidly on track. Although there have been some leadership changes, we remain relentlessly focused on growing and expanding this business. Our team is very motivated and engaged, and we continue to expect good results from this segment going forward.
Now I would like to address NetSpend. Of course, the big news here this quarter is the publication of the CFPB's final rules on October 5 governing the prepaid industry, all 1,689 pages. As you know, there was a lot of public commentary on the proposed rules on prepaid. Some of the technical matters were addressed. However, we were disappointed with some of the positions the CFPB adopted in the final rules. We do welcome the certainty that these new rules bring to the prepaid industry and the CFPB's recognition of prepaid cards as safe and practical financial tools that serve a rapidly expanding consumer base. 
These new rules will require us to devote a significant amount of time and resources toward revising our printed, digital and telephonic disclosures and other compliance-related activities. As you might expect, it is taking a considerable amount of time to thoroughly review and analyze nearly 1,700 pages of regulation and commentary. 
Based on the current, but not yet complete analysis of these rules, we anticipate a loss of revenue between $80 million to $85 million based on expected 2016 revenues. This will be as a result of the elimination of certain fees and the decision to no longer offer optional overdraft protection on our current prepaid card programs.
As NetSpend prepares for the next evolution of its business, we will focus on product innovations that help us reach new customer segments, deepen our relationship with existing customer and attract new partners. This will include the launch of several new products to include a new demand deposit account product and a small business prepaid product.
Our new demand deposit account product will include features such as check-writing ability, enhanced savings features and optional overdraft protection. 
Paul will provide additional details on our revenue and EPS timing expectations in his presentation.
We continue to steadfastly believe that significant opportunities remain to grow our prepaid business. It is projected that over $112 billion will be loaded onto prepaid cards in 2018 alone, double the amount loaded in 2012. This is the growth profile that led us to acquire NetSpend in 2013 and we plan to continue to be a leader in this space.
And finally, I would like to make a comment regarding our capital allocation plans. As I previously mentioned, we generated record free cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date. This strong cash generation has allowed us to accelerate some of our debt-reduction plans that Paul will also address. This accelerated debt reduction, strong free cash flow generation and our confidence in our momentum provides us the opportunity to reenter the market in the coming quarters with respect to share repurchase.
All in all, it was a very good quarter. All 4 segments grew revenue. Three of our 4 segments expanded margins, notwithstanding severance costs, 10 million new traditional accounts on file were added during the quarter, and we continue to execute on our overall business strategy.

And I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the quarter's performance and our year-to-date results. Before I get into the segment results, I want to highlight a few things. First, each of our segments beat our internal projections",1746,"Thank you, Troy. And I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the quarter's performance and our year-to-date results. Before I get into the segment results, I want to highlight a few things. 
First, each of our segments beat our internal projections for the quarter and each is in line with the expectations we laid out at the beginning of the year. 
Second, our TransFirst acquisition integration continues on track, with our expense takeout synergies from the combined businesses meeting our expectations. 
Third, the deleveraging of our balance sheet is ahead of plan, with $175 million of debt paydown during the quarter, bringing our 2-quarter total of deleveraging to $300 million. You may recall, we said we plan to reduce our leverage by $800 million over 8 quarters, so the $300 million through 2 quarters reflects our progress on this target. 
Fourth, as we discussed on our last call, through planned organizational efficiencies, we incurred severance expenses of approximately $9 million during the quarter, which was higher than our original estimate, but we were more aggressive in addressing the expense base that will position us stronger going forward.
And finally, as we discussed on our last call, we absorbed some significant currency headwinds during the quarter that reduced our revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.03. With these items as a backdrop, I will move into our financial results, moving to Slide 6 and our consolidated financial performance. 
Quarterly total revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 62% from 3Q 2015. Quarterly net revenue was $790 million, up 24.1% from last year. GAAP net income was $85.4 million, down 29.2% from last year; and GAAP basic earnings per share was $0.46, also a decrease of 29.2% from last year.
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $269.1 million, an increase of 12.7% from last year; and adjusted EPS was $0.71, a decrease of $0.07 from last year. You may recall, we had a $0.13 adjusted EPS pickup in 3Q 2015 related to taxes, and isolating that impact on a comparative basis yields an increase of a much higher adjusted EPS impact than reported.
Also, the additional $0.03 of severance we experienced in the quarter, coupled with the approximately $0.03 of currency impact, point to an approximate $0.19 of items in the comparative third quarter 2016 versus 2015 adjusted EPS growth picture. 
Our free cash flow for the quarter grew by 37.5% and 36.8% through 9 months, showing that the cash flow generating strength of TSYS continues in the legacy business and is complemented by the strong contribution from TransFirst. This is the second straight quarter of double-digit free cash flow growth, and we expect our free cash flow to be in the $550 million to $570 million range for the year, which is higher than the $510 million to $540 million range we had previously expected.
Now onto our segments' results, starting on Slide 8 with North America. North America business performed slightly better in 3Q than we had planned, increasing revenue by 2.4% on record traditional accounts on file of $444.6 million. Our expectation for revenue growth for this business for 2016 continues to be at or slightly above 5%. This is exactly where we thought the business would be when we entered the year, and the core fundamentals of the business remain intact. 
Our margin for the quarter was 37.7% but included approximately $6 million of severance expense to this segment. And without this expense, segment margin would have been 39.7%.
Now on the International on Slide 9. The 7.4% constant currency growth continues the trend of an improving constant currency revenue growth picture for International. While this added growth has been more related to across-the-board volume gains, with the new record level of accounts on file, we are pleased that our pivot from margin focus to revenue growth is showing signs of success.
While we started the year expecting this segment to be largely flat on a constant currency basis, we now expect constant currency revenue growth for this segment for 2016 to be at or slightly above 5%. We are also seeing some improving prospect pipeline activity in International that, while too early to comment on, could help this growth picture going forward. 
On the margin front, while the 19.5% is in line with our long-term margin goal, it was negatively impacted by severance. And without this, the quarterly margin would have been 21.9%.
And finally, while not included in our International segment results, our CUP Data joint venture continued its historic trend of double-digit growth for the quarter.
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10, where we remain very pleased with the financial results of the newly combined segment, with the integration and synergy plans remaining solidly on track.
While the 112% reported growth is impressive, our core organic growth for our combined direct business continues to be in the high single-digits range, in line with the industry, and our focus in direct continues to be in the integrated channel, which represents approximately 30% of our direct business.
The indirect side had some contraction in the quarter due to some favorable items in 3Q of 2015 that I talked about previously. And without those, indirect growth would have been approximately 2%.
The margin for the segment remains stable at 34.6%. 
Finally, on to NetSpend on Slide 11. The revenue growth at NetSpend of 11.2% for the quarter continued the 4.5-year trend of double-digit revenue growth. We saw an 11% and 18.1% increase in GDV, and a 15.8% year-over-year increase in direct deposit active cards. 
Our margin of 26.3% was relatively consistent with last year's margins, and we continue to expect the business to grow in the low to mid-teens for 2016, which is better than what we had previously expected. 
However, we do expect 4Q revenue growth to be lower than 3Q levels partly due to not growing our marketing investment as significantly in the second half of '16 as we did in the second half of '15.
We also expect, as we have all year, to have slightly expanding margins for the segment for 2016. 
Before I leave NetSpend, I do want to comment on the CFPB's final rules on prepaid that Troy mentioned. While we will be talking more about this in the coming quarters, I do want to provide some baseline information regarding the potential effect to our NetSpend business related to the rules.
First, we expect no negative financial impact to our 2016 expected results related to the rules since they will not become effective until the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Second, we currently estimate that the 2016 total revenues that would have been impacted by the rules would be approximately $80 million to $85 million, with estimated EPS impact of $0.19 to $0.21, including compliance costs. The $80 million to $85 million of impacted revenue consists of overdraft revenue, which was roughly 10% to 12% of NetSpend's revenue and certain other fees that are disallowed by the rule. 
As it relates to 2017 and 2018, Troy mentioned that we have been and will continue to work on our business-expansion strategies. 
Based in part on our current, but not yet complete analysis, of the prepaid rules and the CFPB's underlying intent, we currently estimate with the October 1, 2017 implementation date that our calendar year 2017 total revenues will be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million to $25 million. 
For 2018, we expect total revenues to also be impacted by an additional $20 million to $25 million. In other words, we expect to offset close to half of the negative revenue impact of the rules through our business-expansion strategies.
Regarding EPS, we currently expect a $0.06 to $0.08 negative EPS impact in 2017 and an additional $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact in 2018. In other words, we expect our business-expansion strategies to offset roughly 1/3 of the negative EPS impact of the rules.
I want to emphasize that these are preliminary estimates and are subject to change positively or negatively as we learn more and our strategies progress.
The success of our strategies depend on the rate of adoption of our new products, both by consumers and our distribution partners; the rate of utilization of the various product features by cardholders, market and regulatory dynamics; and a host of other factors that will play out over time. And our estimated impact could vary positively or negatively based on these and other factors. And we will comment more on these in our upcoming calls as we move closer to the October 2017 day. 
Also, I want to highlight that our NetSpend revenue growth for 2015 and 2016 would not change by more than 100 basis points positively or negatively if you excluded the revenue items impacted by the rules showing that the strong double-digit organic revenue growth has been delivered by the core fundamentals of the NetSpend business. 
Finally, as we mentioned in our press release, our guidance remains unchanged for adjusted EPS at $2.78 to $2.85, but we are no longer pointing to the low end of the range as we did on our last call due to the overperformance we have experienced. 
However, we are adjusting our total revenue and net revenue ranges down slightly to reflect the year-to-date currency impact as well as expected currency impact for the fourth quarter.
On a constant currency basis, however, our revenues on both the total revenue and net revenue basis would have remained in our original ranges, and our EPS would have likely exceeded the top end of our EPS range.
To wrap up, the segments are on track with our expectations, and we still expect our margins to slightly expand across all 4 segments. Our TransFirst acquisition, integration and synergy achievement is on track. Our deleveraging plan is ahead of schedule. Our work to define the optimal operating structure for the company yielded greater cost structure efficiencies on a go-forward basis than we had planned.
The uncertainty of the CFPB ruling is behind us and allows us to execute on our strategies in NetSpend on a go-forward basis with clarity as it relates to the final rules.
And our core organic revenue growth targets for our businesses are on track.
In all, the third quarter was an important one on many fronts and we're pleased with the position we are in.
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

And Troy indicated that with the acceleration that we had, it's likely that you reach the $800 million before that period. So the flexibility that kind of presents itself opens up sooner than kind of 8-quarter picture there. I'd reiterate that deleveraging is still our first and highest priority as it relates to the use of our free cash flow, and so we're going to remain focused around that. Our investment-grade rating is still very important to us.

We've been very targeted in our history of NetSpend to grow at faster than the growth of the industry, and so I think we would hold off as it relates to what we think specifically as it relates to '17.

But I will say that from a margin standpoint, not only did we have kind of our onetime cost takeout as it relates to the severance but there's been downstream improvements as well on the margin that have kind of been ancillary to that as we've been looking at the cost basis across all of our segments. And so we we've kind of had kind of an additional lift across the segments that don't necessarily 1-for-1 tie to the severance, but we've gotten that benefit as we've been looking at everything from people cost to vendor cost, and as we look at kind of how we're delivering and getting the efficiencies in our business.

We've had these prepaid rules -- the proposed rules in front of us for a while. So we're looking at those. We've done a lot of modeling, as you might expect. At the end of the day, there is no crystal ball. But we feel quite confident in our management team at NetSpend, the way they looked at it, the way they've modeled it, that we feel reasonably confident, of course. And Paul gave you some caveat, obviously, we've got to get out there. We've got to see what the adoption rates are. We've got to make sure we understand consumer behavior changes, if there are any, et cetera, et cetera.

I would make a couple of points is, obviously, on the North America side, to get to kind of the 5% number, you see a deceleration of growth between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we're 2.4% reported, and it declines on a sequential-quarter basis down from that 2.4%. So that's kind of one test of the componentry that you might want to kind of start with. As I said earlier, if you back out those kind of 2 items, as it relates to prepaid, and the EMV piece, that 2.4% looks more like the revenue guidance range that Troy talked about. But as it relates to the fourth quarter, where those items are playing a significant impact, we do have sequential quarter deceleration. In the fourth quarter, from International, as we said, we would have just kind of commensurate expected level of currency on a reported basis to reflect the changes that we've seen in the pound, primarily, there. On the Merchant side, there isn't anything I would necessarily call out that's dramatically different between kind of third and fourth quarter. But I did say in my prepared remarks a deceleration sequentially between the third quarter and the fourth quarter for NetSpend due to a variety of factors. But the one I called out was a lower level of increased spending as it relates to marketing. So using those kind of as the tonal guides at the segments, I do think that range that you'd get back to does kind of put us at the overall revised guidance revenue ranges that we provided on the call here today."

We were very pleased with our financial performance, TransFirst integration activities, record free cash flow generation and our overall execution during the quarter.
All 4 of our operating segments exceeded our internal targets for the quarter, and I would like to thank all of our team members for their commitment, focus and dedication. It's because of this commitment, focus and dedication that we were ranked #9 on the 2016 FinTech Forum 100 list of leading technology providers in the world, and also recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of Fortune's fastest-growing companies of 2016.
I will focus my comments today on a few key initiatives across the enterprise, and Paul will provide the financial highlights for the segments and the enterprise during his presentation. 
Let's start with North America. During the quarter, we hired Karim Ahmad as our new Executive Vice President of Product and Innovation. As we have discussed on several occasions, accelerating our product capabilities will be crucial to our North America growth story. We are convinced that with Karim's knowledge, experience and leadership, we will get this done. 
During our second quarter earnings call, we may have created some confusion with respect to our 2016, 2018 North America net revenue guidance. I certainly apologize for that confusion, and would like to take this opportunity to address it today.
Let's start with 2016 guidance. We have been consistent since providing North America segment revenue guidance in January that the segment would grow mid to single digits in 2016 but more toward the low end of this range.
It has also become apparent to me, subsequent to our earnings call and after a few conversations and visits with many of you, that the definition of low, mid and high means many different things to different people. To help clear this up going forward, we will no longer refer to our guidance in terms of low, mid or high ranges unless we have previously defined what these ranges are or we will simply provide numerical ranges with absolute numbers.
With just one quarter left in 2016, we expect our 2016 North America net revenue growth to be at or slightly above 5%.
Now let's address how we view 2017 and 2018. Based on what we know at this time, we believe the organic growth profile for our North America business will be in the 5% to 7% range for this period of time, and then sequential quarter growth improvement will begin in the first quarter 2017. Our North America business is our largest and most profitable segment and we believe the core fundamentals of this business are absolutely rock solid. Our technology, people and service capabilities, along with a world-class blue-chip customer base, gives us confidence we can continue to grow and expand this segment. 
I now would like to make a few comments about our Merchant business. We are now 6 months post the acquisition of TransFirst. We were very pleased that the integration activities and synergy goals remain solidly on track. Although there have been some leadership changes, we remain relentlessly focused on growing and expanding this business. Our team is very motivated and engaged, and we continue to expect good results from this segment going forward.
Now I would like to address NetSpend. Of course, the big news here this quarter is the publication of the CFPB's final rules on October 5 governing the prepaid industry, all 1,689 pages. As you know, there was a lot of public commentary on the proposed rules on prepaid. Some of the technical matters were addressed. However, we were disappointed with some of the positions the CFPB adopted in the final rules. We do welcome the certainty that these new rules bring to the prepaid industry and the CFPB's recognition of prepaid cards as safe and practical financial tools that serve a rapidly expanding consumer base. 
These new rules will require us to devote a significant amount of time and resources toward revising our printed, digital and telephonic disclosures and other compliance-related activities. As you might expect, it is taking a considerable amount of time to thoroughly review and analyze nearly 1,700 pages of regulation and commentary. 
Based on the current, but not yet complete analysis of these rules, we anticipate a loss of revenue between $80 million to $85 million based on expected 2016 revenues. This will be as a result of the elimination of certain fees and the decision to no longer offer optional overdraft protection on our current prepaid card programs.
As NetSpend prepares for the next evolution of its business, we will focus on product innovations that help us reach new customer segments, deepen our relationship with existing customer and attract new partners. This will include the launch of several new products to include a new demand deposit account product and a small business prepaid product.
Our new demand deposit account product will include features such as check-writing ability, enhanced savings features and optional overdraft protection. 
Paul will provide additional details on our revenue and EPS timing expectations in his presentation.
We continue to steadfastly believe that significant opportunities remain to grow our prepaid business. It is projected that over $112 billion will be loaded onto prepaid cards in 2018 alone, double the amount loaded in 2012. This is the growth profile that led us to acquire NetSpend in 2013 and we plan to continue to be a leader in this space.
And finally, I would like to make a comment regarding our capital allocation plans. As I previously mentioned, we generated record free cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date. This strong cash generation has allowed us to accelerate some of our debt-reduction plans that Paul will also address. This accelerated debt reduction, strong free cash flow generation and our confidence in our momentum provides us the opportunity to reenter the market in the coming quarters with respect to share repurchase.
All in all, it was a very good quarter. All 4 segments grew revenue. Three of our 4 segments expanded margins, notwithstanding severance costs, 10 million new traditional accounts on file were added during the quarter, and we continue to execute on our overall business strategy. 
I now would like to turn the call over to Paul to provide detailed financial information for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Paul?"

And I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the quarter's performance and our year-to-date results. Before I get into the segment results, I want to highlight a few things. First, each of our segments beat our internal projections",1746,"Thank you, Troy. And I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the quarter's performance and our year-to-date results. Before I get into the segment results, I want to highlight a few things. 
First, each of our segments beat our internal projections for the quarter and each is in line with the expectations we laid out at the beginning of the year. 
Second, our TransFirst acquisition integration continues on track, with our expense takeout synergies from the combined businesses meeting our expectations. 
Third, the deleveraging of our balance sheet is ahead of plan, with $175 million of debt paydown during the quarter, bringing our 2-quarter total of deleveraging to $300 million. You may recall, we said we plan to reduce our leverage by $800 million over 8 quarters, so the $300 million through 2 quarters reflects our progress on this target. 
Fourth, as we discussed on our last call, through planned organizational efficiencies, we incurred severance expenses of approximately $9 million during the quarter, which was higher than our original estimate, but we were more aggressive in addressing the expense base that will position us stronger going forward.
And finally, as we discussed on our last call, we absorbed some significant currency headwinds during the quarter that reduced our revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.03. With these items as a backdrop, I will move into our financial results, moving to Slide 6 and our consolidated financial performance. 
Quarterly total revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 62% from 3Q 2015. Quarterly net revenue was $790 million, up 24.1% from last year. GAAP net income was $85.4 million, down 29.2% from last year; and GAAP basic earnings per share was $0.46, also a decrease of 29.2% from last year.
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $269.1 million, an increase of 12.7% from last year; and adjusted EPS was $0.71, a decrease of $0.07 from last year. You may recall, we had a $0.13 adjusted EPS pickup in 3Q 2015 related to taxes, and isolating that impact on a comparative basis yields an increase of a much higher adjusted EPS impact than reported.
Also, the additional $0.03 of severance we experienced in the quarter, coupled with the approximately $0.03 of currency impact, point to an approximate $0.19 of items in the comparative third quarter 2016 versus 2015 adjusted EPS growth picture. 
Our free cash flow for the quarter grew by 37.5% and 36.8% through 9 months, showing that the cash flow generating strength of TSYS continues in the legacy business and is complemented by the strong contribution from TransFirst. This is the second straight quarter of double-digit free cash flow growth, and we expect our free cash flow to be in the $550 million to $570 million range for the year, which is higher than the $510 million to $540 million range we had previously expected.
Now onto our segments' results, starting on Slide 8 with North America. North America business performed slightly better in 3Q than we had planned, increasing revenue by 2.4% on record traditional accounts on file of $444.6 million. Our expectation for revenue growth for this business for 2016 continues to be at or slightly above 5%. This is exactly where we thought the business would be when we entered the year, and the core fundamentals of the business remain intact. 
Our margin for the quarter was 37.7% but included approximately $6 million of severance expense to this segment. And without this expense, segment margin would have been 39.7%.
Now on the International on Slide 9. The 7.4% constant currency growth continues the trend of an improving constant currency revenue growth picture for International. While this added growth has been more related to across-the-board volume gains, with the new record level of accounts on file, we are pleased that our pivot from margin focus to revenue growth is showing signs of success.
While we started the year expecting this segment to be largely flat on a constant currency basis, we now expect constant currency revenue growth for this segment for 2016 to be at or slightly above 5%. We are also seeing some improving prospect pipeline activity in International that, while too early to comment on, could help this growth picture going forward. 
On the margin front, while the 19.5% is in line with our long-term margin goal, it was negatively impacted by severance. And without this, the quarterly margin would have been 21.9%.
And finally, while not included in our International segment results, our CUP Data joint venture continued its historic trend of double-digit growth for the quarter.
Now on to the Merchant segment on Slide 10, where we remain very pleased with the financial results of the newly combined segment, with the integration and synergy plans remaining solidly on track.
While the 112% reported growth is impressive, our core organic growth for our combined direct business continues to be in the high single-digits range, in line with the industry, and our focus in direct continues to be in the integrated channel, which represents approximately 30% of our direct business.
The indirect side had some contraction in the quarter due to some favorable items in 3Q of 2015 that I talked about previously. And without those, indirect growth would have been approximately 2%.
The margin for the segment remains stable at 34.6%. 
Finally, on to NetSpend on Slide 11. The revenue growth at NetSpend of 11.2% for the quarter continued the 4.5-year trend of double-digit revenue growth. We saw an 11% and 18.1% increase in GDV, and a 15.8% year-over-year increase in direct deposit active cards. 
Our margin of 26.3% was relatively consistent with last year's margins, and we continue to expect the business to grow in the low to mid-teens for 2016, which is better than what we had previously expected. 
However, we do expect 4Q revenue growth to be lower than 3Q levels partly due to not growing our marketing investment as significantly in the second half of '16 as we did in the second half of '15.
We also expect, as we have all year, to have slightly expanding margins for the segment for 2016. 
Before I leave NetSpend, I do want to comment on the CFPB's final rules on prepaid that Troy mentioned. While we will be talking more about this in the coming quarters, I do want to provide some baseline information regarding the potential effect to our NetSpend business related to the rules.
First, we expect no negative financial impact to our 2016 expected results related to the rules since they will not become effective until the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Second, we currently estimate that the 2016 total revenues that would have been impacted by the rules would be approximately $80 million to $85 million, with estimated EPS impact of $0.19 to $0.21, including compliance costs. The $80 million to $85 million of impacted revenue consists of overdraft revenue, which was roughly 10% to 12% of NetSpend's revenue and certain other fees that are disallowed by the rule. 
As it relates to 2017 and 2018, Troy mentioned that we have been and will continue to work on our business-expansion strategies. 
Based in part on our current, but not yet complete analysis, of the prepaid rules and the CFPB's underlying intent, we currently estimate with the October 1, 2017 implementation date that our calendar year 2017 total revenues will be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million to $25 million. 
For 2018, we expect total revenues to also be impacted by an additional $20 million to $25 million. In other words, we expect to offset close to half of the negative revenue impact of the rules through our business-expansion strategies.
Regarding EPS, we currently expect a $0.06 to $0.08 negative EPS impact in 2017 and an additional $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact in 2018. In other words, we expect our business-expansion strategies to offset roughly 1/3 of the negative EPS impact of the rules.
I want to emphasize that these are preliminary estimates and are subject to change positively or negatively as we learn more and our strategies progress.
The success of our strategies depend on the rate of adoption of our new products, both by consumers and our distribution partners; the rate of utilization of the various product features by cardholders, market and regulatory dynamics; and a host of other factors that will play out over time. And our estimated impact could vary positively or negatively based on these and other factors. And we will comment more on these in our upcoming calls as we move closer to the October 2017 day. 
Also, I want to highlight that our NetSpend revenue growth for 2015 and 2016 would not change by more than 100 basis points positively or negatively if you excluded the revenue items impacted by the rules showing that the strong double-digit organic revenue growth has been delivered by the core fundamentals of the NetSpend business. 
Finally, as we mentioned in our press release, our guidance remains unchanged for adjusted EPS at $2.78 to $2.85, but we are no longer pointing to the low end of the range as we did on our last call due to the overperformance we have experienced. 
However, we are adjusting our total revenue and net revenue ranges down slightly to reflect the year-to-date currency impact as well as expected currency impact for the fourth quarter.
On a constant currency basis, however, our revenues on both the total revenue and net revenue basis would have remained in our original ranges, and our EPS would have likely exceeded the top end of our EPS range.
To wrap up, the segments are on track with our expectations, and we still expect our margins to slightly expand across all 4 segments. Our TransFirst acquisition, integration and synergy achievement is on track. Our deleveraging plan is ahead of schedule. Our work to define the optimal operating structure for the company yielded greater cost structure efficiencies on a go-forward basis than we had planned.
The uncertainty of the CFPB ruling is behind us and allows us to execute on our strategies in NetSpend on a go-forward basis with clarity as it relates to the final rules.
And our core organic revenue growth targets for our businesses are on track.
In all, the third quarter was an important one on many fronts and we're pleased with the position we are in.
And with that, we will open it up for questions."

We've been very targeted in our history of NetSpend to grow at faster than the growth of the industry, and so I think we would hold off as it relates to what we think specifically as it relates to '17.

So kind of from a revenue standpoint, and we already talked about North America being kind of at or just slightly better than what we had expected, the revenue of all 4 segments is either kind of at or slightly better. But I will say that from a margin standpoint, not only did we have kind of our onetime cost takeout as it relates to the severance but there's been downstream improvements as well on the margin that have kind of been ancillary to that as we've been looking at the cost basis across all of our segments. And so we we've kind of had kind of an additional lift across the segments that don't necessarily 1-for-1 tie to the severance, but we've gotten that benefit as we've been looking at everything from people cost to vendor cost, and as we look at kind of how we're delivering and getting the efficiencies in our business.

Yes, we don't give quarterly guidance by -- we don't give quarterly guidance by the consolidated level, and we certainly don't give it kind at the segment level. I would make a couple of points is, obviously, on the North America side, to get to kind of the 5% number, you see a deceleration of growth between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we're 2.4% reported, and it declines on a sequential-quarter basis down from that 2.4%. So that's kind of one test of the componentry that you might want to kind of start with. As I said earlier, if you back out those kind of 2 items, as it relates to prepaid, and the EMV piece, that 2.4% looks more like the revenue guidance range that Troy talked about. But as it relates to the fourth quarter, where those items are playing a significant impact, we do have sequential quarter deceleration. In the fourth quarter, from International, as we said, we would have just kind of commensurate expected level of currency on a reported basis to reflect the changes that we've seen in the pound, primarily, there. On the Merchant side, there isn't anything I would necessarily call out that's dramatically different between kind of third and fourth quarter. But I did say in my prepared remarks a deceleration sequentially between the third quarter and the fourth quarter for NetSpend due to a variety of factors. But the one I called out was a lower level of increased spending as it relates to marketing. So using those kind of as the tonal guides at the segments, I do think that range that you'd get back to does kind of put us at the overall revised guidance revenue ranges that we provided on the call here today."

As it relates to Brexit, outside of the financial impact of the pound to [indiscernible], as indicated last quarter, it is just a little bit early to tell. But with that said, and talking to Gaylon and Kelley and our leadership team, it does create a lot of uncertainty. And as we've indicated on several occasions, uncertainty can usually mean good things for us because it creates an opportunity for people to look to outsource, to cut costs, to find efficiencies in their operations. And so as our team travels around Europe, particularly in that area, again, they're seeing opportunities. So beyond the financial side of it, it's an uptick for us. Or a potential upside for us."
