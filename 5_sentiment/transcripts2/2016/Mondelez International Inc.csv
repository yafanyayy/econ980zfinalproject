Over the past few years, we've laid out our vision to be the best snacking company in the world.

Over the past few years, we've laid out our vision to be the best snacking company in the world. Our advantaged platform provides us with the potential to be among the fastest-growing consumer companies with substantial margin upside and strong EPS growth while also returning significant cash to our shareholders. 
Since we began this journey 3 years ago in the face of a very challenging environment, we've taken several significant actions to further strengthen our advantaged platform and create sustainable value for shareholders. Our strong results in 2015 reflect our continued progress with the year playing out essentially as we planned with very strong margin expansion in our developed markets and more growth coming from our emerging markets. 
In aggregate, we delivered top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while generating solid organic revenue growth and improved share performance. Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.7%, driven by our pricing actions to recover higher commodity and currency-driven input costs. As Brian will cover in detail shortly, we're deconsolidating our Venezuelan operations, and this will have a material impact on our recent organic net revenue growth as it does to our global category growth. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 230 basis points to 38.9%, fueled by world-class net productivity. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 170 basis points to 13.7% while continuing to build our advantaged platform through increased advertising and consumer support. And finally, adjusted EPS increased 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong operating gains. 
These results reflect the solid execution of our transformation agenda. First, we further focused our portfolio in our advantaged snacks categories. We combined our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the largest pure-play coffee business in the world, and the proposed current transaction should further enhance our position in the global coffee category. We also strengthened our snacks portfolio by acquiring and integrating Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods, a leader into the fast-growing free from snacks in the U.S. 
Second, we continue to aggressively reduce costs. We're now beginning to see the benefits of our supply chain reinvestment reinvention as we upgrade our manufacturing network and install more efficient and more flexible Lines of the Future. 
For the year, we delivered net productivity of more than 3.5% of cost of goods sold or nearly $700 million. That's world-class and another record year. We also reduced overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other tools, and we're beginning to institutionalize our approach to cost management. These savings enabled us to expand margins and provide the necessary fuel to accelerate growth. 
During the year, we stepped up A&C investment behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. This enabled us to continue to strengthen brand equities and backstop some of our pricing actions. 
On the top line, as we made these investments, we've seen improvement in our volume trends, revenue growth and market share performance as the year progressed. We actively monitor the payback of these investments, and we'll continue to proactively adjust our spending based on actual returns. 
On the bottom line, by pricing to recover input cost inflation, we've protected profitability, allowing our net productivity gains to flow through to gross margin. In short, like many smart companies, we're selectively investing through the downturn in emerging markets with continued investments in A&C and route to market so we could benefit disproportionally as these markets recover. 
Finally, we continue to strengthen our financial profile. We generated strong free cash flow, lowered our cost of debt and returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders. So as you can see, we made good progress on many fronts this year. 
I'm indebted to our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication, hard work and commitment to delivering these results especially in the face of such massive change. 
With that as background, let's take a closer look at our 2015 top line results. For the full year, organic net revenue growth was 3.7%. This included a 90 basis point headwind related to our strategic actions to improve revenue mix. As expected, higher prices were the key driver, contributing about 7 percentage points of growth. 
While we fully expected significant pricing this year, the impact of the strengthening dollar on inflation in emerging markets, especially in the second half, forced us to price even more. While this helped protect margins, it also tempered our vol/mix improvement. 
As Brian will discuss in a moment, our organic revenue growth, as I said, adjusted for the deconsolidation of Venezuela, was 1.4%. We're especially pleased that our Power Brands grew more than 5%, well above the rate of the overall company as a result of targeted A&C support. As expected, developed markets, which comprise about 60% of our revenue, declined less than 1% as we focus our efforts on cost reduction in this slower growth environment. 
Emerging markets grew double digits as we took a more balanced approach by reducing costs and stepping up investments in our brands and capabilities. This allowed us to protect our leading share positions in the near term while remaining to capitalize on their long-term potential. 
Turning now to our results by region. While pricing was the main driver of our revenue growth, most of the pricing occurred in Latin America and EEMEA. For the full year, Latin America was up nearly 20%, driven by pricing in response to currency driven inflation especially in Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America was up almost 7%. 
Brazil was up mid-single digits as we priced to recover input cost inflation, driven by the weakening real. Oreo continued its strong momentum behind increased A&C investment. However, growth in the second half slowed to low single digits as the macro environment there deteriorated. Looking ahead, we do not expect conditions to improve in Brazil in the near term, and our forecast reflects this. 
EEMEA was up 6%, driven primarily by pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of each country's currency. Russia grew high teens for the year, driven by strong growth across all categories including our largest one, chocolate. Alpen Gold led the way in chocolate while biscuit growth was fueled by the successful launch of Oreo. However, as in Brazil, volumes fell in the second half as categories slowed in response to weakening economic conditions and price elasticity. 
Asia Pacific was up about 2% with solid growth in China, partially offset by weakness in some other markets. For the full year, China was up high single digits, driven by strong vol/mix in both biscuits and gum. belVita breakfast biscuits got off to a strong start. Oreo Thins continue to perform well behind distribution gains while Stride gum was up high teens. However, growth slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting the overall economy. As a result, we remain cautious in our China forecast for 2016. 
India increased modestly, but we're pleased that chocolate grew solidly in the second half in response to a stepped-up A&C investments. Cadbury Dairy Milk was up high single digits, and Bubbly is off to a strong start. In addition, Asia's growth was tempered by about a point from SKU reductions as it was one of the regions most affected by the loss of some short-term Kraft licenses in late 2014. 
Europe was down about 2%, including a drag of more than a point from strategic actions to improve revenue mix. Vol/mix, while still negative, improved throughout the year, fueled by the benefits of increased A&C and narrowed price gaps. For example, Milka biscuits grew mid-single digits across the region, and U.K. biscuits grew mid-teens, fueled in part by our latest innovation, Ritz Crisp and Thin. 
North America was up about 1% with biscuits growth accelerating in the second half behind increased A&C and innovation, including Oreo Thins and belVita bites. Importantly, vol/mix drove this acceleration. 
Turning now to our categories. For the full year, our snacks categories were up about 5.5% and about the same if you include powdered beverages and cream cheese. As with our revenue, pricing was the key driver as volumes remained challenged. 
Our organic growth was about 1.5 points below our categories. That was largely related to the 90 basis point impact of our strategic actions to improve revenue mix as well as the price elasticity we experienced earlier in the year. Overall, more than 55% of our snacks revenue gained or held share with solid performance across each category. 
Let's take a closer look. The biscuits category was up about 7%, and our revenue was up about 6.5%, with strong performances in China, Brazil and Russia. About 60% of our revenue gained or held share, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S. as well as solid share gains in Brazil. 
The chocolate category increased about 5.5% while our revenue grew only about 1%. This reflected the fact that we were the first to price in most of our markets. But as I said earlier, this was essential to protecting the health of our franchises. 
As expected, our performance improved in the second half as price gaps narrowed and as we increased A&C support in key markets. As a result, market share steadily improved with half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share for the full year. That's up from about 25% in the first half. 
Lastly, the Gum & Candy category increased nearly 2%. Our revenue grew 4%, with both Gum & Candy up low to mid-single-digits. Hall's grew mid-single digits, driven by strong support behind the new Hall's air campaign that's now been rolled out across Europe, North America and select markets in AP and EEMEA. 
Finally, consistent with our plans, we increased A&C support behind high-return marketing initiatives to accelerate revenue growth and drive share. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our organic growth accelerated sequentially as the year progressed while our share performance was strongest in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we delivered this improvement while significantly expanding adjusted operating income margin, a true virtuous cycle. 
In sum, we're pleased with our overall financial performance in 2015 as well as with the excellent progress we made in the transformation. As a result, we believe we're well positioned to deliver strong results again in 2016. 
Let me now turn it over to Brian, who'll provide details on our 2015 margin performance and earnings growth as well as on our 2016 outlook."
739693,322164989,925427,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good morning. Starting with Slide 9, you could see that for the year, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points to about 39%. As Irene mentioned earlier, strong net productivity was the key driver for this improvement. We're now",2128,"Thanks, Irene, and good morning. Starting with Slide 9, you could see that for the year, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points to about 39%. As Irene mentioned earlier, strong net productivity was the key driver for this improvement. 
We're now beginning to see the early benefits from our upgraded supply chain network, including the installation of our highly efficient Lines of the Future. For the year, mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts was a 40 basis point benefit. We also delivered another year of strong adjusted OI margin expansion, up 170 basis points to 13.7% while increasing our growth investments significantly. 
We continue to drive down overhead cost as a percentage of revenue, leveraging ZBB to identify areas of opportunity and capture the savings. These approaches are now the way we work and will continue to benefit -- deliver benefits for us as we move forward. 
For the year, A&C spending was nearly 9% of revenue, up about 60 basis points. Most of the step up was in the second half, including a significant increase in the fourth quarter. 
As Irene discussed earlier, these investments helped us accelerate organic revenue growth and improved our share performance as the year progressed. We're continuing to prioritize our spending to generate the best overall returns. 
Now let's look at margin by region. As you can see on Slide 9 (sic) [ Slide 11 ], developed markets drove most of the margin expansion with North America up 230 basis points and Europe up 190. In both regions, strong net productivity drove significant gross margin expansion, and overheads were down as well. 
In Latin America, OI margin decreased 70 basis points, largely as a result of cycling the benefit from value-added tax related settlements in the prior year while the weakening macro environment also pressured vol/mix. But in EEMEA and AP, OI margin increased 100 and 150 basis points, respectively. In both regions, gross margin expansion and lower overheads more than offset increased A&C. 
Turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was $1.75 for the year, up 19% on a constant currency basis. Strong operating gains of $0.22 drove the increase, and the year-over-year change in mark to market added $0.06. Below the operating income line, lower interest expense and the benefit from the lower share count more than offset the headwind from higher taxes and the dilution from the coffee transaction that closed in July. Including an unfavorable currency translation impacts of $0.33, adjusted EPS was flat. 
As you can see on Slide 13, over the past 3 years, we've returned more than $11 billion of capital to our shareholders, including nearly $3 billion in dividends and more than $8 billion in share repurchases. For 2015, we accelerated this activity by returning $4.6 billion. This included $1 billion in dividends as well as buying back $3.6 billion of stock or roughly 92 million shares at an average price of $39.43 per share. 
As we exited the year, we had about $5.5 billion remaining under the current buyback authorization that goes through 2018. 
Before turning to our 2016 outlook, let me update you on the change we're making in our accounting treatment for Venezuela. As you saw in our press release today, effective at the end of the fourth quarter, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan operations, and we began to account for our investments in Venezuela using the cost method of accounting in our GAAP financial statements. 
As a result, we took a onetime accounting charge of $778 million to our fourth quarter 2015 reported results to remove all assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan operations from our balance sheet. 
On Slide 14, we've summarized the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela on our 2015 results. Excluding Venezuela, organic revenue was up 1.4% versus 3.7% including Venezuela. You should also note that removing Venezuela reduces 2015 total category growth to approximately 4%. 
Our adjusted OI margin excluding Venezuela was 50 basis points lower as our margins there were higher than our total company average. But the impact in our margin improvement was relatively minor. Excluding Venezuela, we expanded margin 150 basis points versus the 170 basis point increase including Venezuela. 
Finally excluding Venezuela reduced our adjusted EPS by $0.10. As we move to our 2016 outlook, please note all of our guidance reflects the 2015 baseline that excludes Venezuela. 
With that, let's move to our outlook. You'll see that our approach to 2016 is consistent with our 2015 playbook. We continue to target underlying organic revenue growth in line with our categories. This means prudently increasing investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms to accelerate revenue growth and gain share while remaining nimble in how and when we deploy A&C resources across key markets to deliver attractive returns. 
It also means maintaining our commitment to invest in sales and route-to-market capabilities, so that we're well positioned to capitalize on the long-term growth potential in emerging markets. We also believe we have further opportunities to improve revenue mix by optimizing trade spending and eliminating less profitable SKUs. 
While we expect this will be a headwind to our reported organic growth, it strengthens the underlying health of our business and is a contributor to our margin improvement. The challenge will be in striking the right balance between competitive position and customer response so that we aren't simply losing revenue and that the impact is net positive in the P&L and in cash flow. 
Our supply chain reinvention initiatives remain on track, and we'll increasingly benefit from the upgraded infrastructure and capabilities that we're putting in place around the world. We'll continue to reduce overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting. 
Incrementally, in 2016, we'll begin to realize savings from implementing global shared services as we eliminate redundant resources and complete process migration. Finally, we'll continue to look to price to recover currency-driven input cost inflation so that the benefits of our cost-reduction initiatives can flow to the bottom line. 
In sum, we remain focused on reducing costs, expanding margins and building our advantaged platform to drive top line growth. Our overall approach to our 2016 outlook aligns well with the long-term advantages of our snacking categories, but it's no secret that 2016 is expected to be another challenging year. 
On Slide 16, you can see various issues that are affecting all categories not just ours. Considering this macro economic outlook and the weakening trends we saw during Q4 in several of these markets, we're estimating that global snacking category growth will slow to 3% to 4% this year. That's down from the price-driven growth of about 4% in 2015, excluding Venezuela. 
While headwinds may affect the near term, we continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects for snacking. Given this backdrop of challenging category dynamics, we expect our 2016 organic revenue growth to be at least 2%. We view this as a prudent top line outlook given the volatility in recent trends that we're seeing. 
This includes 125 basis point headwind from our actions to improve revenue mix by selectively optimizing trade spending and continuing to eliminate less profitable SKUs. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our underlying organic revenue growth to be in line with our forecast of 3% to 4% global category growth. 
Now let's look at our margin outlook. For 2016, we expect to deliver on our previously committed adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%. As we said earlier, the deconsolidation of our higher-margin business in Venezuela creates an approximately 50 basis point headwind. So we're now likely to be at the lower end of that range. However, our year-over-year margin expansion is expected to be in the range of 200 basis points versus 2015. Said another way, we would have expected to be at the high end of the committed range of 15% to 16% had we not deconsolidated Venezuela. 
Overall, we expect the drivers of our margin expansion to be similar to last year. Specifically, we expect strong contribution from our supply chain as we continue to drive world-class net productivity levels. 
We now have approximately 35 state-of-the-art Lines of the Future currently on stream, and we're clearly seeing benefits hitting the P&L as we ramp up production levels. We also expect to continue to reduce overheads as we execute our ZBB program as we adjust our organization model, and we realize the first savings from migrating back-office processes to global shared services. 
In 2015, as we began to transition key processes, in many cases, we maintained duplicate resourcing until we were confident that the migration with successful. As we ramp up shared services and eliminate these redundant transition costs, we expect savings to build not only during 2016 but through 2018. 
We also expect to expand margins by improving our revenue mix. As we execute on this plan, we expect our margins to build as the year progresses. Given the progress we've made and the clarity of our plans and actions beyond 2016, we're confident in our ability to deliver an adjusted OI margin of 17% to 18% in 2018. 
On a pro forma basis, excluding Venezuela across all years, the midpoint of this 2018 target equates to an over 400 basis point increase versus 2015 and an almost 700 basis point improvement versus our 2013 baseline. We expect to deliver this margin target by continuing to focus on 3 things: first, productivity gains from our supply chain. These are funded and in our plan, and we're now expanding and replicating a model that's working. Second, more overhead reductions from lower indirect costs, savings from our global shared services and organizational efficiency. And third, improved revenue mix. 
These improvements will be partially offset by increased A&C support as we further align our share of voice with our share of market. 
Turning to our 2016 EPS outlook. By delivering our organic revenue and margin targets, we expect adjusted EPS to increase in a double-digit rate on a constant currency basis. We expect this increase to be driven primarily by operating gains. 
Below the line, while we expect a lower share count to provide a modest benefit, this will likely be offset by the impact of the coffee divestiture as we had 2 quarters of fully owned coffee business in full year 2015. 
So before we take your questions, I'd like to go over a few other items for financial modeling purposes. First, based on current foreign exchange rates, we estimate a currency headwind of approximately 6 percentage points for revenue and approximately $0.13 for EPS. We expect our adjusted interest expense to be between $650 million and $675 million or about the same as 2015. 
We anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be in the low to mid-20s for 2016, roughly similar to our 2015 rate, and we expect to repurchase about $2 billion of our shares as we deliver on our commitment to spend the remaining coffee transaction proceeds on share buybacks this year. 
In addition, with respect to JDE, at the back of the presentation is an updated framework to help you estimate its earnings. As you know, JDE is a private company so we won't share significant detail on their results or projections. 
JDE management expects performance to be pressured this year as a result of their strategic actions to better position the company for long-term success. As an investor in JDE, we remain very confident in the long-term potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for its shareholders. 
In addition, with our participation in the proposed transaction, we'll be well positioned in the on-demand segment in North America while further enhancing our global footprint. We'll update you on its impact to our financials after the closing. 
So to wrap up, we delivered very strong results in 2015. In 2016, we expect macro conditions, especially in emerging markets, to remain difficult and potentially worsen, which will weigh on category and revenue growth. 
As you may expect, and I think you're hearing from others, we're seeing even more volatility in markets like Brazil, China and Russia even as we start our first quarter. As a result, we'll continue focusing on driving strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We'll improve our top line growth, revenue mix and share performance, and we'll return significant capital to shareholders. We'll talk more about our strong cash flow generation at the upcoming CAGNY conference. We remain very confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda and deliver an adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. With our advancing assets leadership and capabilities, we believe we're one of the few industry players with the potential to deliver strong top and bottom line growth over the long term. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Should the gross margin be the kind of the main driver of the operating margin expansion for the year? I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of how that may play into it and how input cost inflation will fare in 2016 as well."

As we've said, supply chain ramped throughout the year, and we saw the Lines of the Future really generating more benefits in the second half. We said that all year, and that's really how it played out. That will continue. And as you know, I mean, we've now got success in implementing these Lines of the Future in each of the categories, and it's really about taking that model and implementing it in a broader set of assets around the world. So it's something we're very confident in. On indirect costs and shared services, obviously, ZBB and attacking some of the key cost packages was probably the lowest hanging fruit and some of the earliest benefits, but things like shared services and some of the organizational efficiency work is really a '16 driver. So I guess, it's going to continue to be both. As you saw the results in '15, clearly, it was a strong gross margin-driven year, but we also made significant investments in A&C, and that's another dynamic that's going to play out, and that affected SG&A. So it's a little bit of both, and commodity inflation, I think clearly there are some pockets of improved commodity dynamics playing out over the last couple months, but you have to keep in mind that currencies are also a big part of that, and in most cases, they're going the other way and especially in some of the key markets for us. So right now, it's not a big driver for us given that we have to look at both of those together."

I wonder what makes Mondelez special is this global growth opportunity. I think as you talked about, organic net revenue growth. So people are really sort of thinking is the volume growth opportunity that comes from growing units in all these fast-growing emerging markets. If I look at your 4-year growth projection on a volume basis, you're down in what are supposed to be the volume-driving segments of your business other than Eastern Europe. You're down in Latin America. You're down in Asia Pacific. And while the currency's a part of that, macro is part, maybe not your fault, a couple of concerns I have that I'd love your thoughts on. First, when you see -- whenever you first -- whenever you trade-off pricing and volume, that's a lot easier on the margin structure than having to go the other way, and you do eventually need to go the other way on volume growth to sustain any margin expansions. And secondly, do you worry in some of these markets where you look at Asia Pacific or Latin America, where you're working hard doing the right thing to maintain that margin structure that's fair to investors, but you're seeing some unit declines, do you worry that kind of reverses that networking effect and you get less usage and less households using the products over time in a way that may be constrains a 5- and 10-year growth of the company.

I think most importantly, what you need to look to for us is to make sure that we're continuing to make the investments necessary to stay our business for the long term as these emerging markets recover, and so it's a constant monitoring of how we're performing, but we think we're getting the right balance here, but it does have -- it has had a short-term impact. But we're quite encouraged by the results that we're seeing from the back half of the year, and we've reflected that in our guidance for 2016."

I would say we're in the middle of that. I don't know that it's going to see going to be a front half, back half kind of discussion. We're going to continue to work through it, and as we do it, we'll adjust the targets and the plans there, but we're making good progress. I'll just tell you that, I think. On SG&A, really, 3 dynamics I think that are probably inconsistent with how people are thinking about it. One is obviously I'm not sure everybody fully got the A&C step up that we're doing here, and that's obviously showing up in the SG&A. We have obviously incentive comp that flows through there, given the strong performance versus target, that's up year-over-year and then currency. I mean, I think those are the 3 big drivers that would represent and I'd probably tell you 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of where it is in SG&A. So the underlying performance in overheads, the work that we're doing on indirect and the broader organizational activities is generating benefits. We exceeded our internal targets on ZBB benefits this year, and we've actually taken up what we're going to do there for '16 as part of the plan."

I think it's one of the reasons that you see our vol/mix improvement as the year progressed and as we exited the year. So we certainly are doing our best to make sure that as we price, it has as small of an impact on the overall consumer landscape. I'd also say that virtually all of the pricing actions we have taken have been in respect -- in response to comment to industry costs, and so some of our -- of the elasticity impacts have simply been the time it takes to some of our competitors to execute pricing actions. And as we've seen those price gaps narrow in markets like Russia and Brazil, for example, or some of the actions we have taken in markets like the U.K. or Germany, we are seeing our shares improve. So it is -- there's -- we're doing our best to manage the landscape, and it varies market to market.

Over the past few years, we've laid out our vision to be the best snacking company in the world. Our advantaged platform provides us with the potential to be among the fastest-growing consumer companies with substantial margin upside and strong EPS growth while also returning significant cash to our shareholders. 
Since we began this journey 3 years ago in the face of a very challenging environment, we've taken several significant actions to further strengthen our advantaged platform and create sustainable value for shareholders. Our strong results in 2015 reflect our continued progress with the year playing out essentially as we planned, with very strong margin expansion in our developed markets and more growth coming from our emerging markets. 
In aggregate, we delivered top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while generating solid organic revenue growth and improved share performance. Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.7%, driven by our pricing actions to recover higher commodity and currency-driven input costs. As Brian will cover in detail shortly, we're deconsolidating our Venezuela operations, and this will have a material impact on our recent organic net revenue growth as it does to our global category growth. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 230 basis points to 38.9%, fueled by world-class net productivity. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 170 basis points to 13.7% while continuing to build our advantaged platform through increased advertising and consumer support. And finally, adjusted EPS increased 19% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong operating gains. 
These results reflect the solid execution of our transformation agenda. First, we further focused our portfolio in our advantaged snacks categories. We combined our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the largest pure-play coffee business in the world, and the proposed current transaction should further enhance our position in the global coffee category. We also strengthened our snacks portfolio by acquiring and integrating Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods, a leader into the fast-growing free-from snacks in the U.S. 
Second, we continue to aggressively reduce costs. We're now beginning to see the benefits of our supply chain reinvention as we upgrade our manufacturing network and install more efficient and more flexible Lines of the Future. For the year, we delivered net productivity of more than 3.5% of cost of goods sold or nearly $700 million. That's world class and another record year. We also reduced overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other tools, and we're beginning to institutionalize our approach to cost management. These savings enabled us to expand margins and provide the necessary fuel to accelerate growth. 
During the year, we stepped up A&C investment behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. This enabled us to continue to strengthen brand equities and backstop some of our pricing actions. 
On the top line, as we made these investments, we've seen improvement in our volume trends, revenue growth and market share performance as the year progressed. We actively monitor the payback of these investments, and we'll continue to proactively adjust our spending based on actual returns. 
On the bottom line, by pricing to recover input cost inflation, we protected profitability allowing our net productivity gains to flow through to gross margin. In short, like many smart companies, we're selectively investing through the downturn in emerging markets with continued investments in A&C and route to market so we could benefit disproportionately as these markets recover. 
Finally, we continue to strengthen our financial profile. We generated strong free cash flow, lowered our cost of debt and returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders. So as you can see, we made good progress on many fronts this year. I'm indebted to our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication, hard work and commitment to delivering these results especially in the face of such massive change. 
With that as background, let's take a closer look at our 2015 top line results. For the full year, organic net revenue growth was 3.7%. This included a 90 basis point headwind related to our strategic actions to improve revenue mix. As expected, higher prices were the key driver, contributing about 7 percentage points of growth. 
While we fully expected significant pricing this year, the impact of the strengthening dollar on inflation in emerging markets, especially in the second half, forced us to price even more. While this helped protect margins, it also tempered our vol/mix improvement. 
As Brian will discuss in a moment, our organic revenue growth, as I said, adjusted for the deconsolidation of Venezuela, was 1.4%. We're especially pleased that our Power Brands grew more than 5%, well above the rate of the overall company as a result of targeted A&C support. As expected, developed markets, which comprised about 60% of our revenue, declined less than 1% as we focused our efforts on cost reduction in this slower-growth environment. 
Emerging markets grew double digits as we took a more balanced approach by reducing costs and stepping up investment in our brands and capabilities. This allowed us to protect our leading share positions in the near term while remaining ready to capitalize on their long-term potential. 
Turning now to our results by region. While pricing was the main driver of our revenue growth, most of the pricing occurred in Latin America and EEMEA. For the full year, Latin America was up nearly 20%, driven by pricing in response to currency-driven inflation especially in Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America was up almost 7%. 
Brazil was up mid-single digits as we priced to recover input cost inflation, driven by the weakening real. Oreo continued its strong momentum behind increased A&C investment. However, growth in the second half slowed to low single digits as the macro environment there deteriorated. Looking ahead, we do not expect conditions to improve in Brazil in the near term, and our forecast reflects this. 
EEMEA was up 6%, driven primarily by pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of each country's currency. Russia grew high teens for the year, driven by strong growth across all categories including our largest one, chocolate. Alpen Gold led the way in chocolate while biscuit growth was fueled by the successful launch of Oreo. However, as in Brazil, volumes fell in the second half as categories slowed in response to weakening economic conditions and price elasticity. 
Asia Pacific was up about 2% with solid growth in China, partially offset by weakness in some other markets. For the full year, China was up high single digits, driven by strong vol/mix in both biscuits and gum. belVita breakfast biscuits got off to a strong start. Oreo Thins continue to perform well behind distribution gains while Stride gum was up high teens. However, growth slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting the overall economy. As a result, we remain cautious in our China forecast for 2016. 
India increased modestly, but we're pleased that chocolate grew solidly in the second half in response to stepped-up A&C investments. Cadbury Dairy Milk was up high single digits, and Bubbly is off to a strong start. In addition, Asia's growth was tempered by about a point from SKU reductions as it was one of the regions most affected by the loss of some short-term Kraft licenses in late 2014. 
Europe was down about 2%, including a drag of more than a point from strategic actions to improve revenue mix. Vol/mix, while still negative, improved throughout the year fueled by the benefits of increased A&C and narrowed price gaps. For example, Milka biscuits grew mid-single digits across the region, and U.K. biscuits grew mid-teens, fueled in part by our latest innovation, Ritz Crisp & Thin. 
North America was up about 1% with biscuits growth accelerating in the second half behind increased A&C and innovation, including Oreo Thins and belVita bites. Importantly, vol/mix drove this acceleration. 
Turning now to our categories. For the full year, our snacks categories were up about 5.5% and about the same if you include powdered beverages and cream cheese. As with our revenue, pricing was the key driver as volumes remained challenged. 
Our organic growth was about 1.5 points below our categories. That was largely related to the 90 basis point impact of our strategic actions to improve revenue mix as well as the price elasticity we experienced earlier in the year. Overall, more than 55% of our snacks revenue gained or held share with solid performance across each category. 
Let's take a closer look. The biscuits category was up about 7%, and our revenue was up about 6.5%, with strong performances in China, Brazil and Russia. About 60% of our revenue gained or held share, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S. as well as solid share gains in Brazil. 
The chocolate category increased about 5.5% while our revenue grew only about 1%. This reflected the fact that we were the first to price in most of our markets. But as I said earlier, this was essential to protecting the health of our franchises. 
As expected, our performance improved in the second half as price gaps narrowed and as we increased A&C support in key markets. As a result, market share steadily improved with half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share for the full year. That's up from about 25% in the first half. 
Lastly, the Gum & Candy category increased nearly 2%. Our revenue grew 4%, with both Gum & Candy up low to mid-single-digits. Halls grew mid-single digits, driven by strong support behind the new Halls' air campaign that's now been rolled out across Europe, North America and select markets in AP and EEMEA. 
Finally, consistent with our plans, we increased A&C support behind high-return marketing initiatives to accelerate revenue growth and drive share. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our organic growth accelerated sequentially as the year progressed while our share performance was strongest in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we delivered this improvement while significantly expanding adjusted operating income margin, a true virtuous cycle. 
In sum, we're pleased with our overall financial performance in 2015 as well as with the excellent progress we made in the transformation. As a result, we believe we're well positioned to deliver strong results again in 2016. 
Let me now turn it over to Brian, who'll provide details on our 2015 margin performance and earnings growth as well as on our 2016 outlook."
739693,322164989,925648,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good morning. Starting with Slide 9, you could see that for the year, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points to about 39%.

Starting with Slide 9, you could see that for the year, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points to about 39%. As Irene mentioned earlier, strong net productivity was the key driver for this improvement. We're now beginning to see the early benefits from our upgraded supply chain network, including the installation of our highly efficient Lines of the Future. 
For the year, mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts was a 40 basis point benefit. We also delivered another year of strong adjusted OI margin expansion, up 170 basis points to 13.7% while increasing our growth investments significantly. 
We continue to drive down overhead cost as a percentage of revenue, leveraging ZBB to identify areas of opportunity and capture the savings. These approaches are now the way we work and will continue to benefit -- deliver benefits for us as we move forward. 
For the year, A&C spending was nearly 9% of revenue, up about 60 basis points. Most of the step-up was in the second half, including a significant increase in the fourth quarter. As Irene discussed earlier, these investments helped us accelerate organic revenue growth and improve our share performance as the year progressed. We're continuing to prioritize our spending to generate the best overall returns. 
Now let's look at margin by region. As you can see on Slide 9 (sic) [ Slide 11 ], developed markets drove most of the margin expansion with North America up 230 basis points and Europe up 190. In both regions, strong net productivity drove significant gross margin expansion, and overheads were down as well. 
In Latin America, OI margin decreased 70 basis points, largely as a result of cycling the benefit from value-added tax-related settlements in the prior year while the weakening macro environment also pressured vol/mix. But in EEMEA and AP, OI margin increased 100 and 150 basis points, respectively. In both regions, gross margin expansion and lower overheads more than offset increased A&C. 
Turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was $1.75 for the year, up 19% on a constant currency basis. Strong operating gains of $0.22 drove the increase. And the year-over-year change in mark to market added $0.06. Below the operating income line, lower interest expense and the benefit from the lower share count more than offset the headwind from higher taxes and the dilution from the coffee transaction that closed in July. Including an unfavorable currency translation impact of $0.33, adjusted EPS was flat. 
As you can see on Slide 13, over the past 3 years, we've returned more than $11 billion of capital to our shareholders, including nearly $3 billion in dividends and more than $8 billion in share repurchases. For 2015, we accelerated this activity by returning $4.6 billion. This included $1 billion in dividends as well as buying back $3.6 billion of stock or roughly 92 million shares at an average price of $39.43 per share. As we exited the year, we had about $5.5 billion remaining under the current buyback authorization that goes through 2018. 
Before turning to our 2016 outlook, let me update you on the change we're making in our accounting treatment for Venezuela. As you saw in our press release today, effective at the end of the fourth quarter, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan operations. And we began to account for our investments in Venezuela using the cost method of accounting in our GAAP financial statements. 
As a result, we took a onetime accounting charge of $778 million to our fourth quarter 2015 reported results to remove all assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan operations from our balance sheet. 
On Slide 14, we've summarized the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela on our 2015 results. Excluding Venezuela, organic revenue was up 1.4% versus 3.7%, including Venezuela. You should also note that removing Venezuela reduces 2015 total category growth to approximately 4%. Our adjusted OI margin, excluding Venezuela, was 50 basis points lower as our margins there were higher than our total company average. But the impact on our margin improvement was relatively minor. Excluding Venezuela, we expanded margin 150 basis points versus the 170 basis point increase including Venezuela. 
Finally excluding Venezuela reduced our adjusted EPS by $0.10. As we move to our 2016 outlook, please note all of our guidance reflects the 2015 baseline that excludes Venezuela. 
With that, let's move to our outlook. You'll see that our approach to 2016 is consistent with our 2015 playbook. We continue to target underlying organic revenue growth in line with our categories. This means prudently increasing investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms to accelerate revenue growth and gain share while remaining nimble in how and when we deploy A&C resources across key markets to deliver attractive returns. 
It also means maintaining our commitment to invest in sales and route-to-market capabilities, so that we're well positioned to capitalize on the long-term growth potential in emerging markets. We also believe we have further opportunities to improve revenue mix by optimizing trade spending and eliminating less profitable SKUs. While we expect this will be a headwind to our reported organic growth, it strengthens the underlying health of our business and is a contributor to our margin improvement. The challenge will be in striking the right balance between competitive position and customer response so that we aren't simply losing revenue and that the impact is net positive on the P&L and in cash flow. 
Our supply chain reinvention initiatives remain on track. And we'll increasingly benefit from the upgraded infrastructure and capabilities that we're putting in place around the world. We'll continue to reduce overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting.  Incrementally, in 2016, we'll begin to realize savings from implementing global shared services as we eliminate redundant resources and complete process migration work. Finally, we'll continue to look to price to recover currency-driven input cost inflation so that the benefits of our cost-reduction initiatives can flow to the bottom line. 
In sum, we remain focused on reducing costs, expanding margins and building our advantaged platform to drive top line growth. Our overall approach to our 2016 outlook aligns well with the long-term advantages of our snacking categories, but it's no secret that 2016 is expected to be another challenging year. 
On Slide 16, you can see various issues that are affecting all categories, not just ours. Considering this macro economic outlook and the weakening trends we saw during Q4 in several of these markets, we're estimating that global snacking category growth will slow to 3% to 4% this year. That's down from the price-driven growth of about 4% in 2015, excluding Venezuela. 
While headwinds may affect the near term, we continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects for snacking. Given this backdrop of challenging category dynamics, we expect our 2016 organic revenue growth to be at least 2%. We view this as a prudent top line outlook given the volatility in recent trends that we're seeing. This includes 125 basis point headwind from our actions to improve revenue mix by selectively optimizing trade spending and continuing to eliminate less profitable SKUs. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our underlying organic revenue growth to be in line with our forecast of 3% to 4% global category growth. 
Now let's look at our margin outlook. For 2016, we expect to deliver on our previously committed adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%. As we said earlier, the deconsolidation of our higher-margin business in Venezuela creates an approximately 50 basis point headwind. So we're now likely to be at the lower end of that range. However, our year-over-year margin expansion is expected to be in the range of 200 basis points versus 2015. Said another way, we would have expected to be at the high end of the committed range of 15% to 16% had we not deconsolidated Venezuela. 
Overall, we expect the drivers of our margin expansion to be similar to last year. Specifically, we expect strong contribution from our supply chain as we continue to drive world-class net productivity levels. 
We now have approximately 35 state-of-the-art Lines of the Future currently on stream. And we're clearly seeing benefits hitting the P&L as we ramp up production levels. We also expect to continue to reduce overheads as we execute our ZBB program as we adjust our organization model, and we realize the first savings from migrating back-office processes to global shared services. 
In 2015, as we began to transition key processes, in many cases, we maintained duplicate resourcing until we were confident that the migration was successful. As we ramp up shared services and eliminate these redundant transition costs, we expect savings to build not only during 2016 but through 2018. 
We also expect to expand margins by improving our revenue mix. As we execute on this plan, we expect our margins to build as the year progresses. Given the progress we've made and the clarity of our plans and actions beyond 2016, we're confident in our ability to deliver an adjusted OI margin of 17% to 18% in 2018. 
On a pro forma basis, excluding Venezuela across all years, the midpoint of this 2018 target equates to an over 400 basis point increase versus 2015 and an almost 700 basis point improvement versus our 2013 baseline. We expect to deliver this margin target by continuing to focus on 3 things: first, productivity gains from our supply chain. These are funded and in our plan. And we're now expanding and replicating a model that's working. Second, more overhead reductions from lower indirect costs, savings from our global shared services and organizational efficiency. And third, improved revenue mix. These improvements will be partially offset by increased A&C support as we further align our share of voice with our share of market. 
Turning to our 2016 EPS outlook. By delivering our organic revenue and margin targets, we expect adjusted EPS to increase at a double-digit rate on a constant currency basis. We expect this increase to be driven primarily by operating gains. Below the line, while we expect a lower share count to provide a modest benefit, this will likely be offset by the impact of the coffee divestiture as we had 2 quarters of fully owned coffee business in full year 2015. 
So before we take your questions, I'd like to go over a few other items for financial modeling purposes. First, based on current foreign exchange rates, we estimate a currency headwind of approximately 6 percentage points for revenue and approximately $0.13 for EPS. We expect our adjusted interest expense to be between $650 million and $675 million or about the same as 2015. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be in the low to mid-20s for 2016, roughly similar to our 2015 rate. And we expect to repurchase about $2 billion of our shares as we deliver on our commitment to spend the remaining coffee transaction proceeds on share buybacks this year. 
In addition, with respect to JDE, at the back of the presentation is an updated framework to help you estimate its earnings. As you know, JDE is a private company so we won't share significant detail on their results or projections. 
JDE management expects performance to be pressured this year as a result of their strategic actions to better position the company for long-term success. As an investor in JDE, we remain very confident in the long-term potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for its shareholders. In addition, with our participation in the proposed transaction, we'll be well positioned in the on-demand segment in North America while further enhancing our global footprint. We'll update you on its impact to our financials after the closing. 
So to wrap up, we delivered very strong results in 2015. In 2016, we expect macro conditions, especially in emerging markets, to remain difficult and potentially worsen, which will weigh on category and revenue growth. 
As you might expect, and I think you're hearing from others, we're seeing even more volatility in markets like Brazil, China and Russia even as we start our first quarter. As a result, we'll continue focusing on driving strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We'll improve our top line growth, revenue mix and share performance, and we'll return significant capital to shareholders. We'll talk more about our strong cash flow generation at the upcoming CAGNY conference. We remain very confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda and deliver an adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. With our advantage, assets, leadership and capabilities, we believe we're one of the few industry players with the potential to deliver strong top and bottom line growth over the long term. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Should the gross margin be the kind of the main driver of the operating margin expansion for the year? I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how that may play into it. And how input cost inflation will fare in 2016 as well?"

As we've said, supply chain ramped throughout the year, and we saw the Lines of the Future really generating more benefits in the second half. We said that all year, and that's really how it played out. That will continue. And as you know, I mean, we've now got success in implementing these Lines of the Future in each of the categories, and it's really about taking that model and implementing it in a broader set of assets around the world. So it's something we're very confident in. On indirect costs and shared services, obviously, ZBB and attacking some of the key cost packages was probably the lowest-hanging fruit and some of the earliest benefits. But things like shared services and some of the organizational efficiency work is really a '16 driver. So I guess, it's going to continue to be both. As you saw the results in '15, clearly, it was a strong gross margin-driven year, but we also made significant investments in A&C. And that's another dynamic that's going to play out and that affected SG&A. So it's a little bit of both. And commodity inflation -- look, I think, clearly, there's some pockets of improved commodity dynamics playing out over the last couple of months. But you have to keep in mind that currencies are also a big part of that. And in most cases, they're going the other way, especially in some of the key markets for us. So right now, it's not a big driver for us given that we have to look at both of those together."

I wonder what makes Mondelez special. Is this global growth opportunity? I think as you talked about, organic net revenue growth -- so people are really sort of thinking is the volume growth opportunity that comes from growing units in all these fast-growing emerging markets. If I look at your 4-year growth projection on a volume basis, you're down in what are supposed to be the volume-driving segments of your business other than Eastern Europe. You're down in Latin America. You're down in Asia Pacific. And while the currency's a part of that, macro's part of it, maybe not your fault, a couple of concerns I have that I'd love your thoughts on. First, when you see -- whenever you first -- whenever you trade-off pricing and volume, that's a lot easier on the margin structure than having to go the other way, and you do eventually need to go the other way on volume growth to sustain any margin expansions. And secondly, do you worry in some of these markets where you look at Asia Pacific or Latin America where you're working hard doing the right thing to maintain that margin structure that's fair to investors, but you're seeing some unit declines? Do you worry that kind of reverses that networking effect and you get less usage and less household using the products over time in a way that maybe constrains the 5- and 10-year growth of the company. So how are you thinking about that balance?"

I would remind you that our 2015 vol/mix was down about 3 points. That's about 1 point from Venezuela, about 1 point from the strategic actions we took and about 1 point of elasticity, which was mostly in the first half. As we started to see -- to make the investments, as we locked in our margins and started to make the investments in selected markets in the back half, we saw a very strong improvements in, not only in the vol/mix trend, but also in our individual franchise performance. As we look to 2016, our intent again is to make sure that we're continuing to get a positive benefit. We're not going to give you specific guidance for the split between pricing and vol/mix. But as I mentioned, we are expecting pricing to be less of an impact, but it will continue to be pressured as we see inflation in these emerging markets.

We're going to continue to work through it. And as we do it, we'll adjust the targets and the plans there. But we're making good progress. I'll just tell you that, I think. On SG&A, really 3 dynamics I think that are probably inconsistent with how people are thinking about it. One is obviously, I'm not sure everybody fully got the A&C step-up that we're doing here. That's obviously showing up in the SG&A. We have obviously incentive comp that flows through there, given the strong performance versus targets, that's up year-over-year. And then currency, I mean I think those are the 3 big drivers that would represent and I'd probably tell you 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of where it is in SG&A. So the underlying performance in overheads, the work that we're doing on indirects and the broader organizational activities is generating benefits.

So we certainly are doing our best to make sure that as we price, it has as small impact on the overall consumer landscape. I'd also say that virtually all of the pricing actions we have taken have been in respect -- in response to comment to industry costs. And so some of our -- of the elasticity impacts have simply been the time it takes to some of our competitors to execute pricing actions. And as we've seen those price gaps narrow in markets like Russia and Brazil, for example, or some of the actions we have taken in markets like the U.K. or Germany, we are seeing our shares improve. So it is -- there's -- we're doing our best to manage the landscape, and it varies market to market.

Over the past few years, we've laid out our vision to be the best snacking company in the world. Our advantaged platform provides us with the potential to be among the fastest-growing consumer companies, with substantial margin upside and strong EPS growth, while also returning significant cash to our shareholders. 
Since we began this journey 3 years ago in the face of a very challenging environment, we've taken several significant actions to further strengthen our advantaged platform and create sustainable value for shareholders. Our strong results in 2015 reflect our continued progress, with the year playing out essentially as we planned, with very strong margin expansion in our developed markets and more growth coming from our emerging markets. 
In aggregate, we delivered top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while generating solid organic revenue growth and improved share performance. Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.7%, driven by our pricing actions to recover higher commodity and currency-driven input costs. As Brian will cover in detail shortly, we're deconsolidating our Venezuela operations, and this will have a material impact on our recent organic net revenue growth, as it does to our global category growth. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 230 basis points to 38.9%, fueled by world-class net productivity. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 170 basis points to 13.7% while continuing to build our advantaged platform through increased advertising and consumer support. And finally, adjusted EPS increased 19% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong operating gains. 
These results reflect the solid execution of our transformation agenda. First, we further focused our portfolio in our advantaged snacks categories. We combined our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the largest pure-play coffee business in the world, and the proposed current transaction should further enhance our position in the global coffee category. We also strengthened our snacks portfolio by acquiring and integrating Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods, a leader in the fast-growing free-from snacks in the U.S. 
Second, we continue to aggressively reduce costs. We're now beginning to see the benefits of our supply chain reinvention as we upgrade our manufacturing network and install more efficient and more flexible Lines of the Future. For the year, we delivered net productivity of more than 3.5% of cost of goods sold or nearly $700 million. That's world-class and another record year. We also reduced overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other tools, and we're beginning to institutionalize our approach to cost management. These savings enabled us to expand margins and provide the necessary fuel to accelerate growth. 
During the year, we stepped up A&C investment behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. This enabled us to continue to strengthen brand equities and backstop some of our pricing actions. 
On the top line, as we made these investments, we've seen improvement in our volume trends, revenue growth and market share performance as the year progressed. We actively monitor the payback of these investments, and we'll continue to proactively adjust our spending based on actual returns. 
On the bottom line, by pricing to recover input cost inflation, we've protected profitability, allowing our net productivity gains to flow through to gross margin. In short, like many smart companies, we're selectively investing through the downturn in emerging markets with continued investments in A&C and route to market so we could benefit disproportionately as these markets recover. 
Finally, we continue to strengthen our financial profile. We generated strong free cash flow, lowered our cost of debt and returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders. So as you can see, we made good progress on many fronts this year. I'm indebted to our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication, hard work and commitment to delivering these results, especially in the face of such massive change. 
With that as background, let's take a closer look at our 2015 top line results. For the full year, organic net revenue growth was 3.7%. This included a 90 basis point headwind related to our strategic actions to improve revenue mix. As expected, higher prices were the key driver, contributing about 7 percentage points of growth. 
While we fully expected significant pricing this year, the impact of the strengthening dollar on inflation in emerging markets, especially in the second half, forced us to price even more. While this helped protect margins, it also tempered our vol/mix improvement. 
As Brian will discuss in a moment, our organic revenue growth, as I said, adjusted for the deconsolidation of Venezuela, was 1.4%. We're especially pleased that our Power Brands grew more than 5%, well above the rate of the overall company, as a result of targeted A&C support. As expected, developed markets, which comprise about 60% of our revenue, declined less than 1% as we focused our efforts on cost reduction in this slower-growth environment. 
Emerging markets grew double digits as we took a more balanced approach by reducing costs and stepping up investment in our brands and capabilities. This allowed us to protect our leading share positions in the near term while remaining ready to capitalize on their long-term potential. 
Turning now to our results by region. While pricing was the main driver of our revenue growth, most of the pricing occurred in Latin America and EEMEA. For the full year, Latin America was up nearly 20%, driven by pricing in response to currency-driven inflation, especially in Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America was up almost 7%. 
Brazil was up mid-single digits as we priced to recover input cost inflation, driven by the weakening real. Oreo continued its strong momentum behind increased A&C investment. However, growth in the second half slowed to low single digits as the macro environment there deteriorated. Looking ahead, we do not expect conditions to improve in Brazil in the near term, and our forecast reflects this. 
EEMEA was up 6%, driven primarily by pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of each country's currency. Russia grew high teens for the year, driven by strong growth across all categories, including our largest one, chocolate. Alpen Gold led the way in chocolate, while biscuit growth was fueled by the successful launch of Oreo. However, as in Brazil, volumes fell in the second half as categories slowed in response to weakening economic conditions and price elasticity. 
Asia Pacific was up about 2% with solid growth in China, partially offset by weakness in some other markets. For the full year, China was up high single digits, driven by strong vol/mix in both biscuits and gum. belVita breakfast biscuits got off to a strong start. Oreo Thins continue to perform well behind distribution gains while Stride gum was up high teens. However, growth slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting the overall economy. As a result, we remain cautious in our China forecast for 2016. 
India increased modestly, but we're pleased that chocolate grew solidly in the second half in response to stepped-up A&C investments. Cadbury Dairy Milk was up high single digits, and Bubbly is off to a strong start. In addition, Asia's growth was tempered by about a point from SKU reductions, as it was one of the regions most affected by the loss of some short-term Kraft licenses in late 2014. 
Europe was down about 2%, including a drag of more than a point from strategic actions to improve revenue mix. Vol/mix, while still negative, improved throughout the year, fueled by the benefits of increased A&C and narrowed price gaps. For example, Milka biscuits grew mid-single digits across the region, and U.K. biscuits grew mid-teens, fueled in part by our latest innovation, Ritz Crisp & Thin. 
North America was up about 1%, with biscuits growth accelerating in the second half behind increased A&C and innovation, including Oreo Thins and belVita Bites. Importantly, vol/mix drove this acceleration. 
Turning now to our categories. For the full year, our snacks categories were up about 5.5% and about the same if you include Powdered Beverages and Cream Cheese. As with our revenue, pricing was the key driver as volumes remained challenged. 
Our organic growth was about 1.5 points below our categories. That was largely related to the 90 basis point impact of our strategic actions to improve revenue mix as well as the price elasticity we experienced earlier in the year. Overall, more than 55% of our snacks revenue gained or held share, with solid performance across each category. 
Let's take a closer look. The biscuits category was up about 7%, and our revenue was up about 6.5%, with strong performances in China, Brazil and Russia. About 60% of our revenue gained or held share, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S. as well as solid share gains in Brazil. 
The chocolate category increased about 5.5% while our revenue grew only about 1%. This reflected the fact that we were the first to price in most of our markets. But as I said earlier, this was essential to protecting the health of our franchises. 
As expected, our performance improved in the second half as price gaps narrowed and as we increased A&C support in key markets. As a result, market share steadily improved, with half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share for the full year. That's up from about 25% in the first half. 
Lastly, the Gum & Candy category increased nearly 2%. Our revenue grew 4%, with both Gum & Candy up low to mid-single-digits. Halls grew mid-single digits, driven by strong support behind the new Halls Air campaign that's now been rolled out across Europe, North America and select markets in AP and EEMEA. 
Finally, consistent with our plans, we increased A&C support behind high-return marketing initiatives to accelerate revenue growth and drive share. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our organic growth accelerated sequentially as the year progressed, while our share performance was strongest in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we delivered this improvement while significantly expanding adjusted operating income margin, a true virtuous cycle. 
In sum, we're pleased with our overall financial performance in 2015 as well as with the excellent progress we made in the transformation. As a result, we believe we're well positioned to deliver strong results again in 2016. 
Let me now turn it over to Brian, who'll provide details on our 2015 margin performance and earnings growth as well as on our 2016 outlook."
739693,322164989,925761,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good morning. Starting with Slide 9, you could see that for the year, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points to about 39%.

Starting with Slide 9, you could see that for the year, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points to about 39%. As Irene mentioned earlier, strong net productivity was the key driver for this improvement. We're now beginning to see the early benefits from our upgraded supply chain network, including the installation of our highly efficient Lines of the Future. 
For the year, mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts was a 40 basis point benefit. We also delivered another year of strong adjusted OI margin expansion, up 170 basis points to 13.7%, while increasing our growth investments significantly. 
We continue to drive down overhead cost as a percentage of revenue, leveraging ZBB to identify areas of opportunity and capture the savings. These approaches are now the way we work and will continue to benefit -- deliver benefits for us as we move forward. 
For the year, A&C spending was nearly 9% of revenue, up about 60 basis points. Most of the step-up was in the second half, including a significant increase in the fourth quarter. As Irene discussed earlier, these investments helped us accelerate organic revenue growth and improved our share performance as the year progressed. We're continuing to prioritize our spending to generate the best overall returns. 
Now let's look at margin by region. As you can see on Slide 9 (sic) [ Slide 11 ], developed markets drove most of the margin expansion, with North America up 230 basis points and Europe up 190. In both regions, strong net productivity drove significant gross margin expansion, and overheads were down as well. 
In Latin America, OI margin decreased 70 basis points, largely as a result of cycling the benefit from value-added tax-related settlements in the prior year, while the weakening macro environment also pressured vol/mix. But in EEMEA and AP, OI margin increased 100 and 150 basis points, respectively. In both regions, gross margin expansion and lower overheads more than offset increased A&C. 
Turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was $1.75 for the year, up 19% on a constant currency basis. Strong operating gains of $0.22 drove the increase. And the year-over-year change in mark-to-market added $0.06. Below the operating income line, lower interest expense and the benefit from the lower share count more than offset the headwind from higher taxes and dilution from the coffee transaction that closed in July. Including an unfavorable currency translation impact of $0.33, adjusted EPS was flat. 
As you can see on Slide 13, over the past 3 years, we've returned more than $11 billion of capital to our shareholders, including nearly $3 billion in dividends and more than $8 billion in share repurchases. For 2015, we accelerated this activity by returning $4.6 billion. This included $1 billion in dividends as well as buying back $3.6 billion of stock or roughly 92 million shares at an average price of $39.43 per share. As we exited the year, we had about $5.5 billion remaining under the current buyback authorization that goes through 2018. 
Before turning to our 2016 outlook, let me update you on the change we're making in our accounting treatment for Venezuela. As you saw in our press release today, effective at the end of the fourth quarter, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan operations. And we began to account for our investments in Venezuela using the cost method of accounting in our GAAP financial statements. 
As a result, we took a onetime accounting charge of $778 million to our fourth quarter 2015 reported results to remove all assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan operations from our balance sheet. 
On Slide 14, we've summarized the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela on our 2015 results. Excluding Venezuela, organic revenue was up 1.4% versus 3.7% including Venezuela. You should also note that removing Venezuela reduces 2015 total category growth to approximately 4%. Our adjusted OI margin, excluding Venezuela, was 50 basis points lower as our margins there were higher than our total company average. But the impact on our margin improvement was relatively minor. Excluding Venezuela, we expanded margin 150 basis points versus the 170 basis point increase including Venezuela. 
Finally excluding Venezuela reduced our adjusted EPS by $0.10. As we move to our 2016 outlook, please note all of our guidance reflects the 2015 baseline that excludes Venezuela. 
With that, let's move to our outlook. You'll see that our approach to 2016 is consistent with our 2015 playbook. We continue to target underlying organic revenue growth in line with our categories. This means prudently increasing investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms to accelerate revenue growth and gain share while remaining nimble in how and when we deploy A&C resources across key markets to deliver attractive returns. 
It also means maintaining our commitment to invest in sales and route-to-market capabilities, so that we're well positioned to capitalize on the long-term growth potential in emerging markets. We also believe we have further opportunities to improve revenue mix by optimizing trade spending and eliminating less profitable SKUs. While we expect this will be a headwind to our reported organic growth, it strengthens the underlying health of our business and is a contributor to our margin improvement. The challenge will be in striking the right balance between competitive position and customer response so that we aren't simply losing revenue and that the impact is net positive on the P&L and in cash flow. 
Our supply chain reinvention initiatives remain on track. And we'll increasingly benefit from the upgraded infrastructure and capabilities that we're putting in place around the world. We'll continue to reduce overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting.  Incrementally, in 2016, we'll begin to realize savings from implementing global shared services as we eliminate redundant resources and complete process migration work. Finally, we'll continue to look to price to recover currency-driven input cost inflation so that the benefits of our cost-reduction initiatives can flow to the bottom line. 
In sum, we remain focused on reducing costs, expanding margins and building our advantaged platform to drive top line growth. Our overall approach to our 2016 outlook aligns well with the long-term advantages of our snacking categories, but it's no secret that 2016 is expected to be another challenging year. 
On Slide 16, you can see various issues that are affecting all categories, not just ours. Considering this macro economic outlook and the weakening trends we saw during Q4 in several of these markets, we're estimating that global snacking category growth will slow to 3% to 4% this year. That's down from the price-driven growth of about 4% in 2015, excluding Venezuela. 
While headwinds may affect the near term, we continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects for snacking. Given this backdrop of challenging category dynamics, we expect our 2016 organic revenue growth to be at least 2%. We view this as a prudent top line outlook given the volatility and recent trends that we're seeing. This includes a 125 basis point headwind from our actions to improve revenue mix by selectively optimizing trade spending and continuing to eliminate less profitable SKUs. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our underlying organic revenue growth to be in line with our forecast of 3% to 4% global category growth. 
Now let's look at our margin outlook. For 2016, we expect to deliver on our previously committed adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%. As we said earlier, the deconsolidation of our higher-margin business in Venezuela creates an approximately 50 basis point headwind. So we're now likely to be at the lower end of that range. However, our year-over-year margin expansion is expected to be in the range of 200 basis points versus 2015. Said another way, we would have expected to be at the high end of the committed range of 15% to 16% had we not deconsolidated Venezuela. 
Overall, we expect the drivers of our margin expansion to be similar to last year. Specifically, we expect strong contribution from our supply chain as we continue to drive world-class net productivity levels. 
We now have approximately 35 state-of-the-art Lines of the Future currently on stream. And we're clearly seeing benefits hitting the P&L as we ramp up production levels. We also expect to continue to reduce overheads as we execute our ZBB program, as we adjust our organization model and we realize the first savings from migrating back-office processes to global shared services. 
In 2015, as we began to transition key processes, in many cases, we maintained duplicate resourcing until we were confident that the migration was successful. As we ramp up shared services and eliminate these redundant transition costs, we expect savings to build, not only during 2016 but through 2018. 
We also expect to expand margins by improving our revenue mix. As we execute on this plan, we expect our margins to build as the year progresses. Given the progress we've made and the clarity of our plans and actions beyond 2016, we're confident in our ability to deliver an adjusted OI margin of 17% to 18% in 2018. 
On a pro forma basis, excluding Venezuela across all years, the midpoint of this 2018 target equates to an over 400 basis point increase versus 2015 and an almost 700 basis point improvement versus our 2013 baseline. We expect to deliver this margin target by continuing to focus on 3 things: first, productivity gains from our supply chain. These are funded and in our plan. And we're now expanding and replicating a model that's working. Second, more overhead reductions from lower indirect costs, savings from our global shared services and organizational efficiency. And third, improved revenue mix. These improvements will be partially offset by increased A&C support as we further align our share of voice with our share of market. 
Turning to our 2016 EPS outlook. By delivering our organic revenue and margin targets, we expect adjusted EPS to increase at a double-digit rate on a constant currency basis. We expect this increase to be driven primarily by operating gains. Below the line, while we expect a lower share count to provide a modest benefit, this will likely be offset by the impact of the coffee divestiture, as we had 2 quarters of fully owned coffee business in full year 2015. 
So before we take your questions, I'd like to go over a few other items for financial modeling purposes. First, based on current foreign exchange rates, we estimate a currency headwind of approximately 6 percentage points for revenue and approximately $0.13 for EPS. We expect our adjusted interest expense to be between $650 million and $675 million or about the same as 2015. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be in the low to mid-20s for 2016, roughly similar to our 2015 rate. And we expect to repurchase about $2 billion of our shares as we deliver on our commitment to spend the remaining coffee transaction proceeds on share buybacks this year. 
In addition, with respect to JDE, at the back of the presentation is an updated framework to help you estimate its earnings. As you know, JDE is a private company so we won't share significant detail on their results or projections. 
JDE management expects performance to be pressured this year as a result of their strategic actions to better position the company for long-term success. As an investor in JDE, we remain very confident in the long-term potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for its shareholders. In addition, with our participation in the proposed Keurig transaction, we'll be well positioned in the on-demand segment in North America while further enhancing our global footprint. We'll update you on its impact to our financials after the closing. 
So to wrap up, we delivered very strong results in 2015. In 2016, we expect macro conditions, especially in emerging markets, to remain difficult and potentially worsen, which will weigh on category and revenue growth. 
As you might expect, and I think you're hearing from others, we're seeing even more volatility in markets like Brazil, China and Russia, even as we start our first quarter. As a result, we'll continue focusing on driving strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We'll improve our top line growth, revenue mix and share performance, and we'll return significant capital to shareholders. We'll talk more about our strong cash flow generation at the upcoming CAGNY conference. We remain very confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda and deliver an adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. With our advantaged assets, leadership and capabilities, we believe we're one of the few industry players with the potential to deliver strong top and bottom line growth over the long term. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

As we've said, supply chain ramped throughout the year, and we saw the Lines of the Future really generating more benefits in the second half. We said that all year, and that's really how it played out. That will continue. And as you know, I mean, we've now got success in implementing these Lines of the Future in each of the categories, and it's really about taking that model and implementing it in a broader set of assets around the world. So it's something we're very confident in. On indirect costs and shared services, obviously, ZBB and attacking some of the key cost packages was probably the lowest-hanging fruit and some of the earliest benefits. But things like shared services and some of the organizational efficiency work is really a '16 driver. So I guess it's going to continue to be both. As you saw the results in '15, clearly, it was a strong gross margin-driven year, but we also made significant investments in A&C. And that's another dynamic that's going to play out and that affected SG&A. So it's a little bit of both. And commodity inflation -- look, I think, clearly, there's some pockets of improved commodity dynamics playing out over the last couple of months. But you have to keep in mind that currencies are also a big part of that. And in most cases, they're going the other way, especially in some of the key markets for us. So right now, it's not a big driver for us, given that we have to look at both of those together."

I wonder what makes Mondelez special is this global growth opportunity? I think as you talked about, organic net revenue growth, what people are really sort of thinking is the volume growth opportunity that comes from growing units in all these fast-growing emerging markets. If I look at your 4-year growth progression on a volume basis, you're down in what are supposed to be the volume-driving segments of your business, other than Eastern Europe. You're down in Latin America. You're down in Asia Pacific. And while currency's a part of that, macro's part of it, maybe not your fault, a couple of concerns I have that I'd love your thoughts on. First, when you see -- whenever you -- first, whenever you trade off pricing and volume, that's a lot easier on the margin structure than having to go the other way, and you do eventually need to go the other way on volume growth to sustain any margin expansions. And secondly, do you worry in some of these markets where you look at Asia Pacific or Latin America, where you're working hard doing the right thing to maintain that margin structure that's fair to investors, but you're seeing some unit declines? Do you worry that kind of reverses that networking effect and you get less usage and less households using the products over time in a way that maybe constrains the 5- and 10-year growth of the company.

I would remind you that our 2015 vol/mix was down about 3 points. That's about 1 point from Venezuela, about 1 point from the strategic actions we took and about 1 point of elasticity, which was mostly in the first half. As we started to see -- to make the investments, as we locked in our margins and started to make the investments in selected markets, in the back half, we saw a very strong improvement in, not only in the vol/mix trend, but also in our individual franchise performance. As we look to 2016, our intent again is to make sure that we're continuing to get a positive benefit. We're not going to give you specific guidance for the split between pricing and vol/mix. But as I mentioned, we are expecting pricing to be less of an impact, but it will continue to be pressured as we see inflation in these emerging markets.

We're going to continue to work through it. And as we do it, we'll adjust the targets and the plans there. But we're making good progress, I'll just tell you that, I think. On SG&A, really 3 dynamics I think that are probably inconsistent with how people are thinking about it. One is obviously, I'm not sure everybody fully got the A&C step-up that we're doing here. That's obviously showing up in the SG&A. We have obviously incentive comp that flows through there, given the strong performance versus targets, that's up year-over-year. And then currency, I mean, I think those are the 3 big drivers that would represent and I'd probably tell you 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of where it is in SG&A. So the underlying performance in overheads, the work that we're doing on indirects and the broader organizational activities is generating benefits.

I think it's one of the reasons that you see our vol/mix improving as the year progressed and as we exited the year. So we certainly are doing our best to make sure that as we price, it has as small an impact on the overall consumer landscape. I'd also say that virtually all of the pricing actions we have taken have been in respect -- in response to comment to industry costs. And so some of our -- of the elasticity impact have simply been the time it takes to some of our competitors to execute pricing actions. And as we've seen those price gaps narrow in markets like Russia and Brazil, for example, or some of the actions we have taken in markets like the U.K. or Germany, we are seeing our shares improve. So it is -- there's -- we're doing our best to manage the landscape, and it varies market to market.

Over the past few years, we've laid out our vision to be the best snacking company in the world. Our advantaged platform provides us with the potential to be among the fastest-growing consumer companies, with substantial margin upside and strong EPS growth, while also returning significant cash to our shareholders. 
Since we began this journey 3 years ago in the face of a very challenging environment, we've taken several significant actions to further strengthen our advantaged platform and create sustainable value for shareholders. Our strong results in 2015 reflect our continued progress, with the year playing out essentially as we planned, with very strong margin expansion in our developed markets and more growth coming from our emerging markets. 
In aggregate, we delivered top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while generating solid organic revenue growth and improved share performance. Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.7%, driven by our pricing actions to recover higher commodity and currency-driven input costs. As Brian will cover in detail shortly, we're deconsolidating our Venezuela operations, and this will have a material impact on our recent organic net revenue growth, as it does to our global category growth. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 230 basis points to 38.9%, fueled by world-class net productivity. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 170 basis points to 13.7% while continuing to build our advantaged platform through increased advertising and consumer support. And finally, adjusted EPS increased 19% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong operating gains. 
These results reflect the solid execution of our transformation agenda. First, we further focused our portfolio in our advantaged snacks categories. We combined our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the largest pure-play coffee business in the world, and the proposed current transaction should further enhance our position in the global coffee category. We also strengthened our snacks portfolio by acquiring and integrating Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods, a leader in the fast-growing free-from snacks in the U.S. 
Second, we continue to aggressively reduce costs. We're now beginning to see the benefits of our supply chain reinvention as we upgrade our manufacturing network and install more efficient and more flexible Lines of the Future. For the year, we delivered net productivity of more than 3.5% of cost of goods sold or nearly $700 million. That's world-class and another record year. We also reduced overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other tools, and we're beginning to institutionalize our approach to cost management. These savings enabled us to expand margins and provide the necessary fuel to accelerate growth. 
During the year, we stepped up A&C investment behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. This enabled us to continue to strengthen brand equities and backstop some of our pricing actions. 
On the top line, as we made these investments, we've seen improvement in our volume trends, revenue growth and market share performance as the year progressed. We actively monitor the payback of these investments, and we'll continue to proactively adjust our spending based on actual returns. 
On the bottom line, by pricing to recover input cost inflation, we've protected profitability, allowing our net productivity gains to flow through to gross margin. In short, like many smart companies, we're selectively investing through the downturn in emerging markets with continued investments in A&C and route to market so we could benefit disproportionately as these markets recover. 
Finally, we continue to strengthen our financial profile. We generated strong free cash flow, lowered our cost of debt and returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders. So as you can see, we made good progress on many fronts this year. I'm indebted to our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication, hard work and commitment to delivering these results, especially in the face of such massive change. 
With that as background, let's take a closer look at our 2015 top line results. For the full year, organic net revenue growth was 3.7%. This included a 90 basis point headwind related to our strategic actions to improve revenue mix. As expected, higher prices were the key driver, contributing about 7 percentage points of growth. 
While we fully expected significant pricing this year, the impact of the strengthening dollar on inflation in emerging markets, especially in the second half, forced us to price even more. While this helped protect margins, it also tempered our vol/mix improvement. 
As Brian will discuss in a moment, our organic revenue growth, as I said, adjusted for the deconsolidation of Venezuela, was 1.4%. We're especially pleased that our Power Brands grew more than 5%, well above the rate of the overall company, as a result of targeted A&C support. As expected, developed markets, which comprise about 60% of our revenue, declined less than 1% as we focused our efforts on cost reduction in this slower-growth environment. 
Emerging markets grew double digits as we took a more balanced approach by reducing costs and stepping up investment in our brands and capabilities. This allowed us to protect our leading share positions in the near term while remaining ready to capitalize on their long-term potential. 
Turning now to our results by region. While pricing was the main driver of our revenue growth, most of the pricing occurred in Latin America and EEMEA. For the full year, Latin America was up nearly 20%, driven by pricing in response to currency-driven inflation, especially in Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America was up almost 7%. 
Brazil was up mid-single digits as we priced to recover input cost inflation, driven by the weakening real. Oreo continued its strong momentum behind increased A&C investment. However, growth in the second half slowed to low single digits as the macro environment there deteriorated. Looking ahead, we do not expect conditions to improve in Brazil in the near term, and our forecast reflects this. 
EEMEA was up 6%, driven primarily by pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of each country's currency. Russia grew high teens for the year, driven by strong growth across all categories, including our largest one, chocolate. Alpen Gold led the way in chocolate, while biscuit growth was fueled by the successful launch of Oreo. However, as in Brazil, volumes fell in the second half as categories slowed in response to weakening economic conditions and price elasticity. 
Asia Pacific was up about 2% with solid growth in China, partially offset by weakness in some other markets. For the full year, China was up high single digits, driven by strong vol/mix in both biscuits and gum. belVita breakfast biscuits got off to a strong start. Oreo Thins continue to perform well behind distribution gains while Stride gum was up high teens. However, growth slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting the overall economy. As a result, we remain cautious in our China forecast for 2016. 
India increased modestly, but we're pleased that chocolate grew solidly in the second half in response to stepped-up A&C investments. Cadbury Dairy Milk was up high single digits, and Bubbly is off to a strong start. In addition, Asia's growth was tempered by about a point from SKU reductions, as it was one of the regions most affected by the loss of some short-term Kraft licenses in late 2014. 
Europe was down about 2%, including a drag of more than a point from strategic actions to improve revenue mix. Vol/mix, while still negative, improved throughout the year, fueled by the benefits of increased A&C and narrowed price gaps. For example, Milka biscuits grew mid-single digits across the region, and U.K. biscuits grew mid-teens, fueled in part by our latest innovation, Ritz Crisp & Thin. 
North America was up about 1%, with biscuits growth accelerating in the second half behind increased A&C and innovation, including Oreo Thins and belVita Bites. Importantly, vol/mix drove this acceleration. 
Turning now to our categories. For the full year, our snacks categories were up about 5.5% and about the same if you include Powdered Beverages and Cream Cheese. As with our revenue, pricing was the key driver as volumes remained challenged. 
Our organic growth was about 1.5 points below our categories. That was largely related to the 90 basis point impact of our strategic actions to improve revenue mix as well as the price elasticity we experienced earlier in the year. Overall, more than 55% of our snacks revenue gained or held share, with solid performance across each category. 
Let's take a closer look. The biscuits category was up about 7%, and our revenue was up about 6.5%, with strong performances in China, Brazil and Russia. About 60% of our revenue gained or held share, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S. as well as solid share gains in Brazil. 
The chocolate category increased about 5.5% while our revenue grew only about 1%. This reflected the fact that we were the first to price in most of our markets. But as I said earlier, this was essential to protecting the health of our franchises. 
As expected, our performance improved in the second half as price gaps narrowed and as we increased A&C support in key markets. As a result, market share steadily improved, with half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share for the full year. That's up from about 25% in the first half. 
Lastly, the Gum & Candy category increased nearly 2%. Our revenue grew 4%, with both Gum & Candy up low to mid-single-digits. Halls grew mid-single digits, driven by strong support behind the new Halls Air campaign that's now been rolled out across Europe, North America and select markets in AP and EEMEA. 
Finally, consistent with our plans, we increased A&C support behind high-return marketing initiatives to accelerate revenue growth and drive share. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our organic growth accelerated sequentially as the year progressed, while our share performance was strongest in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we delivered this improvement while significantly expanding adjusted operating income margin, a true virtuous cycle. 
In sum, we're pleased with our overall financial performance in 2015 as well as with the excellent progress we made in the transformation. As a result, we believe we're well positioned to deliver strong results again in 2016. 
Let me now turn it over to Brian, who'll provide details on our 2015 margin performance and earnings growth as well as on our 2016 outlook."
739693,322164989,925859,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good morning. Starting with Slide 9, you could see that for the year, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points to about 39%.

Starting with Slide 9, you could see that for the year, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points to about 39%. As Irene mentioned earlier, strong net productivity was the key driver for this improvement. We're now beginning to see the early benefits from our upgraded supply chain network, including the installation of our highly efficient Lines of the Future. 
For the year, mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts was a 40 basis point benefit. We also delivered another year of strong adjusted OI margin expansion, up 170 basis points to 13.7%, while increasing our growth investments significantly. 
We continue to drive down overhead cost as a percentage of revenue, leveraging ZBB to identify areas of opportunity and capture the savings. These approaches are now the way we work and will continue to benefit -- deliver benefits for us as we move forward. 
For the year, A&C spending was nearly 9% of revenue, up about 60 basis points. Most of the step-up was in the second half, including a significant increase in the fourth quarter. As Irene discussed earlier, these investments helped us accelerate organic revenue growth and improved our share performance as the year progressed. We're continuing to prioritize our spending to generate the best overall returns. 
Now let's look at margin by region. As you can see on Slide 9 (sic) [ Slide 11 ], developed markets drove most of the margin expansion, with North America up 230 basis points and Europe up 190. In both regions, strong net productivity drove significant gross margin expansion, and overheads were down as well. 
In Latin America, OI margin decreased 70 basis points, largely as a result of cycling the benefit from value-added tax-related settlements in the prior year, while the weakening macro environment also pressured vol/mix. But in EEMEA and AP, OI margin increased 100 and 150 basis points, respectively. In both regions, gross margin expansion and lower overheads more than offset increased A&C. 
Turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was $1.75 for the year, up 19% on a constant currency basis. Strong operating gains of $0.22 drove the increase. And the year-over-year change in mark-to-market added $0.06. Below the operating income line, lower interest expense and the benefit from the lower share count more than offset the headwind from higher taxes and dilution from the coffee transaction that closed in July. Including an unfavorable currency translation impact of $0.33, adjusted EPS was flat. 
As you can see on Slide 13, over the past 3 years, we've returned more than $11 billion of capital to our shareholders, including nearly $3 billion in dividends and more than $8 billion in share repurchases. For 2015, we accelerated this activity by returning $4.6 billion. This included $1 billion in dividends as well as buying back $3.6 billion of stock or roughly 92 million shares at an average price of $39.43 per share. As we exited the year, we had about $5.5 billion remaining under the current buyback authorization that goes through 2018. 
Before turning to our 2016 outlook, let me update you on the change we're making in our accounting treatment for Venezuela. As you saw in our press release today, effective at the end of the fourth quarter, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan operations. And we began to account for our investments in Venezuela using the cost method of accounting in our GAAP financial statements. 
As a result, we took a onetime accounting charge of $778 million to our fourth quarter 2015 reported results to remove all assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan operations from our balance sheet. 
On Slide 14, we've summarized the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela on our 2015 results. Excluding Venezuela, organic revenue was up 1.4% versus 3.7% including Venezuela. You should also note that removing Venezuela reduces 2015 total category growth to approximately 4%. Our adjusted OI margin, excluding Venezuela, was 50 basis points lower as our margins there were higher than our total company average. But the impact on our margin improvement was relatively minor. Excluding Venezuela, we expanded margin 150 basis points versus the 170 basis point increase including Venezuela. 
Finally excluding Venezuela reduced our adjusted EPS by $0.10. As we move to our 2016 outlook, please note all of our guidance reflects the 2015 baseline that excludes Venezuela. 
With that, let's move to our outlook. You'll see that our approach to 2016 is consistent with our 2015 playbook. We continue to target underlying organic revenue growth in line with our categories. This means prudently increasing investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms to accelerate revenue growth and gain share while remaining nimble in how and when we deploy A&C resources across key markets to deliver attractive returns. 
It also means maintaining our commitment to invest in sales and route-to-market capabilities, so that we're well positioned to capitalize on the long-term growth potential in emerging markets. We also believe we have further opportunities to improve revenue mix by optimizing trade spending and eliminating less profitable SKUs. While we expect this will be a headwind to our reported organic growth, it strengthens the underlying health of our business and is a contributor to our margin improvement. The challenge will be in striking the right balance between competitive position and customer response so that we aren't simply losing revenue and that the impact is net positive on the P&L and in cash flow. 
Our supply chain reinvention initiatives remain on track. And we'll increasingly benefit from the upgraded infrastructure and capabilities that we're putting in place around the world. We'll continue to reduce overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting. Incrementally, in 2016, we'll begin to realize savings from implementing global shared services as we eliminate redundant resources and complete process migration work. Finally, we'll continue to look to price to recover currency-driven input cost inflation so that the benefits of our cost-reduction initiatives can flow to the bottom line. 
In sum, we remain focused on reducing costs, expanding margins and building our advantaged platform to drive top line growth. Our overall approach to our 2016 outlook aligns well with the long-term advantages of our snacking categories, but it's no secret that 2016 is expected to be another challenging year. 
On Slide 16, you can see various issues that are affecting all categories, not just ours. Considering this macroeconomic outlook and the weakening trends we saw during Q4 in several of these markets, we're estimating that global snacking category growth will slow to 3% to 4% this year. That's down from the price-driven growth of about 4% in 2015, excluding Venezuela. 
While headwinds may affect the near term, we continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects for snacking. Given this backdrop of challenging category dynamics, we expect our 2016 organic revenue growth to be at least 2%. We view this as a prudent top line outlook given the volatility and recent trends that we're seeing. This includes a 125 basis point headwind from our actions to improve revenue mix by selectively optimizing trade spending and continuing to eliminate less profitable SKUs. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our underlying organic revenue growth to be in line with our forecast of 3% to 4% global category growth. 
Now let's look at our margin outlook. For 2016, we expect to deliver on our previously committed adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%. As we said earlier, the deconsolidation of our higher-margin business in Venezuela creates an approximately 50 basis point headwind. So we're now likely to be at the lower end of that range. However, our year-over-year margin expansion is expected to be in the range of 200 basis points versus 2015. Said another way, we would have expected to be at the high end of the committed range of 15% to 16% had we not deconsolidated Venezuela. 
Overall, we expect the drivers of our margin expansion to be similar to last year. Specifically, we expect strong contribution from our supply chain as we continue to drive world-class net productivity levels. 
We now have approximately 35 state-of-the-art Lines of the Future currently on stream. And we're clearly seeing benefits hitting the P&L as we ramp up production levels. We also expect to continue to reduce overheads as we execute our ZBB program, as we adjust our organization model and we realize the first savings from migrating back-office processes to global shared services. 
In 2015, as we began to transition key processes, in many cases, we maintained duplicate resourcing until we were confident that the migration was successful. As we ramp up shared services and eliminate these redundant transition costs, we expect savings to build, not only during 2016 but through 2018. 
We also expect to expand margins by improving our revenue mix. As we execute on this plan, we expect our margins to build as the year progresses. Given the progress we've made and the clarity of our plans and actions beyond 2016, we're confident in our ability to deliver an adjusted OI margin of 17% to 18% in 2018. 
On a pro forma basis, excluding Venezuela across all years, the midpoint of this 2018 target equates to an over 400 basis point increase versus 2015 and an almost 700 basis point improvement versus our 2013 baseline. We expect to deliver this margin target by continuing to focus on 3 things: first, productivity gains from our supply chain. These are funded and in our plan. And we're now expanding and replicating a model that's working. Second, more overhead reductions from lower indirect costs, savings from our global shared services and organizational efficiency. And third, improved revenue mix. These improvements will be partially offset by increased A&C support as we further align our share of voice with our share of market. 
Turning to our 2016 EPS outlook. By delivering our organic revenue and margin targets, we expect adjusted EPS to increase at a double-digit rate on a constant currency basis. We expect this increase to be driven primarily by operating gains. Below the line, while we expect a lower share count to provide a modest benefit, this will likely be offset by the impact of the coffee divestiture, as we had 2 quarters of fully owned coffee business in full year 2015. 
So before we take your questions, I'd like to go over a few other items for financial modeling purposes. First, based on current foreign exchange rates, we estimate a currency headwind of approximately 6 percentage points for revenue and approximately $0.13 for EPS. We expect our adjusted interest expense to be between $650 million and $675 million or about the same as 2015. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be in the low to mid-20s for 2016, roughly similar to our 2015 rate. And we expect to repurchase about $2 billion of our shares as we deliver on our commitment to spend the remaining coffee transaction proceeds on share buybacks this year. 
In addition, with respect to JDE, at the back of the presentation is an updated framework to help you estimate its earnings. As you know, JDE is a private company so we won't share significant detail on their results or projections. 
JDE management expects performance to be pressured this year as a result of their strategic actions to better position the company for long-term success. As an investor in JDE, we remain very confident in the long-term potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for its shareholders. In addition, with our participation in the proposed Keurig transaction, we'll be well positioned in the on-demand segment in North America while further enhancing our global footprint. We'll update you on its impact to our financials after the closing. 
So to wrap up, we delivered very strong results in 2015. In 2016, we expect macro conditions, especially in emerging markets, to remain difficult and potentially worsen, which will weigh on category and revenue growth. 
As you might expect, and I think you're hearing from others, we're seeing even more volatility in markets like Brazil, China and Russia, even as we start our first quarter. As a result, we'll continue focusing on driving strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We'll improve our top line growth, revenue mix and share performance, and we'll return significant capital to shareholders. We'll talk more about our strong cash flow generation at the upcoming CAGNY conference. We remain very confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda and deliver an adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. With our advantaged assets, leadership and capabilities, we believe we're one of the few industry players with the potential to deliver strong top and bottom line growth over the long term. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

As we've said, supply chain ramped throughout the year, and we saw the Lines of the Future really generating more benefits in the second half. We said that all year, and that's really how it played out. That will continue. And as you know, I mean, we've now got success in implementing these Lines of the Future in each of the categories, and it's really about taking that model and implementing it in a broader set of assets around the world. So it's something we're very confident in. On indirect costs and shared services, obviously, ZBB and attacking some of the key cost packages was probably the lowest-hanging fruit and some of the earliest benefits. But things like shared services and some of the organizational efficiency work is really a '16 driver. So I guess it's going to continue to be both. As you saw the results in '15, clearly, it was a strong gross margin-driven year, but we also made significant investments in A&C. And that's another dynamic that's going to play out and that affected SG&A. So it's a little bit of both. And commodity inflation -- look, I think, clearly, there's some pockets of improved commodity dynamics playing out over the last couple of months. But you have to keep in mind that currencies are also a big part of that. And in most cases, they're going the other way, especially in some of the key markets for us. So right now, it's not a big driver for us, given that we have to look at both of those together."

I wonder what makes Mondelez special is this global growth opportunity? I think as you talked about, organic net revenue growth, what people are really sort of thinking is the volume growth opportunity that comes from growing units in all these fast-growing emerging markets. If I look at your 4-year growth progression on a volume basis, you're down in what are supposed to be the volume-driving segments of your business, other than Eastern Europe. You're down in Latin America. You're down in Asia Pacific. And while currency's a part of that, macro's part of it, maybe not your fault, a couple of concerns I have that I'd love your thoughts on. First, when you see -- whenever you -- first, whenever you trade off pricing and volume, that's a lot easier on the margin structure than having to go the other way, and you do eventually need to go the other way on volume growth to sustain any margin expansions. And secondly, do you worry in some of these markets where you look at Asia Pacific or Latin America, where you're working hard doing the right thing to maintain that margin structure that's fair to investors, but you're seeing some unit declines? Do you worry that kind of reverses that networking effect and you get less usage and less households using the products over time in a way that maybe constrains the 5- and 10-year growth of the company.

I would remind you that our 2015 vol/mix was down about 3 points. That's about 1 point from Venezuela, about 1 point from the strategic actions we took and about 1 point of elasticity, which was mostly in the first half. As we started to see -- to make the investments, as we locked in our margins and started to make the investments in selected markets, in the back half, we saw a very strong improvement in, not only in the vol/mix trend, but also in our individual franchise performance. As we look to 2016, our intent again is to make sure that we're continuing to get a positive benefit. We're not going to give you specific guidance for the split between pricing and vol/mix. But as I mentioned, we are expecting pricing to be less of an impact, but it will continue to be pressured as we see inflation in these emerging markets.

We're going to continue to work through it. And as we do it, we'll adjust the targets and the plans there. But we're making good progress, I'll just tell you that, I think. On SG&A, really 3 dynamics I think that are probably inconsistent with how people are thinking about it. One is obviously, I'm not sure everybody fully got the A&C step-up that we're doing here. That's obviously showing up in the SG&A. We have obviously incentive comp that flows through there, given the strong performance versus targets, that's up year-over-year. And then currency, I mean, I think those are the 3 big drivers that would represent and I'd probably tell you 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of where it is in SG&A. So the underlying performance in overheads, the work that we're doing on indirects and the broader organizational activities is generating benefits.

I think it's one of the reasons that you see our vol/mix improving as the year progressed and as we exited the year. So we certainly are doing our best to make sure that as we price, it has as small an impact on the overall consumer landscape. I'd also say that virtually all of the pricing actions we have taken have been in respect -- in response to comment to industry costs. And so some of our -- of the elasticity impact have simply been the time it takes to some of our competitors to execute pricing actions. And as we've seen those price gaps narrow in markets like Russia and Brazil, for example, or some of the actions we have taken in markets like the U.K. or Germany, we are seeing our shares improve. So it is -- there's -- we're doing our best to manage the landscape, and it varies market to market.

Over the past few years, we've laid out our vision to be the best snacking company in the world. Our advantaged platform provides us with the potential to be among the fastest-growing consumer companies, with substantial margin upside and strong EPS growth, while also returning significant cash to our shareholders. 
Since we began this journey 3 years ago in the face of a very challenging environment, we've taken several significant actions to further strengthen our advantaged platform and create sustainable value for shareholders. Our strong results in 2015 reflect our continued progress with the year playing out essentially as we planned with very strong margin expansion in our developed markets and more growth coming from our emerging markets. 
In aggregate, we delivered top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while generating solid organic revenue growth and improved share performance. Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.7%, driven by our pricing actions to recover higher commodity and currency driven input costs. As Brian will cover in detail shortly, we're deconsolidating our Venezuela operations, and this will have a material impact on our recent organic net revenue growth as it does to our global category growth. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 230 basis points to 38.9%, fueled by world-class net productivity. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 170 basis points to 13.7% while continuing to build our advantaged platform through increased advertising and consumer support. And finally, adjusted EPS increased 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong operating gains. 
These results reflect the solid execution of our transformation agenda. First, we further focused our portfolio in our advantaged snacks categories. We combined our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the largest pure play coffee business in the world, and the proposed current transaction should further enhance our position in the global coffee category. We also strengthened our snacks portfolio by acquiring and integrating Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods, a leader in the fast-growing free-from snacks in the U.S. 
Second, we continue to aggressively reduce costs. We're now beginning to see the benefits of our supply chain reinvention as we upgrade our manufacturing network and install more efficient and more flexible Lines of the Future. For the year, we delivered net productivity of more than 3.5% of cost of goods sold or nearly $700 million. That's world-class and another record year. We also reduced overheads by leveraging 0-based budgeting and other tools, and we're beginning to institutionalize our approach to cost management. These savings enabled us to expand margins and provide the necessary fuel to accelerate growth. 
During the year, we stepped up A&C investment behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. This enabled us to continue to strengthen brand equities and backstop some of our pricing actions. On the top line, as we made these investments, we've seen improvement in our volume trends, revenue growth and market share performance as the year progressed. We actively monitor the payback of these investments, and we will continue to proactively adjust our spending based on actual returns. 
On the bottom line, by pricing to recover input cost inflation, we've protected profitability allowing our net productivity gains to flow through to gross margin. In short, like many smart companies, we're selectively investing through the downturn in emerging markets with continued investments in A&C and route to market so we could benefit disproportionately as these markets recover. 
Finally, we continue to strengthen our financial profile. We generated strong free cash flow, lowered our cost of debt and returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders. So as you can see, we made good progress on many fronts this year. I'm indebted to our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication, hard work and commitment to delivering these results especially in the face of such massive change. 
With that as background, let's take a closer look at our 2015 top line results. For the full year, organic net revenue growth was 3.7%. This included a 90 basis point headwind related to our strategic actions to improve revenue mix. As expected, higher prices were the key driver, contributing about 7 percentage points of growth. 
While we fully expected significant pricing this year, the impact of the strengthening dollar on inflation in emerging markets, especially in the second half, forced us to price even more. While this helped protect margins, it also tempered our vol/mix improvement. 
As Brian will discuss in a moment, our organic revenue growth, as I said, adjusted for the deconsolidation of Venezuela, was 1.4%. We're especially pleased that our Power Brands grew more than 5%, well above the rate of the overall company as a result of targeted A&C support. As expected, developed markets, which comprise about 60% of our revenue, declined less than 1% as we focused our efforts on cost reduction in this slower growth environment. 
Emerging markets grew double digits as we took a more balanced approach by reducing costs and stepping up investment in our brands and capabilities. This allowed us to protect our leading share positions in the near term while remaining ready to capitalize on their long-term potential. 
Turning now to our results by region. While pricing was the main driver of our revenue growth, most of the pricing occurred in Latin America and EEMEA. For the full year, Latin America was up nearly 20%, driven by pricing in response to currency driven inflation especially in Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America was up almost 7%. 
Brazil was up mid-single digits as we priced to recover input cost inflation, driven by the weakening real. Oreo continued its strong momentum behind increased A&C investment. However, growth in the second half slowed to low single digits as the macro environment there deteriorated. Looking ahead, we do not expect conditions to improve in Brazil in the near term and our forecast reflects this. 
EEMEA was up 6%, driven primarily by pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of each country's currency. Russia grew high teens for the year, driven by strong growth across all categories including our largest one, chocolate. Alpen Gold led the way in chocolate while biscuit growth was fueled by the successful launch of Oreo. However, as in Brazil, volumes fell in the second half as categories slowed in response to weakening economic conditions and price elasticity. 
Asia Pacific was up about 2% with solid growth in China, partially offset by weakness in some other markets. For the full year, China was up high single digits, driven by strong vol/mix in both biscuits and gum. belVita breakfast biscuits got off to a strong start. Oreo Thins continue to perform well behind distribution gains while Stride gum was up high teens. However, growth slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting the overall economy. As a result, we remain cautious in our China forecast for 2016. 
India increased modestly, but we're pleased that chocolate grew solidly in the second half in response to stepped up A&C investments. Cadbury Dairy Milk was up high single digits, and Bubbly is off to a strong start. In addition, Asia's growth was tempered by about a point from SKU reductions as it was one of the regions most affected by the loss of some short-term Kraft licenses in late 2014. 
Europe was down about 2%, including a drag of more than a point from strategic actions to improve revenue mix. Vol/mix, while still negative, improved throughout the year fueled by the benefits of increased A&C and narrowed price gaps. For example, Milka biscuits grew mid-single digits across the region, and U.K. biscuits grew mid-teens, fueled in part by our latest innovation, Ritz Crisp & Thin. North America was up about 1% with biscuits growth accelerating in the second half behind increased A&C and innovation, including Oreo Thins and belVita Bites. Importantly, vol/mix drove this acceleration. 
Turning now to our categories. For the full year, our snacks categories were up about 5.5% and about the same if you include powdered beverages and cream cheese. As with our revenue, pricing was the key driver as volumes remained challenged. Our organic growth was about 1.5 points below our categories. That was largely related to the 90 basis point impact of our strategic actions to improve revenue mix as well as the price elasticity we experienced earlier in the year. Overall, more than 55% of our snacks revenue gained or held share, with solid performance across each category. 
Let's take a closer look. The biscuits category was up about 7%, and our revenue was up about 6.5%, with strong performances in China, Brazil and Russia. About 60% of our revenue gained or held share, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S. as well as solid share gains in Brazil. 
The chocolate category increased about 5.5% while our revenue grew only about 1%. This reflected the fact that we were the first to price in most of our markets. But as I said earlier, this was essential to protecting the health of our franchises. 
As expected, our performance improved in the second half as price gaps narrowed and as we increased A&C support in key markets. As a result, market share steadily improved with half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share for the full year. That's up from about 25% in the first half. 
Lastly, the gum and candy category increased nearly 2%. Our revenue grew 4%, with both gum and candy up low to mid-single digits. Halls grew mid-single digits, driven by strong support behind the new Halls air campaign that's now been rolled out across Europe, North America and select markets in AP and EEMEA. 
Finally, consistent with our plans, we increased A&C support behind high-return marketing initiatives to accelerate revenue growth and drive share. 
As you can see on Slide 8, our organic growth accelerated sequentially as the year progressed while our share performance was strongest in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we delivered this improvement while significantly expanding adjusted operating income margin, a true virtuous cycle. 
In sum, we're pleased with our overall financial performance in 2015 as well as with the excellent progress we made in the transformation. As a result, we believe we're well positioned to deliver strong results again in 2016. 
Let me now turn it over to Brian, who'll provide details on our 2015 margin performance and earnings growth as well as on our 2016 outlook."
739693,322164989,943064,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene, and good morning. Starting with Slide 9, you could see that for the year, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points to about 39%.

Starting with Slide 9, you could see that for the year, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points to about 39%. As Irene mentioned earlier, strong net productivity was the key driver for this improvement. We're now beginning to see the early benefits from our upgraded supply chain network, including the installation of our highly efficient Lines of the Future. 
For the year, mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts was a 40 basis point benefit. We also delivered another year of strong adjusted OI margin expansion, up 170 basis points to 13.7% while increasing our growth investment significantly. We continue to drive down overhead cost as a percentage of revenue, leveraging ZBB to identify areas of opportunity and capture the savings. These approaches are now the way we work and will continue to benefit -- deliver benefits for us as we move forward. 
For the year, A&C spending was nearly 9% of revenue, up about 60 basis points. Most of the step-up was in the second half, including a significant increase in the fourth quarter. As Irene discussed earlier, these investments helped us accelerate organic revenue growth and improved our share performance as the year progressed. We're continuing to prioritize our spending to generate the best overall returns. 
Now let's look at margin by region. As you can see on Slide 9, developed markets drove most of the margin expansion with North America up 230 basis points and Europe up 190 basis points. In both regions, strong net productivity drove significant gross margin expansion, and overheads were down as well. In Latin America, OI margin decreased 70 basis points, largely as a result of cycling to benefit from value-added tax-related settlements in the prior year while the weakening macro environment also pressured vol/mix. But in EEMEA and AP, OI margin increased 100 and 150 basis points, respectively. In both regions, gross margin expansion and lower overheads more than offset increased A&C. 
Turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was $1.75 for the year, up 19% on a constant currency basis. Strong operating gains of $0.22 drove the increase. And the year-over-year change in mark to market added $0.06. Below the operating income line, lower interest expense and the benefit from a lower share count more than offset the headwind from higher taxes and dilution from the coffee transaction that closed in July. Including an unfavorable currency translation impact of $0.33, adjusted EPS was flat. 
As you can see on Slide 13, over the past 3 years, we've returned more than $11 billion of capital to our shareholders, including nearly $3 billion in dividends and more than $8 billion in share repurchases. For 2015, we accelerated this activity by returning $4.6 billion. This included $1 billion in dividends as well as buying back $3.6 billion of stock or roughly 92 million shares at an average price of $39.43 per share. As we exited the year, we had about $5.5 billion remaining under the current buyback authorization that goes through 2018. 
Before turning to our 2016 outlook, let me update you on the change we're making in our accounting treatment for Venezuela. As you saw in our press release today, effective at the end of the fourth quarter, we deconsolidated our Venezuela operations and we began to account for our investments in Venezuela using the cost method of accounting in our GAAP financial statements. As a result, we took a onetime accounting charge of $778 million to our fourth quarter 2015 reported results to remove all assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan operations from our balance sheet. 
On Slide 14, we've summarized the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela on our 2015 results. Excluding Venezuela, organic revenue was up 1.4% versus 3.7% including Venezuela. You should also note that removing Venezuela reduces 2015 total category growth to approximately 4%. Our adjusted OI margin, excluding Venezuela, was 50 basis points lower as our margins there were higher than our total company average. But the impact on our margin improvement was relatively minor. Excluding Venezuela, we expanded margin 150 basis points versus the 170 basis point increase including Venezuela. Finally excluding Venezuela reduced our adjusted EPS by $0.10. As we move to our 2016 outlook, please note all of our guidance reflects a 2015 baseline that excludes Venezuela. 
With that, let's move to our outlook. You'll see that our approach to 2016 is consistent with our 2015 playbook. We continue to target underlying organic revenue growth in line with our categories. This means prudently increasing investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms to accelerate revenue growth and gain share, while remaining nimble in how and when we deploy A&C resources across key markets to deliver attractive returns. It also means maintaining our commitment to invest in sales and route-to-market capabilities so that we're well positioned to capitalize on the long-term growth potential in emerging markets. 
We also believe we have further opportunities to improve revenue mix by optimizing trade spending and eliminating less profitable SKUs. While we expect this will be a headwind to our reported organic growth, it strengthens the underlying health of our business as a contributor to our margin improvement. The challenge will be in striking the right balance between competitive position and customer response so that we aren't simply losing revenue and that the impact is net positive on the P&L and in cash flow. 
Our supply chain reinvention initiatives remain on track. And we'll increasingly benefit from the upgraded infrastructure and capabilities that we're putting in place around the world. We'll continue to reduce overheads by leveraging 0-based budgeting. Incrementally, in 2016, we'll begin to realize savings from implementing global shared services as we eliminate redundant resources and complete process migration work. Finally, we'll continue to look to price to recover currency driven input cost inflation so that the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives can flow to the bottom line. 
In sum, we remain focused on reducing costs, expanding margins and building our advantaged platform to drive top line growth. Our overall approach to our 2016 outlook aligns well with the long-term advantages of our snacking categories, but it's no secret that 2016 is expected to be another challenging year. 
On Slide 16, you can see various issues that are affecting all categories, not just ours. Considering this macroeconomic outlook and the weakening trends we saw during Q4 in several of these markets, we're estimating that global snack category growth will slow to 3% to 4% this year. That's down from the price driven growth of about 4% in 2015, excluding Venezuela. 
While headwinds may affect the near term, we continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects for snacking. Given this backdrop of challenging category dynamics, we expect our 2016 organic revenue growth to be at least 2%. We view this as a prudent top line outlook given the volatility and recent trends that we're seeing. This includes 125 basis point headwind from our actions to improve revenue mix by selectively optimizing trade spending and continuing to eliminate less profitable SKUs. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our underlying organic revenue growth to be in line with our forecast of 3% to 4% global category growth. 
Now let's look at our margin outlook. For 2016, we expect to deliver on our previously committed adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%. As we said earlier, the deconsolidation of our higher-margin business in Venezuela creates an approximately 50 basis point headwind. So we're now likely to be at the lower end of that range. However, our year-over-year margin expansion is expected to be in the range of 200 basis points versus 2015. Said another way, we would have expected to be at the high end of the committed range of 15% to 16% had we not deconsolidated Venezuela. Overall, we expect the drivers of our margin expansion to be similar to last year. Specifically, we expect strong contribution from our supply chain as we continue to drive world-class net productivity levels. 
We now have approximately 35 state-of-the-art Lines of the Future currently on stream. And we're clearly seeing benefits hitting the P&L as we ramp up production levels. We also expect to continue to reduce overheads as we execute our ZBB program as we adjust our organization model and we realize the first savings from migrating back-office processes to global shared services. 
In 2015, as we began to transition key processes, in many cases, we maintained duplicate resourcing until we were confident that the migration was successful. As we ramp up shared services and eliminate these redundant transition costs, we expect savings to build not only during 2016 but through 2018. 
We also expect to expand margins by improving our revenue mix. As we execute on this plan, we expect our margins to build as the year progresses. Given the progress we've made and the clarity of our plans and actions beyond 2016, we're confident in our ability to deliver an adjusted OI margin of 17% to 18% in 2018. 
On a pro forma basis, excluding Venezuela across all years, the midpoint of this 2018 target equates to an over 400 basis point increase versus 2015 and an almost 700 basis point improvement versus our 2013 baseline. We expect to deliver this margin target by continuing to focus on 3 things. First, productivity gains from our supply chain. These are funded and in our plan. And we're now expanding and replicating a model that's working. Second, more overhead reductions from lower indirect costs, savings from our global shared services and organizational efficiency. And third, improved revenue mix. These improvements will be partially offset by increased A&C support as we further align our share of voice with our share of market. 
Turning to our 2016 EPS outlook. By delivering our organic revenue and margin targets, we expect adjusted EPS to increase at a double-digit rate on a constant currency basis. We expect this increase to be driven primarily by operating gains. Below the line, while we expect a lower share count to provide a modest benefit, this will likely be offset by the impact of the coffee divestiture as we had 2 quarters of fully owned coffee business in full year 2015. 
So before we take your questions, I'd like to go over a few other items for financial modeling purposes. First, based on current foreign exchange rates, we estimate a currency headwind of approximately 6 percentage points for revenue and approximately $0.13 for EPS. We expect our adjusted interest expense to be between $650 million and $675 million or about the same as 2015. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be in the low to mid-20s for 2016, roughly similar to our 2015 rate. And we expect to repurchase about $2 billion of our shares as we deliver on our commitment to spend the remaining coffee transaction proceeds on share buybacks this year. 
In addition, with respect to JDE, at the back of the presentation is an updated framework to help you estimate its earnings. As you know, JDE is a private company so we won't share significant detail on their results or projections. JDE management expects performance to be pressured this year as a result of their strategic actions to better position the company for long-term success. As an investor in JDE, we remain very confident in the long-term potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for its shareholders. In addition, with our participation in the proposed Keurig transaction, we'll be well positioned in the on-demand segment in North America while further enhancing our global footprint. We'll update you on its impact to our financials after the closing. 
So to wrap up, we delivered very strong results in 2015. In 2016, we expect macro conditions, especially in emerging markets, to remain difficult and potentially worsen, which will weigh on category and revenue growth. As you might expect, and I think you're hearing from others, we're seeing even more volatility in markets like Brazil, China and Russia even as we start our first quarter. As a result, we'll continue focusing on driving strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We'll improve our top line growth, revenue mix and share performance, and we'll return significant capital to shareholders. We'll talk more about our strong cash flow generation at the upcoming CAGNY conference. We remain very confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda and deliver an adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. With our advantaged assets, leadership and capabilities, we believe we're one of the few industry players with the potential to deliver strong top and bottom line growth over the long term. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

As we've said, supply chain ramped throughout the year, and we saw the Lines of the Future really generating more benefits in the second half. We've said that all year, and that's really how it played out. That will continue. And as you know, I mean, we've now got success in implementing these Lines of the Future in each of the categories, and it's really about taking that model and implementing it in a broader set of assets around the world. So it's something we're very confident in. On indirect costs and shared services, obviously, ZBB and attacking some of the key cost packages was probably the lowest hanging fruit and some of the earliest benefits. But things like shared services and some of the organizational efficiency work is really a '16 driver. So I guess it's going to continue to be both. As you saw the results in '15, clearly, it was a strong gross margin driven year, but we also made significant investments in A&C. And that's another dynamic that's going to play out and that affected SG&A. So it's a little bit of both. And commodity inflation -- look, I think, clearly, there's some pockets of improved commodity dynamics playing out over the last couple months. But you have to keep in mind that currencies are also a big part of that. And in most cases, they're going the other way, especially in some of the key markets for us. So right now, it's not a big driver for us given that we have to look at both of those together."

I wonder what makes Mondelez special is this global growth opportunity. I think as you talk about, organic net revenue growth, what people are really sort of thinking is the volume growth opportunity that comes from growing units in all these fast-growing emerging markets. If I look at your 4-year growth progression on a volume basis, you're down in what are supposed to be the volume driving segments of your business other than Eastern Europe. You're down in Latin America. You're down in Asia Pacific. And while currency is a part of that, macro's part, maybe not your fault, a couple of concerns I have that I'd love your thoughts on. First, when you see -- whenever you -- first, whenever you trade-off pricing and volume, that's a lot easier on the margin structure than having to go the other way, and you do eventually need to go the other way on volume growth to sustain any margin expansion. And secondly, do you worry in some of these markets where you look at Asia Pacific or Latin America where you're working hard and doing the right thing to maintain that margin structure that's fair to investors, but you're seeing some unit declines? Do you worry that kind of reverses that networking effect and you get less usage and less households using the products over time in a way that maybe constrains the 5- and 10-year growth of the company?

We obviously continue to pay very close attention to the impact of our pricing actions on our volumes. I would remind you that our 2015 vol/mix was down about 3 points. That's about 1 point from Venezuela, about 1 point from the strategic actions we took and about 1 point of elasticity, which was mostly in the first half. As we started to see -- to make the investments, as we locked in our margins and started to make the investments in selected markets in the back half, we saw a very strong improvement in, not only in the vol/mix trend, but also in our individual franchise performance. As we look to 2016, our intent again is to make sure that we're continuing to get a positive benefit. We're not going to give you specific guidance for the split between pricing and vol/mix.

We're going to continue to work through it. And as we do it, we'll adjust the targets and the plans there. But we're making good progress, I'll just tell you that, I think. On SG&A, really 3 dynamics I think that are probably inconsistent with how people are thinking about it. One is obviously, I'm not sure everybody fully got the A&C step-up that we're doing here. That's obviously showing up in the SG&A. We have obviously incentive comp that flows through there and, given the strong performance versus targets, that's up year-over-year. And then currency, I mean I think those are the 3 big drivers that would represent and I'd probably tell you 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of where it is in SG&A. So the underlying performance in overheads, the work that we're doing on indirects and the broader organizational activities is generating benefits.

I think it's one of the reasons that you see our vol/mix improving as the year progressed and as we exited the year. So we certainly are doing our best to make sure that as we price, it has a small impact on the overall consumer landscape. I'd also say that virtually all of the pricing actions we have taken have been in respect -- in response to comment to industry costs. And so some of our -- of the elasticity impact has simply been the time it takes to some of our competitors to execute pricing actions. And as we've seen those price gaps narrow in markets like Russia and Brazil, for example, or some of the actions we have taken in markets like the U.K. or Germany, we are seeing our shares improve. So it is -- there's -- we're doing our best to manage the landscape, and it varies market to market.

We had a good start to the year. We continued to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while stepping up organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew more than 2% as we drove our Power Brands,",1431,"Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. We had a good start to the year. We continued to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while stepping up organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew more than 2% as we drove our Power Brands, stepped up volume/mix in developed markets, raised prices again to recover currency-driven input costs in emerging markets and continued to eliminate less profitable brands and lower return spending. We expanded adjusted gross profit margin by 170 basis points to 39.7% by driving strong net productivity.
Adjusted operating income margin expanded 240 basis points to 15.1%, as we continued to aggressively reduce overheads while significantly stepping up A&C support. And finally, adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant currency basis, driven by operating gains.
Let's take a closer look at the details. Organic revenue in Q1 grew just over 2%, in line with our annual guidance. Importantly, the impact from our revenue management actions, which includes SKU reduction and trade optimization, was a little more than 1 percentage point. That's largely consistent with our full year estimate of about 1.25 points, and you'll see in a few minutes how that played through our margins. 
We delivered this growth despite the volatile operating and currency environment that pressured category growth, especially in many of our larger emerging markets. In aggregate, emerging markets were up about 3.5% as we priced to recover currency-driven inflation to protect profitability. 
Along with softening category growth, this pricing had some elasticity impact, which resulted in lower vol/mix in the short term. In contrast, developed markets grew 1.3%. What's noteworthy is that nearly all of this growth was driven by vol/mix, including solid growth in both Europe and North America. 
This reflects the continuation of the improvement in our vol/mix contribution as the cost environment has moderated since early 2015. Power Brands continue to drive our growth. They were up nearly 4%, in line with our categories. The shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter provided us with only a modest benefit, given that Easter was only 1 week earlier than last year.
Turning now to our results by region. Despite the challenging environment, every region contributed to revenue growth, with 3 of them also delivering positive vol/mix. Latin America was up nearly 4%, all due to pricing in response to currency-driven inflation in Argentina and Brazil. Brazil was down low to mid-single digits as the deteriorating political and economic environment pressured category growth. We expect operating conditions in Brazil to remain challenging for the balance of the year, and that's reflected in our current outlook. In contrast, Mexico, our second-largest market in the region, was a bright spot. Revenue was up high single digits, driven by strong volume and share growth in gum.
EEMEA grew 4.5%, all driven by pricing in response to continued currency-driven inflation in several markets. Political and economic instability in several countries tempered category growth. Russia grew low single digits as higher pricing was mostly offset by elasticity and softer consumption due to the macro environment. Nonetheless, we held share in our 2 largest categories, chocolate and biscuits. As with Brazil, we remain cautious about the near-term operating environment in Russia, and that also continues to temper our full year outlook.
Asia Pacific grew almost 3%, including about 1 point of vol/mix growth. India, Australia and the Southeast Asian markets all contributed. Chocolate in India was up double digits, driven by vol/mix gains and stable shares in response to increased A&C support behind Cadbury Dairy Milk and continued momentum of our Bubbly innovation platform. Australia was up mid-single digits behind strength in chocolate as we lapped our significant revenue management actions from a year ago and invest in marketing and innovation behind our now more profitable chocolate and biscuit businesses.
China was essentially flat. Biscuits revenue was down, reflecting the overall category slowdown. This was offset somewhat by continued double-digit growth in gum despite a decline in that category as well. We remain cautious about China for the remainder of the year, given the soft consumer environment and category trends.
Europe continued to show sequential improvement, delivering modest growth in the quarter as price gaps narrowed and we selectively invested behind high ROI initiatives. Notably, Europe posted positive volume/mix, with strength in both chocolate and biscuits behind Power Brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and Oreo.
Last but not least, North America was up about 2.5%, including a couple of points of vol/mix growth. Biscuits grew low single digits, largely through higher vol/mix and share growth of Oreo, belVita and Triscuit. In addition, we launched GOOD THiNS, a new biscuit innovation platform that capitalizes on consumer demand for more wholesome savory snack options. GOOD THiNS are delicious baked crackers made with potatoes, chickpeas or rice with no artificial ingredients. We launched GOOD THiNS in March and it's already reached a 1.4 [ph] share of the U.S. cracker market.
Turning now to our categories. In the first quarter, overall category growth was about 4%. However, given the timing of Easter, retail consumption shifted somewhat from Q2 into Q1. Excluding the Easter shift impact, overall category growth was roughly 3%. Our organic growth was about 1 point below our categories due primarily to our revenue management actions. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, our Power Brands grew about 4%, in line with our categories and drove significant margin expansion. Net-net, building on our Q4 momentum, about 65% of our snacks revenue gained or held share in the first quarter.
Let's look at our performance in each of our categories. Biscuits grew about 2.5%, with notable strength in the U.S. and the U.K. Our share performance was also strong, with around 80% of our biscuits revenue gaining or holding share. Our biscuits Power Brands grew mid-single digits, led by Oreo and belVita. 
In chocolate, our revenue reflected strong growth in the U.K., India and Australia as the markets adjusted to our pricing actions. This was partially offset by soft results in Brazil and Russia. Together, these 2 markets tempered our overall chocolate growth by more than 1.5 points. 
Shares were solid, with about half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share. We're pleased to see our momentum improving as price gaps narrow and our targeted investments pay off. Our performance in the U.K. was especially strong and a sharp turnaround from our share losses through most of 2015. We increased share by nearly 1 point behind increased A&C support and innovation such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Big Taste and Cadbury Dairy Milk Medley.
In Germany, our share decline in the quarter was due solely to cycling the impact of the revenue management actions we implemented in the second quarter last year. As a result, this is the last quarter of impact related to those actions.
Gum & Candy revenue increased almost 3%, led by strong growth of gum in Mexico and China and Sour Patch Kids candy in the U.S. About 60% of our Gum & Candy revenue gained or held share, with gains in Mexico, China and France. While we remain disappointed by continued aggregate gum share declines here in the U.S., we're encouraged to see both Trident and Dentyne growing. In addition, we'll be implementing a Stride turnaround plan later this year.
To summarize, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We delivered solid top line growth and share performance, with improving vol/mix despite continued volatility in some of our largest emerging markets. Our solid top line, together with strong delivery of productivity and cost savings, which Brian will describe in a moment, provided good foundation for delivering our full year forecast.
Before I conclude however, I'd like to pause for a moment to share a few thoughts about Mark Clouse, our Chief Commercial Officer. As you saw in today's press release, Mark will be leaving our company in a few weeks to become CEO of Pinnacle Foods. Mark is a talented executive and a natural leader, who has made significant contributions to every aspect of our business over the last 2 decades, most recently as our Chief Commercial Officer. Mark has proven that he's ready for this next step in his career. We thank him and wish him and his family all the best.
While of course, we will miss Mark, we have a deep leadership team, and I'm confident that they will continue to execute flawlessly. We'll take this opportunity to further simplify and streamline our organization, and so we won't be backfilling the Chief Commercial Officer role. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian."
739693,330022118,964069,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on Irene's comments, we delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth despite the continued challenging environment.

Building on Irene's comments, we delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth despite the continued challenging environment. Adjusted gross margin increased 170 basis points to 39.7%. Please note that this includes absorbing a 50 basis point headwind related to commodity and currency hedging contracts that don't qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
Our gross margin expansion was driven by net productivity of more than 4% of COGS. That's up from about 3.5% last year and reflects continued progress as we implement integrated Lean Six Sigma and strong execution of our supply chain reinvention program, including installing our state-of-the-art Lines of the Future around the world. In fact, we'll have 4 additional lines operational in our Salinas, Mexico facility by year-end, complementing the 7 lines already in place there. 
You may have also seen that we opened our latest greenfield plant in India on Monday. This plant will produce approximately 60,000 tons of Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate annually to start. By 2020, this multi-category food campus is expected to reach annual capacity of 250,000 tons. 
Adjusted OI margin was 15.1%, up 240 basis points. Drivers of the improvement include the gross margin expansion as well as overhead reductions as we continued to drive cost savings. We did benefit from the timing of some overhead spending in the quarter that will negatively impact our second quarter, but we're fully on track to deliver our targeted cost savings related to indirect cost packages and the migration of back-office processes to global shared services. We also increased A&C support to more than 9% of revenue to support our Power Brands and drive profitable growth over the long term.
Our cost reduction efforts drove margin improvement across all of our regions, with the exception of Latin America, which was affected by the tough environment in Brazil. In both North America and Europe, the margin improvement was driven by strong net productivity and reduced overheads, offset by stepped-up A&C investments to fuel growth. 
In North America, adjusted OI margin grew 260 basis points to 20.3%. And in Europe, margins were up 390 basis points to 19.7%. As you know, North America and Europe have expanded margins by more than 500 and 600 basis points, respectively, since the end of 2013.
In EEMEA, margin was 11.5%, up 770 basis points versus what was an easy compare. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015, price increases were insufficient to cover the sharp increases in currency-driven input costs. In this quarter, strong net productivity, favorable vol/mix and overhead reductions were the key drivers of our margin expansion. In Asia Pacific, margin expanded 310 basis points to 16.1%. This was driven by continued productivity improvements as well as overhead reductions.
In Latin America, given the challenging macroeconomic environment in Brazil, margin declined 260 basis points to 10.5%. This was largely due to unfavorable vol/mix and currency, which more than offset significant cost reductions.
Now turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant currency basis. The increase was driven by $0.07 of operating gains, including a negative $0.02 impact from mark-to-market and a negative $0.01 from calendar adjustments. Below the operating line, EPS increased $0.05 as lower interest expense, the benefit from a lower share count and lower taxes more than offset the dilution from the coffee deal. Our coffee investments in both JDE and Keurig had solid quarters and delivered in line with our expectations.
In the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders. Specifically, we paid out about $270 million in dividends and purchased $1.2 billion of stock or nearly 229 million shares at an average price of about $41. This amount includes the remaining $500 million of cash received as part of the JDE coffee deal that we committed to use for repurchasing stock. In addition, we opportunistically accelerated a portion of our 2016 buyback program into the first quarter. We continue to expect to buy back approximately $2 billion of stock for the year.
Now turning to our outlook. Given our strong start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2016 outlook and are reaffirming our outlook today. Specifically, we continue to expect to deliver organic revenue growth of at least 2%; adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%, which is an expansion of at least 200 basis points this year; double-digit adjusted EPS growth; and at least $1.4 billion of free cash flow. 
In addition, based on recent spot rates, we expect less of an impact from currency translation. For revenue, we expect currency to be a 3% -- 3 percentage point headwind, down from 6 points. And for EPS, we estimate a $0.05 headwind, down from $0.13. 
We've also updated a couple of other items to help with your financial models. We currently estimate that our interest expense will be $625 million to $650 million, down about $25 million from our previous estimate. Due to some discrete items in the first quarter, we now estimate our full year 2016 tax rate will be in the low 20s, down from the low to mid-20s in our prior outlook. 
While we're not providing quarterly guidance, I would like to call out a few items to keep in mind as you think about our second quarter. First, Q2 was typically our lowest margin quarter, given seasonally lower revenues. Second, as we mentioned earlier, our first quarter benefited from the timing of some overhead spending, which will pressure our second quarter.
Finally, as you may know, collective bargaining agreements covering 8 U.S. facilities expired at the end of February. The affected employees have been working without a contract since that time while we continue to bargain in good faith with the union. We've shared our last, best and final offer with the union. We believe it's fair and the right solution for both our employees and our business. Until we reach an agreement, we expect to incur some onetime costs as we continue the negotiation while executing business continuity plans for our North America business. Despite these short-term items, we're executing well and are confident in our business momentum and our ability to deliver on our full year commitments. 
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our strong results in the first quarter. We delivered significant margin expansion, solid organic revenue growth and share performance with Power Brands up 4%, positive vol/mix growth in developed markets and increased investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. We've also returned $1.5 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the volatile operating environment, we're on track to deliver our 2016 outlook as well as our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. With that, let's open it up for questions."

And so the foundational things that we're doing in terms of reinvesting in high ROI marketing initiatives and continuing the expansion of some of our proven innovation platforms, all of that is in place. As you saw in the first quarter, our A&C is up over 9% of revenue. We're continuing to invest in our key franchises and that will just continue as the year progress. So yes, we have a headwind from some of these more volatile emerging markets. But as we said in our -- as I said in my remarks, we feel pretty comfortable that we've accounted for those against the stronger momentum that we should see everywhere else."

I would tell you probably the single biggest impact on the overall category growth is the U.S. It's our biggest biscuit market and we did see that category slowing down. There's a lot of factors that contribute there. Some of our biggest customers are changing some of their merchandising policies, which is having an impact. I think we're still performing quite well within those constraints, but it is having somewhat of an impact on our overall performance. So I think the facts are our revenue in aggregate in North -- our biscuit revenue in North America was up almost 3%. Very strong vol/mix, but the category itself was a little weaker than we had seen. And our approach to that is just to continue to invest in our strong brand, to continue to introduce innovation like Oreo Thins and GOOD THiNS, which are driving very strong results and continuing to leverage the fact that we've got much more flexibility in our packaging capability as a result of the addition of assets like Salinas. So I think we are clearly in charge of the category performance here in the U.S., and we have very strong plans in place to continue to drive that.

Can you talk a little bit about the components of price and volume? I would assume that because foreign exchange pressures are lower, you don't need to take as much pricing as you were previously contemplating. So would it mean that kind of the price piece has come down and then commensurately, you would expect volumes to go up because of elasticities, positive elasticities?"

We had a good start to the year. We continued to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth, while stepping up organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew more than 2% as we drove our Power Brands,",1430,"Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. We had a good start to the year. We continued to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth, while stepping up organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew more than 2% as we drove our Power Brands, stepped up volume/mix in developed markets, raised prices again to recover currency-driven input costs in emerging markets and continued to eliminate less profitable brands and lower return spending. We expanded adjusted gross profit margin by 170 basis points to 39.7% by driving strong net productivity.
Adjusted operating income margin expanded 240 basis points to 15.1%, as we continued to aggressively reduce overheads, while significantly stepping up A&C support. And finally, adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant currency basis, driven by operating gains.
Let's take a closer look at the details. Organic revenue in Q1 grew just over 2%, in line with our annual guidance. Importantly, the impact from our revenue management actions, which includes SKU reduction and trade optimization, was a little more than 1 percentage point. That's largely consistent with our full year estimate of about 1.25 points, and you'll see in a few minutes how that played through our margins. 
We delivered this growth despite the volatile operating and currency environment that pressured category growth, especially in many of our larger emerging markets. In aggregate, emerging markets were up about 3.5% as we priced to recover currency-driven inflation to protect profitability. 
Along with softening category growth, this pricing had some elasticity impact, which resulted in lower vol/mix in the short term. In contrast, developed markets grew 1.3%. What's noteworthy is that nearly all of this growth was driven by vol/mix, including solid growth in both Europe and North America. 
This reflects the continuation of the improvement in our vol/mix contribution as the cost environment has moderated since early 2015. Power Brands continue to drive our growth. They were up nearly 4%, in line with our categories. The shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter provided us with only a modest benefit, given that Easter was only 1 week earlier than last year.
Turning now to our results by region. Despite the challenging environment, every region contributed to revenue growth, with 3 of them also delivering positive vol/mix. Latin America was up nearly 4%, all due to pricing in response to currency-driven inflation in Argentina and Brazil. Brazil was down low to mid-single digits as the deteriorating political and economic environment pressured category growth. We expect operating conditions in Brazil to remain challenging for the balance of the year, and that's reflected in our current outlook. In contrast, Mexico, our second-largest market in the region, was a bright spot. Revenue was up high single digits, driven by strong volume and share growth in gum.
EEMEA grew 4.5%, all driven by pricing, in response to continued currency-driven inflation in several markets. Political and economic instability in several countries tempered category growth. Russia grew low single digits as higher pricing was mostly offset by elasticity and softer consumption due to the macro environment. Nonetheless, we held share in our 2 largest categories, chocolate and biscuit. As with Brazil, we remain cautious about the near-term operating environment in Russia, and that also continues to temper our full year outlook.
Asia Pacific grew almost 3%, including about 1 point of vol/mix growth. India, Australia and the Southeast Asian markets all contributed. Chocolate in India was up double digits, driven by vol/mix gains and stable shares in response to increased A&C support behind Cadbury Dairy Milk and continued momentum of our Bubbly innovation platform. Australia was up mid-single digits behind strength in chocolate as we lapped our significant revenue management actions from a year ago and invest in marketing and innovation behind our now more profitable chocolate and biscuit businesses.
China was essentially flat. Biscuits revenue was down, reflecting the overall category slowdown. This was offset somewhat by continued double-digit growth in gum despite a decline in that category as well. We remain cautious about China for the remainder of the year, given the soft consumer environment and category trends.
Europe continued to show sequential improvement, delivering modest growth in the quarter as price gaps narrowed and we selectively invested behind high ROI initiatives. Notably, Europe posted positive volume/mix, with strength in both chocolate and biscuits behind Power Brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and Oreo.
Last, but not least, North America was up about 2.5%, including a couple of points of vol/mix growth. Biscuits grew low single digits, largely through higher vol/mix and share growth of Oreo, belVita and Triscuit. In addition, we launched GOOD THiNS, a new biscuit innovation platform that capitalizes on consumer demand for more wholesome savory snack options. GOOD THiNS are delicious baked crackers made with potatoes, chickpeas or rice, with no artificial ingredients. We launched GOOD THiNS in March and it's already reached a 1.4% share of the U.S. cracker market.
Turning now to our categories. In the first quarter, overall category growth was about 4%. However, given the timing of Easter, retail consumption shifted somewhat from Q2 into Q1. Excluding the Easter shift impact, overall category growth was roughly 3%. Our organic growth was about 1 point below our categories due primarily to our revenue management actions. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, our Power Brands grew about 4%, in line with our categories and drove significant margin expansion. Net-net, building on our Q4 momentum, about 65% of our snacks revenue gained or held share in the first quarter.
Let's look at our performance in each of our categories. Biscuits grew about 2.5%, with notable strength in the U.S. and the U.K. Our share performance was also strong, with around 80% of our biscuits revenue gaining or holding share. Our biscuits Power Brands grew mid-single digits, led by Oreo and belVita. 
In chocolate, while revenue reflected strong growth in the U.K., India and Australia as the markets adjusted to our pricing actions. This was partially offset by soft results in Brazil and Russia. Together, these 2 markets tempered our overall chocolate growth by more than 1.5 points. 
Shares were solid, with about half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share. We're pleased to see our momentum improving as price gaps narrow and our targeted investments pay off. Our performance in the U.K. was especially strong and a sharp turnaround from our share losses through most of 2015. We increased share by nearly 1 point behind increased A&C support and innovation such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Big Taste and Cadbury Dairy Milk Medley.
In Germany, our share decline in the quarter was due solely to cycling the impact of the revenue management actions we implemented in the second quarter last year. As a result, this is the last quarter of impact related to those actions.
Gum & Candy revenue increased almost 3%, led by strong growth of gum in Mexico and China and Sour Patch Kids candy in the U.S. About 60% of our Gum & Candy revenue gained or held share, with gains in Mexico, China and France. While we remain disappointed by continued aggregate gum share declines here in the U.S., we're encouraged to see both Trident and Dentyne growing. In addition, we'll be implementing a Stride turnaround plan later this year.
To summarize, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We delivered solid top line growth and share performance, with improving vol/mix despite continued volatility in some of our largest emerging markets. Our solid top line, together with strong delivery of productivity and cost savings, which Brian will describe in a moment, provided good foundation for delivering our full year forecast.
Before I conclude however, I'd like to pause for a moment to share a few thoughts about Mark Clouse, our Chief Commercial Officer. As you saw in today's press release, Mark will be leaving our company in a few weeks to become CEO of Pinnacle Foods. Mark is a talented executive and a natural leader, who has made significant contributions to every aspect of our business over the last 2 decades, most recently as our Chief Commercial Officer. Mark has proven that he's ready for this next step in his career. We thank him and wish him and his family all the best.
While of course, we will miss Mark, we have a deep leadership team, and I'm confident that they will continue to execute flawlessly. We'll take this opportunity to further simplify and streamline our organization, and so we won't be backfilling the Chief Commercial Officer role. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. Building on Irene's comments, we delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth despite the continued challenging environment.

Building on Irene's comments, we delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth despite the continued challenging environment. Adjusted gross margin increased 170 basis points to 39.7%. Please note that this includes absorbing a 50 basis point headwind related to commodity and currency hedging contracts that don't qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
Our gross margin expansion was driven by net productivity of more than 4% of COGS. That's up from about 3.5% last year and reflects continued progress as we implement integrated Lean Six Sigma and strong execution of our supply chain reinvention program, including installing our state-of-the-art Lines of the Future around the world. In fact, we'll have 4 additional lines operational in our Salinas, Mexico facility by year-end, complementing the 7 lines already in place there. 
You may have also seen that we opened our latest greenfield plant in India on Monday. This plant will produce approximately 60,000 tons of Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate annually to start. By 2020, this multi-category food campus is expected to reach annual capacity of 250,000 tons. 
Adjusted OI margin was 15.1%, up 240 basis points. Drivers of the improvement include the gross margin expansion as well as overhead reductions as we continued to drive ZBB cost savings. We did benefit from the timing of some overhead spending in the quarter that will negatively impact our second quarter, but we're fully on track to deliver our targeted cost savings related to indirect cost packages and the migration of back-office processes to global shared services. We also increased A&C support to more than 9% of revenue to support our Power Brands and drive profitable growth over the long term.
Our cost reduction efforts drove margin improvement across all of our regions, with the exception of Latin America, which was affected by the tough environment in Brazil. In both North America and Europe, the margin improvement was driven by strong net productivity and reduced overheads, offset by stepped-up A&C investments to fuel growth. 
In North America, adjusted OI margin grew 260 basis points to 20.3%. And in Europe, margins were up 390 basis points to 19.7%. As you know, North America and Europe have expanded margins by more than 500 and 600 basis points, respectively, since the end of 2013.
In EEMEA, margin was 11.5%, up 770 basis points versus what was an easy compare. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015, price increases were insufficient to cover the sharp increases in currency-driven input costs. In this quarter, strong net productivity, favorable vol/mix and overhead reductions were the key drivers of our margin expansion. In Asia Pacific, margin expanded 310 basis points to 16.1%. This was driven by continued productivity improvements as well as overhead reductions.
In Latin America, given the challenging macroeconomic environment in Brazil, margin declined 260 basis points to 10.5%. This was largely due to unfavorable vol/mix and currency, which more than offset significant cost reductions.
Now turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant currency basis. The increase was driven by $0.07 of operating gains, including a negative $0.02 impact from mark-to-market and a negative $0.01 from calendar adjustments. Below the operating line, EPS increased $0.05 as lower interest expense, the benefit from a lower share count and lower taxes more than offset the dilution from the coffee deal. Our coffee investments in both JDE and Keurig had solid quarters and delivered in line with our expectations.
In the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders. Specifically, we paid out about $270 million in dividends and purchased $1.2 billion of stock or nearly 229 million shares at an average price of about $41. This amount includes the remaining $500 million of cash received as part of the JDE coffee deal that we committed to use for repurchasing stock. In addition, we opportunistically accelerated a portion of our 2016 buyback program into the first quarter. We continue to expect to buy back approximately $2 billion of stock for the year.
Now turning to our outlook. Given our strong start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2016 outlook and are reaffirming our outlook today. Specifically, we continue to expect to deliver organic revenue growth of at least 2%; adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%, which is an expansion of at least 200 basis points this year; double-digit adjusted EPS growth; and at least $1.4 billion of free cash flow. 
In addition, based on recent spot rates, we expect less of an impact from currency translation. For revenue, we expect currency to be at 3% -- 3 percentage point headwind, down from 6 points. And for EPS, we estimate a $0.05 headwind, down from $0.13. 
We've also updated a couple of other items to help with your financial models. We currently estimate that our interest expense will be $625 million to $650 million, down about $25 million from our previous estimate. Due to some discrete items in the first quarter, we now estimate our full year 2016 tax rate will be in the low 20s, down from the low to mid-20s in our prior outlook. 
While we're not providing quarterly guidance, I would like to call out a few items to keep in mind as you think about our second quarter. First, Q2 was typically our lowest margin quarter, given seasonally lower revenues. Second, as we mentioned earlier, our first quarter benefited from the timing of some overhead spending, which will pressure our second quarter.
Finally, as you may know, collective bargaining agreements covering 8 U.S. facilities expired at the end of February. The affected employees have been working without a contract since that time, while we continue to bargain in good faith with the union. We've shared our last, best and final offer with the union. We believe it's fair and the right solution for both our employees and our business. Until we reach an agreement, we expect to incur some onetime costs as we continue the negotiation, while executing business continuity plans for our North America business. Despite these short-term items, we're executing well and are confident in our business momentum and our ability to deliver on our full year commitments. 
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our strong results in the first quarter. We delivered significant margin expansion, solid organic revenue growth and share performance with Power Brands up 4%, positive vol/mix growth in developed markets and increased investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. We also returned $1.5 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the volatile operating environment, we're on track to deliver our 2016 outlook as well as our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I would tell you, probably, the single biggest impact on the overall category growth is the U.S. It's our biggest biscuit market and we did see that category slowing down. There's a lot of factors that contribute there. Some of our biggest customers are changing some of their merchandising policies, which is having an impact. I think we're still performing quite well within those constraints, but it is having somewhat of an impact on our overall performance. So I think the facts are our revenue in aggregate in North -- our biscuit revenue in North America was up almost 3%. Very strong vol/mix, but the category itself was a little weaker than we had seen. And our approach to that is just to continue to invest in our strong brand, to continue to introduce innovation like Oreo Thins and GOOD THiNS, which are driving very strong results and continuing to leverage the fact that we've got much more flexibility in our packaging capability as a result of the addition of assets like Salinas. So I think we are clearly in charge of the category performance here in the U.S., and we have very strong plans in place to continue to drive that.

We had a good start to the year. We continued to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth, while stepping up organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew more than 2% as we drove our Power Brands,",1424,"Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. We had a good start to the year. We continued to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth, while stepping up organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew more than 2% as we drove our Power Brands, stepped up volume/mix in developed markets, raised prices again to recover currency-driven input costs in emerging markets and continued to eliminate less profitable brands and lower return spending. We expanded adjusted gross profit margin by 170 basis points to 39.7% by driving strong net productivity.
Adjusted operating income margin expanded 240 basis points to 15.1%, as we continued to aggressively reduce overheads, while significantly stepping up A&C support. And finally, adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant currency basis, driven by operating gains.
Let's take a closer look at the details. Organic revenue in Q1 grew just over 2%, in line with our annual guidance. Importantly, the impact from our revenue management actions, which includes reduction and trade optimization, was a little more than 1 percentage point. That's largely consistent with our full year estimate of about 1.25 points, and you'll see in a few minutes how that played through our margins. 
We delivered this growth despite the volatile operating and currency environment that pressured category growth, especially in many of our larger emerging markets. In aggregate, emerging markets were up about 3.5% as we priced to recover currency-driven inflation to protect profitability. 
Along with softening category growth, this pricing had some elasticity impact, which resulted in lower vol/mix in the short term. In contrast, developed markets grew 1.3%. What's noteworthy is that nearly all of this growth was driven by vol/mix, including solid growth in both Europe and North America. 
This reflects the continuation of the improvement in our vol/mix contribution as the cost environment has moderated since early 2015. Power Brands continue to drive our growth. They were up nearly 4%, in line with our categories. The shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter provided us with only a modest benefit, given that Easter was only 1 week earlier than last year.
Turning now to our results by region. Despite the challenging environment, every region contributed to revenue growth, with 3 of them also delivering positive vol/mix. Latin America was up nearly 4%, all due to pricing in response to currency-driven inflation in Argentina and Brazil. Brazil was down low to mid-single-digits as the deteriorating political and economic environment pressured category growth. We expect operating conditions in Brazil to remain challenging for the balance of the year, and that's reflected in our current outlook. In contrast, Mexico, our second-largest market in the region, was a bright spot. Revenue was up high single-digits, driven by strong volume and share growth in gum.
EEMEA grew 4.5%, all driven by pricing, in response to continued currency-driven inflation in several markets. Political and economic instability in several countries tempered category growth. Russia grew low single-digits as higher pricing was mostly offset by elasticity and softer consumption due to the macro environment. Nonetheless, we held share in our 2 largest categories, chocolate and biscuits. As with Brazil, we remain cautious about the near-term operating environment in Russia, and that also continues to temper our full year outlook.
Asia Pacific grew almost 3%, including about 1 point of vol/mix growth. India, Australia and the Southeast Asian markets all contributed. Chocolate in India was up double-digits, driven by vol/mix gains and stable shares in response to increased A&C support behind Cadbury Dairy Milk and continued momentum of our Bubbly innovation platform. Australia was up mid-single-digits behind strength in chocolate as we lapped our significant revenue management actions from a year ago and invest in marketing and innovation behind our now more profitable chocolate and biscuit businesses.
China was essentially flat. Biscuits revenue was down, reflecting the overall category slowdown. This was offset somewhat by continued double-digit growth in gum despite a decline in that category as well. We remain cautious about China for the remainder of the year, given the soft consumer environment and category trends.
Europe continued to show sequential improvement, delivering modest growth in the quarter as price gaps narrowed and we selectively invested behind high ROI initiatives. Notably, Europe posted positive volume/mix, with strength in both chocolate and biscuits behind Power Brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and Oreo.
Last, but not least, North America was up about 2.5%, including a couple of points of vol/mix growth. Biscuits grew low single-digits, largely through higher vol/mix and share growth of Oreo, belVita and Triscuit. In addition, we launched GOOD THiNS, a new biscuit innovation platform that capitalizes on consumer demand for more wholesome savory snack options. GOOD THiNS are delicious baked crackers made with potatoes, chickpeas or rice, with no artificial ingredients. We launched GOOD THiNS in March, and it's already reached a 1.4% share of the U.S. cracker market.
Turning now to our categories. In the first quarter, overall category growth was about 4%. However, given the timing of Easter, retail consumption shifted somewhat from Q2 into Q1. Excluding the Easter shift impact, overall category growth was roughly 3%. Our organic growth was about 1 point below our categories, due primarily to our revenue management actions. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, our Power Brands grew about 4%, in line with our categories and drove significant margin expansion. Net-net, building on our Q4 momentum, about 65% of our snacks revenue gained or held share in the first quarter.
Let's look at our performance in each of our categories. Biscuits grew about 2.5%, with notable strength in the U.S. and the U.K. Our share performance was also strong, with around 80% of our biscuits revenue gaining or holding share. Our biscuits Power Brands grew mid-single digits, led by Oreo and belVita. 
In chocolate, our revenue reflected strong growth in the U.K., India and Australia as the markets adjusted to our pricing actions. This was partially offset by soft results in Brazil and Russia. Together, these 2 markets tempered our overall chocolate growth by more than 1.5 points. 
Shares were solid, with about half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share. We're pleased to see our momentum improving as price gaps narrow and our targeted investments pay off. Our performance in the U.K. was especially strong and a sharp turnaround from our share losses through most of 2015. We increased share by nearly 1 point behind increased A&C support and innovation such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Big Taste and Cadbury Dairy Milk Medley.
In Germany, our share decline in the quarter was due solely to cycling the impact of the revenue management actions we implemented in the second quarter last year. As a result, this is the last quarter of impact related to those actions.
Gum & Candy revenue increased almost 3%, led by strong growth of gum in Mexico and China and Sour Patch Kids candy in the U.S. About 60% of our Gum & Candy revenue gained or held share, with gains in Mexico, China and France. While we remain disappointed by continued aggregate gum share declines here in the U.S., we're encouraged to see both Trident and Dentyne growing. In addition, we'll be implementing a Stride turnaround plan later this year.
To summarize, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We delivered solid top line growth and share performance, with improving vol/mix, despite continued volatility in some of our largest emerging markets. Our solid top line, together with strong delivery of productivity and cost savings, which Brian will describe in a moment, provide a good foundation for delivering our full year forecast.
Before I conclude, however, I'd like to pause for a moment to share a few thoughts about Mark Clouse, our Chief Commercial Officer. As you saw in today's press release, Mark will be leaving our company in a few weeks to become CEO of Pinnacle Foods. Mark is a talented executive and a natural leader, who has made significant contributions to every aspect of our business over the last 2 decades, most recently as our Chief Commercial Officer. Mark has proven that he's ready for this next step in his career. We thank him and wish him and his family all the best.
While of course, we will miss Mark, we have a deep leadership team, and I'm confident that they will continue to execute flawlessly. We'll take this opportunity to further simplify and streamline our organization, and so we won't be backfilling the Chief Commercial Officer role. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brian."

Building on Irene's comments, we delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth despite the continued challenging environment. Adjusted gross margin increased 170 basis points to 39.7%. Please note that this includes absorbing a 50 basis point headwind related to commodity and currency hedging contracts that don't qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
Our gross margin expansion was driven by net productivity of more than 4% of COGS. That's up from about 3.5% last year and reflects continued progress as we implement integrated Lean Six Sigma and strong execution of our supply chain reinvention program, including installing our state-of-the-art Lines of the Future around the world. In fact, we'll have 4 additional lines operational in our Salinas, Mexico, facility by year-end, complementing the 7 lines already in place there. 
You may have also seen that we opened our latest greenfield plant in India on Monday. This plant will produce approximately 60,000 tons of Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate annually to start. By 2020, this multi-category food campus is expected to reach annual capacity of 250,000 tons. 
Adjusted OI margin was 15.1%, up 240 basis points. Drivers of the improvement include the gross margin expansion as well as overhead reductions as we continue to drive ZBB cost savings. We did benefit from the timing of some overhead spending in the quarter that will negatively impact our second quarter, but we're fully on track to deliver our targeted cost savings related to indirect cost packages and the migration of back-office processes to global shared services. We also increased A&C support to more than 9% of revenue to support our Power Brands and drive profitable growth over the long term.
Our cost reduction efforts drove margin improvement across all of our regions, with the exception of Latin America, which was affected by the tough environment in Brazil. In both North America and Europe, the margin improvement was driven by strong net productivity and reduced overheads, offset by stepped-up A&C investments to fuel growth. 
In North America, adjusted OI margin grew 260 basis points to 20.3%. And in Europe, margins were up 390 basis points to 19.7%. As you know, North America and Europe have expanded margins by more than 500 and 600 basis points, respectively, since the end of 2013.
In EEMEA, margin was 11.5%, up 770 basis points versus what was an easy compare. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015, price increases were insufficient to cover the sharp increases in currency-driven input costs. In this quarter, strong net productivity, favorable vol/mix and overhead reductions were the key drivers of our margin expansion. In Asia Pacific, margin expanded 310 basis points to 16.1%. This was driven by continued productivity improvements as well as overhead reductions.
In Latin America, given the challenging macroeconomic environment in Brazil, margin declined 260 basis points to 10.5%. This was largely due to unfavorable vol/mix and currency, which more than offset significant cost reductions.
Now turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant currency basis. The increase was driven by $0.07 of operating gains, including a negative $0.02 impact from mark-to-market and a negative $0.01 from calendar adjustments. Below the operating line, EPS increased $0.05 as lower interest expense, the benefit from a lower share count and lower taxes more than offset the dilution from the coffee deal. Our coffee investments in both JDE and Keurig had solid quarters and delivered in line with our expectations.
In the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders. Specifically, we paid out about $270 million in dividends and purchased $1.2 billion of stock or nearly 29 million shares at an average price of about $41. This amount includes the remaining $500 million of cash received as part of the JDE coffee deal that we committed to use for repurchasing stock. In addition, we opportunistically accelerated a portion of our 2016 buyback program into the first quarter. We continue to expect to buy back approximately $2 billion of stock for the year.
Now turning to our outlook. Given our strong start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2016 outlook and are reaffirming our outlook today. Specifically, we continue to expect to deliver organic revenue growth of at least 2%; adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%, which is an expansion of at least 200 basis points this year; double-digit adjusted EPS growth; and at least $1.4 billion of free cash flow. 
In addition, based on recent spot rates, we expect less of an impact from currency translation. For revenue, we expect currency to be a 3% -- 3 percentage point headwind, down from 6 points. And for EPS, we estimate a $0.05 headwind, down from $0.13. 
We've also updated a couple of other items to help with your financial models. We currently estimate that our interest expense will be $625 million to $650 million, down about $25 million from our previous estimate. Due to some discrete items in the first quarter, we now estimate our full year 2016 tax rate will be in the low 20s, down from the low to mid-20s in our prior outlook. 
While we're not providing quarterly guidance, I would like to call out a few items to keep in mind as you think about our second quarter. First, Q2 was typically our lowest margin quarter, given seasonally lower revenues. Second, as we mentioned earlier, our first quarter benefited from the timing of some overhead spending, which will pressure our second quarter.
Finally, as you may know, collective bargaining agreements covering 8 U.S. facilities expired at the end of February. The affected employees have been working without a contract since that time, while we continue to bargain in good faith with the union. We've shared our last, best and final offer with the union. We believe it's fair and the right solution for both our employees and our business. Until we reach an agreement, we expect to incur some onetime costs as we continue the negotiation, while executing business continuity plans for our North America business. Despite these short-term items, we're executing well and are confident in our business momentum and our ability to deliver on our full year commitments. 
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our strong results in the first quarter. We delivered significant margin expansion, solid organic revenue growth and share performance, with Power Brands up 4%, positive vol/mix growth in developed markets and increased investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. We also returned $1.5 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the volatile operating environment, we're on track to deliver our 2016 outlook as well as our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I would tell you that probably the single biggest impact on the overall category growth is the U.S. It's our biggest biscuit market, and we did see that category slowing down. There's a lot of factors that contribute there. Some of our biggest customers are changing some of their merchandising policies, which is having an impact. I think we're still performing quite well within those constraints, but it is having somewhat of an impact on our overall performance. So I think the facts are our revenue in aggregate in North -- our biscuit revenue in North America was up almost 3%. Very strong vol/mix, but the category itself was a little weaker than we had seen. And our approach to that is just to continue to invest in our strong brand, to continue to introduce innovation like Oreo Thins and GOOD THiNS, which are driving very strong results and continuing to leverage the fact that we've got much more flexibility in our packaging capability as a result of the addition of assets like Salinas. So I think we are clearly in charge of the category performance here in the U.S., and we have very strong plans in place to continue to drive that.

First, you've talked in recent quarters about the potential to begin to rebuild margins in some of your key emerging market regions. And I think the expectation was that this could be more of a 2017 and '18 dynamic. We're still seeing headwinds in Eastern Europe and Latin America, but in Asia during the quarter, margins recovered pretty sharply and were at an all-time high at around 16%. So just curious, Brian, I guess, what drove the margin performance there, whether that was market mix or more sustainable recovery that we could see carry forward through the year."

But I do think it's the fundamental work that we're doing on getting net productivity to flow through and gross margins improving, while these regions are also doing ZBB and implementing shared services and all the things that are helping us reduce overhead. So the fundamental cost structure of the regions has gotten better. If we can get pricing right in the markets, we'll see improvement there. And that's what we saw in both EEMEA and Asia Pacific in the quarter, and Latin America was really the pricing challenge and the currency dynamics in Brazil that hurt us. So good progress there, but it's the same fundamental game plan and initiatives that are driving margins everywhere."

We had a good start to the year. We continued to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth, while stepping up organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew more than 2% as we drove our Power Brands,",1425,"Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. We had a good start to the year. We continued to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth, while stepping up organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew more than 2% as we drove our Power Brands, stepped up volume/mix in developed markets, raised prices again to recover currency-driven input costs in emerging markets and continued to eliminate less profitable brands and lower return spending. We expanded adjusted gross profit margin by 170 basis points to 39.7% by driving strong net productivity.
Adjusted operating income margin expanded 240 basis points to 15.1%, as we continued to aggressively reduce overheads, while significantly stepping up A&C support. And finally, adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant currency basis, driven by operating gains.
Let's take a closer look at the details. Organic revenue in Q1 grew just over 2%, in line with our annual guidance. Importantly, the impact from our revenue management actions, which includes SKU reduction and trade optimization, was a little more than 1 percentage point. That's largely consistent with our full year estimate of about 1.25 points, and you'll see in a few minutes how that played through our margins. 
We delivered this growth despite the volatile operating and currency environment that pressured category growth, especially in many of our larger emerging markets. In aggregate, emerging markets were up about 3.5% as we priced to recover currency-driven inflation to protect profitability. 
Along with softening category growth, this pricing had some elasticity impact, which resulted in lower vol/mix in the short term. In contrast, developed markets grew 1.3%. What's noteworthy is that nearly all of this growth was driven by vol/mix, including solid growth in both Europe and North America. 
This reflects the continuation of the improvement in our vol/mix contribution as the cost environment has moderated since early 2015. Power Brands continue to drive our growth. They were up nearly 4%, in line with our categories. The shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter provided us with only a modest benefit, given that Easter was only 1 week earlier than last year.
Turning now to our results by region. Despite the challenging environment, every region contributed to revenue growth, with 3 of them also delivering positive vol/mix. Latin America was up nearly 4%, all due to pricing in response to currency-driven inflation in Argentina and Brazil. Brazil was down low to mid-single-digits as the deteriorating political and economic environment pressured category growth. We expect operating conditions in Brazil to remain challenging for the balance of the year, and that's reflected in our current outlook. In contrast, Mexico, our second-largest market in the region, was a bright spot. Revenue was up high single-digits, driven by strong volume and share growth in gum.
EEMEA grew 4.5%, all driven by pricing, in response to continued currency-driven inflation in several markets. Political and economic instability in several countries tempered category growth. Russia grew low single-digits as higher pricing was mostly offset by elasticity and softer consumption due to the macro environment. Nonetheless, we held share in our 2 largest categories, chocolate and biscuits. As with Brazil, we remain cautious about the near-term operating environment in Russia, and that also continues to temper our full year outlook.
Asia Pacific grew almost 3%, including about 1 point of vol/mix growth. India, Australia and the Southeast Asian markets all contributed. Chocolate in India was up double-digits, driven by vol/mix gains and stable shares in response to increased A&C support behind Cadbury Dairy Milk and continued momentum of our Bubbly innovation platform. Australia was up mid-single-digits behind strength in chocolate as we lapped our significant revenue management actions from a year ago and invest in marketing and innovation behind our now more profitable chocolate and biscuit businesses.
China was essentially flat. Biscuits revenue was down, reflecting the overall category slowdown. This was offset somewhat by continued double-digit growth in gum despite a decline in that category as well. We remain cautious about China for the remainder of the year, given the soft consumer environment and category trends.
Europe continued to show sequential improvement, delivering modest growth in the quarter as price gaps narrowed and we selectively invested behind high ROI initiatives. Notably, Europe posted positive volume/mix, with strength in both chocolate and biscuits behind Power Brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and Oreo.
Last, but not least, North America was up about 2.5%, including a couple of points of vol/mix growth. Biscuits grew low single-digits, largely through higher vol/mix and share growth of Oreo, belVita and Triscuit. In addition, we launched GOOD THiNS, a new biscuit innovation platform that capitalizes on consumer demand for more wholesome savory snack options. GOOD THiNS are delicious baked crackers made with potatoes, chickpeas or rice, with no artificial ingredients. We launched GOOD THiNS in March, and it's already reached a 1.4% share of the U.S. cracker market.
Turning now to our categories. In the first quarter, overall category growth was about 4%. However, given the timing of Easter, retail consumption shifted somewhat from Q2 into Q1. Excluding the Easter shift impact, overall category growth was roughly 3%. Our organic growth was about 1 point below our categories, due primarily to our revenue management actions. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, our Power Brands grew about 4%, in line with our categories and drove significant margin expansion. Net-net, building on our Q4 momentum, about 65% of our snacks revenue gained or held share in the first quarter.
Let's look at our performance in each of our categories. Biscuits grew about 2.5%, with notable strength in the U.S. and the U.K. Our share performance was also strong, with around 80% of our biscuits revenue gaining or holding share. Our biscuits Power Brands grew mid-single digits, led by Oreo and belVita. 
In chocolate, our revenue reflected strong growth in the U.K., India and Australia as the markets adjusted to our pricing actions. This was partially offset by soft results in Brazil and Russia. Together, these 2 markets tempered our overall chocolate growth by more than 1.5 points. 
Shares were solid, with about half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share. We're pleased to see our momentum improving as price gaps narrow and our targeted investments pay off. Our performance in the U.K. was especially strong and a sharp turnaround from our share losses through most of 2015. We increased share by nearly 1 point behind increased A&C support and innovation such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Big Taste and Cadbury Dairy Milk Medley.
In Germany, our share decline in the quarter was due solely to cycling the impact of the revenue management actions we implemented in the second quarter last year. As a result, this is the last quarter of impact related to those actions.
Gum & Candy revenue increased almost 3%, led by strong growth of gum in Mexico and China and Sour Patch Kids candy in the U.S. About 60% of our Gum & Candy revenue gained or held share, with gains in Mexico, China and France. While we remain disappointed by continued aggregate gum share declines here in the U.S., we're encouraged to see both Trident and Dentyne growing. In addition, we'll be implementing a Stride turnaround plan later this year.
To summarize, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We delivered solid top line growth and share performance, with improving vol/mix, despite continued volatility in some of our largest emerging markets. Our solid top line, together with strong delivery of productivity and cost savings, which Brian will describe in a moment, provide a good foundation for delivering our full year forecast.
Before I conclude, however, I'd like to pause for a moment to share a few thoughts about Mark Clouse, our Chief Commercial Officer. As you saw in today's press release, Mark will be leaving our company in a few weeks to become CEO of Pinnacle Foods. Mark is a talented executive and a natural leader, who has made significant contributions to every aspect of our business over the last 2 decades, most recently as our Chief Commercial Officer. Mark has proven that he's ready for this next step in his career. We thank him and wish him and his family all the best.
While of course, we will miss Mark, we have a deep leadership team, and I'm confident that they will continue to execute flawlessly. We'll take this opportunity to further simplify and streamline our organization, and so we won't be backfilling the Chief Commercial Officer role. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brian."
739693,330022118,965185,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on Irene's comments, we delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth despite the continued challenging environment. Adjusted gross margin increased 170 basis points to 39.7%. Please note that this i",1134,"Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on Irene's comments, we delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth despite the continued challenging environment. Adjusted gross margin increased 170 basis points to 39.7%. Please note that this includes absorbing a 50 basis point headwind related to commodity and currency hedging contracts that don't qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
Our gross margin expansion was driven by net productivity of more than 4% of COGS. That's up from about 3.5% last year and reflects continued progress as we implement integrated Lean Six Sigma and strong execution of our supply chain reinvention program, including installing our state-of-the-art Lines of the Future around the world. In fact, we'll have 4 additional lines operational in our Salinas, Mexico, facility by year-end, complementing the 7 lines already in place there. 
You may have also seen that we opened our latest greenfield plant in India on Monday. This plant will produce approximately 60,000 tons of Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate annually to start. By 2020, this multi-category food campus is expected to reach annual capacity of 250,000 tons. 
Adjusted OI margin was 15.1%, up 240 basis points. Drivers of the improvement include the gross margin expansion as well as overhead reductions as we continue to drive ZBB cost savings. We did benefit from the timing of some overhead spending in the quarter that will negatively impact our second quarter, but we're fully on track to deliver our targeted cost savings related to indirect cost packages and the migration of back-office processes to global shared services. We also increased A&C support to more than 9% of revenue to support our Power Brands and drive profitable growth over the long term.
Our cost reduction efforts drove margin improvement across all of our regions, with the exception of Latin America, which was affected by the tough environment in Brazil. In both North America and Europe, the margin improvement was driven by strong net productivity and reduced overheads, offset by stepped-up A&C investments to fuel growth. 
In North America, adjusted OI margin grew 260 basis points to 20.3%. And in Europe, margins were up 390 basis points to 19.7%. As you know, North America and Europe have expanded margins by more than 500 and 600 basis points, respectively, since the end of 2013.
In EEMEA, margin was 11.5%, up 770 basis points versus what was an easy compare. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015, price increases were insufficient to cover the sharp increases in currency-driven input costs. In this quarter, strong net productivity, favorable vol/mix and overhead reductions were the key drivers of our margin expansion. In Asia Pacific, margin expanded 310 basis points to 16.1%. This was driven by continued productivity improvements as well as overhead reductions.
In Latin America, given the challenging macroeconomic environment in Brazil, margin declined 260 basis points to 10.5%. This was largely due to unfavorable vol/mix and currency, which more than offset significant cost reductions.
Now turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant currency basis. The increase was driven by $0.07 of operating gains, including a negative $0.02 impact from mark-to-market and a negative $0.01 from calendar adjustments. Below the operating line, EPS increased $0.05 as lower interest expense, the benefit from a lower share count and lower taxes more than offset the dilution from the coffee deal. Our coffee investments in both JDE and Keurig had solid quarters and delivered in line with our expectations.
In the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders. Specifically, we paid out about $270 million in dividends and purchased $1.2 billion of stock or nearly 29 million shares at an average price of about $41. This amount includes the remaining $500 million of cash received as part of the JDE coffee deal that we committed to use for repurchasing stock. In addition, we opportunistically accelerated a portion of our 2016 buyback program into the first quarter. We continue to expect to buy back approximately $2 billion of stock for the year.
Now turning to our outlook. Given our strong start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2016 outlook and are reaffirming our outlook today. Specifically, we continue to expect to deliver organic revenue growth of at least 2%; adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%, which is an expansion of at least 200 basis points this year; double-digit adjusted EPS growth; and at least $1.4 billion of free cash flow. 
In addition, based on recent spot rates, we expect less of an impact from currency translation. For revenue, we expect currency to be a 3% -- 3 percentage point headwind, down from 6 points. And for EPS, we estimate a $0.05 headwind, down from $0.13. 
We've also updated a couple of other items to help with your financial models. We currently estimate that our interest expense will be $625 million to $650 million, down about $25 million from our previous estimate. Due to some discrete items in the first quarter, we now estimate our full year 2016 tax rate will be in the low 20s, down from the low to mid-20s in our prior outlook. 
While we're not providing quarterly guidance, I would like to call out a few items to keep in mind as you think about our second quarter. First, Q2 was typically our lowest margin quarter, given seasonally lower revenues. Second, as we mentioned earlier, our first quarter benefited from the timing of some overhead spending, which will pressure our second quarter.
Finally, as you may know, collective bargaining agreements covering 8 U.S. facilities expired at the end of February. The affected employees have been working without a contract since that time, while we continue to bargain in good faith with the union. We've shared our last, best and final offer with the union. We believe it's fair and the right solution for both our employees and our business. Until we reach an agreement, we expect to incur some onetime costs as we continue the negotiation, while executing business continuity plans for our North America business. Despite these short-term items, we're executing well and are confident in our business momentum and our ability to deliver on our full year commitments. 
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our strong results in the first quarter. We delivered significant margin expansion, solid organic revenue growth and share performance, with Power Brands up 4%, positive vol/mix growth in developed markets and increased investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. We also returned $1.5 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the volatile operating environment, we're on track to deliver our 2016 outlook as well as our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Interest expense, as I signaled in the comments, we're telling you it goes down by about $25 million for the year. It reflects the lower run rate we're seeing in some of the refinancing activities we had in the first quarter and a little bit of currency. We're not necessarily dropping that through in terms of the outlook, but it does provide a little bit of an opportunity there."

I would tell you that probably the single biggest impact on the overall category growth is the U.S. It's our biggest biscuit market, and we did see that category slowing down. There's a lot of factors that contribute there. Some of our biggest customers are changing some of their merchandising policies, which is having an impact. I think we're still performing quite well within those constraints, but it is having somewhat of an impact on our overall performance. So I think the facts are our revenue in aggregate in North -- our biscuit revenue in North America was up almost 3%. Very strong vol/mix, but the category itself was a little weaker than we had seen. And our approach to that is just to continue to invest in our strong brand, to continue to introduce innovation like Oreo Thins and GOOD THiNS, which are driving very strong results and continuing to leverage the fact that we've got much more flexibility in our packaging capability as a result of the addition of assets like Salinas. So I think we are clearly in charge of the category performance here in the U.S., and we have very strong plans in place to continue to drive that. So I would not read anything more than that into these results."

We had a good start to the year. We continued to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth, while stepping up organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew more than 2% as we drove our Power Brands,",1430,"Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. We had a good start to the year. We continued to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth, while stepping up organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew more than 2% as we drove our Power Brands, stepped up volume/mix in developed markets, raised prices again to recover currency-driven input costs in emerging markets and continued to eliminate less profitable brands and lower return spending. We expanded adjusted gross profit margin by 170 basis points to 39.7% by driving strong net productivity.
Adjusted operating income margin expanded 240 basis points to 15.1%, as we continued to aggressively reduce overheads, while significantly stepping up A&C support. And finally, adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant currency basis, driven by operating gains.
Let's take a closer look at the details. Organic revenue in Q1 grew just over 2%, in line with our annual guidance. Importantly, the impact from our revenue management actions, which includes SKU reduction and trade optimization, was a little more than 1 percentage point. That's largely consistent with our full year estimate of about 1.25 points, and you'll see in a few minutes how that played through our margins. 
We delivered this growth despite the volatile operating and currency environment that pressured category growth, especially in many of our larger emerging markets. In aggregate, emerging markets were up about 3.5% as we priced to recover currency-driven inflation to protect profitability. 
Along with softening category growth, this pricing had some elasticity impact, which resulted in lower vol/mix in the short term. In contrast, developed markets grew 1.3%. What's noteworthy is that nearly all of this growth was driven by vol/mix, including solid growth in both Europe and North America. 
This reflects the continuation of the improvement in our vol/mix contribution as the cost environment has moderated since early 2015. Power Brands continue to drive our growth. They were up nearly 4%, in line with our categories. The shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter provided us with only a modest benefit, given that Easter was only 1 week earlier than last year.
Turning now to our results by region. Despite the challenging environment, every region contributed to revenue growth, with 3 of them also delivering positive vol/mix. Latin America was up nearly 4%, all due to pricing in response to currency-driven inflation in Argentina and Brazil. Brazil was down low to mid-single digits as the deteriorating political and economic environment pressured category growth. We expect operating conditions in Brazil to remain challenging for the balance of the year, and that's reflected in our current outlook. In contrast, Mexico, our second-largest market in the region, was a bright spot. Revenue was up high single digits, driven by strong volume and share growth in gum.
EEMEA grew 4.5%, all driven by pricing, in response to continued currency-driven inflation in several markets. Political and economic instability in several countries tempered category growth. Russia grew low single digits as higher pricing was mostly offset by elasticity and softer consumption due to the macro environment. Nonetheless, we held share in our 2 largest categories, chocolate and biscuits. As with Brazil, we remain cautious about the near-term operating environment in Russia, and that also continues to temper our full year outlook.
Asia Pacific grew almost 3%, including about 1 point of vol/mix growth. India, Australia and the Southeast Asian markets all contributed. Chocolate in India was up double-digits, driven by vol/mix gains and stable shares in response to increased A&C support behind Cadbury Dairy Milk and continued momentum of our Bubbly innovation platform. Australia was up mid-single digits behind strength in chocolate as we lapped our significant revenue management actions from a year ago and invest in marketing and innovation behind our now more profitable chocolate and biscuit businesses.
China was essentially flat. Biscuits revenue was down, reflecting the overall category slowdown. This was offset somewhat by continued double-digit growth in gum despite a decline in that category as well. We remain cautious about China for the remainder of the year, given the soft consumer environment and category trends.
Europe continued to show sequential improvement, delivering modest growth in the quarter as price gaps narrowed and we selectively invested behind high ROI initiatives. Notably, Europe posted positive volume/mix, with strength in both chocolate and biscuits behind Power Brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and Oreo.
Last, but not least, North America was up about 2.5%, including a couple of points of vol/mix growth. Biscuits grew low single digits, largely through higher vol/mix and share growth of Oreo, belVita and Triscuit. In addition, we launched GOOD THiNS, a new biscuit innovation platform that capitalizes on consumer demand for more wholesome savory snack options. GOOD THiNS are delicious baked crackers made with potatoes, chickpeas or rice, with no artificial ingredients. We launched GOOD THiNS in March, and it's already reached a 1.4% share of the U.S. cracker market.
Turning now to our categories. In the first quarter, overall category growth was about 4%. However, given the timing of Easter, retail consumption shifted somewhat from Q2 into Q1. Excluding the Easter shift impact, overall category growth was roughly 3%. Our organic growth was about 1 point below our categories, due primarily to our revenue management actions. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, our Power Brands grew about 4%, in line with our categories and drove significant margin expansion. Net-net, building on our Q4 momentum, about 65% of our snacks revenue gained or held share in the first quarter.
Let's look at our performance in each of our categories. Biscuits grew about 2.5%, with notable strength in the U.S. and the U.K. Our share performance was also strong, with around 80% of our biscuits revenue gaining or holding share. Our biscuits Power Brands grew mid-single digits, led by Oreo and belVita. 
In chocolate, our revenue reflected strong growth in the U.K., India and Australia as the markets adjusted to our pricing actions. This was partially offset by soft results in Brazil and Russia. Together, these 2 markets tempered our overall chocolate growth by more than 1.5 points. 
Shares were solid, with about half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share. We're pleased to see our momentum improving as price gaps narrow and our targeted investments pay off. Our performance in the U.K. was especially strong and a sharp turnaround from our share losses through most of 2015. We increased share by nearly 1 point behind increased A&C support and innovation such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Big Taste and Cadbury Dairy Milk Medley.
In Germany, our share decline in the quarter was due solely to cycling the impact of the revenue management actions we implemented in the second quarter last year. As a result, this is the last quarter of impact related to those actions.
Gum & Candy revenue increased almost 3%, led by strong growth of gum in Mexico and China and Sour Patch Kids candy in the U.S. About 60% of our Gum & Candy revenue gained or held share, with gains in Mexico, China and France. While we remain disappointed by continued aggregate gum share declines here in the U.S., we're encouraged to see both Trident and Dentyne growing. In addition, we'll be implementing a Stride turnaround plan later this year.
To summarize, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We delivered solid top line growth and share performance, with improving vol/mix, despite continued volatility in some of our largest emerging markets. Our solid top line, together with strong delivery of productivity and cost savings, which Brian will describe in a moment, provide a good foundation for delivering our full year forecast.
Before I conclude, however, I'd like to pause for a moment to share a few thoughts about Mark Clouse, our Chief Commercial Officer. As you saw in today's press release, Mark will be leaving our company in a few weeks to become CEO of Pinnacle Foods. Mark is a talented executive and a natural leader, who has made significant contributions to every aspect of our business over the last 2 decades, most recently as our Chief Commercial Officer. Mark has proven that he's ready for this next step in his career. We thank him and wish him and his family all the best.
While of course, we will miss Mark, we have a deep leadership team, and I'm confident that they will continue to execute flawlessly. We'll take this opportunity to further simplify and streamline our organization, and so we won't be backfilling the Chief Commercial Officer role. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brian."
739693,330022118,965309,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on Irene's comments, we delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth despite the continued challenging environment.

Building on Irene's comments, we delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth despite the continued challenging environment. Adjusted gross margin increased 170 basis points to 39.7%. Please note that this includes absorbing a 50 basis point headwind related to commodity and currency hedging contracts that don't qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
Our gross margin expansion was driven by net productivity of more than 4% of COGS. That's up from about 3.5% last year and reflects continued progress as we implement integrated Lean Six Sigma and strong execution of our supply chain reinvention program, including installing our state-of-the-art Lines of the Future around the world. In fact, we'll have 4 additional lines operational in our Salinas, Mexico, facility by year-end, complementing the 7 lines already in place there. 
You may have also seen that we opened our latest greenfield plant in India on Monday. This plant will produce approximately 60,000 tons of Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate annually to start. By 2020, this multi-category food campus is expected to reach annual capacity of 250,000 tons. 
Adjusted OI margin was 15.1%, up 240 basis points. Drivers of the improvement include the gross margin expansion as well as overhead reductions as we continue to drive ZBB cost savings. We did benefit from the timing of some overhead spending in the quarter that will negatively impact our second quarter, but we're fully on track to deliver our targeted cost savings related to indirect cost packages and the migration of back-office processes to global shared services. We also increased A&C support to more than 9% of revenue to support our Power Brands and drive profitable growth over the long term.
Our cost reduction efforts drove margin improvement across all of our regions, with the exception of Latin America, which was affected by the tough environment in Brazil. In both North America and Europe, the margin improvement was driven by strong net productivity and reduced overheads, offset by stepped-up A&C investments to fuel growth. 
In North America, adjusted OI margin grew 260 basis points to 20.3%. And in Europe, margins were up 390 basis points to 19.7%. As you know, North America and Europe have expanded margins by more than 500 and 600 basis points, respectively, since the end of 2013.
In EEMEA, margin was 11.5%, up 770 basis points versus what was an easy compare. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015, price increases were insufficient to cover the sharp increases in currency-driven input costs. In this quarter, strong net productivity, favorable vol/mix and overhead reductions were the key drivers of our margin expansion. In Asia Pacific, margin expanded 310 basis points to 16.1%. This was driven by continued productivity improvements as well as overhead reductions.
In Latin America, given the challenging macroeconomic environment in Brazil, margin declined 260 basis points to 10.5%. This was largely due to unfavorable vol/mix and currency, which more than offset significant cost reductions.
Now turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant currency basis. The increase was driven by $0.07 of operating gains, including a negative $0.02 impact from mark-to-market and a negative $0.01 from calendar adjustments. Below the operating line, EPS increased $0.05 as lower interest expense, the benefit from a lower share count and lower taxes more than offset the dilution from the coffee deal. Our coffee investments in both JDE and Keurig had solid quarters and delivered in line with our expectations.
In the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders. Specifically, we paid out about $270 million in dividends and purchased $1.2 billion of stock or nearly 2 -- 29 million shares at an average price of about $41. This amount includes the remaining $500 million of cash received as part of the JDE coffee deal that we committed to use for repurchasing stock. In addition, we opportunistically accelerated a portion of our 2016 buyback program into the first quarter. We continue to expect to buy back approximately $2 billion of stock for the year.
Now turning to our outlook. Given our strong start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2016 outlook and are reaffirming our outlook today. Specifically, we continue to expect to deliver organic revenue growth of at least 2%; adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%, which is an expansion of at least 200 basis points this year; double-digit adjusted EPS growth; and at least $1.4 billion of free cash flow. 
In addition, based on recent spot rates, we expect less of an impact from currency translation. For revenue, we expect currency to be a 3% -- 3 percentage point headwind, down from 6 points. And for EPS, we estimate a $0.05 headwind, down from $0.13. 
We've also updated a couple of other items to help with your financial models. We currently estimate that our interest expense will be $625 million to $650 million, down about $25 million from our previous estimate. Due to some discrete items in the first quarter, we now estimate our full year 2016 tax rate will be in the low 20s, down from the low to mid-20s in our prior outlook. 
While we're not providing quarterly guidance, I would like to call out a few items to keep in mind as you think about our second quarter. First, Q2 was typically our lowest margin quarter, given seasonally lower revenues. Second, as we mentioned earlier, our first quarter benefited from the timing of some overhead spending, which will pressure our second quarter.
Finally, as you may know, collective bargaining agreements covering 8 U.S. facilities expired at the end of February. The affected employees have been working without a contract since that time, while we continue to bargain in good faith with the union. We've shared our last, best and final offer with the union. We believe it's fair and the right solution for both our employees and our business. Until we reach an agreement, we expect to incur some onetime costs as we continue the negotiation, while executing business continuity plans for our North America business. Despite these short-term items, we're executing well and are confident in our business momentum and our ability to deliver on our full year commitments. 
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our strong results in the first quarter. We delivered significant margin expansion, solid organic revenue growth and share performance, with Power Brands up 4%, positive vol/mix growth in developed markets and increased investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. We also returned $1.5 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the volatile operating environment, we're on track to deliver our 2016 outlook as well as our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I would tell you that probably the single biggest impact on the overall category growth is the U.S. It's our biggest biscuit market, and we did see that category slowing down. There's a lot of factors that contribute there. Some of our biggest customers are changing some of their merchandising policies, which is having an impact. I think we're still performing quite well within those constraints, but it is having somewhat of an impact on our overall performance. So I think the facts are our revenue in aggregate in North -- our biscuit revenue in North America was up almost 3%. Very strong vol/mix, but the category itself was a little weaker than we had seen. And our approach to that is just to continue to invest in our strong brand, to continue to introduce innovation like Oreo Thins and GOOD THiNS, which are driving very strong results and continuing to leverage the fact that we've got much more flexibility in our packaging capability as a result of the addition of assets like Salinas. So I think we are clearly in charge of the category performance here in the U.S., and we have very strong plans in place to continue to drive that.

We have an announced transaction that was in the press involving parts of our French business we sold to Eurazeo, which for us, these are a very rational set of actions that are consistent with our agenda here. So we focused on Power Brands in our portfolio. We simplify our supply chain, and it allows us to invest behind the brands that have the highest return. So that transaction is something that will likely close in 2017 as you get through regulatory approvals and Works Councils and all the things that go with that. But I would say that's just part of what we're doing as we think about focusing on Power Brands, and there could be more opportunities like that, but nothing to talk about today."

Despite a challenging environment, we continued to deliver solid results, and we're confident in delivering our 2016 outlook and our 2018 margin targets. I'm pleased with the progress made by our teams in reinventing our supply chain, reducing overheads and reinvesting in growth. Our strategy is working, driving strong near-term margin performance, providing fuel for investment and positioning us to sustainably deliver top and bottom line growth.
Long term, we have stacked our advantage platform together with an ongoing focus on growth and margin expansion to drive organic net revenue at or above our category rates: double-digit adjusted EPS growth, improving cash generation and significant return of capital to our shareholders from share repurchases and dividends. With that as context, let's review the highlights of the second quarter.
Organic revenue grew 1.5%, including the negative impact of about 1 point from revenue management actions. Through the first half, our growth rate was 1.9%. Our Power Brands once again drove our top line, up 3% and in line with global categories. Emerging markets rose nearly 4%, fueled by currency-driven pricing in markets like Argentina and Russia. Developed markets were essentially flat but delivered another positive quarter of vol/mix while continuing to significantly expand margins.
Our overall share performance was not yet where we wanted it to be, but we began to see meaningful improvements in a number of key markets like chocolate in the U.K., Germany, Australia and India as well as Biscuits in Europe and globally across our Gum & Candy business. This progress was partially offset by declines in some large markets such as U.S. Biscuits and Brazil, where our near-term share positions were negatively impacted by aggressive competitive trade promotions. Brian will discuss market share in more detail in a moment.
Adjusted OI margin was for the second quarter was strong, up 210 basis points versus prior year. Cost control has now become embedded in our culture, and we're firing on all cylinders, both in supply chain as well as in overheads. These first half results position us well for the full year. 
Our focus on cost enables us to expand margins while continuing to fuel growth. In that spirit, let me take you through 2 exciting opportunities that will be important drivers going forward. First, we're delighted to announce the launch of our Milka brand into China's $2.8 billion chocolate market. This is a prime example of our growth strategy in action. 
As we've discussed, most of our emerging markets are 1- or 2-category countries. We added gum to our leading China Biscuit business in the second half of 2012. And today, that business generates annual revenue of approximately $200 million. By leveraging a formidable Power Brand like Milka in a sizable category white space, we see significant potential for chocolate in a market where per capita consumption is quite low, even by emerging market standards. 
We expect our unique brand assets, industry-leading innovation, a new world-class manufacturing facility and strong sales and marketing capabilities will not only grow our business but will also accelerate the category. While chocolate in China has recently been challenged, we believe we're well positioned to succeed. Our plans have been presented to customers and will enter the market in the next few weeks, well before the critical Chinese New Year season.
Finally, while only a small part of our business today, we have significantly bolstered our capabilities in e-commerce. Although online snacks are relatively underdeveloped, we believe e-commerce will be increasingly important as consumer purchasing behavior changes. Our intent is to capture share in this fast-growing channel by leveraging our strong brands and marketing know-how. 
Since the start of the year, we've taken a number of steps, including enhancing our infrastructure; adding new experience resources and building capability; strengthening our partnerships with Amazon in the U.S., Alibaba in China and with the e-commerce arms of our traditional retailers; as well as accelerating gift offers with personalized packaging and subscriptions on brands like Cadbury in the U.K. Early results are very encouraging. In the first half, we grew our e-commerce revenue by more than 30%. Looking ahead, our goal is snacking leadership in e-commerce and over $1 billion in sales by 2020.
The launch of chocolate in China and our progress in e-commerce are just 2 examples of investments that are continuing to build and transform our advantage platform. Looking ahead, there's no question that the environment remains challenging, especially in emerging markets. We remain focused on what we can control: margin and share.
To that end, we're taking a number of actions that will impact the second half. These include: increased A&C for our Power Brands; target investments in trade spending to narrow price gaps in key markets; several significant innovation launches, including chocolate in China; and continued expansion of our routes to market, including e-commerce, all while continuing to drive cost reduction across the enterprise. We remain confident in our strategy and execution to grow both our top and bottom lines over the long term and to create significant value for our shareholders.
Before I close, I know many of you would like an update on the potential transaction with Hershey. While I can confirm that we did make an offer to Hershey, as you would expect regarding any potential M&A activity, we have no additional comments to make. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
739693,369830563,1013336,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene. We had solid financial results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Specifically, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion and earnings growth.

Specifically, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion and earnings growth. Adjusted gross margin of over 40% was flat in Q2 as the negative impact of mark-to-market as well as currency-driven inflation offset another quarter of strong net productivity. In fact, our efforts to reinvent our supply chain and deploy advantaged manufacturing lines of the future continue to drive margin benefits as we delivered net productivity of better than 3.5% for the first half. Q2 adjusted OI margin was 15.2%, up 210 basis points. This was largely driven by the ongoing ZBB impact on our overheads and especially our execution on shared service initiatives.
In addition, the margin expansion included some onetime favorable impacts from asset sales in North America. These proceeds more or less offset the negative impacts of mark-to-market and the cost of our U.S. labor-related business continuity planning. We're pleased with our first half margin performance and are slightly ahead of our plan as our cost execution had exceeded expectations. We're also investing in additional A&C and selected incremental trade spending during the second half to support top line growth and improve share.
Let me now provide some color on regional performance for both revenue and margins. North America had a very solid -- a very strong margin quarter. Adjusted OI margins expanded by 470 basis points, driven by strong productivity, overhead cost reductions as well as the previously mentioned asset sale benefit, offset somewhat by the U.S. labor business continuity planning costs. 
We grew organic revenue nearly 1%, driven by vol/mix increases. Escalated trade spending by our competitors negatively affected our short-term results. Overall, Biscuits were up only modestly but Oreo, belVita and Triscuit all delivered solid consumption growth. Candy posted strong results, driven by Sour Patch Kids and Halls. In gum, Trident turned in another quarter of solid performance, and we began the relaunch of Stride late in the quarter, which should improve shares in the months ahead. As Irene mentioned, we had several strong programs in place to better position us for the second half.
Europe also had an outstanding margin quarter, with adjusted OI margin up 350 basis points to 18%, driven by strong productivity and lower overheads. Organic revenue in Europe was essentially flat, although here too, we're seeing a nice progression in vol/mix and share trends. Both our chocolate and biscuit categories delivered strong results in the U.K. and Germany, which helped grow vol/mix by 70 basis points for the region.
Building on last year's launch in the U.K., we also launched Ritz Crisp & Thin crackers in France, which is delivering good results as we take the brand to a new consumption occasion. In EEMEA, adjusted OI margins were flat, driven by weaker demand and the resulting volume leverage impact.
Organic revenue declined more than 2%, driven by a slowdown in the Middle East and North Africa, where economic and geopolitical volatility, including the impact of low oil prices, is having a more pronounced effect on consumer demand. A very weak Ramadan season in the Middle East also tempered the top line. 
Despite that backdrop, Russia turned in a solid performance, growing low double digits as a result of pricing actions to offset inflation. In Asia Pacific, our adjusted OI margins were up 190 basis points, driven by improved overheads, strong productivity and pricing. Organic revenue increased 2% and vol/mix was positive, up more than 1%. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of growth in Asia.
India benefited from the launch of Bournvita Biscuits, which addresses consumers' growing need for a morning snack under a well-known brand that delivers taste and nutrition. Chocolate also generated solid gains. Australia was also strong while Southeast Asia was up for the third straight quarter.
Our Kinh Do business in Vietnam continues to be a bright spot. Our teams are executing well as we integrate this business, which provides a platform to drive our Power Brands through its distribution network of 130,000 outlets.
China declined low single digits as the biscuit category slowed, and we lapped last year's Trident Gum launch. While overall China consumer demand has recently slowed, we believe longer-term dynamics will improve, as evidenced by our significant investment in chocolate that Irene discussed earlier.
In Latin America, adjusted OI margins declined 210 basis points. Difficult economic conditions in Brazil pressured margins in the form of currency and volume headwinds. Latin America organic revenue grew nearly 9%, led by strength in Argentina and Mexico. Argentina grew double digits, primarily due to inflation-driven pricing, while Mexico had a strong first half and continued to gain momentum as strong vol/mix contributed to high single-digit revenue growth. 
Brazil declined low single digits, and we see no short-term catalysts for improvement in the Brazilian economy. We're taking actions to close selected price gaps, but we expect the market to remain challenging in terms of both revenue and margins at least through the second half.
Let me spend a moment providing a few highlights by category. In aggregate, categories have slowed to about 3% year-to-date, driven by key emerging markets like Brazil, China and India. Our global Biscuits business grew nearly 2% with strength in the U.K., in the U.S. and Germany. Oreo led the way, growing high single digits. In addition, we're continuing to drive our well-being portfolio. belVita grew high single digits globally while our GOOD THiNS innovation in the U.S. also posted solid results.
While our Biscuits share has been challenged in some key markets, we have a number of actions underway to address the issue. In the U.S., we're innovating across several winning biscuit platforms while investing incremental trade spending behind our DST execution. In Brazil, we're investing in additional advertising and consumer support while selectively narrowing price gaps on key SKUs. Our focus remains on improving our share position. We expect the incremental actions we're taking will improve our share position in the second half.
Chocolate grew more than 2%, driven by solid results in India, Australia and the U.K. Also in the quarter, Germany continued to deliver strong growth as we lapped last year's revenue management actions. More than half of our revenue in chocolate grew share. Gum & Candy increased nearly 2%, led by solid performance in the U.S. and Mexico. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share.
Now turning to earnings per share. For Q2, our adjusted EPS was up more than 4% on a constant currency basis, which includes the impact of coffee dilution. And for the first half, adjusted EPS increased 17% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains of $0.15 were the primary driver of the improvement. 
Below the line, adjusted EPS declined $0.01 as dilution from last year's coffee deal more than offset benefits from lower share count, taxes and interest expense. Note that this will be the last quarter of coffee dilution as we lap the close of last year's coffee transactions. I would note that both JDE and Keurig performed well in the quarter and contributed some upside versus our expectations.
In the second quarter, we delivered more than $500 million of free cash flow and improved our cash conversion cycle by 20 days to minus 4 days. Returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority for us, and we returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through the first half.
We've repurchased more than $1.3 billion in our shares at an average price of $41.07, and we continue to target $2 billion in share repurchases for the year. Last week, we also announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. Dividends remain an important part of our capital return strategy as we target a payout of at least 30%. Since the spin, we've returned nearly $13 billion of cash to shareholders.
Let's take a closer look at our current outlook. As you've heard today, we feel good about our first half results and expect continued strong performance in the second half despite the macro backdrop, especially in the emerging markets. 
Specifically, we now expect the following for 2016: we've modestly reduced our organic net revenue growth outlook to approximately 2% from at least 2%. This reflects the increasing challenges we're seeing in global categories and includes about 100 basis points from revenue management actions.
We continue to expect adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16% and are increasingly confident in delivering this commitment. As you think about the second half, we expect heavier investments in the third quarter, which would lead to higher margins in the fourth quarter.
We continue to expect double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. Our view now includes an incremental $0.03 to $0.05 versus our last outlook due to solid operating performance, lower interest expense and strong performance in our coffee joint ventures.  Unfortunately, based on recent spot rates, this upside will be mostly offset by currency. We expect currency to be a 4-point headwind to revenue growth, up from 3 points. And for adjusted EPS, we estimated an $0.08 headwind, up from $0.05.
This also includes our view of the Brexit impact on our results, which is limited to an approximate $0.02 headwind related to the currency translation impact on our U.K.-based earnings. Our net transaction exposure is very limited as we buy a majority of our global cocoa needs in British pounds, which offset net transaction exposure in the U.K.
So to summarize our EPS outlook, the upside we're seeing in EPS allows us to fully offset the negative impact of currency changes, including Brexit. Finally, we still expect free cash flow excluding items of at least $1.4 billion.
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our results in the first half. We delivered significant margin expansion while continuing to invest behind our Power Brands. Our vol/mix performance continued to improve, and we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the challenging operating environment, we're confident in our ability to deliver on our top and bottom line targets, and we remain on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018.

This quarter seemed to show a little softer growth in developed markets. Actually, I had expected a little bit of pressure on Brazil and some of those markets, and you've certainly cited those. But overall, emerging market growth was about consistent with where it was in the first quarter. Do you expect that to weaken a bit as we go to the second half as some of these markets are more challenged? And is the developed markets then kind of pick up a little bit in the second half of the year from where they are currently?"

Obviously, we're feeling like having watched what's happening particularly in Brazil, we're seeing more softness there than we had anticipated. But I'd say in our developed markets, it's really all about North America. And Europe is actually continuing to improve sequentially. We're seeing strong vol/mix performance. We're seeing nice performance on share. And so the big change is really on our U.S. Biscuit business where as we mentioned, we saw some very aggressive trade spending from some of our competition. It is not helping to grow the category but we certainly are responding. And I would tell you even in the early couple of weeks in July, we're starting to see that business come back. So net-net, we do expect our developed markets to continue to show strong performance in terms of vol/mix improvement as well as share. But we are -- our overall forecast is -- continues to be somewhat muted because the aggregate category growth, which we had thought would be in the 3% to 4% range, is below the lower end of that range, and that's really what's driving our forecast."

We've done a lot of testing with the consumer and our Milka bundle is a very unique bundle.

Despite a challenging environment, we continue to deliver solid results, and we're confident in delivering our 2016 outlook and our 2018 margin targets. I'm pleased with the progress made by our teams in reinventing our supply chain, reducing overheads and reinvesting in growth. Our strategy is working, driving strong near-term margin performance, providing fuel for investment and positioning us to sustainably deliver top and bottom line growth.
Long-term, we expect our advantage platform together with an ongoing focus on growth and margin expansion to drive organic net revenue at or above our category rates: double-digit adjusted EPS growth, improving cash generation and significant return of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. With that as context, let's review the highlights of the second quarter.
Organic revenue grew 1.5%, including the negative impact of about 1 point from revenue management actions. Through the first half, our growth rate was 1.9%. Our Power Brands once again drove our top line, up 3% and in line with global categories. Emerging markets rose nearly 4%, fueled by currency-driven pricing in markets like Argentina and Russia. Developed markets were essentially flat, but delivered another positive quarter of vol/mix,, while continuing to significantly expand margins.
Our overall share performance was not yet where we wanted it to be, but we began to see meaningful improvements in a number of key markets, like chocolate in the U.K., Germany, Australia and India, as well as Biscuits in Europe and globally across our Gum & Candy business. This progress was partially offset by declines in some large markets, such as U.S. Biscuits and Brazil, where our near-term share positions were negatively impacted by aggressive competitive trade promotions. Brian will discuss market share in more detail in a moment.
Adjusted OI margin for the second quarter was strong, up 210 basis points versus prior year. Cost control has now become embedded in our culture, and we're firing on all cylinders, both in supply chain as well as in overheads. These first half results position us well for the full year. 
Our focus on cost enables us to expand margins, while continuing to fuel growth. In that spirit, let me take you through 2 exciting opportunities that will be important drivers going forward. First, we're delighted to announce the launch of our Milka brand into China's $2.8 billion chocolate market. This is a prime example of our growth strategy in action. 
As we've discussed, most of our emerging markets are 1- or 2-category countries. We added gum to our leading China Biscuit business in the second half of 2012. And today, that business generates annual revenue of approximately $200 million. By leveraging a formidable Power Brand like Milka in a sizable category white space, we see significant potential for chocolate in a market where per capita consumption is quite low, even by emerging market standards. 
We expect our unique brand assets, industry-leading innovation, a new world-class manufacturing facility and strong sales and marketing capabilities will not only grow our business, but will also accelerate the category. While chocolate in China has recently been challenged, we believe we're well positioned to succeed. Our plans have been presented to customers and will enter the market in the next few weeks, well before the critical Chinese New Year season.
Finally, while only a small part of our business today, we have significantly bolstered our capabilities in e-commerce. Although online snacks are relatively underdeveloped, we believe e-commerce will be increasingly important as consumer purchasing behavior changes. Our intent is to capture share in this fast-growing channel by leveraging our strong brands and marketing know-how. 
Since the start of the year, we've taken a number of steps, including enhancing our infrastructure; adding new experience resources and building capability; strengthening our partnerships with Amazon in the U.S., Alibaba in China and with the e-commerce arms of our traditional retailers; as well as accelerating gift offers with personalized packaging and subscriptions on brands like Cadbury in the U.K. Early results are very encouraging. In the first half, we grew our e-commerce revenue by more than 30%. Looking ahead, our goal is snacking leadership in e-commerce and over $1 billion in sales by 2020.
The launch of chocolate in China and our progress in e-commerce are just 2 examples of investments that are continuing to build and transform our advantage platform. Looking ahead, there's no question that the environment remains challenging, especially in emerging markets. We remain focused on what we can control: margin and share.
To that end, we're taking a number of actions that will impact the second half. These include: increased A&C on our Power Brands; target investments in trade spending to narrow price gaps in key markets; several significant innovation launches, including chocolate in China; and continued expansion of our routes to market, including e-commerce, all while continuing to drive cost reduction across the enterprise. We remain confident in our strategy and execution to grow both our top and bottom lines over the long-term and to create significant value for our shareholders.
Before I close, I know many of you would like an update on the potential transaction with Hershey.

We had solid financial results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Specifically, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion and earnings growth. Adjusted gross margin of over 40% was flat in Q2 as",1708,"Thanks, Irene. We had solid financial results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Specifically, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion and earnings growth. Adjusted gross margin of over 40% was flat in Q2 as the negative impact of mark-to-market as well as currency-driven inflation offset another quarter of strong net productivity. In fact, our efforts to reinvent our supply chain and deploy advantage manufacturing lines of the future continue to drive margin benefits, as we delivered net productivity of better than 3.5% for the first half. Q2 adjusted OI margin was 15.2%, up 210 basis points. This was largely driven by the ongoing ZBB impact on our overheads and especially our execution on shared service initiatives.
In addition, the margin expansion included some onetime favorable impacts from asset sales in North America. These proceeds more or less offset the negative impacts of mark-to-market and the cost of our U.S. labor-related business continuity planning. We're pleased with our first half margin performance and are slightly ahead of our plan as our cost execution has exceeded expectations. We're also investing in additional A&C and selected incremental trade spending during the second half to support top line growth and improve share.
Let me now provide some color on regional performance for both revenue and margins. North America had a very solid -- a very strong margin quarter. Adjusted OI margins expanded by 470 basis points, driven by strong productivity, overhead cost reductions as well as the previously mentioned asset sale benefit, offset somewhat by the U.S. labor business continuity planning costs. 
We grew organic revenue nearly 1%, driven by vol/mix increases. Escalated trade spending by our competitors negatively affected our short-term results. Overall, Biscuits were up only modestly, but Oreo, belVita and Triscuit all delivered solid consumption growth. Candy posted strong results, driven by Sour Patch Kids and Halls. In gum, Trident turned in another quarter of solid performance, and we began the relaunch of Stride late in the quarter, which should improve shares in the months ahead. As Irene mentioned, we have several strong programs in place to better position us for the second half.
Europe also had an outstanding margin quarter, with adjusted OI margin up 350 basis points to 18%, driven by strong productivity and lower overheads. Organic revenue in Europe was essentially flat, although here too, we're seeing a nice progression in vol/mix and share trends. Both our chocolate and biscuit categories delivered strong results in the U.K. and Germany, which helped grow vol/mix by 70 basis points for the region.
Building on last year's launch in the U.K., we also launched Ritz Crisp & Thin crackers in France, which is delivering good results, as we take the brand to a new consumption occasion. In EEMEA, adjusted OI margins were flat, driven by weaker demand and the resulting volume leverage impact.
Organic revenue declined more than 2%, driven by a slowdown in the Middle East and North Africa, where economic and geopolitical volatility, including the impact of low oil prices, is having a more pronounced effect on consumer demand. A very weak Ramadan season in the Middle East also tempered the top line. 
Despite that backdrop, Russia turned in a solid performance, growing low double digits as a result of pricing actions to offset inflation. In Asia Pacific, our adjusted OI margins were up 190 basis points, driven by improved overheads, strong productivity and pricing. Organic revenue increased 2% and vol/mix was positive, up more than 1%. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of growth in Asia.
India benefited from the launch of Bournvita Biscuits, which addresses consumers' growing need for a morning snack under a well-known brand that delivers taste and nutrition. Chocolate also generated solid gains. Australia was also strong,, while Southeast Asia was up for the third straight quarter.
Our Kinh Do business in Vietnam continues to be a bright spot. Our teams are executing well as we integrate this business, which provides a platform to drive our Power Brands through its distribution network of 130,000 outlets.
China declined low single digits as the biscuit category slowed, and we lapped last year's Trident Gum launch. While overall China consumer demand has recently slowed, we believe longer-term dynamics will improve, as evidenced by our significant investment in chocolate that Irene discussed earlier.
In Latin America, adjusted OI margins declined 210 basis points. Difficult economic conditions in Brazil pressured margins in the form of currency and volume headwinds. Latin America organic revenue grew nearly 9%, led by strength in Argentina and Mexico. Argentina grew double digits, primarily due to inflation-driven pricing, while Mexico had a strong first half and continued to gain momentum as strong vol/mix contributed to high single-digit revenue growth. 
Brazil declined low single digits, and we see no short-term catalysts for improvement in the Brazilian economy. We're taking actions to close selected price gaps, but we expect the market to remain challenging in terms of both revenue and margins at least through the second half.
Let me spend a moment providing a few highlights by category. In aggregate, categories have slowed to about 3% year-to-date, driven by key emerging markets like Brazil, China and India. Our global Biscuits business grew nearly 2% with strength in the U.K., in the U.S. and Germany. Oreo led the way, growing high single digits. In addition, we're continuing to drive our well-being portfolio. belVita grew high single digits globally, while our GOOD THiNS innovation in the U.S. also posted solid results.
While our Biscuits share has been challenged in some key markets, we have a number of actions underway to address the issue. In the U.S., we're innovating across several winning biscuit platforms, while investing incremental trade spending behind our DSD execution. In Brazil, we're investing in additional advertising and consumer support, while selectively narrowing price gaps on key SKUs. Our focus remains on improving our share position. We expect the incremental actions we're taking will improve our share position in the second half.
Chocolate grew more than 2%, driven by solid results in India, Australia and the U.K. Also in the quarter, Germany continued to deliver strong growth as we lapped last year's revenue management actions. More than half of our revenue in chocolate grew share. Gum & Candy increased nearly 2%, led by solid performance in the U.S. and Mexico. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share.
Now turning to earnings per share. For Q2, our adjusted EPS was up more than 4% on a constant-currency basis, which includes the impact of coffee dilution. And for the first half, adjusted EPS increased 17% on a constant-currency basis. Operating gains of $0.15 were the primary driver of the improvement. 
Below the line, adjusted EPS declined $0.01 as dilution from last year's coffee deal more than offset benefits from lower share count, taxes and interest expense. Note that this will be the last quarter of coffee dilution as we lap the close of last year's coffee transactions. I would note that both JDE and Keurig performed well in the quarter and contributed some upside versus our expectations.
In the second quarter, we delivered more than $500 million of free cash flow and improved our cash conversion cycle by 20 days to minus 4 days. Returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority for us, and we returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through the first half.
We've repurchased more than $1.3 billion in our shares at an average price of $41.07, and we continue to target $2 billion in share repurchases for the year. Last week, we also announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. Dividends remain an important part of our capital return strategy, as we target a payout of at least 30%. Since the spin, we've returned nearly $13 billion of cash to shareholders.
Let's take a closer look at our current outlook. As you've heard today, we feel good about our first half results and expect continued strong performance in the second half despite the macro backdrop, especially in the emerging markets. 
Specifically, we now expect the following for 2016: we've modestly reduced our organic net revenue growth outlook to approximately 2% from at least 2%. This reflects the increasing challenges we're seeing in global categories and includes about 100 basis points from revenue management actions.
We continue to expect adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16% and are increasingly confident in delivering this commitment. As you think about the second half, we expect heavier investments in the third quarter, which would lead to higher margins in the fourth quarter.
We continue to expect double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant-currency basis. Our view now includes an incremental $0.03 to $0.05 versus our last outlook due to solid operating performance, lower interest expense and strong performance in our coffee joint ventures. Unfortunately, based on recent spot rates, this upside will be mostly offset by currency. We expect currency to be a 4-point headwind to revenue growth, up from 3 points. And for adjusted EPS, we estimated an $0.08 headwind, up from $0.05.
This also includes our view of the Brexit impact on our results, which is limited to an approximate $0.02 headwind related to the currency translation impact on our U.K.-based earnings. Our net transaction exposure is very limited, as we buy a majority of our global cocoa needs in British pounds, which offset net transaction exposure in the U.K.
So to summarize our EPS outlook, the upside we're seeing in EPS allows us to fully offset the negative impact of currency changes, including Brexit. Finally, we still expect free cash flow excluding items of at least $1.4 billion.
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our results in the first half. We delivered significant margin expansion, while continuing to invest behind our Power Brands. Our vol/mix performance continued to improve, and we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the challenging operating environment, we're confident in our ability to deliver on our top and bottom line targets, and we remain on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

But overall, emerging market growth was about consistent with where it was in the first quarter.

So I think your assessment about emerging markets is correct. Obviously, we're feeling like having watched what's happening particularly in Brazil, we're seeing more softness there than we had anticipated. But I'd say in our developed markets, it's really all about North America. And Europe is actually continuing to improve sequentially. We're seeing strong vol/mix performance. We're seeing nice performance on share. And so the big change is really on our U.S. Biscuit business where, as we mentioned, we saw some very aggressive trade spending from some of our competition. It is not helping to grow the category, but we certainly are responding. And I would tell you even in the early couple of weeks in July, we're starting to see that business come back. So net-net, we do expect our developed markets to continue to show strong performance in terms of vol/mix improvement as well as share. But we are -- our overall forecast is -- continues to be somewhat muted because the aggregate category growth, which we had thought would be in the 3% to 4% range, is below the lower end of that range, and that's really what's driving our forecast."

Our A&C is above 9% of revenue. You won't have visibility to that right now, but we continue to see A&C as a critical driver of our brand equities. And certainly, as you start to see the recovery in places like the U.K., Germany, India, Australia, EU Biscuits, it's all reflective of the investments that we're making. And so those are the kinds of places that we will continue to make investments as well as in digital marketing. That said, there are selected hotspots that we've talked about, particularly markets like U.S. Biscuit and Brazil where our price gaps are not where we want them to be. And so we are going to invest some trade back in that business, but that's not going to be without A&C support to continue to drive the longer-term brand equity. So net-net, we are increasing A&C in those places where we feel we're getting an adequate return, and that's an important part of our algorithm going forward."

And so it is our intent to continue to price to offset higher input costs, particularly those that are common to industry, and currency in particular, continues to be a headwind for us in most markets around the world. And so the key for us, as we think about protecting gross margins as well as continuing to drive our ability to invest in our brands, making sure that we have adequate coverage of our cost is critically important. As the market leader, we typically are the first to increase prices. It does often lead to some temporary dislocation and -- but it ultimately recovers. You know, I talked a lot about -- last year, I talked a lot about our share position in chocolate, in general, but particularly in markets like the U.K. and Germany. It took some time for the consumers to adjust to those new price points, and now we're starting to see our shares recover.

The purity of Alpine milk, together with some of the assets that you're familiar with the [indiscernible], for example, are really positive with the Chinese consumer, and we have every expectation that we can actually bring growth to this -- back to this market with the launch of Milka."

Despite a challenging environment, we continue to deliver solid results, and we're confident in delivering our 2016 outlook and our 2018 margin targets. I'm pleased with the progress made by our teams in reinventing our supply chain, reducing overheads and reinvesting in growth. Our strategy is working, driving strong near-term margin performance, providing fuel for investment and positioning us to sustainably deliver top and bottom line growth.
Long-term, we expect our advantage platform together with an ongoing focus on growth and margin expansion to drive organic net revenue at or above our category rates: double-digit adjusted EPS growth, improving cash generation and significant return of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. With that as context, let's review the highlights of the second quarter.
Organic revenue grew 1.5%, including the negative impact of about 1 point from revenue management actions. Through the first half, our growth rate was 1.9%. Our Power Brands once again drove our top line, up 3% and in line with global categories. Emerging markets rose nearly 4%, fueled by currency-driven pricing in markets like Argentina and Russia. Developed markets were essentially flat, but delivered another positive quarter of vol/mix, while continuing to significantly expand margins.
Our overall share performance was not yet where we wanted it to be, but we began to see meaningful improvements in a number of key markets, like chocolate in the U.K., Germany, Australia and India, as well as Biscuits in Europe and globally across our Gum & Candy business. This progress was partially offset by declines in some large markets, such as U.S. Biscuits and Brazil, where our near-term share positions were negatively impacted by aggressive competitive trade promotions. Brian will discuss market share in more detail in a moment.
Adjusted OI margin for the second quarter was strong, up 210 basis points versus prior year. Cost control has now become embedded in our culture, and we're firing on all cylinders, both in supply chain as well as in overheads. These first half results position us well for the full year. 
Our focus on cost enables us to expand margins, while continuing to fuel growth. In that spirit, let me take you through 2 exciting opportunities that will be important drivers going forward. First, we're delighted to announce the launch of our Milka brand into China's $2.8 billion chocolate market. This is a prime example of our growth strategy in action. 
As we've discussed, most of our emerging markets are 1- or 2-category countries. We added gum to our leading China Biscuit business in the second half of 2012. And today, that business generates annual revenue of approximately $200 million. By leveraging a formidable Power Brand like Milka in a sizable category white space, we see significant potential for chocolate in a market where per capita consumption is quite low, even by emerging market standards. 
We expect our unique brand assets, industry-leading innovation, a new world-class manufacturing facility, and strong sales and marketing capabilities will not only grow our business, but will also accelerate the category. While chocolate in China has recently been challenged, we believe we're well positioned to succeed. Our plans have been presented to customers and will enter the market in the next few weeks, well before the critical Chinese New Year season.
Finally, while only a small part of our business today, we have significantly bolstered our capabilities in e-commerce. Although online snacks are relatively underdeveloped, we believe e-commerce will be increasingly important as consumer purchasing behavior changes. Our intent is to capture share in this fast-growing channel by leveraging our strong brands and marketing know-how. 
Since the start of the year, we've taken a number of steps, including enhancing our infrastructure; adding new experience resources and building capability; strengthening our partnerships with Amazon in the U.S., Alibaba in China and with the e-commerce arms of our traditional retailers; as well as accelerating gift offers with personalized packaging and subscriptions on brands like Cadbury in the U.K. Early results are very encouraging. In the first half, we grew our e-commerce revenue by more than 30%. Looking ahead, our goal is snacking leadership in e-commerce and over $1 billion in sales by 2020.
The launch of chocolate in China and our progress in e-commerce are just 2 examples of investments that are continuing to build and transform our advantage platform. Looking ahead, there's no question that the environment remains challenging, especially in emerging markets. We remain focused on what we can control: margin and share.
To that end, we're taking a number of actions that will impact the second half. These include: increased A&C for our Power Brands; targeted investments in trade spending to narrow price gaps in key markets; several significant innovation launches, including chocolate in China; and continued expansion of our routes to market, including e-commerce, all while continuing to drive cost reduction across the enterprise. We remain confident in our strategy and execution to grow both our top and bottom lines over the long-term and to create significant value for our shareholders.
Before I close, I know many of you would like an update on the potential transaction with Hershey. While I can confirm that we did make an offer to Hershey, as you would expect regarding any potential M&A activity, we have no additional comments to make. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

We had solid financial results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Specifically, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion and earnings growth. Adjusted gross margin of over 40% was flat in Q2 as",1709,"Thanks, Irene. We had solid financial results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Specifically, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion and earnings growth. Adjusted gross margin of over 40% was flat in Q2 as the negative impact of mark-to-market as well as currency-driven inflation offset another quarter of strong net productivity. In fact, our efforts to reinvent our supply chain and deploy advantage manufacturing lines of the future continued to drive margin benefits, as we delivered net productivity of better than 3.5% for the first half. Q2 adjusted OI margin was 15.2%, up 210 basis points. This was largely driven by the ongoing ZBB impact on our overheads and especially our execution on shared service initiatives.
In addition, the margin expansion included some onetime favorable impacts from asset sales in North America. These proceeds more or less offset the negative impacts of mark-to-market and the costs of our U.S. labor-related business continuity planning. We're pleased with our first half margin performance and are slightly ahead of our plan as our cost execution has exceeded expectations. We're also investing in additional A&C and selected incremental trade spending during the second half to support top line growth and improve share.
Let me now provide some color on regional performance for both revenue and margins. North America had a very solid -- a very strong margin quarter. Adjusted OI margins expanded by 470 basis points, driven by strong productivity, overhead cost reductions as well as the previously mentioned asset sale benefit, offset somewhat by the U.S. labor business continuity planning costs. 
We grew organic revenue nearly 1%, driven by vol/mix increases. Escalated trade spending by our competitors negatively affected our short-term results. Overall, Biscuits were up only modestly, but Oreo, belVita and Triscuit all delivered solid consumption growth. Candy posted strong results, driven by Sour Patch Kids and Halls. In gum, Trident turned in another quarter of solid performance, and we began the relaunch of Stride late in the quarter, which should improve shares in the months ahead. As Irene mentioned, we have several strong programs in place to better position us for the second half.
Europe also had an outstanding margin quarter, with adjusted OI margin up 350 basis points to 18%, driven by strong productivity and lower overheads. Organic revenue in Europe was essentially flat, although here too, we're seeing a nice progression in vol/mix and share trends. Both our chocolate and biscuit categories delivered strong results in the U.K. and Germany, which helped grow vol/mix by 70 basis points for the region.
Building on last year's launch in the U.K., we also launched Ritz Crisp & Thin crackers in France, which is delivering good results, as we take the brand to a new consumption occasion. In EEMEA, adjusted OI margins were flat, driven by weaker demand and the resulting volume leverage impact.
Organic revenue declined more than 2%, driven by a slowdown in the Middle East and North Africa, where economic and geopolitical volatility, including the impact of low oil prices, is having a more pronounced effect on consumer demand. A very weak Ramadan season in the Middle East also tempered the top line. 
Despite that backdrop, Russia turned in a solid performance, growing low double digits as a result of pricing actions to offset inflation. In Asia Pacific, our adjusted OI margins were up 190 basis points, driven by improved overheads, strong productivity and pricing. Organic revenue increased 2% and vol/mix was positive, up more than 1%. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of growth in Asia.
India benefited from the launch of Bournvita Biscuits, which addresses consumers' growing need for a morning snack under a well-known brand that delivers taste and nutrition. Chocolate also generated solid gains. Australia was also strong, while Southeast Asia was up for the third straight quarter.
Our Kinh Do business in Vietnam continues to be a bright spot. Our teams are executing well as we integrate this business, which provides a platform to drive our Power Brands through its distribution network of 130,000 outlets.
China declined low single digits as the biscuit category slowed, and we lapped last year's Trident Gum launch. While overall China consumer demand has recently slowed, we believe longer-term dynamics will improve, as evidenced by our significant investment in chocolate that Irene discussed earlier.
In Latin America, adjusted OI margins declined 210 basis points. Difficult economic conditions in Brazil pressured margins in the form of currency and volume headwinds. Latin America organic revenue grew nearly 9%, led by strength in Argentina and Mexico. Argentina grew double digits, primarily due to inflation-driven pricing, while Mexico had a strong first half and continued to gain momentum as strong vol/mix contributed to high single-digit revenue growth. 
Brazil declined low single digits, and we see no short-term catalysts for improvement in the Brazilian economy. We're taking actions to close selected price gaps, but we expect the market to remain challenging in terms of both revenue and margins at least through the second half.
Let me spend a moment providing a few highlights by category. In aggregate, categories have slowed to about 3% year-to-date, driven by key emerging markets like Brazil, China and India. Our global Biscuits business grew nearly 2% with strength in the U.K., in the U.S. and Germany. Oreo led the way, growing high single digits. In addition, we're continuing to drive our well-being portfolio. belVita grew high single digits globally, while our GOOD THiNS innovation in the U.S. also posted solid results.
While our Biscuits share has been challenged in some key markets, we have a number of actions underway to address the issue. In the U.S., we're innovating across several winning biscuit platforms, while investing incremental trade spending behind our DSD execution. In Brazil, we're investing in additional advertising and consumer support, while selectively narrowing price gaps on key SKUs. Our focus remains on improving our share position. We expect the incremental actions we're taking will improve our share position in the second half.
Chocolate grew more than 2%, driven by solid results in India, Australia and the U.K. Also in the quarter, Germany continued to deliver strong growth as we lapped last year's revenue management actions. More than half of our revenue in chocolate grew share. Gum & Candy increased nearly 2%, led by solid performance in the U.S. and Mexico. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share.
Now turning to earnings per share. For Q2, our adjusted EPS was up more than 4% on a constant-currency basis, which includes the impact of coffee dilution. And then for the first half, adjusted EPS increased 17% on a constant-currency basis. Operating gains of $0.15 were the primary driver of the improvement. 
Below the line, adjusted EPS declined $0.01 as dilution from last year's coffee deal more than offset benefits from lower share count, taxes and interest expense. Note that this will be the last quarter of coffee dilution as we lap the close of last year's coffee transactions. I would note that both JDE and Keurig performed well in the quarter and contributed some upside versus our expectations.
In the second quarter, we delivered more than $500 million of free cash flow and improved our cash conversion cycle by 20 days to minus 4 days. Returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority for us, and we returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through the first half.
We've repurchased more than $1.3 billion in our shares at an average price of $41.07, and we continue to target $2 billion in share repurchases for the year. Last week, we also announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. Dividends remain an important part of our capital return strategy, as we target a payout of at least 30%. Since the spin, we've returned nearly $13 billion of cash to shareholders.
Let's take a closer look at our current outlook. As you've heard today, we feel good about our first half results and expect continued strong performance in the second half despite the macro backdrop, especially in the emerging markets. 
Specifically, we now expect the following for 2016: we've modestly reduced our organic net revenue growth outlook to approximately 2% from at least 2%. This reflects the increasing challenges we're seeing in global categories and includes about 100 basis points from revenue management actions.
We continue to expect adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16% and are increasingly confident in delivering this commitment. As you think about the second half, we expect heavier investments in the third quarter, which would lead to higher margins in the fourth quarter.
We continue to expect double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant-currency basis. Our view now includes an incremental $0.03 to $0.05 versus our last outlook due to solid operating performance, lower interest expense and strong performance in our coffee joint ventures. Unfortunately, based on recent spot rates, this upside will be mostly offset by currency. We expect currency to be a 4-point headwind to revenue growth, up from 3 points. And for adjusted EPS, we estimate an $0.08 headwind, up from $0.05.
This also includes our view of the Brexit impact on our results, which is limited to an approximate $0.02 headwind related to the currency translation impact on our U.K.-based earnings. Our net transaction exposure is very limited, as we buy a majority of our global cocoa needs in British pounds, which offset net transaction exposure in the U.K.
So to summarize our EPS outlook, the upside we're seeing in EPS allows us to fully offset the negative impact of currency changes, including Brexit. Finally, we still expect free cash flow excluding items of at least $1.4 billion.
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our results in the first half. We delivered significant margin expansion, while continuing to invest behind our Power Brands. Our vol/mix performance continued to improve, and we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the challenging operating environment, we're confident in our ability to deliver on our top and bottom line targets, and we remain on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

But overall, emerging market growth was about consistent with where it was in the first quarter.

So I think your assessment about emerging markets is correct. Obviously, we're feeling like having watched what's happening particularly in Brazil, we're seeing more softness there than we had anticipated. But I'd say in our developed markets, it's really all about North America. And Europe is actually continuing to improve sequentially. We're seeing strong vol/mix performance. We're seeing nice performance on share. And so the big change is really on our U.S. Biscuits business where, as we mentioned, we saw some very aggressive trade spending from some of our competition. It is not helping to grow the category, but we certainly are responding. And I would tell you even in the early couple of weeks in July, we're starting to see that business come back. So net-net, we do expect our developed markets to continue to show strong performance in terms of vol/mix improvement as well as share. But we are -- our overall forecast is -- continues to be somewhat muted because the aggregate category growth, which we had thought would be in the 3% to 4% range, is below the lower end of that range, and that's really what's driving our forecast."

I think in the quarter, you would have seen some challenges in terms of keeping up with currency-driven inflation in a couple of markets. Brazil is a good example. EEMEA is a bit of a challenge in terms of volume leverage. So I would tell you, as we've said and as we shared in the conferences, this is going to be as much -- primarily a gross margin-driven continued margin expansion. The supply chain work that we're doing is still significant. We feel great about that. The net productivity was very strong. And I think gross margin will continue to be a driver of the margin expansion for us."

So we see every opportunity to learn from the experience we're having with Alibaba and bring some of the unique items, some of the subscription opportunities for brands like belVita, for example, to the online space and to drive our growth. And that is the big opportunity that we see. We are certainly learning a lot from the various partnerships that we have around the world. With respect to chocolate in China, we have studied this for quite some time. The Chinese consumers love brands with personality. We've done a lot of testing with the consumer and our Milka bundle is a very unique bundle. The purity of Alpine milk, together with some of the assets that you're familiar with; the Lila cow, for example, are really positive with the Chinese consumer, and we have every expectation that we can actually bring growth to this -- back to this market with the launch of Milka."

Despite a challenging environment, we continue to deliver solid results, and we're confident in delivering our 2016 outlook and our 2018 margin targets. I'm pleased with the progress made by our teams in reinventing our supply chain, reducing overheads and reinvesting in growth. Our strategy is working, driving strong near-term margin performance, providing fuel for investment and positioning us to sustainably deliver top and bottom line growth.
Long-term, we expect our advantage platform together with an ongoing focus on growth and margin expansion to drive organic net revenue at or above our category rates: double-digit adjusted EPS growth, improving cash generation and significant return of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. With that as context, let's review the highlights of the second quarter.
Organic revenue grew 1.5%, including the negative impact of about 1 point from revenue management actions. Through the first half, our growth rate was 1.9%. Our Power Brands once again drove our top line, up 3% and in line with global categories. Emerging markets rose nearly 4%, fueled by currency-driven pricing in markets like Argentina and Russia. Developed markets were essentially flat, but delivered another positive quarter of vol/mix, while continuing to significantly expand margins.
Our overall share performance was not yet where we wanted it to be, but we began to see meaningful improvements in a number of key markets, like chocolate in the U.K., Germany, Australia and India, as well as Biscuits in Europe and globally across our Gum & Candy business. This progress was partially offset by declines in some large markets, such as U.S. Biscuits and Brazil, where our near-term share positions were negatively impacted by aggressive competitive trade promotions. Brian will discuss market share in more detail in a moment.
Adjusted OI margin for the second quarter was strong, up 210 basis points versus prior year. Cost control has now become embedded in our culture, and we're firing on all cylinders, both in supply chain as well as in overheads. These first half results position us well for the full year. 
Our focus on cost enables us to expand margins, while continuing to fuel growth. In that spirit, let me take you through 2 exciting opportunities that will be important drivers going forward. First, we're delighted to announce the launch of our Milka brand into China's $2.8 billion chocolate market. This is a prime example of our growth strategy in action. 
As we've discussed, most of our emerging markets are 1- or 2-category countries. We added gum to our leading China Biscuit business in the second half of 2012. And today, that business generates annual revenue of approximately $200 million. By leveraging a formidable Power Brand like Milka in a sizable category white space, we see significant potential for chocolate in a market where per capita consumption is quite low, even by emerging market standards. 
We expect our unique brand assets, industry-leading innovation, a new world-class manufacturing facility, and strong sales and marketing capabilities will not only grow our business, but will also accelerate the category. While chocolate in China has recently been challenged, we believe we're well positioned to succeed. Our plans have been presented to customers and will enter the market in the next few weeks, well before the critical Chinese New Year season.
Finally, while only a small part of our business today, we have significantly bolstered our capabilities in e-commerce. Although online snacks are relatively underdeveloped, we believe e-commerce will be increasingly important as consumer purchasing behavior changes. Our intent is to capture share in this fast-growing channel by leveraging our strong brands and marketing know-how. 
Since the start of the year, we've taken a number of steps, including enhancing our infrastructure; adding new experience resources and building capability; strengthening our partnerships with Amazon in the U.S., Alibaba in China and with the e-commerce arms of our traditional retailers; as well as accelerating gift offers with personalized packaging and subscriptions on brands like Cadbury in the U.K. Early results are very encouraging. In the first half, we grew our e-commerce revenue by more than 30%. Looking ahead, our goal is snacking leadership in e-commerce and over $1 billion in sales by 2020.
The launch of chocolate in China and our progress in e-commerce are just 2 examples of investments that are continuing to build and transform our advantage platform. Looking ahead, there's no question that the environment remains challenging, especially in emerging markets. We remain focused on what we can control: margin and share.
To that end, we're taking a number of actions that will impact the second half. These include: increased A&C for our Power Brands; targeted investments in trade spending to narrow price gaps in key markets; several significant innovation launches, including chocolate in China; and continued expansion of our routes to market, including e-commerce, all while continuing to drive cost reduction across the enterprise. We remain confident in our strategy and execution to grow both our top and bottom lines over the long-term and to create significant value for our shareholders.
Before I close, I know many of you would like an update on the potential transaction with Hershey. While I can confirm that we did make an offer to Hershey, as you would expect regarding any potential M&A activity, we have no additional comments to make. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
739693,369830563,1014544,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene. We had solid financial results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Specifically, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion and earnings growth. Adjusted gross margin of over 40% was flat in Q2 as",1709,"Thanks, Irene. We had solid financial results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Specifically, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion and earnings growth. Adjusted gross margin of over 40% was flat in Q2 as the negative impact of mark-to-market as well as currency-driven inflation offset another quarter of strong net productivity. In fact, our efforts to reinvent our supply chain and deploy advantage manufacturing lines of the future continued to drive margin benefits, as we delivered net productivity of better than 3.5% for the first half. Q2 adjusted OI margin was 15.2%, up 210 basis points. This was largely driven by the ongoing ZBB impact on our overheads and especially our execution on shared service initiatives.
In addition, the margin expansion included some onetime favorable impacts from asset sales in North America. These proceeds more or less offset the negative impacts of mark-to-market and the costs of our U.S. labor-related business continuity planning. We're pleased with our first half margin performance and are slightly ahead of our plan as our cost execution has exceeded expectations. We're also investing in additional A&C and selected incremental trade spending during the second half to support top line growth and improve share.
Let me now provide some color on regional performance for both revenue and margins. North America had a very solid -- a very strong margin quarter. Adjusted OI margins expanded by 470 basis points, driven by strong productivity, overhead cost reductions as well as the previously mentioned asset sale benefit, offset somewhat by the U.S. labor business continuity planning costs. 
We grew organic revenue nearly 1%, driven by vol/mix increases. Escalated trade spending by our competitors negatively affected our short-term results. Overall, Biscuits were up only modestly, but Oreo, belVita and Triscuit all delivered solid consumption growth. Candy posted strong results, driven by Sour Patch Kids and Halls. In gum, Trident turned in another quarter of solid performance, and we began the relaunch of Stride late in the quarter, which should improve shares in the months ahead. As Irene mentioned, we have several strong programs in place to better position us for the second half.
Europe also had an outstanding margin quarter, with adjusted OI margin up 350 basis points to 18%, driven by strong productivity and lower overheads. Organic revenue in Europe was essentially flat, although here too, we're seeing a nice progression in vol/mix and share trends. Both our chocolate and biscuit categories delivered strong results in the U.K. and Germany, which helped grow vol/mix by 70 basis points for the region.
Building on last year's launch in the U.K., we also launched Ritz Crisp & Thin crackers in France, which is delivering good results, as we take the brand to a new consumption occasion. In EEMEA, adjusted OI margins were flat, driven by weaker demand and the resulting volume leverage impact.
Organic revenue declined more than 2%, driven by a slowdown in the Middle East and North Africa, where economic and geopolitical volatility, including the impact of low oil prices, is having a more pronounced effect on consumer demand. A very weak Ramadan season in the Middle East also tempered the top line. 
Despite that backdrop, Russia turned in a solid performance, growing low double digits as a result of pricing actions to offset inflation. In Asia Pacific, our adjusted OI margins were up 190 basis points, driven by improved overheads, strong productivity and pricing. Organic revenue increased 2% and vol/mix was positive, up more than 1%. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of growth in Asia.
India benefited from the launch of Bournvita Biscuits, which addresses consumers' growing need for a morning snack under a well-known brand that delivers taste and nutrition. Chocolate also generated solid gains. Australia was also strong, while Southeast Asia was up for the third straight quarter.
Our Kinh Do business in Vietnam continues to be a bright spot. Our teams are executing well as we integrate this business, which provides a platform to drive our Power Brands through its distribution network of 130,000 outlets.
China declined low single digits as the biscuit category slowed, and we lapped last year's Trident Gum launch. While overall China consumer demand has recently slowed, we believe longer-term dynamics will improve, as evidenced by our significant investment in chocolate that Irene discussed earlier.
In Latin America, adjusted OI margins declined 210 basis points. Difficult economic conditions in Brazil pressured margins in the form of currency and volume headwinds. Latin America organic revenue grew nearly 9%, led by strength in Argentina and Mexico. Argentina grew double digits, primarily due to inflation-driven pricing, while Mexico had a strong first half and continued to gain momentum as strong vol/mix contributed to high single-digit revenue growth. 
Brazil declined low single digits, and we see no short-term catalysts for improvement in the Brazilian economy. We're taking actions to close selected price gaps, but we expect the market to remain challenging in terms of both revenue and margins at least through the second half.
Let me spend a moment providing a few highlights by category. In aggregate, categories have slowed to about 3% year-to-date, driven by key emerging markets like Brazil, China and India. Our global Biscuits business grew nearly 2% with strength in the U.K., in the U.S. and Germany. Oreo led the way, growing high single digits. In addition, we're continuing to drive our well-being portfolio. belVita grew high single digits globally, while our GOOD THiNS innovation in the U.S. also posted solid results.
While our Biscuits share has been challenged in some key markets, we have a number of actions underway to address the issue. In the U.S., we're innovating across several winning biscuit platforms, while investing incremental trade spending behind our DSD execution. In Brazil, we're investing in additional advertising and consumer support, while selectively narrowing price gaps on key SKUs. Our focus remains on improving our share position. We expect the incremental actions we're taking will improve our share position in the second half.
Chocolate grew more than 2%, driven by solid results in India, Australia and the U.K. Also in the quarter, Germany continued to deliver strong growth as we lapped last year's revenue management actions. More than half of our revenue in chocolate grew share. Gum & Candy increased nearly 2%, led by solid performance in the U.S. and Mexico. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share.
Now turning to earnings per share. For Q2, our adjusted EPS was up more than 4% on a constant-currency basis, which includes the impact of coffee dilution. And then for the first half, adjusted EPS increased 17% on a constant-currency basis. Operating gains of $0.15 were the primary driver of the improvement. 
Below the line, adjusted EPS declined $0.01 as dilution from last year's coffee deal more than offset benefits from lower share count, taxes and interest expense. Note that this will be the last quarter of coffee dilution as we lap the close of last year's coffee transactions. I would note that both JDE and Keurig performed well in the quarter and contributed some upside versus our expectations.
In the second quarter, we delivered more than $500 million of free cash flow and improved our cash conversion cycle by 20 days to minus 4 days. Returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority for us, and we returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through the first half.
We've repurchased more than $1.3 billion in our shares at an average price of $41.07, and we continue to target $2 billion in share repurchases for the year. Last week, we also announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. Dividends remain an important part of our capital return strategy, as we target a payout of at least 30%. Since the spin, we've returned nearly $13 billion of cash to shareholders.
Let's take a closer look at our current outlook. As you've heard today, we feel good about our first half results and expect continued strong performance in the second half despite the macro backdrop, especially in the emerging markets. 
Specifically, we now expect the following for 2016: we've modestly reduced our organic net revenue growth outlook to approximately 2% from at least 2%. This reflects the increasing challenges we're seeing in global categories and includes about 100 basis points from revenue management actions.
We continue to expect adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16% and are increasingly confident in delivering this commitment. As you think about the second half, we expect heavier investments in the third quarter, which would lead to higher margins in the fourth quarter.
We continue to expect double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant-currency basis. Our view now includes an incremental $0.03 to $0.05 versus our last outlook due to solid operating performance, lower interest expense and strong performance in our coffee joint ventures. Unfortunately, based on recent spot rates, this upside will be mostly offset by currency. We expect currency to be a 4-point headwind to revenue growth, up from 3 points. And for adjusted EPS, we estimate an $0.08 headwind, up from $0.05.
This also includes our view of the Brexit impact on our results, which is limited to an approximate $0.02 headwind related to the currency translation impact on our U.K.-based earnings. Our net transaction exposure is very limited, as we buy a majority of our global cocoa needs in British pounds, which offset net transaction exposure in the U.K.
So to summarize our EPS outlook, the upside we're seeing in EPS allows us to fully offset the negative impact of currency changes, including Brexit. Finally, we still expect free cash flow excluding items of at least $1.4 billion.
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our results in the first half. We delivered significant margin expansion, while continuing to invest behind our Power Brands. Our vol/mix performance continued to improve, and we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the challenging operating environment, we're confident in our ability to deliver on our top and bottom line targets, and we remain on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Obviously, we're feeling like having watched what's happening particularly in Brazil, we're seeing more softness there than we had anticipated. But I'd say in our developed markets, it's really all about North America. And Europe is actually continuing to improve sequentially. We're seeing strong vol/mix performance. We're seeing nice performance on share. And so the big change is really on our U.S. Biscuits business where, as we mentioned, we saw some very aggressive trade spending from some of our competition. It is not helping to grow the category, but we certainly are responding. And I would tell you even in the early couple of weeks in July, we're starting to see that business come back. So net-net, we do expect our developed markets to continue to show strong performance in terms of vol/mix improvement as well as share. But we are -- our overall forecast is -- continues to be somewhat muted because the aggregate category growth, which we had thought would be in the 3% to 4% range, is below the lower end of that range, and that's really what's driving our forecast."

It's minor. Just want to make sure I'm writing the right thing here. The big picture, I'd just kind of like to go back to the capital allocation and just at least give it a try, see what you think of this question. But if the margin upside is as good as laid out and if there is more to come after 2018, why not just take the capital and buy back stock and execute the margin improvement program? Wouldn't a large acquisition require the sale of equity, which is presumably underearning right now? And then, I just want to say, Irene, that I'm really trying to make this not a Hershey question and I totally understand your sensitivity. I'm really trying to focus on the margin potential side of this and how big is that margin potential over time. And then lastly, I just note that this builds on the big margin changes that we've seen at the peers with some announcement for bigger margin expectations having just gotten rolled out. So it's incredibly topical."

And we will continue to invest in those assets to drive long-term growth. In the near-term and frankly over the longer-term, the funding source for those investments will come from continued margin expansion. And as you rightly point out, we see opportunity, as you've heard from us this morning, we continue to see opportunities to deliver margins in the 17% to 18% range in 2018. And certainly, we will continue to see opportunities beyond that. So margin remains the source of expansion to the bottom line as well as a source of funding for us to continue to invest in our brand franchises. Even as our global categories have slowed, snacking categories are growing at a much faster rate than other food. And we continue to see the long-term potential of investing in that growth opportunity."

And that is the big opportunity that we see. We are certainly learning a lot from the various partnerships that we have around the world. With respect to chocolate in China, we have studied this for quite some time. The Chinese consumers love brands with personality. We've done a lot of testing with the consumer and our Milka bundle is a very unique bundle.

In doing so, we'll eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS results.

As you've all seen throughout the year, the macro environment remains challenging. Consumer demand across the globe has slowed and we continue to deal with choppy conditions in some emerging markets. In the face of this slower growth environment, we've continued to deliver solid financial results.
Through the first 9 months, we've made progress in several areas. Although our top line is not yet where we'd like it to be, year-to-date organic net revenue grew 1.6%, led by our Power Brands, which were up more than 3%. Importantly, these results reflect a steadily improving contribution from volume/mix.
We've continued to aggressively reduce overheads and improve the efficiency and cost structure of our supply chain while making necessary investments to accelerate growth. As a result, we've been able to expand adjusted operating income margin by 260 basis points. What's more, we've increased adjusted EPS by 28% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by operating gains.
Brian will provide more detail on our Q3 performance in a moment, but I'd like to underscore a few highlights. As Tim Cofer, our Chief Growth Officer, shared at the Barclays conference in September, we're focused on accelerating volume-driven revenue growth. Although there is still room for improvement, we're making progress as vol/mix turned positive in Q3, with solid contributions from North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.
Over the past 7 quarters, we've delivered a better balance of pricing and vol/mix while increasing profitability. Going forward, we'll continue to invest to support this balance because it's critical to sustainable top line growth.
Our Power Brands delivered another solid quarter and once again outpaced category growth. We're pleased to see that our largest most important brands continue to perform well even in the face of challenging market conditions.
On the bottom line, we delivered another quarter of outstanding margin and earnings growth, with adjusted OI margin up 220 basis points and adjusted EPS up more than 40% on a constant currency basis. Our year-to-date results position us well not only for the balance of this year, but also as we progress toward our 2018 adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18%.
Finally, we remain committed to a balanced and disciplined capital deployment plan, one that drives long-term growth through reinvestment in the business while providing compelling capital returns to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders, including $1.8 billion in share repurchases.
Looking ahead, we expect the environment to remain challenging, but we will continue to deliver our financial commitments by maintaining focused on what we can control and by executing the 3 pillars of our growth strategy.
First, as we contemporize our core, we're increasing A&C support behind our Power Brands, selectively investing in trade to narrow price gaps, sharpening connections with our consumers through digital marketing and innovating to redefine permissible snacking. This is playing out in our improving vol/mix and solid performance of several key Power Brands. For example, Oreo, belVita and Milka all posted mid- to high single-digit growth year-to-date and we have solid momentum behind our Thins biscuit platform, which includes innovations like Oreo Thins and Chips Ahoy! Thins on the sweet side and GOOD THiNS and Ritz Crisp & Thin on the savory side.
Second, we're filling key white spaces by establishing beachheads in key markets. We recently launched chocolate in China, where initial response to our Milka bundle has been very positive. We're also launching mainstream and premium chocolate in the U.S., where we believe the Oreo and Green & Black's brands will resonate well with consumers. We acquired the license to sell Cadbury-branded biscuits around the world. This will enable us to grow our Cadbury chocobakery portfolio in more than 100 markets. And in Japan, we launched Oreo, Ritz and premium biscuits in September, following the repatriation of our brands there. These white space opportunities will unlock sizable incremental growth in the near-term, beyond our current run rates.
And third, we're continuing to drive selling and channel ubiquity by expanding our routes to market and improving in-store execution. This includes a significant focus on e-commerce, which grew approximately 40% in Q3. Of course, given the challenging macroeconomic conditions, we're being quite selective with our investments. This helps balance margin expansion with revenue growth, both short and longer-term.
Next, we remain confident that a focused and disciplined growth strategy, our strong record of delivering cost savings and margin expansion, together with our proven cash flow will enable us to accelerate growth on both the top and bottom lines over the long-term and create significant value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
739693,403990720,1061442,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene.

We performed well on a number of key measures in Q3 and again delivered solid financial results. Organic net revenue increased 1.1% despite the negative impact of approximately 80 basis points from our revenue management actions. Our Power Brands again drove our top line, up 2.5%. And as Irene mentioned, we delivered another quarter of vol/mix improvement, which drove almost half of the revenue growth. Emerging markets rose 2% due to currency-driven pricing in inflationary markets. Our developed markets increased 0.6%, driven by positive vol/mix while also significantly expanding margins.
Now let's take a look at our margin performance. We delivered another quarter of robust adjusted OI margin expansion. Our adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to approximately 40%. Continued strong net productivity drove the improvement, which was somewhat offset by higher trade and pricing investments in a few key markets. Adjusted OI margin was 15.8%, up 220 basis points. This improvement was driven by continued reductions in overheads as a result of zero-based budgeting and the expansion of global shared services. The margin improvement included a net benefit of approximately 30 basis points from certain non-core items such as VAT-related settlements, gains from the sale of property and cost related to our U.S. labor business continuity planning.
As Shep mentioned at the beginning of the call, these results now exclude the impact of mark-to-market, which was immaterial in the quarter. Making this change allows for some reduction in both complexity and cost while providing investors with the same transparency of mark-to-market impacts.
We continue to be pleased with our progress on the cost agenda and margin expansion. We're ahead of plan for the year and will be even more aggressive in both overheads and cost reductions, given the more challenging top line growth environment. At the same time, we're fully committed to support our Power Brands with increased A&C investment. In Q4, we expect to make additional investments to drive revenue and share growth as we head into 2017.
Let me provide some color on our performance by region. In North America, we delivered another strong quarter of margin expansion as adjusted OI margins improved by 220 basis points, primarily driven by continued overhead reductions and good net productivity. On the top line, our North American business grew about 1%, driven by solid vol/mix. Biscuits growth was led by belVita, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz and Wheat Thins, which all posted solid gains. Despite soft Gum & Candy results, Sour Patch Kids delivered another strong quarter of growth while expanding share and Stride posted double-digit growth following the brand's relaunch at the end of Q2.
Europe also delivered another quarter of strong margin growth, with adjusted OI margin up 230 basis points to 19.7%. Productivity and lower overheads drove those gains. Organic net revenue was up 1%, primarily due to solid vol/mix. Biscuits posted significant growth thanks to strong results in the U.K. and France. Chocolate growth in the Germany -- in Germany was also a key driver.
In EEMEA, market dynamics deteriorated, especially in the Middle East, as the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia deal with the ongoing pressures resulting from persistent low oil prices. As a result, organic revenue declined just over 1% and adjusted OI margin decreased 100 basis points, driven by lower volume leverage. We're planning for continued weak demand for the Middle East markets over the next few quarters. Once again, however, Russia was a relatively bright spot in the region, posting double-digit growth in biscuits and modest single-digit growth overall.
Please take note that this will be the last quarter we talk about EEMEA as we consolidate this region into our Europe and Asia Pacific businesses. Details of the change are provided in our second and third quarter 10-Qs.
In Asia Pacific, adjusted OI margins grew 340 basis points to 13.4%, driven by improved overheads and good productivity. Organic revenue increased 1.5%, primarily due to vol/mix improvements as AP grew for the sixth consecutive quarter. India posted mid-single-digit growth, fueled in part by continued strength in chocolate and the launch of Bournvita Biscuits.
Southeast Asia delivered good share momentum, with solid top line growth in both the Philippines and Vietnam. We continue to see great results from our Kinh Do acquisition as Vietnam delivered high single-digit growth. Biscuits grew share by nearly 2 points. China declined slightly due to soft demand across most categories. That said, we continue to hold or grow shares across our categories and are encouraged by the early market feedback on our launch of Milka chocolate.
In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 540 points to over 15%, primarily driven by the VAT-related settlement in the quarter. Excluding this settlement, margins still posted solid growth.
Organic net revenue increased nearly 3%, led by Mexico and Argentina. Mexico grew mid-single-digits, driven by balanced vol/mix and pricing, while Argentina grew high double-digit through pricing to offset currency-driven inflation.
Consistent with our commentary from last quarter, Brazil continued to be difficult as the economy remained in deep recession. Government austerity measures, tight credit conditions and high unemployment are all weighing on consumption. We took actions to narrow price gaps in the quarter and we delivered modest growth in chocolate. We're being very selective to protect margins, but we're still seeing some down-trading, especially in biscuits. Unfortunately, we don't see any short-term catalysts for improvement in the Brazilian economy and are planning for this challenging situation to continue into at least the first half of 2017.
Let me now spend a few moments providing some highlights on the category performance. In aggregate, category growth continued to slow in the third quarter and is now at 2.6% on a year-to-date basis. While our growth has trailed the categories overall, this was primarily due to our revenue management actions and reflects the conscious decision to forgo revenue with lower margins.
Our Biscuits business grew nearly 2%, with strength in the U.K., the U.S. and Germany. Both belVita and Oreo continue to drive our Biscuits results. The launch of Chips Ahoy! Thins in the U.S. also fueled the category. 3/4 of our revenue grew share.
Chocolate grew 2%, driven by solid results in the U.K., Germany and India. More than half of our revenue grew share in this category. As we discussed at the Barclays event in September, we're launching chocolate in the U.S. and are encouraged by the initial customer feedback. A limited selection of products will be in, available in the market during the fourth quarter. This, together with our recent launch of Milka in China, will begin to have a more material impact on revenue in Q4 and into 2017.
Gum & Candy increased just over 1%, led by solid performance in Mexico and the U.S. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share.
Turning to earnings per share. In Q3, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.52, which was up 42% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by strong operating income as well as lower taxes and continued solid results from our coffee equity investments.
Moving to cash flow and capital return. As we highlighted in September, we continue to have a strong focus on improving our cash conversion cycle. To that end, in Q3, we've generated approximately $500 million of free cash flow. Several factors such as improving margins, declining CapEx, lower restructuring charges and improved cash conversion metrics put us in a good position to double our free cash flow in 2018.
During the quarter, we've returned more than $700 million of capital to shareholders, which brings us to $2.6 billion in capital returned through 9 months. To-date, we repurchased approximately $1.8 billion of shares at an average price of $41.64. We've now increased our target per share buybacks and expect to repurchase approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter.
Before I turn to the outlook, you likely saw that we launched the debt tender and also raised $3.75 billion in new notes last week. As you would expect, we're taking advantage of favorable market conditions and very attractive pricing to lower our interest costs and increase our flexibility. This is expected to be debt-neutral as we intend to use the net proceeds from the issuance to fund all or a portion of the tender offer while using the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding near-term debt maturities.
Now to the outlook. Given the slower category growth environment and more challenging conditions in emerging markets, we now expect full year organic net revenue to grow approximately 1.6%. This includes about 100 basis points from our revenue management actions. Underlying net revenue growth, we expect positive vol/mix in the fourth quarter and flat to slightly positive vol/mix for the full year.
We remain on track to deliver our 15% to 16% adjusted OI margin target. We expect to achieve this while making additional growth investments in the fourth quarter to stage 2017.
We're also increasing our EPS outlook for the year, which reflects our strong year-to-date performance. We now expect full year EPS to be up approximately 25% on a constant currency basis.
And with respect to free cash flow, excluding items, we continue to expect to deliver at least $1.4 billion for the year.
So to wrap up, we feel good about our year-to-date performance, especially in light of the difficult macro backdrop. We're pleased with the improving quality of our top line despite slower growth overall. Our vol/mix trends continue to demonstrate healthy improvement, including positive growth in Q3 and flat to positive growth for the full year. Our teams continue to deliver significant adjusted OI margin expansion while increasing investments in our Power Brands. And we're making capital return a priority, with $2.6 billion returned to shareholders year-to-date.
Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our commitments and remain on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. As usual, we will provide our outlook for 2017 during our Q4 earnings call.
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

That algorithm is working well for us, and we will continue to deploy that algorithm as we look into 2017. So we're not going to give you any guidance today, but I will tell you, our playbook is going to look like similar, where we're going to continue to focus on our Power Brands and focus in those places for investment that we think we can get the best return while continuing to streamline our cost structure to drive our margin expansion. As we think about the fourth quarter, we are not expecting a real change in the base momentum of our business today. But we have a number of incremental initiatives that we talked about in the course of the conversation here. We're continuing to roll out China chocolate. We launched it in late Q3 and we'll get a benefit in Q4 and into 2017 from that rollout. We'll start to benefit from the initial shipments related to our chocolate launch in the U.S. behind the Oreo and Green & Black's trademarks as I mentioned. We're repatriating on Nabisco Brands, particularly Ritz Oreo and premium in Japan. That will be incremental to our base. So all of those actions on top of our base momentum is what gives us confidence that we will see some improvement in momentum as we exit the year."

So I think there were several areas where we invest to trade spending. It's not surprising really trying to balance growth and margin, given competitive environment. Over time, as our algorithm as said, we think we can manage pricing net of commodities to the point where we can drop through productivity and allow pricing, net of commodities, to be about flat. But that'll be over time, and it won't be linear. It will vary quarter-to-quarter. I think that's what you're seeing.

That's forced us, in some cases, to price and that's created some of the challenges we talked about in a couple of the emerging markets. But I would say, for the most part, it's moderated. The U.K. continues to be a bit of an outlier with the recent -- the Brexit impact and we're working our way through that. We are pretty balanced though as you look at the U.K., as I said, in the second quarter. Our exposure on the transaction basis in the U.K. is balanced, given we have production. Quite a bit of our supply comes out of the U.K. and is based in local currency. So for the most part, that's not as significant as you might expect. We do also then buy a lot of our cocoa with -- in British pounds and that as well has created a bit of a cushion for us in other parts of the global business. So that said, cocoa in the recent weeks and even a couple of months has actually inflated a bit in U.S. dollars. And if that persists, that will be a challenge for us as we move forward. We'll have to monitor and manage that as we move into '17.

Obviously, that's helped us contribute to the margin expansion. It's been an element of that margin progress. Revenue management itself and the trade optimization piece of that, I would say we're still making progress in the early phases of that. We're focused on 10 markets, where the majority of our revenue is and the revenue of our trade spending. We've resourced it appropriately. We're finding opportunities to spend our dollars more effectively. To be honest, we're finding opportunities to actually grow revenue by appropriately allocating those dollars and distorting those dollars. The analytics have proven to be incredibly powerful in the centralization and aggregation of that data is very powerful. So I think that will continue to be something that we resource and build into our plans for next year. It is mix. We'll have some pressure on revenue in some markets, and as I said with the optimization a promotional spend, we can actually see upside in revenue and margin. So -- but as I said in the earlier question, the pruning and SKU rationalization related to supply chain reinvention is, I would say, it's diminishing. It's getting smaller, so as we head into next year, you asked about the trend, I think it will be less of a negative impact for next year."

There continues to be an important component of overhead scale leverage there, so that it's critical for us to fuel the growth there to be able to leverage and amortize that infrastructure. And certainly in our developed markets, we're -- in Europe, I think we're probably among the top of our peer group. In the U.S., we're getting much more in that top quartile.

With me today are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian Gladden, our CFO.
Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors.
During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.
Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.
Before we get started, please note one change in our non-GAAP measures. Consistent with majority of our peers, we're no longer electing to qualify commodity and currency-related derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, we've redefined our adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS measures to exclude gains and losses for mark-to-market impacts on commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives until the related inventory is sold.
In doing so, we'll eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS results. For your reference, we've included a schedule in the appendix of today's slides with mark-to-market gains and losses that were reflected in adjusted operating income in prior periods for comparability.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene."

As you've all seen throughout the year, the macro environment remains challenging. Consumer demand across the globe has slowed and we continue to deal with choppy conditions in some emerging markets. In the face of this slower growth environment, we've continued to deliver solid financial results.
Through the first 9 months, we've made progress in several areas. Although our top line is not yet where we'd like it to be, year-to-date organic net revenue grew 1.6%, led by our Power Brands, which were up more than 3%. Importantly, these results reflect a steadily improving contribution from volume/mix.
We've continued to aggressively reduce overheads and improve the efficiency and cost structure of our supply chain while making necessary investments to accelerate growth. As a result, we've been able to expand adjusted operating income margin by 260 basis points. What's more, we've increased adjusted EPS by 28% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by operating gains.
Brian will provide more detail on our Q3 performance in a moment, but I'd like to underscore a few highlights. As Tim Cofer, our Chief Growth Officer, shared at the Barclays conference in September, we're focused on accelerating volume-driven revenue growth. Although there is still room for improvement, we're making progress as vol/mix turned positive in Q3, with solid contributions from North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.
Over the past 7 quarters, we've delivered a better balance of pricing and vol/mix while increasing profitability. Going forward, we'll continue to invest to support this balance because it's critical to sustainable top line growth.
Our Power Brands delivered another solid quarter and once again outpaced category growth. We're pleased to see that our largest most important brands continue to perform well even in the face of challenging market conditions.
On the bottom line, we delivered another quarter of outstanding margin and earnings growth, with adjusted OI margin up 220 basis points and adjusted EPS up more than 40% on a constant currency basis. Our year-to-date results position us well not only for the balance of this year, but also as we progress toward our 2018 adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18%.
Finally, we remain committed to a balanced and disciplined capital deployment plan, one that drives long-term growth through reinvestment in the business while providing compelling capital returns to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders, including $1.8 billion in share repurchases.
Looking ahead, we expect the environment to remain challenging, but we will continue to deliver our financial commitments by maintaining focused on what we can control and by executing the 3 pillars of our growth strategy.
First, as we contemporize our core, we're increasing A&C support behind our Power Brands, selectively investing in trade to narrow price gaps, sharpening connections with our consumers through digital marketing and innovating to redefine permissible snacking. This is playing out in our improving vol/mix and solid performance of several key Power Brands. For example, Oreo, belVita and Milka all posted mid- to high single-digit growth year-to-date and we have solid momentum behind our Thins biscuit platform, which includes innovations like Oreo Thins and Chips Ahoy! Thins on the sweet side and GOOD THiNS and Ritz Crisp & Thin on the savory side.
Second, we're filling key white spaces by establishing beachheads in key markets. We recently launched chocolate in China, where initial response to our Milka bundle has been very positive. We're also launching mainstream and premium chocolate in the U.S., where we believe the Oreo and Green & Black's brands will resonate well with consumers. We acquired the license to sell Cadbury-branded biscuits around the world. This will enable us to grow our Cadbury chocobakery portfolio in more than 100 markets. And in Japan, we launched Oreo, Ritz and premium biscuits in September, following the repatriation of our brands there. These white space opportunities will unlock sizable incremental growth in the near-term, beyond our current run rates.
And third, we're continuing to drive selling and channel ubiquity by expanding our routes to market and improving in-store execution. This includes a significant focus on e-commerce, which grew approximately 40% in Q3. Of course, given the challenging macroeconomic conditions, we're being quite selective with our investments. This helps balance margin expansion with revenue growth, both short and longer-term.
Next, we remain confident that a focused and disciplined growth strategy, our strong record of delivering cost savings and margin expansion, together with our proven cash flow will enable us to accelerate growth on both the top and bottom lines over the long-term and create significant value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone.We performed well on a number of key measures in Q3 and again delivered solid financial results.

We performed well on a number of key measures in Q3 and again delivered solid financial results. Organic net revenue increased 1.1% despite the negative impact of approximately 80 basis points from our revenue management actions. Our Power Brands again drove our top line, up 2.5%. And as Irene mentioned, we delivered another quarter of vol/mix improvement, which drove almost half of the revenue growth. Emerging markets rose 2% due to currency-driven pricing in inflationary markets. Our developed markets increased 0.6%, driven by positive vol/mix while also significantly expanding margins.
Now let's take a look at our margin performance. We delivered another quarter of robust adjusted OI margin expansion. Our adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to approximately 40%. Continued strong net productivity drove the improvement, which was somewhat offset by higher trade and pricing investments in a few key markets. Adjusted OI margin was 15.8%, up 220 basis points. This improvement was driven by continued reductions in overheads as a result of zero-based budgeting and the expansion of global shared services. The margin improvement included a net benefit of approximately 30 basis points from certain non-core items such as VAT-related settlements, gains from the sale of property and cost related to our U.S. labor business continuity planning.
As Shep mentioned at the beginning of the call, these results now exclude the impact of mark-to-market, which was immaterial in the quarter. Making this change allows for some reduction in both complexity and cost while providing investors with the same transparency of mark-to-market impacts.
We continue to be pleased with our progress on the cost agenda and margin expansion. We're ahead of plan for the year and will be even more aggressive in both overheads and cost reductions, given the more challenging top line growth environment. At the same time, we're fully committed to support our Power Brands with increased A&C investment. In Q4, we expect to make additional investments to drive revenue and share growth as we head into 2017.
Let me provide some color on our performance by region. In North America, we delivered another strong quarter of margin expansion as adjusted OI margins improved by 220 basis points, primarily driven by continued overhead reductions and good net productivity. On the top line, our North American business grew about 1%, driven by solid vol/mix. Biscuits growth was led by belVita, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz and Wheat Thins, which all posted solid gains. Despite soft Gum & Candy results, Sour Patch Kids delivered another strong quarter of growth while expanding share and Stride posted double-digit growth following the brand's relaunch at the end of Q2.
Europe also delivered another quarter of strong margin growth, with adjusted OI margin up 230 basis points to 19.7%. Productivity and lower overheads drove those gains. Organic net revenue was up 1%, primarily due to solid vol/mix. Biscuits posted significant growth thanks to strong results in the U.K. and France. Chocolate growth in the Germany -- in Germany was also a key driver.
In EEMEA, market dynamics deteriorated, especially in the Middle East, as the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia deal with the ongoing pressures resulting from persistent low oil prices. As a result, organic revenue declined just over 1% and adjusted OI margin decreased 100 basis points, driven by lower volume leverage. We're planning for continued weak demand for the Middle East markets over the next few quarters. Once again, however, Russia was a relatively bright spot in the region, posting double-digit growth in biscuits and modest single-digit growth overall.
Please take note that this will be the last quarter we talk about EEMEA as we consolidate this region into our Europe and Asia Pacific businesses. Details of the change are provided in our second and third quarter 10-Qs.
In Asia Pacific, adjusted OI margins grew 340 basis points to 13.4%, driven by improved overheads and good productivity. Organic revenue increased 1.5%, primarily due to vol/mix improvements as AP grew for the sixth consecutive quarter. India posted mid-single-digit growth, fueled in part by continued strength in chocolate and the launch of Bournvita Biscuits.
Southeast Asia delivered good share momentum, with solid top line growth in both the Philippines and Vietnam. We continue to see great results from our Kinh Do acquisition as Vietnam delivered high single-digit growth. Biscuits grew share by nearly 2 points. China declined slightly due to soft demand across most categories. That said, we continue to hold or grow shares across our categories and are encouraged by the early market feedback on our launch of Milka chocolate.
In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 540 points to over 15%, primarily driven by the VAT-related settlement in the quarter. Excluding this settlement, margins still posted solid growth.
Organic net revenue increased nearly 3%, led by Mexico and Argentina. Mexico grew mid-single-digits, driven by balanced vol/mix and pricing, while Argentina grew high double-digit through pricing to offset currency-driven inflation.
Consistent with our commentary from last quarter, Brazil continued to be difficult as the economy remained in deep recession. Government austerity measures, tight credit conditions and high unemployment are all weighing on consumption. We took actions to narrow price gaps in the quarter and we delivered modest growth in chocolate. We're being very selective to protect margins, but we're still seeing some down-trading, especially in biscuits. Unfortunately, we don't see any short-term catalysts for improvement in the Brazilian economy and are planning for this challenging situation to continue into at least the first half of 2017.
Let me now spend a few moments providing some highlights on the category performance. In aggregate, category growth continued to slow in the third quarter and is now at 2.6% on a year-to-date basis. While our growth has trailed the categories overall, this was primarily due to our revenue management actions and reflects the conscious decision to forgo revenue with lower margins.
Our Biscuits business grew nearly 2%, with strength in the U.K., the U.S. and Germany. Both belVita and Oreo continue to drive our Biscuits results. The launch of Chips Ahoy! Thins in the U.S. also fueled the category. 3/4 of our revenue grew share.
Chocolate grew 2%, driven by solid results in the U.K., Germany and India. More than half of our revenue grew share in this category. As we discussed at the Barclays event in September, we're launching chocolate in the U.S. and are encouraged by the initial customer feedback. A limited selection of products will be in, available in the market during the fourth quarter. This, together with our recent launch of Milka in China, will begin to have a more material impact on revenue in Q4 and into 2017.
Gum & Candy increased just over 1%, led by solid performance in Mexico and the U.S. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share.
Turning to earnings per share. In Q3, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.52, which was up 42% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by strong operating income as well as lower taxes and continued solid results from our coffee equity investments.
Moving to cash flow and capital return. As we highlighted in September, we continue to have a strong focus on improving our cash conversion cycle. To that end, in Q3, we've generated approximately $500 million of free cash flow. Several factors such as improving margins, declining CapEx, lower restructuring charges and improved cash conversion metrics put us in a good position to double our free cash flow in 2018.
During the quarter, we've returned more than $700 million of capital to shareholders, which brings us to $2.6 billion in capital returned through 9 months. To-date, we repurchased approximately $1.8 billion of shares at an average price of $41.64. We've now increased our target per share buybacks and expect to repurchase approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter.
Before I turn to the outlook, you likely saw that we launched the debt tender and also raised $3.75 billion in new notes last week. As you would expect, we're taking advantage of favorable market conditions and very attractive pricing to lower our interest costs and increase our flexibility. This is expected to be debt-neutral as we intend to use the net proceeds from the issuance to fund all or a portion of the tender offer while using the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding near-term debt maturities.
Now to the outlook. Given the slower category growth environment and more challenging conditions in emerging markets, we now expect full year organic net revenue to grow approximately 1.6%. This includes about 100 basis points from our revenue management actions. Underlying net revenue growth, we expect positive vol/mix in the fourth quarter and flat to slightly positive vol/mix for the full year.
We remain on track to deliver our 15% to 16% adjusted OI margin target. We expect to achieve this while making additional growth investments in the fourth quarter to stage 2017.
We're also increasing our EPS outlook for the year, which reflects our strong year-to-date performance. We now expect full year EPS to be up approximately 25% on a constant currency basis.
And with respect to free cash flow, excluding items, we continue to expect to deliver at least $1.4 billion for the year.
So to wrap up, we feel good about our year-to-date performance, especially in light of the difficult macro backdrop. We're pleased with the improving quality of our top line despite slower growth overall. Our vol/mix trends continue to demonstrate healthy improvement, including positive growth in Q3 and flat to positive growth for the full year. Our teams continue to deliver significant adjusted OI margin expansion while increasing investments in our Power Brands. And we're making capital return a priority, with $2.6 billion returned to shareholders year-to-date.
Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our commitments and remain on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. As usual, we will provide our outlook for 2017 during our Q4 earnings call.
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

So we're not going to give you any guidance today, but I will tell you our playbook is going to look like similar, where we're going to continue to focus on our Power Brands and focus in those places for investment that we think we can get the best return while continuing to streamline our cost structure to drive our margin expansion.
As we think about the fourth quarter, we are not expecting a real change in the base momentum of our business today, but we have a number of incremental initiatives that we talked about in the course of the conversation here. We're continuing the rollout of China chocolate. We launched it in late Q3 and we'll get a benefit in Q4 and into 2017 from that rollout. We'll start to benefit from the initial shipments related to our chocolate launch in the U.S. behind the Oreo and Green & Black's trademarks as I mentioned. We're repatriating on Nabisco Brands, particularly Ritz, Oreo and premium in Japan. That will be incremental to our base. So all of those actions on top of our base momentum is what gives us confidence that we will see some improvement in momentum as we exit the year."

The timing, I would say, Andrew, I mean, it's something we've been looking at and benchmarking. I think we thought about the timing. The reality was it was relatively minor in the quarter, relatively minor for the year. As we think about places where we're putting hedges on for longer periods of time, it just got to the point where the volatility has increased over time. It's been more pronounced over the last year or so, and it just seemed like the right time to do it."

We gave you a range for how we're executing there. And I would just say we continue to see a lot of runway into '18 and beyond with the supply chain and gross margins.
So there were several areas where we invest to trade spending. It's not surprising really trying to balance growth and margin, given competitive environment. Over time, as our algorithm has said, we've said we think we can manage pricing net of commodities to the point where we can drop through productivity and allow pricing, net of commodities, to be about flat, but that will be over time. It won't be linear. It will vary quarter-to-quarter. I think that's what you're seeing. Feel good about the overall margin delivery offset some of the gross margin challenge with SG&A and delivered. We're up, year-to-date, 260 basis points on OI. So we tend to think about it that way. It will vary. It will be a little bit lumpy. And we feel good about the execution on supply chain."

We are pretty balanced though as you look at the U.K., as I said, in the second quarter. Our exposure on the transaction basis in the U.K. is balanced, given we have production. Quite a bit of our supply comes out of the U.K. and is based in local currency. So for the most part, that's not as significant as you might expect. We do also then buy a lot of our cocoa with -- in British pounds and that as well has created a bit of a cushion for us in other parts of the global business.

We're finding opportunities to spend our dollars more effectively. To be honest, we're finding opportunities to actually grow revenue by appropriately allocating those dollars and distorting those dollars. The analytics have proven to be incredibly powerful and the centralization and aggregation of that data is very powerful. So I think that will continue to be something that we resource and build into our plans for next year. It is mixed. We'll have some pressure on revenue in some markets.

About 5 points of that is pricing, and so we're continuing to get pricing in these markets. As I mentioned earlier, we're looking to be a lot smarter in how we execute that pricing, looking much more to use price pack architecture, smaller sizes, economy sizes to deliver that pricing. And so we're still getting pricing.
The facts are if you look at our margin performance for our emerging markets, we're getting up to the level of our peers. There continues to be an important component of overhead scale leverage there, so that it's critical for us to fuel the growth there to be able to leverage and amortize that infrastructure. And certainly, in our developed markets, we're -- in Europe, I think we're probably among the top of our peer group. In the U.S., we're getting much more in that top quartile. So I think our margins overall, in aggregate, we've made sizable margin expansion, 220 in the quarter, 260 basis points year-to-date.

So that will help actually both Europe and Asia Pacific. And basically, we'll see progress there.
With respect to Latin America, a lot of the tools that we're using, the base productivity, shifting our product mix, very disciplined focus on overheads are the same tools that we're using, and those will continue to be available in Latin America and we're going to use those as we continue our margin expansion there. So the work that's done in -- we're very pleased with the progress we've made in Asia Pacific. A lot of it is using the very same tools that we've used elsewhere in the world, zero-based budgeting, focusing on streamlining our overheads, as Brian mentioned, moving to shared services, which actually will start to affect the emerging markets more in a more pronounced away as we head into 2017.

Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.

Before we get started, please note one change in our non-GAAP measures. Consistent with majority of our peers, we're no longer electing to qualify commodity and currency-related derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, we've redefined our adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS measures to exclude gains and losses for mark-to-market impacts on commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives until the related inventory is sold.
In doing so, we'll eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS results. For your reference, we've included a schedule in the appendix of today's slides with mark-to-market gains and losses that were reflected in adjusted operating income in prior periods for comparability.

As you've all seen throughout the year, the macro environment remains challenging. Consumer demand across the globe has slowed and we continue to deal with choppy conditions in some emerging markets. In the face of this slower growth environment, we've continued to deliver solid financial results.
Through the first 9 months, we've made progress in several areas. Although our top line is not yet where we'd like it to be, year-to-date organic net revenue grew 1.6%, led by our Power Brands, which were up more than 3%. Importantly, these results reflect a steadily improving contribution from volume/mix.
We've continued to aggressively reduce overheads and improve the efficiency and cost structure of our supply chain while making necessary investments to accelerate growth. As a result, we've been able to expand adjusted operating income margin by 260 basis points. What's more, we've increased adjusted EPS by 28% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by operating gains.
Brian will provide more detail on our Q3 performance in a moment, but I'd like to underscore a few highlights. As Tim Cofer, our Chief Growth Officer, shared at the Barclays conference in September, we're focused on accelerating volume-driven revenue growth. Although there is still room for improvement, we're making progress as vol/mix turned positive in Q3, with solid contributions from North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.
Over the past 7 quarters, we've delivered a better balance of pricing and vol/mix while increasing profitability. Going forward, we'll continue to invest to support this balance because it's critical to sustainable top line growth.
Our Power Brands delivered another solid quarter and once again outpaced category growth. We're pleased to see that our largest most important brands continue to perform well even in the face of challenging market conditions.
On the bottom line, we delivered another quarter of outstanding margin and earnings growth, with adjusted OI margin up 220 basis points and adjusted EPS up more than 40% on a constant currency basis. Our year-to-date results position us well not only for the balance of this year, but also as we progress toward our 2018 adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18%.
Finally, we remain committed to a balanced and disciplined capital deployment plan, one that drives long-term growth through reinvestment in the business while providing compelling capital returns to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders, including $1.8 billion in share repurchases.
Looking ahead, we expect the environment to remain challenging, but we will continue to deliver our financial commitments by maintaining focus on what we can control and by executing the 3 pillars of our growth strategy.
First, as we contemporize our core, we're increasing A&C support behind our Power Brands, selectively investing in trade to narrow price gaps, sharpening connections with our consumers through digital marketing and innovating to redefine permissible snacking. This is playing out in our improving vol/mix and solid performance of several key Power Brands. For example, Oreo, belVita and Milka all posted mid- to high single-digit growth year-to-date and we have solid momentum behind our Thins biscuit platform, which includes innovations like Oreo Thins and Chips Ahoy! Thins on the sweet side and GOOD THiNS and Ritz Crisp & Thin on the savory side.
Second, we're filling key white spaces by establishing beachheads in key markets. We recently launched chocolate in China, where initial response to our Milka bundle has been very positive. We're also launching mainstream and premium chocolate in the U.S., where we believe the Oreo and Green & Black's brands will resonate well with consumers. We acquired the license to sell Cadbury-branded biscuits around the world. This will enable us to grow our Cadbury chocobakery portfolio in more than 100 markets. And in Japan, we launched Oreo, Ritz and premium biscuits in September, following the repatriation of our brands there. These white space opportunities will unlock sizable incremental growth in the near-term, beyond our current run rates.
And third, we're continuing to drive selling and channel ubiquity by expanding our routes to market and improving in-store execution. This includes a significant focus on e-commerce, which grew approximately 40% in Q3. Of course, given the challenging macroeconomic conditions, we're being quite selective with our investments. This helps balance margin expansion with revenue growth, both short and longer-term.
Next, we remain confident that a focused and disciplined growth strategy, our strong record of delivering cost savings and margin expansion, together with our proven cash flow will enable us to accelerate growth on both the top and bottom lines over the long-term and create significant value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

We performed well on a number of key measures in Q3 and again delivered solid financial results. Organic net revenue increased 1.1% despite the negative impact of approximately 80 basis points from our revenue management actions. Our Power Brands again drove our top line, up 2.5%. And as Irene mentioned, we delivered another quarter of vol/mix improvement, which drove almost half of the revenue growth. Emerging markets rose 2% due to currency-driven pricing in inflationary markets. Our developed markets increased 0.6%, driven by positive vol/mix while also significantly expanding margins.
Now let's take a look at our margin performance. We delivered another quarter of robust adjusted OI margin expansion. Our adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to approximately 40%. Continued strong net productivity drove the improvement, which was somewhat offset by higher trade and pricing investments in a few key markets. Adjusted OI margin was 15.8%, up 220 basis points. This improvement was driven by continued reductions in overheads as a result of zero-based budgeting and the expansion of global shared services. The margin improvement included a net benefit of approximately 30 basis points from certain non-core items such as VAT-related settlements, gains from the sale of property and costs related to our U.S. labor business continuity planning.
As Shep mentioned at the beginning of the call, these results now exclude the impact of mark-to-market, which was immaterial in the quarter. Making this change allows for some reduction in both complexity and cost while providing investors with the same transparency of mark-to-market impacts.
We continue to be pleased with our progress on the cost agenda and margin expansion. We're ahead of plan for the year and will be even more aggressive in both overheads and cost reductions, given the more challenging top line growth environment. At the same time, we're fully committed to support our Power Brands with increased A&C investment. In Q4, we expect to make additional investments to drive revenue and share growth as we head into 2017.
Let me now provide some color on our performance by region. In North America, we delivered another strong quarter of margin expansion as adjusted OI margins improved by 220 basis points, primarily driven by continued overhead reductions and good net productivity. On the top line, our North American business grew about 1%, driven by solid vol/mix. Biscuits growth was led by belVita, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz and Wheat Thins, which all posted solid gains. Despite soft Gum & Candy results, Sour Patch Kids delivered another strong quarter of growth while expanding share and Stride posted double-digit growth following the brand's relaunch at the end of Q2.
Europe also delivered another quarter of strong margin growth, with adjusted OI margin up 230 basis points to 19.7%. Productivity and lower overheads drove those gains. Organic net revenue was up 1%, primarily due to solid vol/mix. Biscuits posted significant growth thanks to strong results in the U.K. and France. Chocolate growth in the Germany -- in Germany was also a key driver.
In EEMEA, market dynamics deteriorated, especially in the Middle East, as the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia deal with the ongoing pressures resulting from persistent low oil prices. As a result, organic revenue declined just over 1% and adjusted OI margin decreased 100 basis points, driven by lower volume leverage. We're planning for continued weak demand for the Middle East markets over the next few quarters. Once again, however, Russia was a relatively bright spot in the region, posting double-digit growth in biscuits and modest single-digit growth overall.
Please take note that this will be the last quarter we talk about EEMEA as we consolidate this region into our Europe and Asia Pacific businesses. Details of the change are provided in our second and third quarter 10-Qs.
In Asia Pacific, adjusted OI margins grew 340 basis points to 13.4%, driven by improved overheads and good productivity. Organic revenue increased 1.5%, primarily due to vol/mix improvements as AP grew for the sixth consecutive quarter. India posted mid-single-digit growth, fueled in part by continued strength in chocolate and the launch of Bournvita Biscuits.
Southeast Asia delivered good share momentum, with solid top line growth in both the Philippines and Vietnam. We continue to see great results from our Kinh Do acquisition as Vietnam delivered high single-digit growth. Biscuits grew share by nearly 2 points. China declined slightly due to soft demand across most categories. That said, we continue to hold or grow shares across our categories and are encouraged by the early market feedback on our launch of Milka chocolate.
In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 540 points to over 15%, primarily driven by the VAT-related settlement in the quarter. Excluding this settlement, margins still posted solid growth.
Organic net revenue increased nearly 3%, led by Mexico and Argentina. Mexico grew mid-single-digits, driven by balanced vol/mix and pricing, while Argentina grew high double-digit through pricing to offset currency driven inflation.
Consistent with our commentary from last quarter, Brazil continued to be difficult as the economy remained in deep recession. Government austerity measures, tight credit conditions and high unemployment are all weighing on consumption. We took actions to narrow price gaps in the quarter and we delivered modest growth in chocolate. We're being very selective to protect margins, but we're still seeing some down-trading, especially in biscuits. Unfortunately, we don't see any short-term catalysts for improvement in the Brazilian economy and are planning for this challenging situation to continue into at least the first half of 2017.
Let me now spend a few moments providing some highlights on the category performance. In aggregate, category growth continued to slow in the third quarter and is now at 2.6% on a year-to-date basis. While our growth has trailed the categories overall, this was primarily due to our revenue management actions and reflects the conscious decision to forgo revenue with lower margins.
Our Biscuits business grew nearly 2%, with strength in the U.K., the U.S. and Germany. Both belVita and Oreo continue to drive our Biscuits results. The launch of Chips Ahoy! Thins in the U.S. also fueled the category. 3/4 of our revenue grew share.
Chocolate grew 2%, driven by solid results in the U.K., Germany and India. More than half of our revenue grew share in this category. As we discussed at the Barclays event in September, we're launching chocolate in the U.S. and are encouraged by the initial customer feedback. A limited selection of products will be in-- available in the market during the fourth quarter. This, together with our recent launch of Milka in China, will begin to have a more material impact on revenue in Q4 and into 2017.
Gum & Candy increased just over 1%, led by solid performance in Mexico and the U.S. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share.
Turning to earnings per share. In Q3, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.52, which was up 42% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by strong operating income as well as lower taxes and continued solid results from our coffee equity investments.
Moving to cash flow and capital return. As we highlighted in September, we continue to have a strong focus on improving our cash conversion cycle. To that end, in Q3, we've generated approximately $500 million of free cash flow. Several factors such as improving margins, declining CapEx, lower restructuring charges and improved cash conversion metrics put us in a good position to double our free cash flow in 2018.
During the quarter, we've returned more than $700 million of capital to shareholders, which brings us to $2.6 billion in capital returned through 9 months. To-date, we repurchased approximately $1.8 billion of shares at an average price of $41.64. We've now increased our target for share buybacks and expect to repurchase approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter.
Before I turn to the outlook, you likely saw that we launched the debt tender and also raised $3.75 billion in new notes last week. As you would expect, we're taking advantage of favorable market conditions and very attractive pricing to lower our interest costs and increase our flexibility. This is expected to be debt-neutral as we intend to use the net proceeds from the issuance to fund all or a portion of the tender offer while using the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding near-term debt maturities.
Now to the outlook. Given the slower category growth environment and more challenging conditions in emerging markets, we now expect full year organic net revenue to grow approximately 1.6%. This includes about 100 basis points from our revenue management actions. Underlying net revenue growth, we expect positive vol/mix in the fourth quarter and flat to slightly positive vol/mix for the full year.
We remain on track to deliver our 15% to 16% adjusted OI margin target. We expect to achieve this while making additional growth investments in the fourth quarter to stage 2017.
We're also increasing our EPS outlook for the year, which reflects our strong year-to-date performance. We now expect full year EPS to be up approximately 25% on a constant currency basis.
And with respect to free cash flow, excluding items, we continue to expect to deliver at least $1.4 billion for the year.
So to wrap up, we feel good about our year-to-date performance, especially in light of the difficult macro backdrop. We're pleased with the improving quality of our top line despite slower growth overall. Our vol/mix trends continue to demonstrate healthy improvement, including positive growth in Q3 and flat to positive growth for the full year. Our teams continue to deliver significant adjusted OI margin expansion while increasing investments in our Power Brands. And we're making capital return a priority, with $2.6 billion returned to shareholders year-to-date.
Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our commitments and remain on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. As usual, we will provide our outlook for 2017 during our Q4 earnings call.

That algorithm is working well for us and we will continue to deploy that algorithm as we look into 2017. So we're not going to give you any guidance today, but I will tell you our playbook is going to look quite similar, where we're going to continue to focus on our Power Brands and focus in those places for investment that we think we can get the best return while continuing to streamline our cost structure to drive our margin expansion.
As we think about the fourth quarter, we are not expecting a real change in the base momentum of our business today, but we have a number of incremental initiatives that we talked about in the course of the conversation here. We're continuing the rollout of China chocolate. We launched it in late Q3 and we'll get a benefit in Q4 and into 2017 from that rollout. We'll start to benefit from the initial shipments related to our chocolate launch in the U.S. behind the Oreo and Green & Black's trademarks as I mentioned. We're repatriating our Nabisco Brands, particularly Ritz, Oreo and premium in Japan. That will be incremental to our base. So all of those actions on top of our base momentum is what gives us confidence that we will see some improvement in momentum as we exit the year."

The timing, I would say, Andrew, I mean, it's something we've been looking at and benchmarking. I think we've thought about the timing. The reality was it was relatively minor in the quarter, relatively minor for the year.

We gave you a range for how we're executing there. And I would just say we continue to see a lot of runway into '18 and beyond with the supply chain and gross margins.
So there were several areas where we invested trade spending, adjusted pricing, really trying to balance growth and margin, given competitive environment. Over time, as our algorithm has said, we've said we think we can manage pricing net of commodities to the point where we can drop through productivity and allow pricing, net of commodities, to be about flat, but that will be over time. It won't be linear. It will vary quarter-to-quarter. I think that's what you're seeing. Feel good about the overall margin delivery offset some of the gross margin challenge with SG&A and delivered. We're up, year-to-date, 260 basis points on OI. So we tend to think about it that way. It will vary. It will be a little bit lumpy. And we feel good about the execution on supply chain."

We are pretty balanced though as you look at the U.K., as I said, in the second quarter. Our exposure on the transaction basis in the U.K. is balanced, given we have production.

We'll have to monitor and manage that as we move into '17. But I think, for the most part, in gross margin, we've done a reasonable job this year balancing the impact of transactional currency and pricing appropriately in key markets."

We're finding opportunities to spend our dollars more effectively. To be honest, we're finding opportunities to actually grow revenue by appropriately allocating those dollars and distorting those dollars. The analytics have proven to be incredibly powerful and the centralization and aggregation of that data is very powerful. So I think that will continue to be something that we resource and build into our plans for next year. It is mixed. We'll have some pressure on revenue in some markets.

As I mentioned earlier, we're looking to be a lot smarter in how we execute that pricing, looking much more to use price pack architecture, smaller sizes, economy sizes to deliver that pricing. And so we're still getting pricing.
The facts are if you look at our margin performance for our emerging markets, we're getting up to the level of our peers. There continues to be an important component of overhead scale leverage there, so that it's critical for us to fuel the growth there to be able to leverage and amortize that infrastructure. And certainly, in our developed markets, we're -- in Europe, I think we're probably among the top of our peer group. In the U.S., we're getting much more in that top quartile. So I think our margins overall, in aggregate, we've made sizable margin expansion, 220 in the quarter, 260 basis points year-to-date.

Before we get started, please note one change in our non-GAAP measures. Consistent with majority of our peers, we're no longer electing to qualify commodity and currency-related derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, we've redefined our adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS measures to exclude gains and losses for mark-to-market impacts on commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives until the related inventory is sold.
In doing so, we'll eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS results.

As you've all seen throughout the year, the macro environment remains challenging. Consumer demand across the globe has slowed and we continue to deal with choppy conditions in some emerging markets. In the face of this slower growth environment, we've continued to deliver solid financial results.
Through the first 9 months, we've made progress in several areas. Although our top line is not yet where we'd like it to be, year-to-date organic net revenue grew 1.6%, led by our Power Brands, which were up more than 3%. Importantly, these results reflect a steadily improving contribution from volume/mix.
We've continued to aggressively reduce overheads and improve the efficiency and cost structure of our supply chain while making necessary investments to accelerate growth. As a result, we've been able to expand adjusted operating income margin by 260 basis points. What's more, we've increased adjusted EPS by 28% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by operating gains.
Brian will provide more detail on our Q3 performance in a moment, but I'd like to underscore a few highlights. As Tim Cofer, our Chief Growth Officer, shared at the Barclays conference in September, we're focused on accelerating volume-driven revenue growth. Although there is still room for improvement, we're making progress as vol/mix turned positive in Q3, with solid contributions from North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.
Over the past 7 quarters, we've delivered a better balance of pricing and vol/mix while increasing profitability. Going forward, we'll continue to invest to support this balance because it's critical to sustainable top line growth.
Our Power Brands delivered another solid quarter and once again outpaced category growth. We're pleased to see that our largest most important brands continue to perform well even in the face of challenging market conditions.
On the bottom line, we delivered another quarter of outstanding margin and earnings growth, with adjusted OI margin up 220 basis points and adjusted EPS up more than 40% on a constant currency basis. Our year-to-date results position us well not only for the balance of this year, but also as we progress toward our 2018 adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18%.
Finally, we remain committed to a balanced and disciplined capital deployment plan, one that drives long-term growth through reinvestment in the business while providing compelling capital returns to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders, including $1.8 billion in share repurchases.
Looking ahead, we expect the environment to remain challenging, but we will continue to deliver our financial commitments by maintaining focus on what we can control and by executing the 3 pillars of our growth strategy.
First, as we contemporize our core, we're increasing A&C support behind our Power Brands, selectively investing in trade to narrow price gaps, sharpening connections with our consumers through digital marketing and innovating to redefine permissible snacking. This is playing out in our improving vol/mix and solid performance of several key Power Brands. For example, Oreo, belVita and Milka all posted mid- to high single-digit growth year-to-date and we have solid momentum behind our Thins biscuit platform, which includes innovations like Oreo Thins and Chips Ahoy! Thins on the sweet side and GOOD THiNS and Ritz Crisp & Thin on the savory side.
Second, we're filling key white spaces by establishing beachheads in key markets. We recently launched chocolate in China, where initial response to our Milka bundle has been very positive. We're also launching mainstream and premium chocolate in the U.S., where we believe the Oreo and Green & Black's brands will resonate well with consumers. We acquired the license to sell Cadbury-branded biscuits around the world. This will enable us to grow our Cadbury chocobakery portfolio in more than 100 markets. And in Japan, we launched Oreo, Ritz and premium biscuits in September, following the repatriation of our brands there. These white space opportunities will unlock sizable incremental growth in the near-term, beyond our current run rates.
And third, we're continuing to drive selling and channel ubiquity by expanding our routes to market and improving in-store execution. This includes a significant focus on e-commerce, which grew approximately 40% in Q3. Of course, given the challenging macroeconomic conditions, we're being quite selective with our investments. This helps balance margin expansion with revenue growth, both short and longer-term.
Next, we remain confident that a focused and disciplined growth strategy, our strong record of delivering cost savings and margin expansion, together with our proven cash flow will enable us to accelerate growth on both the top and bottom lines over the long-term and create significant value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
739693,403990720,1062483,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone.We performed well on a number of key measures in Q3 and again delivered solid financial results.

We performed well on a number of key measures in Q3 and again delivered solid financial results. Organic net revenue increased 1.1% despite the negative impact of approximately 80 basis points from our revenue management actions. Our Power Brands again drove our top line, up 2.5%. And as Irene mentioned, we delivered another quarter of vol/mix improvement, which drove almost half of the revenue growth. Emerging markets rose 2% due to currency-driven pricing in inflationary markets. Our developed markets increased 0.6%, driven by positive vol/mix while also significantly expanding margins.
Now let's take a look at our margin performance. We delivered another quarter of robust adjusted OI margin expansion. Our adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to approximately 40%. Continued strong net productivity drove the improvement, which was somewhat offset by higher trade and pricing investments in a few key markets. Adjusted OI margin was 15.8%, up 220 basis points. This improvement was driven by continued reductions in overheads as a result of zero-based budgeting and the expansion of global shared services. The margin improvement included a net benefit of approximately 30 basis points from certain non-core items such as VAT-related settlements, gains from the sale of property and costs related to our U.S. labor business continuity planning.
As Shep mentioned at the beginning of the call, these results now exclude the impact of mark-to-market, which was immaterial in the quarter. Making this change allows for some reduction in both complexity and cost while providing investors with the same transparency of mark-to-market impacts.
We continue to be pleased with our progress on the cost agenda and margin expansion. We're ahead of plan for the year and will be even more aggressive in both overheads and cost reductions, given the more challenging top line growth environment. At the same time, we're fully committed to support our Power Brands with increased A&C investment. In Q4, we expect to make additional investments to drive revenue and share growth as we head into 2017.
Let me now provide some color on our performance by region. In North America, we delivered another strong quarter of margin expansion as adjusted OI margins improved by 220 basis points, primarily driven by continued overhead reductions and good net productivity. On the top line, our North American business grew about 1%, driven by solid vol/mix. Biscuits growth was led by belVita, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz and Wheat Thins, which all posted solid gains. Despite soft Gum & Candy results, Sour Patch Kids delivered another strong quarter of growth while expanding share and Stride posted double-digit growth following the brand's relaunch at the end of Q2.
Europe also delivered another quarter of strong margin growth, with adjusted OI margin up 230 basis points to 19.7%. Productivity and lower overheads drove those gains. Organic net revenue was up 1%, primarily due to solid vol/mix. Biscuits posted significant growth thanks to strong results in the U.K. and France. Chocolate growth in the Germany -- in Germany was also a key driver.
In EEMEA, market dynamics deteriorated, especially in the Middle East, as the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia deal with the ongoing pressures resulting from persistent low oil prices. As a result, organic revenue declined just over 1% and adjusted OI margin decreased 100 basis points, driven by lower volume leverage. We're planning for continued weak demand for the Middle East markets over the next few quarters. Once again, however, Russia was a relatively bright spot in the region, posting double-digit growth in biscuits and modest single-digit growth overall.
Please take note that this will be the last quarter we talk about EEMEA as we consolidate this region into our Europe and Asia Pacific businesses. Details of the change are provided in our second and third quarter 10-Qs.
In Asia Pacific, adjusted OI margins grew 340 basis points to 13.4%, driven by improved overheads and good productivity. Organic revenue increased 1.5%, primarily due to vol/mix improvements as AP grew for the sixth consecutive quarter. India posted mid-single-digit growth, fueled in part by continued strength in chocolate and the launch of Bournvita Biscuits.
Southeast Asia delivered good share momentum, with solid top line growth in both the Philippines and Vietnam. We continue to see great results from our Kinh Do acquisition as Vietnam delivered high single-digit growth. Biscuits grew share by nearly 2 points. China declined slightly due to soft demand across most categories. That said, we continue to hold or grow shares across our categories and are encouraged by the early market feedback on our launch of Milka chocolate.
In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 540 points to over 15%, primarily driven by the VAT-related settlement in the quarter. Excluding this settlement, margins still posted solid growth.
Organic net revenue increased nearly 3%, led by Mexico and Argentina. Mexico grew mid-single-digits, driven by balanced vol/mix and pricing, while Argentina grew high double-digit through pricing to offset currency driven inflation.
Consistent with our commentary from last quarter, Brazil continued to be difficult as the economy remained in deep recession. Government austerity measures, tight credit conditions and high unemployment are all weighing on consumption. We took actions to narrow price gaps in the quarter and we delivered modest growth in chocolate. We're being very selective to protect margins, but we're still seeing some down-trading, especially in biscuits. Unfortunately, we don't see any short-term catalysts for improvement in the Brazilian economy and are planning for this challenging situation to continue into at least the first half of 2017.
Let me now spend a few moments providing some highlights on the category performance. In aggregate, category growth continued to slow in the third quarter and is now at 2.6% on a year-to-date basis. While our growth has trailed the categories overall, this was primarily due to our revenue management actions and reflects the conscious decision to forgo revenue with lower margins.
Our Biscuits business grew nearly 2%, with strength in the U.K., the U.S. and Germany. Both belVita and Oreo continue to drive our Biscuits results. The launch of Chips Ahoy! Thins in the U.S. also fueled the category. 3/4 of our revenue grew share.
Chocolate grew 2%, driven by solid results in the U.K., Germany and India. More than half of our revenue grew share in this category. As we discussed at the Barclays event in September, we're launching chocolate in the U.S. and are encouraged by the initial customer feedback. A limited selection of products will be in-- available in the market during the fourth quarter. This, together with our recent launch of Milka in China, will begin to have a more material impact on revenue in Q4 and into 2017.
Gum & Candy increased just over 1%, led by solid performance in Mexico and the U.S. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share.
Turning to earnings per share. In Q3, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.52, which was up 42% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by strong operating income as well as lower taxes and continued solid results from our coffee equity investments.
Moving to cash flow and capital return. As we highlighted in September, we continue to have a strong focus on improving our cash conversion cycle. To that end, in Q3, we've generated approximately $500 million of free cash flow. Several factors such as improving margins, declining CapEx, lower restructuring charges and improved cash conversion metrics put us in a good position to double our free cash flow in 2018.
During the quarter, we've returned more than $700 million of capital to shareholders, which brings us to $2.6 billion in capital returned through 9 months. To-date, we repurchased approximately $1.8 billion of shares at an average price of $41.64. We've now increased our target for share buybacks and expect to repurchase approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter.
Before I turn to the outlook, you likely saw that we launched the debt tender and also raised $3.75 billion in new notes last week. As you would expect, we're taking advantage of favorable market conditions and very attractive pricing to lower our interest costs and increase our flexibility. This is expected to be debt-neutral as we intend to use the net proceeds from the issuance to fund all or a portion of the tender offer while using the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding near-term debt maturities.
Now to the outlook. Given the slower category growth environment and more challenging conditions in emerging markets, we now expect full year organic net revenue to grow approximately 1.6%. This includes about 100 basis points from our revenue management actions. Underlying net revenue growth, we expect positive vol/mix in the fourth quarter and flat to slightly positive vol/mix for the full year.
We remain on track to deliver our 15% to 16% adjusted OI margin target. We expect to achieve this while making additional growth investments in the fourth quarter to stage 2017.
We're also increasing our EPS outlook for the year, which reflects our strong year-to-date performance. We now expect full year EPS to be up approximately 25% on a constant currency basis.
And with respect to free cash flow, excluding items, we continue to expect to deliver at least $1.4 billion for the year.
So to wrap up, we feel good about our year-to-date performance, especially in light of the difficult macro backdrop. We're pleased with the improving quality of our top line despite slower growth overall. Our vol/mix trends continue to demonstrate healthy improvement, including positive growth in Q3 and flat to positive growth for the full year. Our teams continue to deliver significant adjusted OI margin expansion while increasing investments in our Power Brands. And we're making capital return a priority, with $2.6 billion returned to shareholders year-to-date.
Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our commitments and remain on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. As usual, we will provide our outlook for 2017 during our Q4 earnings call.
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

We're focused on what we can control. So we're going to continue to focus on our cost structure and making sure that our investments are being razor-focused -- laser-focused on the places where we think we can get the best returns. That algorithm is working well for us and we will continue to deploy that algorithm as we look into 2017. So we're not going to give you any guidance today, but I will tell you our playbook is going to look quite similar, where we're going to continue to focus on our Power Brands and focus in those places for investment that we think we can get the best return while continuing to streamline our cost structure to drive our margin expansion.
As we think about the fourth quarter, we are not expecting a real change in the base momentum of our business today, but we have a number of incremental initiatives that we talked about in the course of the conversation here. We're continuing the rollout of China chocolate. We launched it in late Q3 and we'll get a benefit in Q4 and into 2017 from that rollout. We'll start to benefit from the initial shipments related to our chocolate launch in the U.S. behind the Oreo and Green & Black's trademarks as I mentioned. We're repatriating our Nabisco Brands, particularly Ritz, Oreo and premium in Japan. That will be incremental to our base. So all of those actions on top of our base momentum is what gives us confidence that we will see some improvement in momentum as we exit the year."

The reality was it was relatively minor in the quarter, relatively minor for the year.

We gave you a range for how we're executing there. And I would just say we continue to see a lot of runway into '18 and beyond with the supply chain and gross margins.
So there were several areas where we invested trade spending, adjusted pricing, really trying to balance growth and margin, given competitive environment. Over time, as our algorithm has said, we've said we think we can manage pricing net of commodities to the point where we can drop through productivity and allow pricing, net of commodities, to be about flat, but that will be over time. It won't be linear. It will vary quarter-to-quarter. I think that's what you're seeing. Feel good about the overall margin delivery offset some of the gross margin challenge with SG&A and delivered. We're up, year-to-date, 260 basis points on OI. So we tend to think about it that way. It will vary. It will be a little bit lumpy. And we feel good about the execution on supply chain."

We are pretty balanced though as you look at the U.K., as I said, in the second quarter. Our exposure on the transaction basis in the U.K. is balanced, given we have production. Quite a bit of our supply comes out of the U.K. and is based in local currency. So for the most part, that's not as significant as you might expect. We do also then buy a lot of our cocoa with -- in British pounds and that as well has created a bit of a cushion for us in other parts of the global business. So that said, cocoa in the recent weeks and even a couple of months has actually inflated a bit in U.S. dollars. And if that persists, that will be a challenge for us as we move forward.

Obviously, that's helped us contribute to the margin expansion. It's been an element of that margin progress.

We're focused on 10 markets where the majority of our revenue is and the majority of our trade spending. We've resourced it appropriately. We're finding opportunities to spend our dollars more effectively. To be honest, we're finding opportunities to actually grow revenue by appropriately allocating those dollars and distorting those dollars. The analytics have proven to be incredibly powerful and the centralization and aggregation of that data is very powerful. So I think that will continue to be something that we resource and build into our plans for next year. It is mixed. We'll have some pressure on revenue in some markets. And as I said, with the optimization of promotional spend, we can actually see upside in revenue and margin. So -- but as I said in the earlier question, the pruning and SKU rationalization related to supply chain reinvention is, I would say, it's diminishing. It's getting smaller.

About 5 points of that is pricing, and so we're continuing to get pricing in these markets. As I mentioned earlier, we're looking to be a lot smarter in how we execute that pricing, looking much more to use price pack architecture, smaller sizes, economy sizes to deliver that pricing. And so we're still getting pricing.
The facts are if you look at our margin performance for our emerging markets, we're getting up to the level of our peers. There continues to be an important component of overhead scale leverage there, so that it's critical for us to fuel the growth there to be able to leverage and amortize that infrastructure. And certainly, in our developed markets, we're -- in Europe, I think we're probably among the top of our peer group. In the U.S., we're getting much more in that top quartile. So I think our margins overall, in aggregate, we've made sizable margin expansion, 220 in the quarter, 260 basis points year-to-date. But -- it's coming from a balance of the work that we're doing in both our developed and our emerging markets. And again, pricing is -- we feel quite confident in our ability to price smartly in these emerging markets, and the results you're seeing reflect that."

So they're a bit behind in terms of executing on transformation. Some of that margin expansion opportunity is still to come. And as you know, we've invested, in many cases, ahead of the growth and we've chose to stick with those investments and count on the fact that those emerging markets will come back and be a nice lever for us when growth returns."

I think your year-to-date expansion in Asia has been pretty striking. And it seems to be maybe evolving a bit different relative to your base plan a few years ago, which rested more on holding margins flat and driving profit through a faster top line. I mean, assume the category growth does remain challenged, how are your options now evolving to address the cost base and overheads in LatAm and EEMEA going forward? I know [indiscernible]."

We start with EEMEA is inheriting some of the business. We announced that we're breaking up our EEMEA region, some of the business into Asia Pacific and some of the business into Europe, and that will inherently give us much more leverage on the Middle Eastern business and the Africa business and the Eastern Europe business that is a part of that. So that will help actually both Europe and Asia Pacific. And basically, we'll see progress there.
With respect to Latin America, a lot of the tools that we're using, the base productivity, shifting our product mix, a very disciplined focus on overheads are the same tools that we're using, and those will continue to be available in Latin America and we're going to use those as we continue our margin expansion there. So the work that's done in -- we're very pleased with the progress we've made in Asia Pacific. A lot of it is using the very same tools that we've used elsewhere in the world, zero-based budgeting, focusing on streamlining our overheads, as Brian mentioned, moving to shared services, which actually will start to affect the emerging markets more in a more pronounced away as we head into 2017. So we see the opportunities in our other emerging market geographies similar to what we've done in Asia Pacific, but we're very pleased with the performance in Asia Pacific."
