I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations, and with me today are Rick Smith, our Chairman in Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we realigned to the reporting structure of our direct-to-consumer reseller business and that it now reports into our Personal Solutions business. Previously, direct-to-consumer resellers were reported within the USIS and International segments based on the country of the customer. We have provided the quarterly history for Personal Solutions, USIS and International, and the new format for each quarter in 2014 and 2015 in the Q&A section of our earnings release. All discussion of the 2015 business unit performance and their outlook for 2016 will be consistent with the new structure. 
Earlier this week, the Veda shareholders voted to accept Equifax's acquisition offer, and we also received subsequent approval from the courts. Therefore, the 2016 guidance that are provided today as well as the updated long-term business model for Equifax, which is included in the Q&A section of our earnings release, both include the impact of the Veda acquisition. However, our guidance for the first quarter of 2016 will not include any impact from Veda, including the incremental cost of the debt given the short amount of time that it will be part of Equifax in the quarter. 
During this call, as in previous earnings releases, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margins, which will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. In 2016, we will be emphasizing adjusted EBITDA margin in discussing our operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income adding back depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the acquisition and integration expenses from Veda, which are also reflected in our definition of adjusted EPS. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables posted on our website. 
During this call, Bill be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax in this business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and the subsequent filings. Please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick."

Thanks, as always, for joining us this morning. Execution across all of our 4 business units continues to be very strong and enabled us to deliver yet another strong quarter in the fourth quarter as well as the",3221,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks, as always, for joining us this morning. 
Execution across all of our 4 business units continues to be very strong and enabled us to deliver yet another strong quarter in the fourth quarter as well as the full year. For the quarter, fourth quarter 2015, total revenue was $666 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis from 2014. For the quarter, FX created $18 million of year-over-year headwind for us. The adjusted operating margin was 27.1%, up from 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 12% from $1.02 in 2014. And just to refresh your memory, that exceeded the upper end of the guidance range we provided on the last call, which is $1.10 to $1.12. 
Finally, given our strong performance in 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend up to now $0.33 a quarter, and this is, as you probably all know, the sixth consecutive double-digit increase in our dividend rate, reflecting the strong performance of the company. I think you'll agree on many dimensions. 2015 was outstanding year for our 117-year-old business. We exceeded our expectations. We have broad-based contributions from each business unit, industrial verticals and across the vast majority of our geographies, our team delivered. We're well positioned for a strong 2016. We'll talk about the economic environment in the Q&A, and I'm proud of the team for their continued commitment to innovation, execution, outstanding customer service. 
For the full year, total revenue is $2.7 billion, up 9% on a reported basis and up 12% on a local currency basis for 2014. And for the year, FX created a $76 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, up 90 basis points from 26.5% in 2014 and well above the targeted 25 basis points or so increase we guided to in the past. Adjusted EPS was $4.15, up 16% from $3.89 a year ago. And just as a reminder, that performance in 2015 was all organically driven as we had no acquisitions in the year. As always, our transition to the business units for some brief commentary before John gives you details. I'll go through some highlights for the business as well and then we'll get to more specifics. 
Let me talk, first of all, Jeff mentioned in his opening comments, we repositioned PSOL in 2015. You know that this team has been working diligently on their new growth model, which I fully support, and it's yielding benefits, and John will go through some of those numbers. at The same time, I made the decision that it was important we had one team, one leader, one business that we manage all strategy, all product positioning in the geographies for our consumer business regardless of that business going direct to the consumer or if it was going through a reseller. So we made the decision to realign that under Daniel Adams now who leads our direct-to-consumer businesses globally. I think that gives us more continuity going forward. 
Now on to the businesses themselves. USIS delivered an impressive 8% revenue growth for the year while expanding its operating margins 290 basis points. Our insights-driven strategy, which we've talked about, has resonated extremely well of our largest clients in key our client program. Our KCP customers are purchasing multiple Decision 360 products and services in aggregate access almost 5 Equifax data products, which is remarkable. Across our Top 100 clients, Decision 360 products and services are increasing as well, and there, they're accessing about 3 products on average. So D360 is really making a difference in the marketplace for us. 
In USIS, our product management solutions business again delivered healthy 22% growth for the year, largely driven by their ID authentication and management solution products. Our enterprise vertical strategy has made significant contributions to our total company revenue growth. We experienced industry executives in these verticals. We are better able to leverage our diverse data assets, analytical expertise in IT platforms to deliver premier Decision Solutions. USIS leads many of our enterprise vertical initiatives. To give you an example, a few of those in 2015, our vertical grew 25% in USIS and 29% for the total company. This again compares favorably to the average Mortgage Bankers Application index, which was up 17% for the year. So that trend of outperforming the mortgage market has continued now for many, many years. Next example is in the auto vertical, which USIS revenue grew 6% and total company grew 9%. This also compares very favorably to the overall market where verticals -- sales approximately 5%. And more recently, our retail banking vertical grew USIS revenue 17% and total company revenue by 18%. So you get a sense there that there's enterprise focus taking all over data assets and seasoned leaders in each vertical and delivering those unique assets to our customers is enabling us to grow significantly, in many cases, faster than market itself. 
For years now, we've been working with Fannie Mae on ways to better leverage our information to further improve the underwriting process for mortgage loans. Late in 2015, Fannie Mae made the decision to incorporate credit data into the underwriting process for mortgage lending. We talked about this with you in the past. This initiative will be important contributor to revenue in both 2016 and 2017. It also represents a significant structural change in the loan underwriting and it sets the stage for applications outside the mortgage lending to increasingly use trended data and our world-class analytical talent and leverage our Cambrian platform, which we talked about before. We're well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities as they arrive -- arise. Live testing is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2016 and go live midyear. More importantly, trended data will be available through our core credit online delivery system, making them information available for all solutions that access our credit database. 
Opportunities for USIS in 2016 and beyond are significant. Trended data, ID and fraud for the penetration on targeted vertical markets are all expected to make important contributions to sustained revenue growth. Our multi-year model for USIS remains, as we've communicated to you before, with top line growth in the 5% to 7% range. And adjusted EBITDA margin, which we'll now talk about going forward, is expected to be in the high 40s expanding to the low 50s over time. International delivered 12% local currency revenue growth with strong performance coming from our operations in Europe, in Latin America. Revenue in International's 3 largest verticals, FIs, telcos and small, medium-sized enterprises grew 13% in 2015. Our decision platforms, analytic solutions and debt management revenue grew 12% in 2015. Europe had an outstanding year, driven by largely by broad-based growth in our U.K. operations. By industry, FI, telco, SMEs all grew high to low double digits for the year. By offering Decision Solutions, analytical services and debt management all grew at double-digit rates in 2015. 
TDX has been working, as you know, with U.K. government to manage their past-due consumer debt in fourth quarter 2015 and started receiving accounts at that time, and we started placing those accounts with a collection analyzing the data in the fourth quarter of last year. And while still early, the performance of the data is slightly ahead of our expectations. This opportunity, along with our ongoing sales efforts, is expected to be a significant strategic initiative driving growth for International for years to come. International historically delivered some of our strongest performance in New Product Innovation, which has been a significant contributor to the incremental revenue growth, further market penetration obviously customer loyalty to build products and solutions that we couldn't build in the past. This broad-based effort towards innovation continues to fuel growth for International. For the year, our 6 geographies in International, represents almost 2/3 of the revenue delivered an NPI Vitality Index of 10% or greater, which is fabulous. International has some exciting opportunities ahead of it, in addition to try [indiscernible] will come back and talk later, which will become a part of the International operation. In 2016, we broadly expanded Cambrian, deploying it across the International geographies, substantially enhancing our ability to deliver analytical insights and drive growth. The continued excellent performance with new products and cost benefits and the regionalization efforts begun last year as well as the addition to Veda will expand EBITDA margins in 2016 and beyond. 
We have moderately raised our expectations for multi-year growth in International now to range of 7 -- or 8% to 10%, with adjusted EBITDA margins in the low 30s growing to mid 30s over time. Both of those measures in top line and EBITDA margin reflect the anticipated close of Veda. 
On to Workforce Solutions. They grew 18% last year. It was an outstanding performance as was their 510 basis point margin expansion for the year. Core product growth, along with a number of new product initiatives, all contributed to this outstanding performance. Verification Services is strong and broad-based growth of 25% in the year continues to be driven by adding records in the Work Number database. As their coverage of individual employment records increases the valuable service enables us to further penetrate our key targets verticals, including mortgage, auto, consumer finance, government and preemployment. All those verticals, every one of them, was up a strong double digit for the year. Just amazingly strong, balanced growth. 
At year-end, the Work Number database reached almost 280 million records as we stated before. We're well on our way to achieving 300 million records in total. The recent emergence of what they call the instant mortgage facilitated through online application process has generated new growth opportunities for automated income and employment verification. We recently signed one of the largest players in this space because of our unique ability to deliver both the credit information as well as the employment and income verification simultaneously and speeding up the process and enhancing the consumer experience. 
Within EWS, the Employer Services business also had another very strong year in 2015, growing 8%. Much of this growth was driven by our Workforce Analytics offering, which we talk to you about before. This allows employers to ensure that they are compliant with the Affordable Care Act as well as providing ACA-required tax information to employees. Workforce Analytics doubled their business in 2015 and is expected to more than double again in 2016. Our Workforce Analytics client base now is approaching over 800 clients with the pipeline remains very strong. To date, our solutions has largely been focused on our larger enterprise customers in 2016. We're starting to go down market, enabling us to capture relationships with smaller employees, which we can offer cross-sell opportunities with our other employee services offerings. Health care-related revenue generated by both our income verification and the Affordable Care Act to find solutions more than doubled in 2015 versus 2014. And workforce solutions has delivered a stellar performance not just in 2015 but over the last 9 years. As a business, they were quick to adopt our approach to innovate and to embrace LEAN. As a result, they've outperformed on revenue growth and substantially improved their margin. Looking forward, expanding and further penetrating their key markets and verticals, increasing their number of records in the Work Number database and globalizing their footprint, we'll continue to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. Our multi-year expectation for Workforce Solutions has been increased. Now expecting revenue growth of 9% to 11%, with adjusted EBITDA margin in the high-40% range expanding to low 50s over time. 
Personal Solutions finalized its strategic transformation and it's executing well against its four-pronged strategy. For the year, the newly constructed global Personal Solutions delivered 19% local currency growth -- revenue growth and is well positioned to for 2016 and beyond. Revenue growth from our direct and indirect consumer activities continues to meet our expectations. Revenue growth in our Personal Solutions business in Canada and U.K. was up a nice 7% in 2015. In the U.S., we continue to perform consistent with our expectations with increasing ARPU and lowering subscriber churn. Our direct-to-consumer resellers were the most significant contributor to Personal Solutions in 2015. We talked about that one as a part of the USIS. Our reseller revenues in both Canada and the U.K. grew solid as well. It's solid double digit, in fact, in 2015. And the reseller revenue -- reseller revenue in U.S. was very strong, primarily driven by the 2-year contract where leading companies in this space, credit and we talked to you about that. We're also well positioned for continued growth in 2016 and makes an addition of a new reseller [indiscernible] we signed a multiyear contract a few months back. 
With our broad-based portfolio of data assets, we believe there'll be additional opportunities in 2016 and beyond to provide a broader array of credit, income and fraud services the consumers to our direct and reseller channel. Under the new organizational structure, our multi-year expectation for revenue growth in PSol is now 5% to 8%, up from the previous target of 4% to 6%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the low 30s expanding to the mid-30s over time. The outsized growth in 2015 was primarily driven by the start-up of our relationship with Credit Karma, the largest of our DTC, direct-to-consumer the resellers. In 2016, we'll anniversary this revenue, so long-term growth rates from PSol will revert back to more normal levels again at 5% to 8% with strong growth going forward. 
Now on to some corporate highlights before I turn the mic over to John to give you more details on the financials. Today, we have a truly global company with a global set of processes deployed around the world, a global structure, a global culture and a group that's all focused on the core set of global strategic imperatives. Over the years, we've globalized our most critical and fundamental management to facilitate greater linkage between our strategy and our execution. And through this effort, we have streamlined our product innovation and placement. We've enabled greater leverage of our IT platforms. We've optimized the investment of our talent. We've more effectively moved our talent and products where greatest opportunities exist. This globalization also enable us to better and more quickly leverage the skills and expertise that often one market, i.e. in USIS, into another market in International. Again, that's both processes, products and people. Everybody in the company is measured in they contribute to our imperatives regardless of what part of the organization they reside. 
Having reinvigorated our NPI and New Product Innovation, what we talked to you about last year about 2.0 and the next phase of innovation, we launched 64 new products last year. Along with the pipeline of 2016 launches, we expect the revenue contributions to deliver strong NPI growth in 2016 and beyond. Our largest and most diverse growth opportunities are executed under our Enterprise Growth Initiatives we call EGI. In 2015, year-over-year revenue, growth from these large initiatives, was over 20%, and so 20% growth over 2014. In 2015, we exceeded our expectations for NPI revenues by 6%. Furthermore, I've discussed with you in the past, the class of products we launched in 2015 under our revitalized effort of 2.0 are expected to deliver a record level of revenue, year 3 revenue when compared to prior year launches. It is the healthiest class of products that we've launched since NPI has been in existence here. One of the more exciting new product opportunities revolves around trended data. The effort and investment we're making to fulfill our commitments to Fannie Mae will be leveraged across all of our unique data assets. We firmly believe that the next horizon for information-based solution is trended data, which will underpin more powerful decision and solutions for our customers and significantly improve our competitive position. So to be clear, our focus is trending as many of our unique data assets, which truly unique only to Equifax or our customers to provide these values, so things like the Work Number and C+ and others. 
Finally, as of many of our corporate management documents, our global NPI process will be implemented in Veda once we complete the acquisition. Now I'll review that in a moment. In 2015, we launched our Big Data platform called Cambrian. Cambrian will enable faster development and delivery analytical insights, including improving the speed in which we develop new products. It'll also greatly enhance our Decision 360 capabilities and provide significant competitive advantage using advanced Veda analytic techniques. Other corporate impairment for us has been about LEAN. LEAN continues to make incremental contributions to our expense leverage and exceeded our goal by contributing over 30% greater benefit in 2015 than we had budgeted. And we leveraged our expertise in LEAN principles to deepen our relationships with some of our largest customers with projects that help them streamline many of their operational activities, and that obviously provides a competitive differentiator boost in the marketplace. 
Let me close before I give it to John and talk a little bit about Veda. I'm sure many of you are aware that the regulatory approval of Veda received in December enabled them to schedule a shareholder meeting, which Jeff alluded to a little bit ago. They had a shareholder meeting on February 8 and gained approval there, and they've also received a the final Court approval this week. And at this point, it's our expectation to close the acquisition at the end of February of this year. We're very excited about this opportunity they represent for us. They have great strategy, strong financial performance, outstanding management team, great market position. And they also give us a significant opportunity in the Asia Pacific geography of further broadening and enhancing our geographic footprint, which is important to us as we diversify revenue stream. As we move into our first quarter earnings call and beyond, obviously we'll keep you apprised of the strategic and the financial progress of that the team is making with his new asset. 
In closing, our performance in 2015 exemplifies the culture and the strength of our management team and our dedication and the entire organization to innovate and execute for our customers. It's a culture and a process that has taken years to develop, and it underpins the confidence we have in our ability to continue delivering on our commitments and to make our customers and shareholders satisfied with that performance. Our strategic imperatives as we enter 2016 are a few areas. They are very important to us. We cascade this around the world. One, obviously, is to deliver strong and consistent profitable growth and shareholder returns; two, to develop unparalleled analytically insights, leveraging the unique data assets in Equifax has; three is to innovate for market leadership in key domains and verticals in which we operate; four, is to serve the trusted steward and advocate for customers and consumers around the world; and obviously, closing the last, to invest in talent to drive that strategy and foster a culture of innovation. 
So with that, john, as you always do, please go through the financials."

As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentio",1958,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. 
Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentioned at the opening, all this information is based on the new segments with direct-to-consumer resellers moved into PSol from USIS and International. Going forward, given the substantial amortization expense related to the Veda acquisition, we will increase our discussion of EBITDA for Equifax and the operating segments. 
U.S. Information Solutions revenue in 4Q '15 was $296 million, up 7% when compared to the fourth quarter of '14. For the full year, revenue of $1.2 billion was up 8%. This compares favorably to our long-term expectation for USIS of 5% to 7% growth as both mortgage and automotive were very strong in 2015. 
Online Information Solutions revenue was $204 million in 4Q '15, up 6% year-to-year and $842 million for the full year, up 8% when compared to the prior year. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $28 million in 4Q '15, up 10% year-to-year and $124 million for calendar year '15, up 17%. Total mortgage-related revenue was up 16% and 17% in the quarter for USIS and Equifax, respectively. For calendar year '15, mortgage-related revenue was up 25% and 29% for USIS and Equifax, respectively. This compares favorably to the average Mortgage Bankers Application index, which was up 14% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the calendar year. 
Financial Marketing Services revenue was $64 million in 4Q '15, up 7% year-to-year and $205 million for calendar year '15, up 5% year-to-year. The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 41.6% in 4Q '15 and 41.9% for calendar year '15, up 50 basis points and 290, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.5% in 4Q '15 and 49.7% in calendar year '15. We expect to see continued expansion in the USIS EBITDA margins in 2016. 
International's revenue was $143 million in 4Q '15, down 1% on a reported basis but up 11% on a local currency basis. Revenue was $569 million for calendar year '15, down 1% on a reported basis but up 12% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $64 million in 4Q '15, up 3% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in local currency. For calendar year '15, Europe revenue was $247 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 12% on local currency. Latin America's revenue was $49 million in 4Q '15, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Revenue was $200 million for calendar year '15, up 4% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. Latin America showed outstanding local currency growth throughout '15, led by strong growth across Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. 
Canada revenue was $29 million, down 11% in U.S. dollars but up 5% in local currency. Revenue for calendar year '15 was $122 million in U.S. dollars, down 11% U.S. dollars but up 3% in local currency. Canada's performance strengthened very nicely in the second half and has momentum going into 2016. 
International's operating margin was 20.7% in 4Q '15 and 20% in calendar year '15. EBITDA margins were 27.2% in 4Q '15 and 27% in calendar year '15. Both operating and EBITDA margins were down year-to-year in International, however, both showed sequential improvement in the fourth quarter relative to the third. In 2016, we expect to see continued margin improvement, driven by continued strong local currency growth and the benefits of regionalization as well as from the addition of Veda. We'll see some margin pressure related to weakened foreign currencies, particularly with the Canadian dollar and the devaluation of the Argentinean peso. 
Workforce Solutions revenue was $144 million in the quarter, up 12% year-to-year and $578 million in calendar year '15, up 18% year-on-year. This reflects continued very strong growth in Verification Services, up 14% in fourth quarter and 25% year-to-year. Employer services also delivered a very strong performance, up 8% in the fourth quarter and 8% in the calendar year. This was driven by success in their Compliance Center offerings and their solution for employers' compliance that are the requirements of the ACA. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 36.8% in 4Q '15 and 37.9% in calendar year '15, up 430 and 510 basis points, respectively. Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins were 44.3% in the fourth quarter and 45.1% in the calendar year. We expect continued strong expansion of Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins in 2016. 
Global Personal Solutions revenue of $84 million in 4Q '15, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on local currency basis. Revenue in calendar year '15 was $346 million, up 18% on a reported basis and up 19% on a local currency basis. PSol's business has 2 main areas: credit and identity monitoring services sold through direct and indirect channels that protect and monitor consumers' ID and enable consumers to gain better access to credit, and credit another data sales sold through our DTC reseller partners. Credit and identity monitoring services sold through the indirect channel represent those circumstances where Equifax provides white label online credit and identity services through partners. In 2015, ongoing revenue from credit and identity monitoring services grew at the high end of 4% to 6% guidance range we have previously provided for the PSOL segment prior to the addition of DTC sellers. DTC reseller's revenue represent sales of credit and other data to resellers. In these cases, Equifax provides data and analytics but not the web properties with which the customer directly interacts. Examples of these business are relationships with Credit Karma and LifeLock. DTC reseller revenue showed substantial growth in 2015, driven primarily by our relationship with Credit Karma, which began in 4Q '14. Our DTC reseller revenue should continue to grow faster than our direct-to-consumer sales, but as Rick mentioned, not at the very high rate you saw in 2015. 
Looking forward, as previously mentioned, we expect this overall segment to grow 5% to 8%. Operating margin was 27% in 4Q '15 and 27.5% for calendar year '15, consistent with our expectations. EBITDA margins were 29.7% in 4Q '15 and 30.2% in calendar year '15. PSOL revenue and operating margin in the 4Q '14 [ph] were very strong, reflecting a large reach deal won in 4Q '14. 4Q '15 operating margin of 27% was consistent with our expectations and our guidance and reflects the impact of our decision to invest more in marketing in 2015 as well as the addition of DTC reseller business to PSOL. 
In the fourth quarter, general corporate expense was $51 million, excluding $3.7 million for onetime expenses associated with the Veda acquisition, general corporate expense was up slightly from 3Q, consistent with our guidance. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect general corporate expense, excluding Veda-related acquisition and integration expenses, to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million and run at a slightly lower rate throughout the remaining quarters of the year. The adjusted operating margin at 27.1% in 4Q '15 and 27.4% in calendar year '15 were up 60 and 90 basis points year-to-year, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.4% in 4Q '15 and 34.8% in calendar year '15. We expect to see improvements in our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2016 expanding by about 75 basis points. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.6%, equal to our expectation and in our guidance. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate, after adjusting for non-GAAP items, the Missouri state tax law change in the second quarter and TDX escrow adjustment in third quarter, was 33.7% consistent with our comments during our third quarter release. Looking forward into 2016, our expectation is for a GAAP effective tax rate of about 33%. 
Operating cash flow was $205 million in 4Q '15 and $742 million in calendar year '15. Both were very strong, reflecting strong earnings and working capital performance. Free cash flow, equal to operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was very strong in 2015 at $596 million, up 12% from 2014. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $53 million and for calendar year '15 were $146 million. Consistent with our comments throughout the year, the increase in capital spending versus 2014 reflects the acceleration of our investment in New Product Innovation, deployment of global platforms, including Cambrian and other analytics, InterConnect, fraud, and our PSol infrastructure. As we look forward to 2016, we expect capital spending, including Veda, to be in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This is consistent with 2015 and reflects a continuation of our current investments as well as some additional spending in the near term as we integrate Veda. This is slightly higher than our expected long-term rate of capital spending of about 5% of revenue due to the Veda integration.
As Rick indicated, we have received Veda shareholder approval and approval from the Australian courts to complete the purchase of Veda. We expect the acquisition to close on about February 25. Total purchase price, including assumed debt and fees, is approximately USD 1.9 billion. At the close of the Veda transaction, we will have debt outstanding of just under $3.1 billion and debt to EBITDA on a trailing basis of just under 3x. As indicated previously, we expect to maintain our current credit ratings. In 2016, we will focus on using our very strong cash flow for debt reduction and returning our leverage to a level consistent with our current credit rating. Therefore, we do not intend to repurchase shares in 2016. We will, however, continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016 with a goal of delivering on our long-term model of an additional 1 to 2 points of revenue growth. Assuming acquisitions consistent with our targets in 2016 and 2017, we would expect to repurchase shares in 2017. 
As we discussed last quarter, we will exclude Veda transactions and other acquisition expenses and integration expenses incurred in the first year after the Veda acquisition through 1Q '17 and calculating adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin and EBITDA margin. We will provide information regarding transaction and acquisition expenses incurred with the acquisition as well as integration expenses we expect to incur related to the Veda acquisition after the transaction closes at our 1Q '16 Earnings Release Conference Call. Also, Jeff mentioned at the beginning of the call, given the relatively short time we will own Veda in the quarter, our 1Q '16 guidance does not include the impact of Veda nor the incremental debt cost, including interest expense related to the acquisition. We will provide you details on the impact of Veda on 1Q '16 during our 1Q '16 earnings call in April. 
The 2016 full year guidance Rick will provide includes Veda. For 2016, we have assumed Veda will be part of Equifax for 10 months. Veda revenue for 10 months is assumed to be USD 220 million to USD 230 million. This include an estimate of the impact to revenue of U.S. GAAP, which will be updated as we close 1Q '16. The benefit to adjusted EPS from Veda, net of acquisition financing cost, is about $0.10 to $0.15 per share. As a reminder, adjusted EPS excludes acquisition amortization expense. For modeling purposes, you can assume an average cost of our Veda acquisition debt during 2016 of about 2.5%. Veda's seasonality of revenues is similar to Equifax, with 2Q revenue typically the highest from a seasonality perspective, 1Q generally the lowest revenue, and 3Q and 4Q somewhat similar in terms of revenue. The spread between 2Q and 1Q revenue has recently been in the range of 7% to 10%. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

As I've mentioned before to all of you and many of you noted in our conversations and in the write ups, the level of execution and the momentum this team has generated in 2015 is the best in my",719,"Thanks, John. Some summary comments before we go to the Q&A. As I've mentioned before to all of you and many of you noted in our conversations and in the write ups, the level of execution and the momentum this team has generated in 2015 is the best in my 10 years here. I think it's truly remarkable what they've done. We are well positioned for growth opportunities that lie ahead and our ability to take care -- to take on any of the challenges that may confront us. In the coming years, the incremental revenue that would be contributing from class of new products that we just launched, we expect it to exceed our historical average. That's the wind in our back. Our enterprise growth initiatives, including the expanded insights, driven by Cambrian, healthcare, trended data and auto, will not only enhance our competitive position but also deliver growth opportunities for years to come. All of these efforts are expected, in our opinion, to offset the anticipated slowdown of U.S. mortgage market, which, as you know, started to decelerate over the course of 2015. While it's impossible to predict where the mortgage market is going to go, especially when I look this morning at 10-year Treasury under 1.6, forecast range from down 20% to up mid-single digits. Our forecast that we're giving you for 2016 is anticipating that the mortgage market will be down single digits in 2016. And obviously, our expectation of the team in both Workforce Solutions and USIS, as they have done for many, many years, outperforms that quite significantly. Obviously, if rates continue to stay low as they are, there may be some market upside to what occurs in the mortgage market, and we'll all know obviously when we head deeper into the year. 
2016 is yet again expected to be another strong year performance for the company. For the year, we expect revenue, including the impact of Veda, to be between $3 billion and $3.1 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of the '15% to 19%. That's going to be partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in October that the organic constant currency growth would be at the high end of our long-term range of 6% to 8%. I got to say it again, that's at the high end of our range coming off at constant currency growth last year of 12%. So it's, I think, quite remarkable. As John mentioned, we also expect to add another 1 to 2 points of tuck-in acquisitions throughout the year. These additional acquisitions are obviously beyond Veda, which as you said is not including our 2000 -- I'm sorry, in the first [ph] quarter of 2016 outlook. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $4.95 and $5.05, which is up 10% to 12% per year, excluding approximately $0.13 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 13% to 15%. For the first quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $685 million and $695 billion, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%. That will be partially offset by about 3 points of FX headwinds in the quarter. First quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.14 and $1.16, which is up 7% to 8%, excluding $0.04 per share of negative impact on FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 12% to the first quarter. Again, we expect to close the Veda in the first quarter, but we'll not include that in the estimate. Maybe in the Q&A, we'll talk about why it's not in the first quarter, for that 1 month. In 2016, we'll also going to shift our focus to adjusted EBITDA margin, and we talked about that throughout the call, since it's better represents the true operating profound the company. In 2016, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by a solid 75 basis points over last year's 34.8% EBITDA margin. In our modified multiyear business model, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the upper 30% to 40% range and with annual acceleration of at least at 25 basis points. 
So with that, operator, if you open up for questions for audience, that would be great."

And combine that with some very smart people internally and externally we leverage on the routine basis, economists that help us think through the consumer small business lending trends. And We are not seeing a slowdown in our markets, maybe an exception here are there, but nothing material, David, that gives me concern that the forecast we gave you for guidance is not very attainable.

That's kind of behind us now. We'll to start to see margin expansion in PSOL, levels you saw in 2015. We also invested in 2 main areas in International that are behind us now, one was, as you're very well aware, standing up of the U.K. government contract. it was a year-long, heavy investment. And now, the revenue starts to come because it was virtually no revenue in 2015. Secondly, we talked about kind of regionalization of platforms and people and processes that give us a long term, more cost-efficient International model. Those investments were largely made in 2015.

As a result, they're willing to pay more for trended data. The other point I alluded to in my prepared comments, Paul, was we're going to trend more than just the credit file and take out really unique data assets when no else has and start trending those. Think about the value of trending income data versus taking a snapshot in time so -- and then you take the utility data. So the trending -- I really mean this is the sort of the trending of data especially the unique data assets we have I think creates innovative products and solutions for the years to come.

LEAN is an example, and our ability to operate global platforms and take global processes and prudent take cost out and act and react to a recessionary environment is far greater today than it was. We're in infancy stage in understanding globalizing the platform, globalizing the process and deploying around the world, so we could act much faster if we had to in the environment. Two, just the overall pipeline of products we have, we're much stronger now. We're in early days of NPI back then. The EGI did not exist then. So just the ability to grind out organic growth that exist then. And lastly, we have built some counter -- I mean, 2 other points, countercyclical products that are bigger now, that did well. I think about unemployment claims as an example in EWS that will do well in a recessionary environment. And we're more global today, especially with the addition of Veda and their platform. If the entire globe is in recession, that doesn't really help you. But if it's isolated a few of the developed markets, in fact, a little bit of growth enterprise may help us as well."

Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section of the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we realigned the reporting structure of our direct-to-consumer reseller business, so that it now reports into our Personal Solutions business. Previously, direct-to-consumer resellers were reported within the USIS and International segments based on the country of the customer. We have provided the quarterly history for Personal Solutions, USIS and International, and the new format for each quarter in 2014 and 2015 in the Q&A section of our earnings release. All discussion of the 2015 business unit performance and their outlook for 2016 will be consistent with the new structure. 
Earlier this week, the Veda shareholders voted to accept Equifax's acquisition offer, and we also received subsequent approval from the court. Therefore, the 2016 guidance provided today as well as the updated long-term business model for Equifax, which is included in the Q&A section of our earnings release, both include the impact of the Veda acquisition. However, our guidance for the first quarter of 2016 will not include any impact from Veda, including the incremental cost of the debt. Given the short amount of time, Veda will be part of Equifax in the quarter. 
During this call, as in previous earnings releases, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin, which will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. In 2016, we will be emphasizing adjusted EBITDA margin in discussing our operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income adding back depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the acquisition and integration expenses from Veda, which are also reflected in our calculation of adjusted EPS. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables posted on our website. 
During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax in this business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and the subsequent filings. Please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick."

Thanks, as always, for joining us this morning.  Execution across all 4 of our business units continues to be very strong, and enabled us to deliver yet another strong quarter in the fourth quarter as well as the full year. For the quarter, fourth quarter 2015 total revenue was $666 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis from 2014. For the quarter, FX created $18 million of year-over-year headwind for us. The adjusted operating margin was 27.1%, up from 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 12% from $1.02 in 2014. And just to refresh your memory, that exceeded the upper end of our guidance range we provided on the last call, which is $1.10 to $1.12. Finally, given our strong performance in 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend up to now $0.33 a quarter, and this is, as you probably all know, the sixth consecutive double-digit increase in our dividend rate, reflecting the strong performance of the company. I think you'll agree on many dimensions. 2015 was an outstanding year for our 117-year-old business. We exceeded our expectations. We had broad-based contributions from each business unit, industrial verticals, and across the vast majority of our geographies, our team delivered. We're well positioned for a strong 2016. We'll talk about the economic environment in the Q&A, and I'm proud of the team for their continued commitment to innovation, execution, outstanding customer service. 
For the full year, total revenue is $2.7 billion, up 9% on a reported basis, and up 12% on a local currency basis for 2014, and for the year, FX created a $76 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, up 90 basis points from 26.5% in 2014, and well above the targeted 25 basis points or so increase we have guided to in the past. Adjusted EPS was $4.15, up 16% from $3.89 a year ago, and just as a reminder, that performance in 2015 was all organically driven, as we had no acquisitions in he year. As I always do, I'll transition to the business units for some brief commentary before John gives you the details. I'll go through some highlights for the business as well, and then we'll get in to more specifics. 
I want to talk, first of all, Jeff mentioned in his opening comments, we repositioned PSOL in 2015. You know that this team has been working diligently on their new growth model, which I fully support. It's yielding benefits, and John will go through some of those numbers. At the same time, I made the decision that it was important that we have one team, one leader, one business that would manage all strategy, all product positioning in the geographies for our consumer business, regardless of that business going direct to the consumer or if it was going through a reseller. So we've made the decision to realign that under Dan Adams now, who leads our direct-to-consumer businesses globally. I think that just gives us more continuity going forward. 
Now onto the businesses themselves. USIS delivered an impressive 8% revenue growth for the year, while expanding its operating margins 290 basis points. Our insights-driven strategy, which we've talked about, has resonated extremely well with our largest clients in key our client program. Our KCP customers are purchasing multiple Decision 360 products and services, in aggregate, access almost 5 Equifax data products, which is remarkable. Across our top 100 clients, Decision 360 products and services are increasing as well, and there, they're accessing about 3 products on average. So D360 is really making a difference in the marketplace for us. 
In USIS, our product vending management solutions business again delivered a healthy 22% growth for the year, largely driven by their ID authentication and management solution products. Our enterprise vertical strategy has made significant contributions to our total company revenue growth. With experienced industry executives in these verticals, we are better able to leverage our diverse data assets, analytic expertise in IT platforms to deliver premier Decision Solutions. USIS leads many of our enterprise vertical initiatives. To give you an example, a few of those in 2015, our mortgage vertical grew 25% in USIS and 29% for the total company. This again compares favorably to the average Mortgage Bankers Application index, which was up 17% for the year. So that trend of outperforming the mortgage market has continued now for many, many years. Next example is in the auto vertical, which USIS revenue grew 6% and total company grew 9%. This also compares very favorably with the overall market where verticals -- vehicles sales dropped approximately 5%. And more recently, our retail banking vertical grew USIS revenue 17%, and total company revenue by 18%. So you get a sense there that there's enterprise focus taking all over data assets and seasoned leaders in each vertical, delivering those unique assets to our customers, is enabling us to grow significantly, and in many cases, faster than the market itself. 
For years now, we've been working with Fannie Mae on ways to better leverage our information to further improve the underwriting process for mortgage loans. Late in 2015, Fannie Mae made the decision to incorporate credit data into the underwriting process for mortgage lending. We talked about this with you in the past. This initiative will be an important contributor to revenue in both 2016 and 2017. It also represents a significant structural change in the loan underwriting, and it sets the stage for applications outside the mortgage lending to increasingly use trended data and our world-class analytical talent and leverage our Cambrian platform, which we talked about before. We're well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities as they arise. Live testing is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2016, and go live midyear. More importantly, trended data will be available through our core credit online delivery system, making the information available for all solutions that access our credit database. 
Opportunities for USIS in 2016 and beyond are significant. Trended data, ID and fraud, further penetration in our targeted vertical markets are all expected to make important contributions to sustained revenue growth. Our multi-year model for USIS remains, as we've communicated to you before, with top line growth in the 5% to 7% range. And adjusted EBITDA margin, which we'll now talk about going forward, is expected to be in the high 40s, expanding to the low-50s over time. International delivered 12% local currency revenue growth, with strong performance coming from our operations in Europe, in Latin America. Revenue in international's 3 largest verticals: FIs, telcos and small, medium-sized enterprises, grew 13% in 2015. Our decision platforms, analytic solutions and debt management revenue grew 12% in 2015. Europe had an outstanding year, driven by largely by broad-based growth in our U.K. operations. By industry, FI, telco, SMEs all grew high to low double digits for the year. Our offering: Decision Solutions, analytical services and debt management all grew at double-digit rates in 2015. 
TDX has been working, as you know, with U.K. government to manage their past-due consumer debt in fourth quarter 2015, and started receiving accounts at that time, and we started placing those accounts with the collection agencies, analyzing the data in the fourth quarter of last year, and while still early, the performance of the data is slightly ahead of our expectations. This opportunity, along with our ongoing sales efforts, is expected to be a significant strategic initiative, driving growth for international for years to come. Internationals historically delivered some of our strongest performance in New Product Innovation, which has been a significant contributor to incremental revenue growth, further market penetration, and obviously, customer loyalty because we're new build products and solutions that we couldn't build in the past. This broad-based effort towards innovation continues to fuel growth for international. For the year, our 6 geographies in international, represented almost 2/3 of the revenue, delivered an NPI Vitality Index of 10% or greater, which is fabulous. International has some exciting opportunities ahead of it, in addition to Veda, which I'll come back and talk later, which will become a part of the International operation. In 2016, we broadly expanded Cambrian, deploying it across the International geographies, substantially enhancing our ability to deliver analytical insights and drive growth. The continued excellent performance with new products and cost benefits and the regionalization efforts begun last year, as well as the addition to Veda, will expand EBITDA margins in 2016 and beyond. We have moderately raised our expectations for multi-year growth in international now to a range of 7% -- or 8% to 10%, with adjusted EBITDA margins in the low-30s, growing to mid-30s over time. Both those measures in top line and EBITDA margin reflect the anticipated close of Veda. 
On to Workforce Solutions. They grew 18% last year. It was an outstanding performance, as was their 510 basis point margin expansion for the year. Core product growth, along with a number of new product initiatives, all contributed to this outstanding performance. Verification Service is strong and broad-based growth of 25% in the year continues to be driven by adding records in the Work Number database. As their coverage of individual employment records increases the value of our service enables us to further penetrate our key target verticals, including mortgage, auto, consumer finance, government and preemployment. In all those verticals, every one of them, was up a very strong double digit for the year, just amazingly strong, balanced growth. At year-end, the Work Number database reached almost 280 million records, as we stated before. We're well on our way to achieving 300 million records in total. The recent emergence of what they call the instant mortgage facilitated through online application process has generated new growth opportunities for automated income and employment verification. We recently signed one of the largest players in the space because of our unique ability to deliver both the credit information, as well as the employment and income verification simultaneously by speeding up the process and enhancing the consumer experience. 
Within EWS, the Employer Services business also had another very strong year in 2015, growing 8%. Much of this growth was driven by our Workforce Analytics offering, which we've talked to you about before. This allows employers to ensure that they are compliant with the Affordable Care Act, as well as providing ACA-required tax information to employees. Workforce Analytics doubled their business in 2015, and is expected to more than double again in 2016. Our Workforce Analytics client base now is approaching over 800 clients. Our pipeline remains very strong. To date, our solutions' largely been focused on our larger enterprise customers in 2016. We're starting to go down market, enabling us to capture relationships with smaller employees, which we can offer cross-sell opportunities with our other employee services offerings. Health care-related revenue, generated by both our income verification and the Affordable Care Act compliance solutions, more than doubled in 2015 versus 2014. And workforce solutions has delivered a stellar performance, not just in 2015, but over the last 9 years. As a business, they were quick to adopt our approach to innovate and to embrace Lean. As a result, they've outperformed on revenue growth and substantially improved their margin. Looking forward, expanding and further penetrating their key markets and verticals, increasing their number of records in the Work Number database and globalizing their footprint will continue to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. Our multi-year expectation for Workforce Solutions has been increased. Now expecting revenue growth of 9% to 11%, with adjusted EBITDA margin in the high-40% range, expanding to low-50s over time. 
Personal Solutions finalized its strategic transformation, and is executing well against its four-pronged strategy. For the year, the newly constructed global Personal Solutions delivered 19% local currency growth -- revenue growth, and is well-positioned for 2016 and beyond. Revenue growth from our direct and indirect consumer activities continues to meet our expectations. Revenue growth in our Personal Solutions business in Canada and U.K. was up a nice 7% in 2015. In the U.S., we continue to perform consistent with our expectations, with increasing ARPU and lowering subscriber churn. Our direct-to-consumer resellers were the most significant contributor to Personal Solutions in 2015. We've talked about that one. That was a part of USIS. Our reseller revenues in both Canada and the U.K. grew solid as well, a solid double digit, in fact, in 2015. And the reseller revenue -- the reseller revenue in U.S. was very strong, primarily driven by the 2-year contract. We're a leading company in the space. Credit Karma will talk to you about that. We're also well-positioned for continued growth in 2016. You may have seen the addition of a new reseller, LifeLock. We signed a multiyear contract a few months back. 
With our broad-based portfolio of data assets, we believe there'll be additional opportunities in 2016 and beyond to provide a broader array of credit, income and fraud services to consumers through our direct and reseller channel. Under the new organizational structure, our multi-year expectations for revenue growth in PSOL is now 5% to 8%, up from the previous target of 4% to 6%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the low-30s, expanding to the mid-30s over time. The outsized growth in 2015 was primarily driven by the start-up of our relationship with Credit Karma, the largest of our DTC, direct-to-consumer resellers. In 2016, we'll anniversary this revenue, so long-term growth rates for PSOL will revert back to more normal levels again of 5% to 8%, with strong growth going forward. 
Now on to some corporate highlights before I turn the mic over to John to give you more details on the financials. Today, we are truly global company with a global set of processes deployed around the world, a global structure, a global culture and a group that's all focused on the core set of global strategic imperatives. Over the years, we've globalized our most critical and fundamental management disciplines to facilitate greater linkage between our strategy and our execution. And through this effort, we have streamlined our product innovation and placement. We've enabled greater leverage of our IT platforms. We've optimized the investment in our talent. We've more effectively moved our talent and products where the greatest opportunities exist. This globalization also enables us to better and more quickly leverage the skills and expertise develop in one market, i.e. in USIS, into another market, International. Again, that's both processes, products and people. Everybody in the company is measured and evaluated in what they contribute to our imperatives, regardless of what part of the organization they reside. 
Having reinvigorated our NPI, New Product Innovation, what we talked to you about last year of our 2.0 and the next phase of innovation, we launched 64 new products last year. Along with the pipeline of 2016 launches, we expect the revenue contributions to deliver strong NPI growth in 2016 and beyond. Our largest and most diverse growth opportunities are executed under our enterprise growth initiatives we call EGI. In 2015, year-over-year revenue growth from these large initiatives was over 20%, and so a 20% growth over 2014. In 2015, we exceeded our expectations for NPI revenues by 6%. Furthermore, I've discussed with you in the past, the class of products we launched in 2015 under our revitalized effort of 2.0 are expected to deliver a record level of revenue, year 3 revenue when compared to prior year launches. It is the healthiest class of products that we've launched since NPI has been in existence here. One of the more exciting new product opportunities revolves around trended data. The effort and investment we're making to fulfill our commitment to Fannie Mae will be leveraged across all of our unique data assets. We firmly believe that the next horizon for information-based solution is trended data, which will underpin more powerful decision and solutions for our customers and significantly improve our competitive position. So to be clear, our focus is trending as many of our unique data assets, which are truly unique only to Equifax or our customers to provide these values, so things like the Work Number and C+ [ph] and others. 
Finally, as with many of our corporate management documents, our global NPI process will be implemented in Veda once we complete the acquisition, and I'll get to Veda in a moment. In 2015, we launched our Big Data platform called Cambrian. Cambrian will enable faster development and delivery analytic insights, including improving the speed at which we develop new products. It will also greatly enhance our Decision 360 capabilities, and provide significant competitive advantage using advanced analytic techniques. Now the corporate impairment for us has been about LEAN. LEAN continues to make incremental contributions to our expense leverage, and exceeded our goal by contributing over 30% greater benefit in 2015 than we had budgeted. And we've leveraged our expertise in LEAN principles to deepen our relationships with some of our largest customers, with projects that help them streamline many of their operational activities, and that obviously provides a competitive differentiator boost in the marketplace. 
Let me close before I give it to John and talk a little bit about Veda. I'm sure many of you are aware that the regulatory approval of Veda received in December enabled them to schedule a shareholder meeting, which Jeff alluded to a little bit ago. They had a shareholder meeting on February 8 and gained approval there, and they've also received a the final court approval this week, and at this point, it's our expectation to close the acquisition at the -- towards the end of February of this year. We're very excited about this opportunity, represent for us the great strategy, strong financial performance, outstanding management team, great market position, and they also give us a significant opportunity in the Asia Pacific geography of further broadening and enhancing our geographic footprint, which is important to us, as we diversify revenue stream. As we move into our first quarter earnings call and beyond, obviously, we'll keep you apprized of the strategic and the financial progress that the team is making with his new asset. 
In closing, our performance in 2015 exemplifies the culture and the strength of our management team and our dedication in the entire organization to innovate and execute for our customers. It's a culture and a process that has taken years to develop, and it underpins the confidence we have in our ability to continue delivering on our commitments and to make our customers and shareholders satisfied with that performance. Our strategic imperatives, as we enter 2016, are in a few areas that are very important to us. We cascade this around the world. One, obviously, is deliver strong and consistent profitable growth and shareholder returns; two, to develop unparalleled analytically insights, leveraging the unique data assets that Equifax has; three is to innovate for market leadership in the key domains and verticals in which we operate; four, is to serve as a trusted steward and advocate for customers and consumers around the world; and obviously, in closing, the last, to invest in talent to drive that strategy and foster a culture of innovation. 
So with that, John, as you always do, please go through the financials."

As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentione",1966,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentioned at the opening, all BU information is based on the new segments with direct-to-consumer resellers moved to PSOL from USIS and International. Going forward, given the substantial amortization expense related to the Veda acquisition, we will increase our discussion of EBITDA for Equifax and the operating segments. 
U.S. Information Solutions revenue in 4Q '15 was $296 million, up 7% when compared to the fourth quarter of '14. For the full year, revenue of $1.2 billion was up 8%. This compares favorably to our long-term expectation for USIS of 5% to 7% growth as both the mortgage and automotive were very strong in 2015. 
Online Information Solutions revenue was $204 million in 4Q '15, up 6% year-to-year and $842 million for the full year, up 8% when compared with the prior year. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $28 million in 4Q '15, up 10% year-to-year, and $124 million for calendar year '15, up 17%. Total mortgage-related revenue was up 16% and 17% in the quarter for USIS and Equifax, respectively. For calendar year '15, mortgage-related revenue was up 25% and 29% for USIS and Equifax, respectively. This compares favorably to the average Mortgage Bankers Application index, which was up 14% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the calendar year. 
Financial Marketing Services revenue was $64 million in 4Q '15, up 7% year-to-year and up $205 million for calendar year '15, up 5% year-to-year. The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 41.6% in 4Q '15 and 41.9% for calendar year '15, up 50 basis points and 290 basis points, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.5% in 4Q '15 and 49.7% in calendar year '15. We expect to see continued expansion in the USIS EBITDA margins in 2016. 
International's revenue was $143 million in 4Q '15, down 1% on a reported basis, but up 11% on a local currency basis. Revenue was $569 million for calendar year '15, down 1% on a reported basis, but off 12% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $64 million in 4Q '15, up 3% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in local currency. For calendar year '15, Europe revenue was $247 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 12% on local currency. Latin America's revenue was $49 million in 4Q '15, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Revenue was $200 million for calendar year '15, up 4% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. Latin America showed outstanding local currency growth throughout '15, led by strong growth across Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Canada revenue was $29 million, down 11% in U.S. dollars, but up 5% in local currency. Revenue for calendar year '15 was $122 million in U.S. dollars, down 11% in U.S. dollars but up 3% in local currency. Canada's performance strengthened very nicely in the second half, and has momentum going into 2016. 
International's operating margin was 20.7% in 4Q '15 and 20% in calendar year '15. EBITDA margins were 27.2% in 4Q '15, and 27% in calendar year '15. Both operating and EBITDA margins were down year-to-year in International. However, both showed sequential improvement in the fourth quarter relative to the third. In 2016, we expect to see continued margin improvement, driven by continued strong local currency growth and the benefits of regionalization as well as from the addition of Veda. We will see some margin pressure related to weakened foreign currencies, particularly with the Canadian dollar and the devaluation of the Argentinean peso. 
Workforce Solutions revenue was $144 million in the quarter, up 12% year-to-year, and $578 million in calendar year '15, up 18% year-to-year. This reflects continued very strong growth in Verification Services, up 14% in fourth quarter and 25% year-to-year. Employer services also delivered a very strong performance, up 8% in the fourth quarter and 8% in the calendar year. This was driven by success in their Compliance Center offerings and their solution for employers' compliance that are the requirements of the ACA. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 36.8% in 4Q '15 and 37.9% in calendar year '15, up 430 and 510 basis points, respectively. Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins were 44.3% in the fourth quarter, and 45.1% in the calendar year. We expect continued strong expansion of Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins in 2016. 
Global Personal Solutions revenue was $84 million in 4Q '15, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis. Revenue in calendar year '15 was $346 million, up 18% on a reported basis and up 19% on a local currency basis. PSOL's business has 2 main areas: credit and identity monitoring services sold through direct and indirect channels that protect and monitor consumers' ID and enable consumers to gain better access to credit, and credit another data sales sold through our DTC reseller partners. Credit and identity monitoring services sold through the indirect channel represent those circumstances where Equifax provides white label online credit and identity services through partners. In 2015, ongoing revenue from credit and identity monitoring services grew at the high end of the 4% to 6% guidance range we have previously provided for the PSOL segment prior to the addition of DTC sellers. DTC reseller's revenue represent sales of credit and other data to resellers. In these cases, Equifax provides data and analytics, but not the web properties with which the customer directly interacts. Examples of this business are relationships with Credit Karma and LifeLock. DTC reseller revenue showed substantial growth in 2015, driven primarily by our relationship with Credit Karma, which began in 4Q '14. Our DTC reseller revenue should continue to grow faster than our direct-to-consumer sales, but as Rick mentioned, not at the very high rate you saw in 2015. 
Looking forward, as previously mentioned, we expect this overall segment to grow 5% to 8%. Operating margin was 27% in 4Q '15 and 27.5% for calendar year '15, consistent with our expectations. EBITDA margins were 29.7% in 4Q '15 and 30.2% in calendar year '15. PSOL revenue and operating margin in 4Q '14 were very strong, reflecting a large reach deal won in 4Q '14. 4Q '15 operating margin of 27% was consistent with our expectations and our guidance, and reflects the impact of our decision to invest more in marketing in 2015, as well as the addition of DTC reseller business to PSOL. 
In the fourth quarter, general corporate expense was $51 million, excluding $3.7 million for onetime expenses associated with the Veda acquisition. General corporate expense was up slightly from 3Q, consistent with our guidance. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect general corporate expense, excluding Veda-related acquisition and integration expenses, to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million and run at a slightly lower rate throughout the remaining quarters of the year. The adjusted operating margin at 27.1% in 4Q '15 and 27.4% in calendar year '15 were up 60 and 90 basis points year-to-year, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.4% in 4Q '15 and 34.8% in calendar year '15. We expect to see improvements in our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2016, expanding by about 75 basis points. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.6%, equal to our expectation and in our guidance. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate, after adjusting for non-GAAP items, the Missouri state tax law change in the second quarter and TDX escrow adjustment in third quarter, was 33.7% consistent with our comments during our third quarter release. Looking forward into 2016, our expectation is for a GAAP effective tax rate of about 33%. 
Operating cash flow was $205 million in 4Q '15 and $742 million in calendar year '15. Both were very strong, reflecting strong earnings and working capital performance. Free cash flow, equal to operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was very strong in 2015 at $596 million, up 12% from 2014. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $53 million and for calendar year '15 were $146 million. Consistent with our comments throughout the year, the increase in capital spending versus 2014 reflects the acceleration of our investment in New Product Innovation, deployment of global platforms, including Cambrian and other analytics, InterConnect, fraud, and our new PSOL infrastructure. As we look forward to 2016, we expect capital spending, including Veda, to be in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This is consistent with 2015 and reflects a continuation of our current investments as well as some additional spending in the near term as we integrate Veda. This is slightly higher than our expected long-term rate of capital spending of about 5% of revenue due to the Veda integration.
As Rick indicated, we have received Veda shareholder approval and approval from the Australian courts to complete the purchase of Veda. We expect the acquisition to close on about February 25. Total purchase price, including assumed debt and fees, is approximately USD 1.9 billion. At the close of the Veda transaction, we will have debt outstanding of just under $3.1 billion, and debt to EBITDA on a trailing basis of just under 3x. As indicated previously, we expect to maintain our current credit ratings. In 2016, we will focus on using our very strong cash flow for debt reduction and returning our leverage to a level consistent with our current credit rating. Therefore, we do not intend to repurchase shares in 2016. We will, however, continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016 with a goal of delivering on our long-term model of an additional 1 to 2 points of revenue growth. Assuming acquisitions consistent with our targets in 2016 and 2017, we would expect to repurchase shares in 2017. 
As we discussed last quarter, we will exclude Veda transactions and other acquisition expenses and integration expenses incurred in the first year after the Veda acquisition through 1Q '17, and calculating adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin and EBITDA margin. We will provide information regarding transaction and acquisition expenses incurred with the acquisition, as well as integration expenses we expect to incur related to the Veda acquisition after the transaction closes at our 1Q '16 earnings release conference call. Also, Jeff mentioned at the beginning of the call, given the relatively short time we will own Veda in the quarter, our 1Q '16 guidance does not include the impact of Veda nor the incremental debt cost, including interest expense related to the acquisition. We will provide you details on the impact of Veda on 1Q '16 during our 1Q '16 earnings call in April. 
The 2016 full year guidance Rick will provide includes Veda. For 2016, we have assumed Veda will be a part of Equifax for 10 months. Veda revenue for 10 months is assumed to be USD 220 million to USD 230 million. This include an estimate of the impact to revenue of U.S. GAAP, which will be updated as we close 1Q '16. The benefit to adjusted EPS from Veda net of acquisition financing cost is about $0.10 to $0.15 per share. As a reminder, adjusted EPS excludes acquisition amortization expense. For modeling purposes, you can assume an average cost of our Veda acquisition debt during 2016 of about 2.5%. Veda's seasonality of revenues is similar to Equifax, with 2Q revenue typically the highest from a seasonality perspective, 1Q generally the lowest revenue, and 3Q and 4Q somewhat similar in terms of revenue. The spread between 2Q and 1Q revenue has recently been in the range of 7% to 10%. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

Some summary comments before we go to the Q&A. As I've mentioned before to all of you and many of you noted in our conversations and in the write ups, the level of execution and the momentum this team has generated in 2015 is the best in my 10 years here. I think it's truly remarkable what they've done. We are well positioned for growth opportunities that lie ahead and our ability to take care -- to take on any of the challenges that may confront us. In the coming years, the incremental revenue that would be contributing from class of new products that we just launched, we expect it to exceed our historical average. That's the wind in our back. Our enterprise growth initiatives, including the expanded insights, driven by Cambrian, healthcare, trended data and auto, will not only enhance our competitive position but also deliver growth opportunities for years to come. All of these efforts are expected, in our opinion, to offset the anticipated slowdown of U.S. mortgage market, which, as you know, started to decelerate over the course of 2015. While it's impossible to predict where the mortgage market is going to go, especially when I look this morning at 10-year Treasury under 1.6, forecast range from down 20% to up mid-single digits. Our forecast that we're giving you for 2016 is anticipating that the mortgage market will be down single digits in 2016. And obviously, our expectation of the team in both Workforce Solutions and USIS, as they have done for many, many years, outperforms that quite significantly. Obviously, if rates continue to stay low as they are, there may be some market upside to what occurs in the mortgage market, and we'll all know obviously when we head deeper into the year. 
2016 is yet again expected to be another strong year performance for the company. For the year, we expect revenue, including the impact of Veda, to be between $3 billion and $3.1 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of the '15% to 19%. That's going to be partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in October that the organic constant currency growth would be at the high end of our long-term range of 6% to 8%. I got to say it again, that's at the high end of our range coming off at constant currency growth last year of 12%. So it's, I think, quite remarkable. As John mentioned, we also expect to add another 1 to 2 points of tuck-in acquisitions throughout the year. These additional acquisitions are obviously beyond Veda, which as you said, is not included in our 2000 -- I'm sorry, in the first quarter of 2016 outlook. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $4.95 and $5.05, which is up 10% to 12% per year, excluding approximately $0.13 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 13% to 15%. For the first quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $685 million and $695 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%. That will be partially offset by about 3 points of FX headwind in the quarter. First quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.14 and $1.16, which is up 7% to 8%, excluding $0.04 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 12% for the first quarter. Again, we expect to close Veda in the first quarter, but we'll not include that in the estimate. Maybe during the Q&A, we'll talk about why it's not in the first quarter for that 1 month. In 2016, we'll also going to shift our focus to adjusted EBITDA margin. We'll just talk about that throughout the call since it better represents the true operating performance of the company. 2016, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by a solid 75 basis points over last year's 34.8% EBITDA margin. In our modified multiyear business model, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the upper 30% to 40% range, with annual acceleration of at least 25 basis points. 
So with that, operator, if you'd open up for questions for audience, that would be great."

And we are not seeing a slowdown in our markets. Maybe an exception here or there, but nothing material, David, that gives me concern that the forecast we just gave you for guidance is not very attainable.

What you're going to see there is continued margin expansion in businesses that have been expanding now for quite some time. That's EWS, as you alluded to, and USIS. That trend will continue. Number two, we intentionally made investments in PSOL in 2015 to position them for better growth in 2016 and beyond. That's kind of behind us now. So you'll start to see margin expansion in PSOL, from the levels you saw in 2015. We also invested in 2 main areas in International that are behind us now. One was, as you're very well aware, standing up of the U.K. government contract, which was a year-long, heavy investment. And now, the revenue starts to come because it was virtually no revenue in 2015. Secondly, we talked about kind of regionalization of platforms and people and processes that give us a long term, more cost-efficient International model. Those investments were largely made in 2015. Those have now been anniversaried. So you'll start to see International and PSOL margins expanding this year. And obviously, International, I think I alluded to it, will be -- also, their margins will be enhanced with the addition of a very high-margin, successful business in Veda.

But we are such -- we're so lightly penetrated in many of the high-growth markets. There's years of growth to go on the verification side in the U.S. alone. And you add to that, which is not the heart of your question, growth from the analytics platform that we've built on the employer side. And I gave a little comment, which I didn't expand upon, but I will now, in my prepared comments, David. The appetite for customers and geographies around the world for us to take this platform of the Work Number to their geographies is stronger now than it's ever been. And we have got a team working full speed on a couple of many geographies around the world. And so I'm not going to get in a lot of detail on where. But they saw the same problems that we're solving here there. So long way of saying, the growth opportunity is significant, it's multiyear, and it's not just the U.S."

I'm not going to go into the level of price increase we get from trended data. But the way to look at it is, the value derived on ROI basis from the mortgage underwriters from looking at data over multiple years versus a shot in time is significant. As a result, they're willing to pay more for trended data. The other point I alluded to in the -- in my prepared comments, Paul, was we're going to trend more than just the credit file and take our really unique data assets that no else has and sort of trending those. Think about the value of trending income data versus taking a snapshot in time so -- and then you take the utility data. So the trending -- I really mean essentially the trending of data, especially the unique data assets we have, I think, creates innovative products and solutions for years to come. As far as the mortgage market -- on Workforce Solutions, again, we don't disclose that level of detail. I'd leave it at this though. There's still significant room. And David Togut kind of alluded to this. As the database grows, the hit rate goes up. It benefits all verticals, including mortgage. But we still have penetration opportunities, not just on hit rate but by account in the mortgage arena in EWS, much like we do in auto, insurance, credit card, government and others for the Work Number."

In fact, I think it'll be at the lower end of that range in '16, to be very clear with you. And then as far as the multiyear model, I wouldn't have ratchet that up. I'd rather do that once I have success under our belt, and we see just how big this is going to be. So I think it's a little premature. But it's the right time once we see the success and the traction. As you know, it goes live in midyear and will be a lot smarter coming the end of the year.

EGI did not exist then. So just the ability to grind out organic growth that exist. And lastly, we have built some counter -- I mean 2 other points, countercyclical products that are bigger now, would do well. Think about unemployment claims as an example in EWS.

So yes, having access to a much larger sales organization with deeper, longer-standing relationships will help our debt management growth. But beyond that, one, we're getting a business that's got great organic growth opportunities. I alluded the fact there's inorganic opportunities. And then the others are bringing things like the Work Number to Australia, bringing Cambrian to Australia, bringing InterConnect to Australia, bringing our global fraud platform to Australia. It's hard -- you can't underestimate the relationship these guys have in Australia and New Zealand, and the market presence they have with all major verticals is significant. And they build out, much like Equifax has in Australia and New Zealand a very wide array of unique data assets. And if we can bring our know-how to bear there to build products, that is a great growth driver. And then as someone, I think it was Andrew, asked a second ago, eventually, one comprehensive as you referred to or positive data as many referred to it, when that becomes mainstream, guess what, we know how to manage positive data and build production on positive data really well. And that, in years to come, is another growth driver for us."

And one of the beauties, Andrew, of moving leaders around the different businesses is they have a different perspective than the predecessor. And Dann is looking at this business now saying kind of look at the bridge market differently. He's looking and saying, how do I combine some of the assets that we have from EWS, where he was for 5.5 years, into the global PSOL channel. So it's not just the large indirect resellers that give me hope for the long-term growth in PSOL, it's the 4 levers we talked about plus taking other data assets into PSOL."

Previously, direct-to-consumer resellers were reported within the USIS and International segments based on the country of the customer. We have provided the quarterly history for Personal Solutions, USIS and International, and the new format for each quarter in 2014 and 2015 in the Q&A section of our earnings release. All discussion of the 2015 business unit performance and their outlook for 2016 will be consistent with the new structure. 
Earlier this week, the Veda shareholders voted to accept Equifax's acquisition offer, and we also received subsequent approval from the court. Therefore, the 2016 guidance provided today as well as the updated long-term business model for Equifax, which is included in the Q&A section of our earnings release, both include the impact of the Veda acquisition. However, our guidance for the first quarter of 2016 will not include any impact from Veda, including the incremental cost of the debt. Given the short amount of time, Veda will be part of Equifax in the quarter. 
During this call, as in previous earnings releases, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin, which will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. In 2016, we will be emphasizing adjusted EBITDA margin in discussing our operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income adding back depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the acquisition and integration expenses from Veda, which are also reflected in our calculation of adjusted EPS. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables posted on our website. 
During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax in this business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and the subsequent filings. Please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick."
175749,322055847,932008,"Equifax Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks, as always, for joining us this morning.  Execution across all 4 of our business units continues to be very strong, and enabled us to deliver yet another strong quarter in the fourth quarter as well as the",3248,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks, as always, for joining us this morning.  Execution across all 4 of our business units continues to be very strong, and enabled us to deliver yet another strong quarter in the fourth quarter as well as the full year. For the quarter, fourth quarter 2015 total revenue was $666 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis from 2014. For the quarter, FX created $18 million of year-over-year headwind for us. The adjusted operating margin was 27.1%, up from 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 12% from $1.02 in 2014. And just to refresh your memory, that exceeded the upper end of our guidance range we provided on the last call, which is $1.10 to $1.12. Finally, given our strong performance in 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend up to now $0.33 a quarter, and this is, as you probably all know, the sixth consecutive double-digit increase in our dividend rate, reflecting the strong performance of the company. I think you'll agree on many dimensions. 2015 was an outstanding year for our 117-year-old business. We exceeded our expectations. We had broad-based contributions from each business unit, industry verticals, and across the vast majority of our geographies, our team delivered. We're well positioned for a strong 2016. We'll talk about the economic environment in the Q&A, and I'm proud of the team for their continued commitment to innovation, execution, outstanding customer service. 
For the full year, total revenue is $2.7 billion, up 9% on a reported basis, and up 12% on a local currency basis for 2014, and for the year, FX created a $76 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, up 90 basis points from 26.5% in 2014, and well above the targeted 25 basis points or so increase we have guided to in the past. Adjusted EPS was $4.15, up 16% from $3.89 a year ago, and just as a reminder, that performance in 2015 was all organically driven, as we had no acquisitions in the year. As I always do, I'll transition to the business units for some brief commentary before John gives you the details. I'll go through some highlights for the business as well, and then we'll get in to more specifics. 
I want to talk, first of all, Jeff mentioned in his opening comments, we repositioned PSOL in 2015. You know that this team has been working diligently on their new growth model, which I fully support. It's yielding benefits, and John will go through some of those numbers. At the same time, I made the decision that it was important that we have one team, one leader, one business that would manage all strategy, all product positioning in the geographies for our consumer business, regardless of that business going direct to the consumer or if it was going through a reseller. So we've made the decision to realign that under Dann Adams now, who leads our direct-to-consumer businesses globally. I think that just gives us more continuity going forward. 
Now onto the businesses themselves. USIS delivered an impressive 8% revenue growth for the year, while expanding its operating margins 290 basis points. Our insights-driven strategy, which we've talked about, has resonated extremely well with our largest clients in key our client program. Our KCP customers are purchasing multiple Decision 360 products and services, in aggregate, access almost 5 Equifax data products, which is remarkable. Across our top 100 clients, Decision 360 products and services are increasing as well, and there, they're accessing about 3 products on average. So D360 is really making a difference in the marketplace for us. 
In USIS, our Fraud and Identity Management Solutions business again delivered a healthy 22% growth for the year, largely driven by their ID authentication and management solution products. Our enterprise vertical strategy has made significant contributions to our total company revenue growth. With experienced industry executives in these verticals, we are better able to leverage our diverse data assets, analytic expertise in IT platforms to deliver premier Decision Solutions. USIS leads many of our enterprise vertical initiatives. To give you an example, a few of those in 2015, our mortgage vertical grew 25% in USIS and 29% for the total company. This again compares favorably to the average Mortgage Bankers Application index, which was up 17% for the year. So that trend of outperforming the mortgage market has continued now for many, many years. Next example is in the auto vertical, which USIS revenue grew 6% and total company grew 9%. This also compares very favorably with the overall market where verticals -- vehicles sales dropped approximately 5%. And more recently, our retail banking vertical grew USIS revenue 17%, and total company revenue by 18%. So you get a sense there that there's enterprise focus taking all over data assets and getting seasoned leaders in each vertical, delivering those unique assets to our customers, is enabling us to grow significantly, and in many cases, faster than the market itself. 
For years now, we've been working with Fannie Mae on ways to better leverage our information to further improve the underwriting process for mortgage loans. Late in 2015, Fannie Mae made the decision to incorporate trended data into the underwriting process for mortgage lending. We talked about this with you in the past. This initiative will be an important contributor to revenue in both 2016 and 2017. It also represents a significant structural change in the loan underwriting, as it sets the stage for applications outside the mortgage lending to increasingly use trended data and our world-class analytical talent and leverage our Cambrian platform, which we talked about before. We're well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities as they arise. Live testing is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2016, and go live midyear. More importantly, trended data will be available through our core credit online delivery system, making the information available for all solutions that access our credit database. 
Opportunities for USIS in 2016 and beyond are significant. Trended data, ID and Fraud, further penetration in our targeted vertical markets are all expected to make important contributions to sustained revenue growth. Our multi-year model for USIS remains, as we've communicated to you before, with top line growth in the 5% to 7% range. And adjusted EBITDA margin, which we'll now talk about going forward, is expected to be in the high 40s, expanding to the low-50s over time. International delivered 12% local currency revenue growth, with strong performance coming from our operations in Europe and Latin America. Revenue in international's 3 largest verticals: FIs, telcos and small, medium-sized enterprises, grew 13% in 2015. Our decision platforms, analytic solutions and debt management revenue grew 12% in 2015. Europe had an outstanding year, driven by largely by broad-based growth in our U.K. operations. By industry, FI, telco, SMEs all grew high to low double digits for the year. By offering Decision Solutions, Analytical Services and debt management all grew at double-digit rates in 2015. 
TDX has been working as you know, with U.K. government to manage their past-due consumer debt in fourth quarter 2015, and started receiving accounts at that time, and we started placing those accounts with the collection agencies, analyzing the data in the fourth quarter of last year, and while still early, the performance of the data is slightly ahead of our expectations. This opportunity, along with our ongoing sales efforts, is expected to be a significant strategic initiative, driving growth for International for years to come. International has historically delivered some of our strongest performance in New Product Innovation, which has been a significant contributor to incremental revenue growth, further market penetration, and obviously, customer loyalty because we're building new products and solutions that we couldn't build in the past. This broad-based effort towards innovation continues to fuel growth for International. For the year, our 6 geographies in International, represented almost 2/3 of the revenue, delivered an NPI Vitality Index of 10% or greater, which is fabulous. International has some exciting opportunities ahead of it, in addition to Veda, which I'll come back and talk later, which will become a part of the International operation. In 2016, we broadly expanded Cambrian, deploying it across the International geographies, substantially enhancing our ability to deliver analytical insights and drive growth. The continued excellent performance with new products and cost benefits and the regionalization efforts begun last year, as well as the addition to Veda, will expand EBITDA margins in 2016 and beyond. We have moderately raised our expectations for multi-year growth in international now to a range of 7% -- or 8% to 10%, with adjusted EBITDA margins in the low-30s, growing to mid-30s over time. Both those measures in top line and EBITDA margin reflect the anticipated close of Veda. 
On to Workforce Solutions. They grew 18% last year. It was an outstanding performance, as was their 510 basis point margin expansion for the year. Core product growth, along with a number of new product initiatives, all contributed to this outstanding performance. Verification Service is strong and broad-based growth of 25% in the year continues to be driven by adding records to the Work Number database. As our coverage of individual employment records increases the value of our services enables us to further penetrate our key target verticals, including mortgage, auto, consumer finance, government and preemployment. In all those verticals, every one of them, was up a very strong double digit for the year, just amazingly strong, balanced growth. At year-end, the Work Number database reached almost 280 million records, as we stated before. We're well on our way to achieving 300 million records in total. The recent emergence of what they call the instant mortgage facilitated through online application process has generated new growth opportunities for automated income and employment verification. We recently signed one of the largest players in the space because of our unique ability to deliver both the credit information, as well as the employment and income verification simultaneously by speeding up the process and enhancing the consumer experience. 
Within EWS, the Employer Services business also had another very strong year in 2015, growing 8%. Much of this growth was driven by our Workforce Analytics offering, which we've talked to you about before. This allows employers to ensure that they are compliant with the Affordable Care Act, as well as providing ACA-required tax information to employees. Workforce Analytics doubled their business in 2015, and is expected to more than double again in 2016. Our Workforce Analytics client base now is approaching over 800 clients. Our pipeline remains very strong. To date, our solution has largely been focused on our larger enterprise customers. In 2015 we're starting to go down market, enabling us to capture relationships with smaller employees, which we can offer cross-sell opportunities with our other Employer Services offerings. Health care-related revenue, generated by both our income verification and the Affordable Care Act compliance solutions, more than doubled in 2015 versus 2014. And workforce solutions has delivered a stellar performance, not just in 2015, but over the last 9 years. As a business, they were quick to adopt our approach to innovate and to embrace Lean. As a result, they've outperformed on revenue growth and substantially improved their margin. Looking forward, expanding and further penetrating their key markets and verticals, increasing their number of records in the Work Number database and globalizing their footprint will continue to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. Our multi-year expectation for Workforce Solutions has been increased. Now expecting revenue growth of 9% to 11%, with adjusted EBITDA margin in the high-40% range, expanding to low-50s over time. 
Personal Solutions finalized its strategic transformation, and is executing well against its 4-pronged strategy. For the year, the newly constructed global Personal Solutions delivered 19% local currency growth -- revenue growth, and is well-positioned for 2016 and beyond. Revenue growth from our direct and indirect consumer activities continues to meet our expectations. Revenue growth in our Personal Solutions business in Canada and U.K. was up a nice 7% in 2015. In the U.S., we continue to perform consistent with our expectations, with increasing ARPU and lowering subscriber churn. Our direct-to-consumer resellers were the most significant contributor to Personal Solutions in 2015. We've talked about that one. That was a part of USIS. Our reseller revenues in both Canada and the U.K. grew solid as well, a solid double digit, in fact, in 2015. And the reseller revenue -- the reseller revenue in U.S. was very strong, primarily driven by the 2-year contract with a leading company in the space, Credit Karma. We've talked to you about that. We're also well-positioned for continued growth in 2016. You may have seen the addition of a new reseller, LifeLock. We signed a multiyear contract a few months back. 
With our broad-based portfolio of data assets, we believe there'll be additional opportunities in 2016 and beyond to provide a broader array of credit, income and fraud services to consumers through our direct and reseller channel. Under the new organizational structure, our multi-year expectations for revenue growth in PSOL is now 5% to 8%, up from the previous target of 4% to 6%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the low-30s, expanding to the mid-30s over time. The outsized growth in 2015 was primarily driven by the start-up of our relationship with Credit Karma, the largest of our DTC, direct-to-consumer, resellers. In 2016, we'll anniversary this revenue, so long-term growth rates for PSOL will revert back to more normal levels again of 5% to 8%, with good strong growth going forward. 
Now on to some corporate highlights before I turn the mic over to John to give you more details on the financials. Today, we are truly global company with a global set of processes deployed around the world, a global structure, a global culture and a group that's all focused on the core set of global strategic imperatives. Over the years, we've globalized our most critical and fundamental management disciplines to facilitate greater linkage between our strategy and our execution. And through this effort, we have streamlined our product innovation and placement. We've enabled greater leverage of our IT platforms. We've optimized the investment in our talent. We've more effectively moved our talent and products where the greatest opportunities exist. This globalization also enables us to better and more quickly leverage the skills and expertise developed in one market, i.e. in USIS, into another market, International. Again, that's both processes, products and people. Everybody in the company is measured and evaluated in what they contribute to our imperatives, regardless of what part of the organization they reside. 
Having reinvigorated our NPI, New Product Innovation, what we talked to you about last year of our 2.0 and the next phase of innovation, we launched 64 new products last year. Along with the pipeline of 2016 launches, we expect the revenue contributions to deliver strong NPI growth in 2016 and beyond. Our largest and most diverse growth opportunities are executed under our enterprise growth initiatives we call EGI. In 2015, year-over-year revenue growth from these large initiatives was over 20%, and so a 20% growth over 2014. In 2015, we exceeded our expectations for NPI revenues by 6%. Furthermore, I've discussed with you in the past, the class of products we launched in 2015 under our revitalized effort of 2.0 are expected to deliver a record level of revenue, year 3 revenue when compared to prior year launches. It is the healthiest class of products that we've launched since NPI has been in existence here. One of the more exciting new product opportunities revolves around trended data. The effort and investment we're making to fulfill our commitment to Fannie Mae will be leveraged across all of our unique data assets. We firmly believe that the next horizon for information-based solution is trended data, which will underpin more powerful Decisioning Solutions for our customers and significantly improve our competitive position. So to be clear, our focus is trending as many of our unique data assets, which are truly unique, only to Equifax or our customers to provide these values, so things like the Work Number and C+ [ph] and others. 
Finally, as with many of our corporate management doctrines, our global NPI process will be implemented in Veda once we complete the acquisition, and I'll get to Veda in a moment. In 2015, we launched our Big Data platform called Cambrian. Cambrian will enable faster development and delivery of analytic insights, including improving the speed at which we develop new products. It will also greatly enhance our Decision 360 capabilities, and provide significant competitive advantage using advanced analytic techniques. Now the corporate impairment for us has been about Lean. Lean continues to make incremental contributions to our expense leverage, and exceeded our goal by contributing over 30% greater benefit in 2015 than we had budgeted. And we've leveraged our expertise in Lean principles to deepen our relationships with some of our largest customers through projects that help them streamline many of their operational activities, and that obviously provides a competitive differentiator boost in the marketplace. 
Let me close before I give it to John and talk a little bit about Veda. I'm sure many of you are aware that the regulatory approval of Veda received in December enabled them to schedule a shareholder meeting, which Jeff alluded to a little bit ago. They had a shareholder meeting on February 8 and gained approval there, and they've also received a the final court approval this week, and at this point, it's our expectation to close the acquisition at the -- towards the end of February of this year. We're very excited about this opportunity, represent for us the great strategy, strong financial performance, outstanding management team, great market position, and they also give us a significant opportunity in the Asia Pacific geography of further broadening and enhancing our geographic footprint, which is important to us, as we diversify revenue stream. As we move into our first quarter earnings call and beyond, obviously, we'll keep you apprized of the strategic and the financial progress that the team is making with his new asset. 
In closing, our performance in 2015 exemplifies the culture and the strength of our management team and our dedication in the entire organization to innovate and execute for our customers. It's a culture and a process that has taken years to develop, and it underpins the confidence we have in our ability to continue delivering on our commitments and to make our customers and shareholders satisfied with that performance. Our strategic imperatives, as we enter 2016, are in a few areas that are very important to us. We cascade these around the world. One, obviously, is deliver strong and consistent profitable growth and shareholder returns; two, to develop unparalleled analytical insights, leveraging the unique data assets that Equifax has; three is to innovate for market leadership in the key domains and verticals in which we operate; four, is to serve as a trusted steward and advocate for customers and consumers around the world; and obviously, in closing, the last, to invest in talent to drive that strategy and foster a culture of innovation. 
So with that, John, as you always do, please go through the financials."

As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentione",1968,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentioned at the opening, all BU information is based on the new segments with direct-to-consumer resellers moved to PSOL from USIS and International. Going forward, given the substantial amortization expense related to the Veda acquisition, we will increase our discussion of EBITDA for Equifax and the operating segments. 
U.S. Information Solutions revenue in 4Q '15 was $296 million, up 7% when compared to the fourth quarter of '14. For the full year, revenue of $1.2 billion was up 8%. This compares favorably to our long-term expectation for USIS of 5% to 7% growth as both the mortgage and automotive were very strong in 2015. 
Online Information Solutions revenue was $204 million in 4Q '15, up 6% year-to-year and $842 million for the full year, up 8% when compared with the prior year. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $28 million in 4Q '15, up 10% year-to-year, and $124 million for calendar year '15, up 17%. Total mortgage-related revenue was up 16% and 17% in the quarter for USIS and Equifax, respectively. For calendar year '15, mortgage-related revenue was up 25% and 29% for USIS and Equifax, respectively. This compares favorably to the average Mortgage Bankers Application index, which was up 14% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the calendar year. 
Financial Marketing Services revenue was $64 million in 4Q '15, up 7% year-to-year and up $205 million for calendar year '15, up 5% year-to-year. The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 41.6% in 4Q '15 and 41.9% for calendar year '15, up 50 basis points and 290 basis points, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.5% in 4Q '15 and 49.7% in calendar year '15. We expect to see continued expansion in the USIS EBITDA margins in 2016. 
International's revenue was $143 million in 4Q '15, down 1% on a reported basis, but up 11% on a local currency basis. Revenue was $569 million for calendar year '15, down 1% on a reported basis, but up 12% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $64 million in 4Q '15, up 3% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in local currency. For calendar year '15, Europe revenue was $247 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 12% on local currency. Latin America's revenue was $49 million in 4Q '15, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Revenue was $200 million for calendar year '15, up 4% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. Latin America showed outstanding local currency growth throughout '15, led by strong growth across Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Canada revenue was $29 million, down 11% in U.S. dollars, but up 5% in local currency. Revenue for calendar year '15 was $122 million in U.S. dollars, down 11% in U.S. dollars but up 3% in local currency. Canada's performance strengthened very nicely in the second half, and has momentum going into 2016. 
International's operating margin was 20.7% in 4Q '15 and 20% in calendar year '15. EBITDA margins were 27.2% in 4Q '15, and 27% in calendar year '15. Both operating and EBITDA margins were down year-to-year in International. However, both showed sequential improvement in the fourth quarter relative to the third. In 2016, we expect to see continued margin improvement, driven by continued strong local currency growth and the benefits of regionalization as well as from the addition of Veda. We will see some margin pressure related to weakened foreign currencies, particularly with the Canadian dollar and the devaluation of the Argentinean peso. 
Workforce Solutions revenue was $144 million in the quarter, up 12% year-to-year, and $578 million in calendar year '15, up 18% year-to-year. This reflects continued very strong growth in Verification Services, up 14% in fourth quarter and 25% year-to-year. Employer Services also delivered a very strong performance, up 8% in the fourth quarter and 8% in the calendar year. This was driven by success in their Compliance Center offerings and their solution for employers' compliance with are the requirements of the ACA. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 36.8% in 4Q '15 and 37.9% in calendar year '15, up 430 and 510 basis points, respectively. Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins were 44.3% in the fourth quarter, and 45.1% in the calendar year. We expect continued strong expansion of Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins in 2016. 
Global Personal Solutions revenue was $84 million in 4Q '15, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis. Revenue in calendar year '15 was $346 million, up 18% on a reported basis and up 19% on a local currency basis. PSOL's business has 2 main areas: credit and identity monitoring services sold through direct and indirect channels that protect and monitor consumers' ID and enable consumers to gain better access to credit, and credit and other data sales sold through our DTC reseller partners. Credit and identity monitoring services sold through the indirect channel represent those circumstances where Equifax provides white level [ph] online credit and identity services through partners. In 2015, ongoing revenue from credit and identity monitoring services grew at the high end of the 4% to 6% guidance range we have previously provided for the PSOL segment prior to the addition of DTC sellers. DTC reseller's revenue represent sales of credit and other data to resellers. In these cases, Equifax provides data and analytics, but not the web properties with which the customer directly interacts. Examples of this business are relationships with Credit Karma and LifeLock. DTC reseller revenue showed substantial growth in 2015, driven primarily by our relationship with Credit Karma, which began in 4Q '14. Our DTC reseller revenue should continue to grow faster than our direct-to-consumer sales, but as Rick mentioned, not at the very high rate you saw in 2015. 
Looking forward, as previously mentioned, we expect this overall segment to grow 5% to 8%. Operating margin was 27% in 4Q '15 and 27.5% for calendar year '15, consistent with our expectations. EBITDA margins were 29.7% in 4Q '15 and 30.2% in calendar year '15. PSOL revenue and operating margin in 4Q '14 were very strong, reflecting a large reach deal won in 4Q '14. 4Q '15 operating margin of 27% was consistent with our expectations and our guidance, and reflects the impact of our decision to invest more in marketing in 2015, as well as the addition of DTC reseller business to PSOL. 
In the fourth quarter, general corporate expense was $51 million, excluding $3.7 million for onetime expenses associated with the Veda acquisition. General corporate expense was up slightly from 3Q, consistent with our guidance. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect general corporate expense, excluding Veda-related acquisition and integration expenses, to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million and run at a slightly lower rate throughout the remaining quarters of the year. The adjusted operating margin at 27.1% in 4Q '15 and 27.4% in calendar year '15 were up 60 and 90 basis points year-to-year, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.4% in 4Q '15 and 34.8% in calendar year '15. We expect to see improvements in our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2016, expanding by about 75 basis points. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.6%, equal to our expectation and in our guidance. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate, after adjusting for non-GAAP items, the Missouri state tax law change in the second quarter and TDX escrow adjustment in third quarter, was 33.7% consistent with our comments during our third quarter release. Looking forward into 2016, our expectation is for a GAAP effective tax rate of about 33%. 
Operating cash flow was $205 million in 4Q '15 and $742 million in calendar year '15. Both were very strong, reflecting strong earnings and working capital performance. Free cash flow, equal to operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was very strong in 2015 at $596 million, up 12% from 2014. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $53 million and for calendar year '15 were $146 million. Consistent with our comments throughout the year, the increase in capital spending versus 2014 reflects the acceleration of our investment in New Product Innovation, deployment of global platforms, including Cambrian and other analytics, InterConnect, Fraud, and our new PSOL infrastructure. As we look forward to 2016, we expect capital spending, including Veda, to be in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This is consistent with 2015 and reflects a continuation of our current investments as well as some additional spending in the near term as we integrate Veda. This is slightly higher than our expected long-term rate of capital spending of about 5% of revenue due to the Veda integration.
As Rick indicated, we have received Veda shareholder approval and approval from the Australian courts to complete the purchase of Veda. We expect the acquisition to close on about February 25. Total purchase price, including assumed debt and fees, is approximately USD 1.9 billion. At the close of the Veda transaction, we will have debt outstanding of just under $3.1 billion, and debt to EBITDA on a trailing basis of just under 3x. As indicated previously, we expect to maintain our current credit ratings. In 2016, we will focus on using our very strong cash flow for debt reduction and returning our leverage to a level consistent with our current credit rating. Therefore, we do not intend to repurchase shares in 2016. We will, however, continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016 with a goal of delivering on our long-term model of an additional 1 to 2 points of revenue growth. Assuming acquisitions consistent with our targets in 2016 and 2017, we would expect to repurchase shares in 2017. 
As we discussed last quarter, we will exclude Veda transactions and other acquisition expenses and integration expenses incurred in the first year after the Veda acquisition through 1Q '17, in calculating adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin and EBITDA margin. We will provide information regarding transaction and acquisition expenses incurred with the acquisition, as well as integration expenses we expect to incur related to the Veda acquisition after the transaction closes at our 1Q '16 earnings release conference call. Also, Jeff mentioned at the beginning of the call, given the relatively short time we will own Veda in the quarter, our 1Q '16 guidance does not include the impact of Veda nor the incremental debt cost, including interest expense related to the acquisition. We will provide you details on the impact of Veda on 1Q '16 during our 1Q '16 earnings call in April. 
The 2016 full year guidance Rick will provide includes Veda. For 2016, we have assumed Veda will be a part of Equifax for 10 months. Veda revenue for 10 months is assumed to be USD 220 million to USD 230 million. This include an estimate of the impact to revenue of U.S. GAAP, which will be updated as we close 1Q '16. The benefit to adjusted EPS from Veda net of acquisition financing cost is about $0.10 to $0.15 per share. As a reminder, adjusted EPS excludes acquisition amortization expense. For modeling purposes, you can assume an average cost of our Veda acquisition debt during 2016 of about 2.5%. Veda's seasonality of revenues is similar to Equifax, with 2Q revenue typically the highest from a seasonality perspective, 1Q generally the lowest revenue, and 3Q and 4Q somewhat similar in terms of revenue. The spread between 2Q and 1Q revenue has recently been in the range of 7% to 10%. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."
175749,322055847,932008,"Equifax Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Some summary comments before we go to the Q&A. As I've mentioned before to all of you and many of you noted in our conversations and in the write ups, the level of execution and the momentum this team has generated in 2015 is the best in my",718,"Thanks, John. Some summary comments before we go to the Q&A. As I've mentioned before to all of you and many of you noted in our conversations and in the write ups, the level of execution and the momentum this team has generated in 2015 is the best in my 10 years here. I think it's truly remarkable what they've done. We are well positioned for growth opportunities that lie ahead and our ability to take care -- to take on any of the challenges that may confront us. In the coming years, the incremental revenue that would be contributing from class of new products that we just launched, we expect it to exceed our historical average. That's the wind in our back. Our enterprise growth initiatives, including the expanded insights, driven by Cambrian, healthcare, trended data and auto, will not only enhance our competitive position but also deliver growth opportunities for years to come. All of these efforts are expected, in our opinion, to offset the anticipated slowdown of U.S. mortgage market, which, as you know, started to decelerate over the course of 2015. While it's impossible to predict where the mortgage market is going to go, especially when I look this morning at 10-year Treasury is under 1.6, forecast range from down 20% to up mid-single digits. Our forecast that we're giving you for 2016 is anticipating that the mortgage market will be down single digits in 2016. And obviously, our expectation of the team in both Workforce Solutions and USIS, as they have done for many, many years, outperforms that quite significantly. Obviously, if rates continue to stay low as they are, there may be some market upside to what occurs in the mortgage market, and we'll all know obviously when we head deeper into the year. 
2016 is yet again expected to be another strong year performance for the company. For the year, we expect revenue, including the impact of Veda, to be between $3 billion and $3.1 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of the 15% to 19%. That's going to be partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in October that the organic constant currency growth would be at the high end of our long-term range of 6% to 8%. I got to say it again, that's at the high end of our range coming off constant currency growth last year of 12%. So it's, I think, quite remarkable. As John mentioned, we also expect to add another 1 to 2 points of tuck-in acquisitions throughout the year. These additional acquisitions are obviously beyond Veda, which as he said, is not included in our 2000 -- I'm sorry, in the first quarter of 2016 outlook. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $4.95 and $5.05, which is up 10% to 12% for the year, excluding approximately $0.13 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 13% to 15%. For the first quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $685 million and $695 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%. That will be partially offset by about 3 points of FX headwind in the quarter. First quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.14 and $1.16, which is up 7% to 8%, excluding $0.04 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 12% for the first quarter. Again, we expect to close Veda in the first quarter, but we'll not include that in the estimate. Maybe during the Q&A, we'll talk about why it's not in the first quarter for that 1 month. In 2016, we'll also going to shift our focus to adjusted EBITDA margin. You've heard us talk about that throughout the call, since it better represents the true operating performance of the company. 2016, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by a solid 75 basis points over last year's 34.8% EBITDA margin. In our modified multiyear business model, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the upper 30% to 40% range, with annual acceleration of at least 25 basis points. 
So with that, operator, if you'd open up for questions for audience, that would be great."

And we are not seeing a slowdown in our markets. Maybe an exception here or there, but nothing material, David, that gives me concern that the forecast we just gave you for guidance is not very attainable. We're just not seeing that strong correlation. So at this juncture, in our major markets around the world, the consumers continue to be healthy.

But I did guide at the very end about 75 basis -- we're talking EBITDA now, David, 75 basis points of margin expansion at the corporate level 2016 over 2015. What you're going to see there is continued margin expansion in businesses that have been expanding now for quite some time. That's EWS, as you alluded to, and USIS. That trend will continue. Number two, we intentionally made investments in PSOL in 2015 to position them for better growth in 2016 and beyond. That's kind of behind us now. So you'll start to see margin expansion in PSOL, from the levels you saw in 2015. We also invested in 2 main areas in International that are behind us now. One was, as you're very well aware, standing up of the U.K. government contract, which was a year-long, heavy investment. And now, the revenue starts to come because it was virtually no revenue in 2015. Secondly, we talked about kind of regionalization of platforms and people and processes that give us a long term, more cost-efficient International model. Those investments were largely made in 2015. Those have now been anniversaried. So you'll start to see International and PSOL margins expanding this year. And obviously, International, I think I alluded to it, will be -- also, their margins will be enhanced with the addition of a very high-margin, successful business in Veda. Beyond that, do you have any other trends you want to point out?"

But we are such -- we're so lightly penetrated in many of the high-growth markets. There's years of growth to go on the verification side in the U.S. alone. And you add to that, which is not the heart of your question, growth from the analytics platform that we've built on the employer side. And I gave a little comment, which I didn't expand upon, but I will now, in my prepared comments, David. The appetite for customers and geographies around the world for us to take this platform of the Work Number to their geographies is stronger now than it's ever been. And we have got a team working full speed on a couple of main geographies around the world. And so I'm not going to get in a lot of detail on where.

I'm not going to go into the level of pricing increase we get from trended data. But the way to look at it is, the value derived on ROI basis from the mortgage underwriters from looking at data over multiple years versus a shot in time is significant. As a result, they're willing to pay more for trended data. The other point I alluded to in the -- in my prepared comments, Paul, was we're going to trend more than just the credit file and take our really unique data assets that no else has and start trending those. Think about the value of trending income data versus taking a snapshot in time so -- and then you take the utility data. So the trending -- I really mean this sincerely -- the trending of data, especially the unique data assets we have, I think, creates innovative products and solutions for years to come. As far as the mortgage market -- on Workforce Solutions, again, we don't disclose that level of detail. I'd leave it at this though. There's still significant room. And David Togut kind of alluded to this. As the database grows, the hit rate goes up. It benefits all verticals, including mortgage. But we still have penetration opportunities, not just on hit rate but by account in the mortgage arena in EWS, much like we do in auto, insurance, credit card, government and others for the Work Number."

In fact, I think it'll be at the lower end of that range in '16, to be very clear with you. And then as far as the multiyear model, why wouldn't I ratchet that up? I'd rather do that once I have success under our belt, and we see just how big this is going to be. So I think it's a little premature. But at the right time once we see the success and the traction.

If it does occur, I look today versus how we're positioned as a company 2007 has been dramatically different, Lean as an example. And our ability to operate global platforms and take global processes and improve them, take cost out and act and react to recessionary environment is far greater today than it was then. And we are in our infancy stage of understanding globalizing the platform, globalizing the process and deploying Lean around the world. So we could react much faster, if we had to, in that environment. Two, just the overall pipeline of products we have is much stronger now. We're in the early days of NPI back then. EGI did not exist then. So just the ability to grind out organic growth didn't exist. And lastly, we have built some counter -- I'll make 2 other points -- countercyclical products that are bigger now, would do well. Think about unemployment claims as an example in EWS. That would do well in a recessionary environment. And we're more global today, especially with the addition of Veda and their platform. If the entire globe hits with recession, that doesn't really help you. But if it's isolated to a few of the developed markets, that fact that we're a bigger global enterprise may help us as well."

So time to revenue will be faster with Cambrian. Obviously, I mean, small tuck-in acquisitions that we're so good at, and hopefully, we continue to be really good at. So we know how to do it. That will be a vehicle for profitable growth going forward. So the cool thing is, and I think you'll agree is, it's not just 1, 2 or 3 things we're counting on for growth.

One is for 2016, unless there is an implosion that no one has ever contemplated in China, they've diversified their markets, their economy as such that, in fact, the consensus even today is a stronger GDP in Australia than 2015. The second thought I have is, if they're going to have recession eventually, you can't defy odds. I think they're the second-longest running economy in the history of modern time in the world. The time they had their last recession, they're going to have one eventually. But third, we're making investment like this, we don't make an investment for a quarter, for a year, for 2-year period of time. This is a part of the world that we want to be in. We have great partner down there now with Veda. They give us a lens into so many more geographies down there, beyond just Australia, New Zealand.

Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section of the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we realigned the reporting structure of our direct-to-consumer reseller business, so that it now reports into our Personal Solutions business. Previously, direct-to-consumer resellers were reported within the USIS and International segments based on the country of the customer. We have provided the quarterly history for Personal Solutions, USIS and International, and the new format for each quarter in 2014 and 2015 in the Q&A section of our earnings release. All discussion of the 2015 business unit performance and their outlook for 2016 will be consistent with the new structure. 
Earlier this week, the Veda shareholders voted to accept Equifax's acquisition offer, and we also received subsequent approval from the court. Therefore, the 2016 guidance provided today as well as the updated long-term business model for Equifax, which is included in the Q&A section of our earnings release, both include the impact of the Veda acquisition. However, our guidance for the first quarter of 2016 will not include any impact from Veda, including the incremental cost of the debt. Given the short amount of time, Veda will be part of Equifax in the quarter. 
During this call, as in previous earnings releases, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin, which will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. In 2016, we will be emphasizing adjusted EBITDA margin in discussing our operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income adding back depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the acquisition and integration expenses from Veda, which are also reflected in our calculation of adjusted EPS. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables posted on our website. 
During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax in this business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and the subsequent filings. Please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick."

Execution across all 4 of our business units continues to be very strong, and enabled us to deliver yet another strong quarter in the fourth quarter as well as the",3248,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks, as always, for joining us this morning.  Execution across all 4 of our business units continues to be very strong, and enabled us to deliver yet another strong quarter in the fourth quarter as well as the full year. For the quarter, fourth quarter 2015 total revenue was $666 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis from 2014. For the quarter, FX created $18 million of year-over-year headwind for us. The adjusted operating margin was 27.1%, up from 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 12% from $1.02 in 2014. And just to refresh your memory, that exceeded the upper end of our guidance range we provided on the last call, which is $1.10 to $1.12. Finally, given our strong performance in 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend up to now $0.33 a quarter, and this is, as you probably all know, the sixth consecutive double-digit increase in our dividend rate, reflecting the strong performance of the company. I think you'll agree on many dimensions. 2015 was an outstanding year for our 117-year-old business. We exceeded our expectations. We had broad-based contributions from each business unit, industry verticals, and across the vast majority of our geographies, our team delivered. We're well positioned for a strong 2016. We'll talk about the economic environment in the Q&A, and I'm proud of the team for their continued commitment to innovation, execution, outstanding customer service. 
For the full year, total revenue is $2.7 billion, up 9% on a reported basis, and up 12% on a local currency basis for 2014, and for the year, FX created a $76 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, up 90 basis points from 26.5% in 2014, and well above the targeted 25 basis points or so increase we have guided to in the past. Adjusted EPS was $4.15, up 16% from $3.89 a year ago, and just as a reminder, that performance in 2015 was all organically driven, as we had no acquisitions in the year. As I always do, I'll transition to the business units for some brief commentary before John gives you the details. I'll go through some highlights for the business as well, and then we'll get in to more specifics. 
I want to talk, first of all, Jeff mentioned in his opening comments, we repositioned PSOL in 2015. You know that this team has been working diligently on their new growth model, which I fully support. It's yielding benefits, and John will go through some of those numbers. At the same time, I made the decision that it was important that we have one team, one leader, one business that would manage all strategy, all product positioning in the geographies for our consumer business, regardless of that business going direct to the consumer or if it was going through a reseller. So we've made the decision to realign that under Dann Adams now, who leads our direct-to-consumer businesses globally. I think that just gives us more continuity going forward. 
Now onto the businesses themselves. USIS delivered an impressive 8% revenue growth for the year, while expanding its operating margins 290 basis points. Our insights-driven strategy, which we've talked about, has resonated extremely well with our largest clients in key our client program. Our KCP customers are purchasing multiple Decision 360 products and services, in aggregate, access almost 5 Equifax data products, which is remarkable. Across our top 100 clients, Decision 360 products and services are increasing as well, and there, they're accessing about 3 products on average. So D360 is really making a difference in the marketplace for us. 
In USIS, our Fraud and Identity Management Solutions business again delivered a healthy 22% growth for the year, largely driven by their ID authentication and management solution products. Our enterprise vertical strategy has made significant contributions to our total company revenue growth. With experienced industry executives in these verticals, we are better able to leverage our diverse data assets, analytic expertise in IT platforms to deliver premier Decision Solutions. USIS leads many of our enterprise vertical initiatives. To give you an example, a few of those in 2015, our mortgage vertical grew 25% in USIS and 29% for the total company. This again compares favorably to the average Mortgage Bankers Application index, which was up 17% for the year. So that trend of outperforming the mortgage market has continued now for many, many years. Next example is in the auto vertical, which USIS revenue grew 6% and total company grew 9%. This also compares very favorably with the overall market where verticals -- vehicles sales dropped approximately 5%. And more recently, our retail banking vertical grew USIS revenue 17%, and total company revenue by 18%. So you get a sense there that there's enterprise focus taking all over data assets and getting seasoned leaders in each vertical, delivering those unique assets to our customers, is enabling us to grow significantly, and in many cases, faster than the market itself. 
For years now, we've been working with Fannie Mae on ways to better leverage our information to further improve the underwriting process for mortgage loans. Late in 2015, Fannie Mae made the decision to incorporate trended data into the underwriting process for mortgage lending. We talked about this with you in the past. This initiative will be an important contributor to revenue in both 2016 and 2017. It also represents a significant structural change in the loan underwriting, as it sets the stage for applications outside the mortgage lending to increasingly use trended data and our world-class analytical talent and leverage our Cambrian platform, which we talked about before. We're well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities as they arise. Live testing is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2016, and go live midyear. More importantly, trended data will be available through our core credit online delivery system, making the information available for all solutions that access our credit database. 
Opportunities for USIS in 2016 and beyond are significant. Trended data, ID and Fraud, further penetration in our targeted vertical markets are all expected to make important contributions to sustained revenue growth. Our multi-year model for USIS remains, as we've communicated to you before, with top line growth in the 5% to 7% range. And adjusted EBITDA margin, which we'll now talk about going forward, is expected to be in the high 40s, expanding to the low-50s over time. International delivered 12% local currency revenue growth, with strong performance coming from our operations in Europe and Latin America. Revenue in international's 3 largest verticals: FIs, telcos and small, medium-sized enterprises, grew 13% in 2015. Our decision platforms, analytic solutions and debt management revenue grew 12% in 2015. Europe had an outstanding year, driven by largely by broad-based growth in our U.K. operations. By industry, FI, telco, SMEs all grew high to low double digits for the year. By offering Decision Solutions, Analytical Services and debt management all grew at double-digit rates in 2015. 
TDX has been working as you know, with U.K. government to manage their past-due consumer debt in fourth quarter 2015, and started receiving accounts at that time, and we started placing those accounts with the collection agencies, analyzing the data in the fourth quarter of last year, and while still early, the performance of the data is slightly ahead of our expectations. This opportunity, along with our ongoing sales efforts, is expected to be a significant strategic initiative, driving growth for International for years to come. International has historically delivered some of our strongest performance in New Product Innovation, which has been a significant contributor to incremental revenue growth, further market penetration, and obviously, customer loyalty because we're building new products and solutions that we couldn't build in the past. This broad-based effort towards innovation continues to fuel growth for International. For the year, our 6 geographies in International, represented almost 2/3 of the revenue, delivered an NPI Vitality Index of 10% or greater, which is fabulous. International has some exciting opportunities ahead of it, in addition to Veda, which I'll come back and talk later, which will become a part of the International operation. In 2016, we broadly expanded Cambrian, deploying it across the International geographies, substantially enhancing our ability to deliver analytical insights and drive growth. The continued excellent performance with new products and cost benefits and the regionalization efforts begun last year, as well as the addition to Veda, will expand EBITDA margins in 2016 and beyond. We have moderately raised our expectations for multi-year growth in international now to a range of 7% -- or 8% to 10%, with adjusted EBITDA margins in the low-30s, growing to mid-30s over time. Both those measures in top line and EBITDA margin reflect the anticipated close of Veda. 
On to Workforce Solutions. They grew 18% last year. It was an outstanding performance, as was their 510 basis point margin expansion for the year. Core product growth, along with a number of new product initiatives, all contributed to this outstanding performance. Verification Service is strong and broad-based growth of 25% in the year continues to be driven by adding records to the Work Number database. As our coverage of individual employment records increases the value of our services enables us to further penetrate our key target verticals, including mortgage, auto, consumer finance, government and preemployment. In all those verticals, every one of them, was up a very strong double digit for the year, just amazingly strong, balanced growth. At year-end, the Work Number database reached almost 280 million records, as we stated before. We're well on our way to achieving 300 million records in total. The recent emergence of what they call the instant mortgage facilitated through online application process has generated new growth opportunities for automated income and employment verification. We recently signed one of the largest players in the space because of our unique ability to deliver both the credit information, as well as the employment and income verification simultaneously by speeding up the process and enhancing the consumer experience. 
Within EWS, the Employer Services business also had another very strong year in 2015, growing 8%. Much of this growth was driven by our Workforce Analytics offering, which we've talked to you about before. This allows employers to ensure that they are compliant with the Affordable Care Act, as well as providing ACA-required tax information to employees. Workforce Analytics doubled their business in 2015, and is expected to more than double again in 2016. Our Workforce Analytics client base now is approaching over 800 clients. Our pipeline remains very strong. To date, our solution has largely been focused on our larger enterprise customers. In 2015 we're starting to go down market, enabling us to capture relationships with smaller employees, which we can offer cross-sell opportunities with our other Employer Services offerings. Health care-related revenue, generated by both our income verification and the Affordable Care Act compliance solutions, more than doubled in 2015 versus 2014. And workforce solutions has delivered a stellar performance, not just in 2015, but over the last 9 years. As a business, they were quick to adopt our approach to innovate and to embrace Lean. As a result, they've outperformed on revenue growth and substantially improved their margin. Looking forward, expanding and further penetrating their key markets and verticals, increasing their number of records in the Work Number database and globalizing their footprint will continue to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. Our multi-year expectation for Workforce Solutions has been increased. Now expecting revenue growth of 9% to 11%, with adjusted EBITDA margin in the high-40% range, expanding to low-50s over time. 
Personal Solutions finalized its strategic transformation, and is executing well against its 4-pronged strategy. For the year, the newly constructed global Personal Solutions delivered 19% local currency growth -- revenue growth, and is well-positioned for 2016 and beyond. Revenue growth from our direct and indirect consumer activities continues to meet our expectations. Revenue growth in our Personal Solutions business in Canada and U.K. was up a nice 7% in 2015. In the U.S., we continue to perform consistent with our expectations, with increasing ARPU and lowering subscriber churn. Our direct-to-consumer resellers were the most significant contributor to Personal Solutions in 2015. We've talked about that one. That was a part of USIS. Our reseller revenues in both Canada and the U.K. grew solid as well, a solid double digit, in fact, in 2015. And the reseller revenue -- the reseller revenue in U.S. was very strong, primarily driven by the 2-year contract with a leading company in the space, Credit Karma. We've talked to you about that. We're also well-positioned for continued growth in 2016. You may have seen the addition of a new reseller, LifeLock. We signed a multiyear contract a few months back. 
With our broad-based portfolio of data assets, we believe there'll be additional opportunities in 2016 and beyond to provide a broader array of credit, income and fraud services to consumers through our direct and reseller channel. Under the new organizational structure, our multi-year expectations for revenue growth in PSOL is now 5% to 8%, up from the previous target of 4% to 6%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the low-30s, expanding to the mid-30s over time. The outsized growth in 2015 was primarily driven by the start-up of our relationship with Credit Karma, the largest of our DTC, direct-to-consumer, resellers. In 2016, we'll anniversary this revenue, so long-term growth rates for PSOL will revert back to more normal levels again of 5% to 8%, with good strong growth going forward. 
Now on to some corporate highlights before I turn the mic over to John to give you more details on the financials. Today, we are truly global company with a global set of processes deployed around the world, a global structure, a global culture and a group that's all focused on the core set of global strategic imperatives. Over the years, we've globalized our most critical and fundamental management disciplines to facilitate greater linkage between our strategy and our execution. And through this effort, we have streamlined our product innovation and placement. We've enabled greater leverage of our IT platforms. We've optimized the investment in our talent. We've more effectively moved our talent and products where the greatest opportunities exist. This globalization also enables us to better and more quickly leverage the skills and expertise developed in one market, i.e. in USIS, into another market, International. Again, that's both processes, products and people. Everybody in the company is measured and evaluated in what they contribute to our imperatives, regardless of what part of the organization they reside. 
Having reinvigorated our NPI, New Product Innovation, what we talked to you about last year of our 2.0 and the next phase of innovation, we launched 64 new products last year. Along with the pipeline of 2016 launches, we expect the revenue contributions to deliver strong NPI growth in 2016 and beyond. Our largest and most diverse growth opportunities are executed under our enterprise growth initiatives we call EGI. In 2015, year-over-year revenue growth from these large initiatives was over 20%, and so a 20% growth over 2014. In 2015, we exceeded our expectations for NPI revenues by 6%. Furthermore, I've discussed with you in the past, the class of products we launched in 2015 under our revitalized effort of 2.0 are expected to deliver a record level of revenue, year 3 revenue when compared to prior year launches. It is the healthiest class of products that we've launched since NPI has been in existence here. One of the more exciting new product opportunities revolves around trended data. The effort and investment we're making to fulfill our commitment to Fannie Mae will be leveraged across all of our unique data assets. We firmly believe that the next horizon for information-based solution is trended data, which will underpin more powerful Decisioning Solutions for our customers and significantly improve our competitive position. So to be clear, our focus is trending as many of our unique data assets, which are truly unique, only to Equifax or our customers to provide these values, so things like the Work Number and C+ [ph] and others. 
Finally, as with many of our corporate management doctrines, our global NPI process will be implemented in Veda once we complete the acquisition, and I'll get to Veda in a moment. In 2015, we launched our Big Data platform called Cambrian. Cambrian will enable faster development and delivery of analytic insights, including improving the speed at which we develop new products. It will also greatly enhance our Decision 360 capabilities, and provide significant competitive advantage using advanced analytic techniques. Now the corporate impairment for us has been about Lean. Lean continues to make incremental contributions to our expense leverage, and exceeded our goal by contributing over 30% greater benefit in 2015 than we had budgeted. And we've leveraged our expertise in Lean principles to deepen our relationships with some of our largest customers through projects that help them streamline many of their operational activities, and that obviously provides a competitive differentiator boost in the marketplace. 
Let me close before I give it to John and talk a little bit about Veda. I'm sure many of you are aware that the regulatory approval of Veda received in December enabled them to schedule a shareholder meeting, which Jeff alluded to a little bit ago. They had a shareholder meeting on February 8 and gained approval there, and they've also received a the final court approval this week, and at this point, it's our expectation to close the acquisition at the -- towards the end of February of this year. We're very excited about this opportunity, represent for us the great strategy, strong financial performance, outstanding management team, great market position, and they also give us a significant opportunity in the Asia Pacific geography of further broadening and enhancing our geographic footprint, which is important to us, as we diversify revenue stream. As we move into our first quarter earnings call and beyond, obviously, we'll keep you apprised of the strategic and the financial progress that the team is making with his new asset. 
In closing, our performance in 2015 exemplifies the culture and the strength of our management team and our dedication in the entire organization to innovate and execute for our customers. It's a culture and a process that has taken years to develop, and it underpins the confidence we have in our ability to continue delivering on our commitments and to make our customers and shareholders satisfied with that performance. Our strategic imperatives, as we enter 2016, are in a few areas that are very important to us. We cascade these around the world. One, obviously, is deliver strong and consistent profitable growth and shareholder returns; two, to develop unparalleled analytical insights, leveraging the unique data assets that Equifax has; three is to innovate for market leadership in the key domains and verticals in which we operate; four, is to serve as a trusted steward and advocate for customers and consumers around the world; and obviously, in closing, the last, to invest in talent to drive that strategy and foster a culture of innovation. 
So with that, John, as you always do, please go through the financials."

As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentione",1968,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentioned at the opening, all BU information is based on the new segments with direct-to-consumer resellers moved to PSOL from USIS and International. Going forward, given the substantial amortization expense related to the Veda acquisition, we will increase our discussion of EBITDA for Equifax and the operating segments. 
U.S. Information Solutions revenue in 4Q '15 was $296 million, up 7% when compared to the fourth quarter of '14. For the full year, revenue of $1.2 billion was up 8%. This compares favorably to our long-term expectation for USIS of 5% to 7% growth as both the mortgage and automotive were very strong in 2015. 
Online Information Solutions revenue was $204 million in 4Q '15, up 6% year-to-year and $842 million for the full year, up 8% when compared with the prior year. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $28 million in 4Q '15, up 10% year-to-year, and $124 million for calendar year '15, up 17%. Total mortgage-related revenue was up 16% and 17% in the quarter for USIS and Equifax, respectively. For calendar year '15, mortgage-related revenue was up 25% and 29% for USIS and Equifax, respectively. This compares favorably to the average Mortgage Bankers Application index, which was up 14% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the calendar year. 
Financial Marketing Services revenue was $64 million in 4Q '15, up 7% year-to-year and up $205 million for calendar year '15, up 5% year-to-year. The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 41.6% in 4Q '15 and 41.9% for calendar year '15, up 50 basis points and 290 basis points, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.5% in 4Q '15 and 49.7% in calendar year '15. We expect to see continued expansion in the USIS EBITDA margins in 2016. 
International's revenue was $143 million in 4Q '15, down 1% on a reported basis, but up 11% on a local currency basis. Revenue was $569 million for calendar year '15, down 1% on a reported basis, but up 12% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $64 million in 4Q '15, up 3% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in local currency. For calendar year '15, Europe revenue was $247 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 12% on local currency. Latin America's revenue was $49 million in 4Q '15, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Revenue was $200 million for calendar year '15, up 4% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. Latin America showed outstanding local currency growth throughout '15, led by strong growth across Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Canada revenue was $29 million, down 11% in U.S. dollars, but up 5% in local currency. Revenue for calendar year '15 was $122 million in U.S. dollars, down 11% in U.S. dollars but up 3% in local currency. Canada's performance strengthened very nicely in the second half, and has momentum going into 2016. 
International's operating margin was 20.7% in 4Q '15 and 20% in calendar year '15. EBITDA margins were 27.2% in 4Q '15, and 27% in calendar year '15. Both operating and EBITDA margins were down year-to-year in International. However, both showed sequential improvement in the fourth quarter relative to the third. In 2016, we expect to see continued margin improvement, driven by continued strong local currency growth and the benefits of regionalization as well as from the addition of Veda. We will see some margin pressure related to weakened foreign currencies, particularly with the Canadian dollar and the devaluation of the Argentinean peso. 
Workforce Solutions revenue was $144 million in the quarter, up 12% year-to-year, and $578 million in calendar year '15, up 18% year-to-year. This reflects continued very strong growth in Verification Services, up 14% in fourth quarter and 25% year-to-year. Employer Services also delivered a very strong performance, up 8% in the fourth quarter and 8% in the calendar year. This was driven by success in their Compliance Center offerings and their solution for employers' compliance with are the requirements of the ACA. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 36.8% in 4Q '15 and 37.9% in calendar year '15, up 430 and 510 basis points, respectively. Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins were 44.3% in the fourth quarter, and 45.1% in the calendar year. We expect continued strong expansion of Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins in 2016. 
Global Personal Solutions revenue was $84 million in 4Q '15, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis. Revenue in calendar year '15 was $346 million, up 18% on a reported basis and up 19% on a local currency basis. PSOL's business has 2 main areas: credit and identity monitoring services sold through direct and indirect channels that protect and monitor consumers' ID and enable consumers to gain better access to credit, and credit and other data sales sold through our DTC reseller partners. Credit and identity monitoring services sold through the indirect channel represent those circumstances where Equifax provides white level [ph] online credit and identity services through partners. In 2015, ongoing revenue from credit and identity monitoring services grew at the high end of the 4% to 6% guidance range we have previously provided for the PSOL segment prior to the addition of DTC sellers. DTC reseller's revenue represent sales of credit and other data to resellers. In these cases, Equifax provides data and analytics, but not the web properties with which the customer directly interacts. Examples of this business are relationships with Credit Karma and LifeLock. DTC reseller revenue showed substantial growth in 2015, driven primarily by our relationship with Credit Karma, which began in 4Q '14. Our DTC reseller revenue should continue to grow faster than our direct-to-consumer sales, but as Rick mentioned, not at the very high rate you saw in 2015. 
Looking forward, as previously mentioned, we expect this overall segment to grow 5% to 8%. Operating margin was 27% in 4Q '15 and 27.5% for calendar year '15, consistent with our expectations. EBITDA margins were 29.7% in 4Q '15 and 30.2% in calendar year '15. PSOL revenue and operating margin in 4Q '14 were very strong, reflecting a large reach deal won in 4Q '14. 4Q '15 operating margin of 27% was consistent with our expectations and our guidance, and reflects the impact of our decision to invest more in marketing in 2015, as well as the addition of DTC reseller business to PSOL. 
In the fourth quarter, general corporate expense was $51 million, excluding $3.7 million for onetime expenses associated with the Veda acquisition. General corporate expense was up slightly from 3Q, consistent with our guidance. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect general corporate expense, excluding Veda-related acquisition and integration expenses, to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million and run at a slightly lower rate throughout the remaining quarters of the year. The adjusted operating margin at 27.1% in 4Q '15 and 27.4% in calendar year '15 were up 60 and 90 basis points year-to-year, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.4% in 4Q '15 and 34.8% in calendar year '15. We expect to see improvements in our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2016, expanding by about 75 basis points. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.6%, equal to our expectation and in our guidance. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate, after adjusting for non-GAAP items, the Missouri state tax law change in the second quarter and TDX escrow adjustment in third quarter, was 33.7% consistent with our comments during our third quarter release. Looking forward into 2016, our expectation is for a GAAP effective tax rate of about 33%. 
Operating cash flow was $205 million in 4Q '15 and $742 million in calendar year '15. Both were very strong, reflecting strong earnings and working capital performance. Free cash flow, equal to operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was very strong in 2015 at $596 million, up 12% from 2014. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $53 million and for calendar year '15 were $146 million. Consistent with our comments throughout the year, the increase in capital spending versus 2014 reflects the acceleration of our investment in New Product Innovation, deployment of global platforms, including Cambrian and other analytics, InterConnect, Fraud, and our new PSOL infrastructure. As we look forward to 2016, we expect capital spending, including Veda, to be in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This is consistent with 2015 and reflects a continuation of our current investments as well as some additional spending in the near term as we integrate Veda. This is slightly higher than our expected long-term rate of capital spending of about 5% of revenue due to the Veda integration.
As Rick indicated, we have received Veda shareholder approval and approval from the Australian courts to complete the purchase of Veda. We expect the acquisition to close on about February 25. Total purchase price, including assumed debt and fees, is approximately USD 1.9 billion. At the close of the Veda transaction, we will have debt outstanding of just under $3.1 billion, and debt to EBITDA on a trailing basis of just under 3x. As indicated previously, we expect to maintain our current credit ratings. In 2016, we will focus on using our very strong cash flow for debt reduction and returning our leverage to a level consistent with our current credit rating. Therefore, we do not intend to repurchase shares in 2016. We will, however, continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016 with a goal of delivering on our long-term model of an additional 1 to 2 points of revenue growth. Assuming acquisitions consistent with our targets in 2016 and 2017, we would expect to repurchase shares in 2017. 
As we discussed last quarter, we will exclude Veda transactions and other acquisition expenses and integration expenses incurred in the first year after the Veda acquisition through 1Q '17, in calculating adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin and EBITDA margin. We will provide information regarding transaction and acquisition expenses incurred with the acquisition, as well as integration expenses we expect to incur related to the Veda acquisition after the transaction closes at our 1Q '16 earnings release conference call. Also, Jeff mentioned at the beginning of the call, given the relatively short time we will own Veda in the quarter, our 1Q '16 guidance does not include the impact of Veda nor the incremental debt cost, including interest expense related to the acquisition. We will provide you details on the impact of Veda on 1Q '16 during our 1Q '16 earnings call in April. 
The 2016 full year guidance Rick will provide includes Veda. For 2016, we have assumed Veda will be a part of Equifax for 10 months. Veda revenue for 10 months is assumed to be USD 220 million to USD 230 million. This include an estimate of the impact to revenue of U.S. GAAP, which will be updated as we close 1Q '16. The benefit to adjusted EPS from Veda net of acquisition financing cost is about $0.10 to $0.15 per share. As a reminder, adjusted EPS excludes acquisition amortization expense. For modeling purposes, you can assume an average cost of our Veda acquisition debt during 2016 of about 2.5%. Veda's seasonality of revenues is similar to Equifax, with 2Q revenue typically the highest from a seasonality perspective, 1Q generally the lowest revenue, and 3Q and 4Q somewhat similar in terms of revenue. The spread between 2Q and 1Q revenue has recently been in the range of 7% to 10%. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

Some summary comments before we go to the Q&A. As I've mentioned before to all of you and many of you noted in our conversations and in the write ups, the level of execution and the momentum this team has generated in 2015 is the best in my 10 years here. I think it's truly remarkable what they've done. We are well positioned for growth opportunities that lie ahead and our ability to take care -- to take on any of the challenges that may confront us. In the coming years, the incremental revenue that would be contributing from class of new products that we just launched, we expect it to exceed our historical average. That's the wind in our back. Our enterprise growth initiatives, including the expanded insights, driven by Cambrian, healthcare, trended data and auto, will not only enhance our competitive position but also deliver growth opportunities for years to come. All of these efforts are expected, in our opinion, to offset the anticipated slowdown of U.S. mortgage market, which, as you know, started to decelerate over the course of 2015. While it's impossible to predict where the mortgage market is going to go, especially when I look this morning at 10-year Treasury is under 1.6, forecast range from down 20% to up mid-single digits. Our forecast that we're giving you for 2016 is anticipating that the mortgage market will be down single digits in 2016. And obviously, our expectation of the team in both Workforce Solutions and USIS, as they have done for many, many years, outperforms that quite significantly. Obviously, if rates continue to stay low as they are, there may be some market upside to what occurs in the mortgage market, and we'll all know obviously when we head deeper into the year. 
2016 is yet again expected to be another strong year performance for the company. For the year, we expect revenue, including the impact of Veda, to be between $3 billion and $3.1 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of the 15% to 19%. That's going to be partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in October that the organic constant currency growth would be at the high end of our long-term range of 6% to 8%. I got to say it again, that's at the high end of our range coming off constant currency growth last year of 12%. So it's, I think, quite remarkable. As John mentioned, we also expect to add another 1 to 2 points of tuck-in acquisitions throughout the year. These additional acquisitions are obviously beyond Veda, which as he said, is not included in our 2000 -- I'm sorry, in the first quarter of 2016 outlook. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $4.95 and $5.05, which is up 10% to 12% for the year, excluding approximately $0.13 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 13% to 15%. For the first quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $685 million and $695 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%. That will be partially offset by about 3 points of FX headwind in the quarter. First quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.14 and $1.16, which is up 7% to 8%, excluding $0.04 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 12% for the first quarter. Again, we expect to close Veda in the first quarter, but we'll not include that in the estimate. Maybe during the Q&A, we'll talk about why it's not in the first quarter for that 1 month. In 2016, we'll also going to shift our focus to adjusted EBITDA margin. You've heard us talk about that throughout the call, since it better represents the true operating performance of the company. 2016, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by a solid 75 basis points over last year's 34.8% EBITDA margin. In our modified multiyear business model, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the upper 30% to 40% range, with annual acceleration of at least 25 basis points. 
So with that, operator, if you'd open up for questions for audience, that would be great."

And we are not seeing a slowdown in our markets. Maybe an exception here or there, but nothing material, David, that gives me concern that the forecast we just gave you for guidance is not very attainable.

What you're going to see there is continued margin expansion in businesses that have been expanding now for quite some time. That's EWS, as you alluded to, and USIS. That trend will continue. Number two, we intentionally made investments in PSOL in 2015 to position them for better growth in 2016 and beyond. That's kind of behind us now. So you'll start to see margin expansion in PSOL, from the levels you saw in 2015. We also invested in 2 main areas in International that are behind us now. One was, as you're very well aware, standing up of the U.K. government contract, which was a year-long, heavy investment. And now, the revenue starts to come because it was virtually no revenue in 2015. Secondly, we talked about kind of regionalization of platforms and people and processes that give us a long term, more cost-efficient International model. Those investments were largely made in 2015. Those have now been anniversaried. So you'll start to see International and PSOL margins expanding this year. And obviously, International, I think I alluded to it, will be -- also, their margins will be enhanced with the addition of a very high-margin, successful business in Veda.

But we are such -- we're so lightly penetrated in many of the high-growth markets. There's years of growth to go on the verification side in the U.S. alone. And you add to that, which is not the heart of your question, growth from the analytics platform that we've built on the employer side. And I gave a little comment, which I didn't expand upon, but I will now, in my prepared comments, David. The appetite for customers and geographies around the world for us to take this platform of the Work Number to their geographies is stronger now than it's ever been. And we have got a team working full speed on a couple of main geographies around the world. And so I'm not going to get in a lot of detail on where. But they solve same problems that we're solving here there. So long way of saying, the growth opportunity is significant, it's multiyear, and it's not just the U.S."

I'm not going to go into the level of pricing increase we get from trended data. But the way to look at it is, the value derived on ROI basis from the mortgage underwriters from looking at data over multiple years versus a shot in time is significant. As a result, they're willing to pay more for trended data. The other point I alluded to in the -- in my prepared comments, Paul, was we're going to trend more than just the credit file and take our really unique data assets that no else has and start trending those. Think about the value of trending income data versus taking a snapshot in time so -- and then you take the utility data. So the trending -- I really mean this sincerely -- the trending of data, especially the unique data assets we have, I think, creates innovative products and solutions for years to come. As far as the mortgage market -- on Workforce Solutions, again, we don't disclose that level of detail. I'd leave it at this though. There's still significant room. And David Togut kind of alluded to this. As the database grows, the hit rate goes up. It benefits all verticals, including mortgage. But we still have penetration opportunities, not just on hit rate but by account in the mortgage arena in EWS, much like we do in auto, insurance, credit card, government and others for the Work Number."

In fact, I think it'll be at the lower end of that range in '16, to be very clear with you. And then as far as the multiyear model, why wouldn't I ratchet that up? I'd rather do that once I have success under our belt, and we see just how big this is going to be. So I think it's a little premature. But at the right time once we see the success and the traction. As you know, it goes live in midyear and we'll be a lot smarter come the end of the year. And as the model justifies being changed at that time, we will."

And we are in our infancy stage of understanding globalizing the platform, globalizing the process and deploying Lean around the world. So we could react much faster, if we had to, in that environment. Two, just the overall pipeline of products we have is much stronger now. We're in the early days of NPI back then. EGI did not exist then. So just the ability to grind out organic growth didn't exist. And lastly, we have built some counter -- I'll make 2 other points -- countercyclical products that are bigger now, would do well. Think about unemployment claims as an example in EWS. That would do well in a recessionary environment. And we're more global today, especially with the addition of Veda and their platform.

So yes, having access to a much larger sales organization with deeper, longer-standing relationships will help our debt management growth. But beyond that, one, we're getting a business that's got great organic growth opportunities. I alluded the fact there's inorganic opportunities. And then the others are bringing things like the Work Number to Australia, bringing Cambrian to Australia, bringing InterConnect to Australia, bringing our global fraud platform to Australia. It's hard -- you can't underestimate the relationship these guys have in Australia and New Zealand, and the market presence they have with all major verticals is significant. And they build out, much like Equifax has in Australia and New Zealand, a very wide array of unique data assets. And if we can bring our know-how to bear there to build products, that is a great growth driver. And then as someone, I think it was Andrew, asked a second ago, eventually when comprehensive, as you referred to or positive data as many referred to it, when that becomes mainstream, guess what, we know how to manage positive data and build production on positive data really well.

Thanks as always for joining us this morning on the call. Our first quarter performance certainly exceeded our expectations and further underscored the strength and the ability of this management team to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed the commitments we made to you, our shareholders. And not only do have experienced leadership team but the entire organizational rhythm is geared to the management disciplines we created and built together over the last 10 or 11 years this attends our NPI, enterprise growth initiatives, Lean, growth account management, et cetera. Let me tell you one thing, this team is hungry and competitive and continue to winning streak that they've been on now for a number of years.
Our first quarter results are noteworthy as they are compared to a very strong performance in the first quarter 2015. 2016 first quarter was a record quarter, which is on top of a record year in 2015. For the quarter, total revenue was $728 million, that was up 12% on a reported basis and up 15% on a local currency basis from the first quarter of 2015. Organic constant currency revenue growth was very strong, up almost 11% over last year. Also in the quarter, foreign exchange created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.2% compared to 34.5% in the first quarter of 2015 and that was in line with our expectations when we guided for full year during our fourth quarter release, and John will talk about that in detail as will either if you have any questions. Adjusted EPS was $1.23, up 15% from $1.07 last year and significantly above the upper end of our guidance range.
As always, before John gives you the financial details, I'd like to briefly cover some more highlights for the first quarter as I always do. I'll talk about the business unit specifically first and the transition corporate level highlights. And then John will take the financials.
Starting, obviously, with USIS. They delivered solid 4% revenue growth in the quarter, double-digit growth in front, automotive, commercial and mortgage resellers helped offset slower goals in Mortgage Solutions, which, as you know, last year first quarter was a really, really strong quarter for us. New product innovation is expected a significant impact on USIS's future growth, while some of this is been driven by the initiatives that USIS like the company are very, very large base. Our current estimate, sticking with USIS, for 2016's class of new products are expected to have 3-year revenue that is double the estimate of our 2015 class. We'll talk about more about NPI at the company level later in my comments, but it's off to a very, very good start for USIS.
Also the pipeline a new product is much more robust than prior years. Our current pipeline is estimated to deliver significantly more revenue, incremental revenue growth reflecting both market demand and our increasing investments in products.
Cambria, which you've heard now about for a number of quarters, is having a very positive impact with our customers. Since launching Cambria, our mix of projects have shifted significantly towards multi-data sources and deeper insights for many our customers traditional decision activities. Data extraction and analysis time have been reduced by well over 50%. What that allows us to do is fail fast and as I've talked before, it shortens the cycle time of to bring new products to market.
Initial applications have address customer needs across the verticals including banking, auto, telecommunications. That's enabling us to enable our entire customer base with unified technology and skill sets.
Our work with Fannie Mae on trend today is on track and expected to go live as we committed to you over in the year and we'll go live at the end of June, 1st of July of this year. IT integration with Fannie Mae and ongoing platform for trending data is complete and our global operations team is in the final stages of establishing their support readiness program, again, anticipating at the end of June, early July launch.
USIS is expected to have another strong year in 2016 with growth at the lower end of the long-term range of 5% to 7% despite our continuing expectations for a flat to down mortgage market in 2016. EBITDA margins are expected to be at or above 50% for the year, which is slightly better than what we were expecting as we entered 2016.
On the international, they delivered 30% local currency revenue growth benefiting from broad-based organic growth, which is above the upper end of the long-term growth model, which is 8% to 10%. The growth was also, obviously, contributed from the support of the acquisition of Veda and John will go into a lot of detail on that.
Within international, NPI has been and will continue to be an important growth driver for them. Innovation in international is very broad-based. For instance, in the first quarter, over 60% of new product revenue was driven by our customers for decision activities, the remainder was driven by new solutions for high-value operations in ivy, identification, date the 360, front and debt management.
The relationship with U.K. government for our debt management services is strong and the initiative is off to a very good start. We have 5 central government agencies operationalized, including the HMRC, which is, as you recall, the equivalent to our IRS. And this represents most of the debt that has been placed for collections. We have placed over $800 million of debt the various agencies, were performing the analytics and the collections effort. Our data is fully integrated in the process of segmenting consumer and business accounts through terminal which agencies is best suited to collect that particular segment.
Revenue in international's 4 largest vertical, which are financial institutions, telcos, government and SMEs will be very strong 12% in the quarter, which is very broad-based across verticals and countries. The decision in platforms, Analytical Services and debt management revenue across solid 19% in the quarter, be deepening our relationship -- our customer relationships and strengthening our competitive position globally. Many of we delivered very healthy double-digit local currency growth in Latin America for a number of years and we expect to do so again this year, although the second evaluation of the Argentine peso will have a negative impact on our reported results in 2016, it appears that Argentina's new government is moving in the right direction to restore credibility and the financial markets.
In fact, I just returned from Argentina to spend sometime with our customers, government officials and economists and the outlook for Argentina in the next 2, 3, 4 years is as strong as I seen in my 10.5 years here. Across the region, in Latin America, we have a very good management team, a very strong market position and our strategy continues to resonate well with our customers.
Finally, the integration of via is going very well. Our primary focus at this point is 2 is a possible integration of the backroom processes, tools, the point products and capabilities from around the company that will add value to our local customers; and 3, ensuring all of our customer-facing teams in that region continues to service our customers well.
We continued to expect international to have a strong 2016. Organic revenue growth should be above the upper end of the long-term model, again, which is 8% to 10%, with EBITDA margins improving sequentially throughout the course of the year as planned.
On the work force solutions, they delivered an outstanding 21% revenue growth and over 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in the first quarter. Work force solutions continued to grow were above the upper end from our multiyear model of 9% to 11% as really being driven strong execution of the core strategic growth initiatives which are adding records that the database, New Product Innovation, pursuing new growth opportunities and difficult such as automatic credit card, healthcare government in the growth continues to be very broad-based across many verticals, penetrating new customers and offer a new products.
Demand for solutions known as ACA, and solutions for employers continue to be strong. Our current outlook for the year is now ahead of the expectations we stated earlier in the year. And you may recall those expectations earlier in the year expected very significant grows over 2015, so that strength is getting even stronger as we move through 2016. We've also identified other interesting opportunities to help employers with their ACA compliance. That includes things like the IRS forms 10-94 and 10-95 and even beyond that. Work force solutions is emerging as a leader in what can be called compliance as a service to help employers solve increasingly complex compliance matters. A Swedish services has expanded and we continue to look for new opportunities our services with these emerging needs. An example of emerging need is new regulation coming out around overtime pay changes, and we are looking at leveraging our ACA analytical platform to solve those problems as well.
EWS' NPI Vitality Index is expected to be very strong again this year, reaching approximately 13%. The growth focus this year is on accelerating record growth in those working of the database and deepening market penetration and targeted markets against such as auto, car and government and maximizing opportunities to help employers with their compliance needs. Ford also continuing to solve employers complex HR compliance challenges. Work for solutions should have another outstanding year in 2016 with revenue growth well above the long-term range of 9% to 11%.
EBITDA margins should be in the high 40s, just shy of a long-term target we gave you earlier in the year of 50%.
On a global consumer solutions, they also had an exceptional quarter, with 16% local currency revenue growth and 100 basis points margin -- hundred basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Indirect revenue was up over 50% as the team continues to sign large deals with established companies who seek to deepen and broaden the relationships with consumers.
Our customers and our pipeline is robust across multiple industries, including banking, retail, consumer products and services as well as our expanding relationship that we established last year with -- Mid-single-digit revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities was consistent with our expectations and largely driven by higher average in the U.S. and account acquisition outside the U.S.
Global consumer solutions first quarter performance was outstanding, and we now expect that they to will be comfortably exceed their long-term growth target -- constantly delivering doubled digit growth for the year of adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to exceed 30%.
Before I go on to John, let me just give a couple of highlights at the corporate level and then John will give you the financials.
Our enterprise growth initiatives are off to a very good start this year. 3 or 4 transformational initiatives are developing the work global exchange; 2, disrupting innovation by cambria platform throughout our global footprint and; 3, unify our global consumer solutions business with a single operating platform around the world that we call let me jump at it each of those are a second.
With already completed the scope and the timeline for creating an income and employment verification exchange in a select group of our larger markets. We have the platform, we have strong customer demand and we will be moving forward with his efforts throughout 2016 and beyond.
We are -- the initial focus for globalizing Cambria will be in Canada, Argentina and Australia. Canada will be the first other geographies will complete their initial assessment and defined their requirements. We'll give you an update on other countries as we exit 2016. That bodes well for growth opportunities in '17, '18 and beyond. Our global IT platform supporting global consumer solutions Renaissance is expected to go live this year after deployment in our core markets of the U.S., Canada and the U.K., will evaluate for the market opportunities, obviously, including Australia and Latin America.
Cambrian has substantially enhanced our ability to provide unique, high value and size to our customers and it positions us well for the future. The platform can easily incorporate very contemporary analytic technologies, i.e. machine learning algorithms, analyze all types of unstructured data and provide customers with dashboards customized to their specific needs. In front, we've applied machine learning algorithms to increase prediction by over 20% by reducing false positives for Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering, we know unstructured data to reduce false positives by approximately 60%.
Customers were providing them with access to over 50 metrics on over $3 billion trade lines from their customers, with We 
Created a dashboard portal that will be updated on a periodic basis. These types of services uniquely enable us to further deepen our customer relationships and position as as a premier source of insights on their consumers. Although in the early year, our new product pipeline for 2016 looks very promising. We expect year 3 revenue from our 2016 launches to be up significantly from 2015 product launches in 3-year revenue expectation, which most of you may recall, 2015 class was up significantly over 2014.
two various solid product class will fuel growth through 2018. Our Lean -- our work with our customers leveraging our operational experience with Lean is creating great client Stickiness. It has been the activities we're helping our clients with our numerous and inclusions things as mortgage lending, collections, auto lending, marketing and employee on boarding so again, the activities are far beyond their interaction with us. Destroyed to make their processes more efficient. We've also extended their program to international on either completed or have projects in the pipeline in countries such as the U.K. and Canada. We have a number of clients where we have repeat engagements including 2 where we have had 5 separate engagements as 1 company since 2014.
Increasingly, client is making Equifax a trusted adviser in times of change. But these relationships were able to increase utilization of our products and services across the enterprise, identify new customer opportunities down year for product and services and support and strengthen long-term relationships.
Our broad-based performance continues to position us very nicely to exceed the targets we set for ourselves and have committed to our employees, our customers, shareholders and consumers.
We are now adding a second quarter with strong momentum and in many respects, have yet to fully realize the benefits of a number a strategic initiatives that were expected to meaningful contributions not only to this year but again, in 2017 and '18. With that, let me turn it over to John for the financials."

As indicated previously, with the data acquisition, will ship adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and company as a whole. Adjusted EBITDA margin has been defined as adjusted net income plus depreciation, net interest expenses and taxes. At the segment level, adjusted EBITDA margin. As adjusted operating income plus depreciation, plus net equity and other income.
Given the change in our reporting structure, this metric will provide an improved understanding of segment performance as well as assessing their progress against our multiyear targets.
The GAAP, non-GAAP organization at -- the earnings release provide a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin.
As you will recall, we'll be excluding beta transaction expenses and integration expenses incurred through 1Q '17, the first year after the beta acquisition from our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA margin. In 1Q '16, the total beta transaction pretax expense was about $22 million virtually all of which was transaction related. $16 million of these pretax expenses are reflected as operating expense. Of this $16 million, $12 million are investing millinery spreads legal and accounting adviser transaction fees and impact general corporate expense.
The remainder of the operating expense as a beta acquisition related, employee compensation of data, which is included in the international operating segment. Net FX loss is related to beta financing were approximately $6 million in the first quarter and are reflected as other income.
As a reminder, recognize $5 million in FX gains related to beta financing in 4Q '15. Looking forward, the remaining beta transaction expenses will be occurred in 2Q '16 and should be relatively smaller, principally final legal and finance fees related to require government filings and FX losses of approximately $3 million related to completion of the extinguishments of certain beta debts.
Beta integration expenses will increase in 2Q '16 as integration activities accelerate. Total beta transaction and integration pretax expenses in 2Q '16 are expected to be approximately $7 million, which includes the $3 million in FX losses.
Now let me turn to the business units financial performance for the first quarter.
U.S. information solutions revenue was $295 million, up 4% when compared to the first quarter of 2016 and consistent with our expectations. Online information solutions revenue was $280 million, up 5% when compared to the year-ago period, reflecting double-digit growth in commercial information in fraud. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 1% compared to Q1 2015. Total mortgage related revenue in USIS was up 7% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which is up 1% in the first quarter.
USIS total mortgage revenue growth continues to outpace overall mortgage market growth, consistent with our historical performance, although the mortgage market was slightly better than we anticipated for the quarter, our full-year outlook for mortgage origination remains the same as last quarter at flat to down slightly. On the Financial Marketing Services in the revenue was $45 million, up 1% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions was a strong 48.7%. As expected, this was down from the very strong 50.8% delivered in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting the very strong mortgage market in 1Q '15. In addition, the decline reflects increased legal expenses versus 1Q '15. Legal expenses incurred in any given period can be choppy. And excluding this increase legal expense, the adjusted EBITDA margin for 1Q '16 would have been down only slightly versus the record levels of 1Q '15.
Work force solutions revenue was $180 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $99.2 million, up 16%, was driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and preemployment market segments. This reflects increased penetration verifiers as well as continued growth and records to the database.
Employer services revenue, $8.9 million, was up 29% from last year. Our traditional employer services businesses of unemployment claims -- validations and onboarding, performed well with, and revenue was consistent with our long-term electrification expectations in the mid-single digits. Workforce Analytics, had a very strong quarter as 1Q '16 and 2Q '16 represent the first in which employers are providing Form 1095C to employees as part of their annual tax filing and as required by the ACA.
As these forms are principally delivered in the first half of the year, we expect the strong growth in Workforce Analytics to continue into 2Q '16. The workforce solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 49.5%, up from 47.3% in 1Q '15. This reflects a very strong growth of our higher-margin verifier and Workforce Analytics businesses.
Revenue from our combined USIS and workforce solutions businesses, which represent our total U.S. B2B business activities was $475 million, representing organic growth of over 10%.
International's revenue was $158 million, up 17% on a reported basis and 30% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth, which excludes beta revenue, was slightly above our long-term range of 8% to 10%. By region, -- revenue was 100 -- was $61 million, up 10% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency.
Latin America's revenue was $43 million, down 11% in U.S. dollars but up 15% in local currency. As you probably know, Argentina's average FX rates in 1Q '16 depreciated almost 40% from 1Q '15. Argentina when combined with the impact on the currency and Uruguay, contributed almost 75% of the negative foreign exchange impact on revenue in Latin America.
Asia Pacific revenue was $28 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from beta from net positive and are tedious management at the operations of Australia. Our current debt management revenue in Australia is very small. As a reminder, the Veda transaction closed on February 24, with that of being a part of Equifax for about 40% of the quarter. Canada revenue was $28 million, down 10% in U.S. dollars both flat and local currency. We saw continuing in improvement in Equifax Canada during the second half of 2015, both in terms of revenue growth and, importantly, the pipeline of new products we expect to begin to deliver revenue later in 2016 and 2017.
This flat performance in 1Q '16 reflects the relative weakness of the Canadian economy we referenced in our last earnings call. We expect improved performance as we -- as new products ramp later this year.
For the first quarter, international adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3% and, as expected, down slightly from 1Q '15. The slight decline reflects the benefit of adding higher-margin as well as improved EBITDA margin performance it's in that management, which was offset by a decline in EBITDA margin and Latin America.
This decline in Latin America is due to substantial weakness of local currencies. A portion of our cost is in U.S. dollars, which does not benefit from the devaluation of the currency. Over the remainder of 2016 and international, we expect to show EBITDA margin growth, reflecting revenue growth on our higher-margin countries, coupled with the cost benefit of the regionalization program started last year.
Global consumer solutions revenue was $95 million, up 14% on a reported basis and up 16% on a local currency basis. Global Personal Solutions showed growth across all channels, B2C, indirect and direct and the strong growth in the quarter driven by principally by and to a lesser extent, our other channels. For the first quarter, in adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 100 basis points from 1Q '15. This reflects strong revenue growth and leverage against support costs.
In the first quarter, general corporate expense of $71.6 million, was in line with our expectations and down 9% from last year. Onetime items impacted both 1Q '16 and 1Q '15. As I mentioned earlier, Veda integration expenses impact the corporate expense by just over $12 million in 1Q '16. As you will remember, in 1Q '15, we executed an organizational restructuring which impacted corporate expense by $23 million. Excluding these items, general corporate expense was approximately $59 million in 1Q '16, an increase of about $4 million or about 8%.
For the second quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million including the integration expense. The adjusted EBITDA margin at 34.2% was down from 34.5% in 2016 and consistent with our expectations for the quarter. The reduction reflects the expected decline in USIS and international that we discussed customer earlier, partially offset by very strong EBITDA margin performance at both work for solutions and global consumer solutions.
We expect to see year-over-year growth in EBITDA margins in each of the second through fourth quarters and continue to expect 2016 EBITDA margins to be up approximately 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%, which is in line with our expectations. Our adjusted effective tax rate, excluding the tax impact of the data transaction integration expenses was 32.7%. This was consistent with the 32% guidance we have provided. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our expected tax rate to be slightly below this level, approaching 32%.
Capital expenditures for the quarter was $40 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be at the high-end of our long-term range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This reflects expected spending related to the integration of Veda. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $90 million and consistent with our expectations. Operating cash flow was down from 1Q '15 U2 working capital movements. We continue to expect strong growth in cash flow year-over-year for 2016.
Total debt in the quarter was $3.08 billion, slightly below our expectations, yesterday we flighty Form 8-K, with the required Veda financial interest new statement which will give usx ability to take advantage of market windows to refinance a portion of the Veda acquisition. As an indicator last quarter, was banned our share repurchases during 2016 and focus our very strong cash flow and debt reduction and returning a leveraged to a level consistent with our target leverage. We will, however, continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016 with the goal of delivering 1 to 2 points of additional ongoing revenue growth.
Finally, you'll recall that in our 2016 calendar year guidance, we indicated that we expect revenue from Veda of USD 220 million to USD 230 million. And that we expected a benefit of Veda to adjusted EPS of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. In addition, when you provided outlook from 1Q '16, we do not include any impact for Veda. As we indicated at that time, once we have completed the initial integration of Veda into our financial statements and had progressed in the transition of Veda U.S. Capital onto an, we have provide an update of these estimates.
Based on the completion of this were today, we are increasing our full year expectation for EPS accretion to approximately $0.20 per share. Our expectation for revenue in 2016 is now $230 million to $235 million, which reflects improved growth expectations, partially offset by a larger negative impact on revenue recognition from the movement U.S. GAAP accounting. Betas performance in 1Q '16 was consistent on a pro rata basis with these expectations. Acquisition amortization and 2016 from the beta acquisition expected to be approximately $55 million.
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

As I give you guidance for second quarter and for the balance of the year, just to clarify, that does not assume any additional M&A at this juncture. So it's, obviously, the full year of Veda in the numbers plus organic growth. And as John alluded to in his comments, we are expecting to do additional tuck-in M&A this year. That's just not in the guidance I'm about to give you. I want to make sure that was there.
For the second quarter, we're increasing our outlook for both revenues and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue, including Veda to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22% that's partially offset by 3% of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.34 and $1.36. That's up 17% to 18% over 2015, excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 19% to 21%.
With our strong first performance in second quarter and outlook of second quarter, we also increasing our full year outlook for the year. We expect revenue, including the impact of Veda to be between $3.05 million to $3.15 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 17% to 21%. Again, partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwinds.
This is up from the previous guidance of $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion and moves nicely above the high end of a multiyear financial model, 60% organic growth. And you also up expect potential additional growth requisition is the pipeline a strong, but not included in our outlook.
Adjusted EPS for the years compacted to be between $5.15 and $5.25, which is up 14% to 17% year-on-year, excluding approximately $0.12 per share of negative impact and FX. This reflects constant currency EPS growth of 17% and 19%. This, too, is up from $4.95 to $5.05 that we guided to during the fourth quarter earnings call a few months ago.
We also -- continue to expect, as John division, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to continue to expand our approximately 75 basis points for all of 2016.
So with that, operator, I'd you know to open up for any questions. Open the blinds"

During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings. 
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS excludes acquisition-related amortization expense as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with earnings release and are also posted on our website.  Also refer to the investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.

Thanks as always for joining us this morning on the call. Our first quarter performance certainly exceeded our expectations and further underscored the strength and the ability of this management team to consisten",2517,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks as always for joining us this morning on the call. Our first quarter performance certainly exceeded our expectations and further underscored the strength and the ability of this management team to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed the commitments we made to you, our shareholders. And not only do have experienced leadership team, but the entire organizational rhythm is geared to the management disciplines that we've created and built together over the last 10 or 11 years. Those disciplines are NPI, enterprise growth initiatives, Lean, growth playbook, account management, et cetera. Let me tell you one thing, this team is hungry and competitive to continue the winning streak that they've been on now for a number of years.
Our first quarter results are noteworthy as they are compared to a very strong performance in the first quarter 2015. 2016 first quarter was a record quarter, which is on top of a record year in 2015. For the quarter, total revenue was $728 million, that was up 12% on a reported basis and up 15% on a local currency basis from the first quarter of 2015. Organic constant currency revenue growth was very strong, up almost 11% over last year. Also in the quarter, foreign exchange created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.2% compared to 34.5% in the first quarter of 2015, and that was in line with our expectations when we guided for the full year during our fourth quarter release. And John will talk about that in detail as will I if you have any questions. Adjusted EPS was $1.23, up 15% from $1.07 last year and significantly above the upper end of our guidance range.
As always, before John gives you the financial details, I'd like to briefly cover some highlights for the first quarter as I always do. I'll talk about the business unit specifically first and then transition in these corporate level highlights. And then John will take the financials.
Starting, obviously, with USIS. They delivered solid 4% revenue growth in the quarter, double-digit growth in fraud, automotive, commercial and mortgage resellers helped offset slower goals in Mortgage Solutions, which, as you know, last year first quarter, was a really, really strong quarter for us. New product innovation is expected to have significant impact on USIS' future growth, while some of this is being driven by Cambrian, the initiatives at USIS, like the company, are very, very broad-based. 
Our current estimate, sticking with USIS, for 2016's class of new products are expected to have 3-year revenue that is double the estimate of our 2015 class. We'll talk more about NPI at the company level later in my comments, but it's off to a very, very good start for USIS.
Also the pipeline of new product is much more robust than prior years. Our current pipeline is estimated to deliver significantly more revenue -- incremental revenue growth, reflecting both greater market demand and our increasing investments in products.
Cambrian, which you've heard now about for a number of quarters, is having a very positive impact with our customers. Since launching Cambria, our mix of projects has shifted significantly towards multi-data sources and deeper insights for many our customers' traditional decision activities. Data extraction and analysis time have been reduced by well over 50%. What that allows us to do is fail fast, and as I've talked before, it shortens the cycle time of bringing new products to the market.
Initial applications have addressed customer needs across diverse verticals, including banking, auto and telecommunications. That's enabling us to leverage our entire customer base with unified technology and skill sets.
Our work with Fannie Mae on trended data is on track and expected to go live as we committed to you earlier in the year and will go live at the end of June, 1st of July of this year. IT integration with Fannie Mae and the ongoing platform for trended data is complete, and our global operations team is in the final stages of establishing their support readiness program, again, anticipating at the end of June, early July launch.
USIS is expected to have another strong year in 2016, with growth at the lower end of the long-term range of 5% to 7% despite our continuing expectations for a flat to down mortgage market in 2016. EBITDA margins are expected to be at or above 50% for the year, which is slightly better than what we were expecting as we entered 2016.
On to International. They delivered 30% local currency revenue growth, benefiting from broad-based organic growth, which is above the upper end of the long-term growth model, which is 8% to 10%. The growth was also, obviously, contributed from the support of the acquisition of Veda. And John will go into a lot of detail on that.
Within International, NPI has been and will continue to be an important growth driver for them. Innovation in International is very broad-based. For instance, in the first quarter, over 60% of new product revenue was driven by our customers' core decisioning activities. The remainder was driven by new solutions for high-value offerings in ID, authentication, Data 360, fraud and debt management.
The relationship with the U.K. government for our debt management services is strong, and the initiative is off to a very good start. We have 5 central government agencies operationalized, including the HMRC, which is, as you recall, the equivalent to our IRS. And this represents most of the debt that has been placed for collections. We have placed over $800 million of debt with various agencies, who are performing the analytics and the collections effort. Our data is fully integrated in the process of segmenting consumer and business accounts to determine which agency is best suited to collect that particular segment.
Revenue in international's 4 largest verticals, which are financial institutions, telcos, government and SMEs, grew a very strong 12% in the quarter, which is very broad-based across verticals and countries. The decisioning platforms, Analytical Services and debt management revenue across International grew a very solid 19% in the quarter. The high-value solutions are deepening our relationship -- our customer relationships and strengthening our competitive position globally. 
Many of you know we delivered very healthy double-digit local currency growth in Latin America for a number of years, and we expect to do so again this year. Although the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso will have a negative impact on our reported results in 2016, it appears that Argentina's new government is moving in the right direction to restore credibility in the financial markets. In fact, I just returned from Argentina to spend sometime with our customers, government officials and economists, and the outlook for Argentina in the next 2, 3, 4 years is as strong as I've seen in my 10.5 years here. 
Across the region, in Latin America, we have a very good management team, a very strong market position, and our strategy continues to resonate well with our customers.
Finally, the integration of Veda is going very well. Our primary focus at this point is threefold: one, is the thoughtful integration of the backroom processes; two, the deploying products and capabilities from around the company that will add value to our local customers; and three, ensuring that all of our customer-facing teams in that region continues to service our customers well.
We continue to expect International to have a strong 2016. Organic revenue growth should be above the upper end of the long-term model, again, which is 8% to 10%, with EBITDA margins improving sequentially throughout the course of the year as planned.
On to Workforce Solutions. They delivered an outstanding 21% revenue growth and over 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in the first quarter. Workforce Solutions continues to grow well above the upper end of our multiyear model of 9% to 11%. That's really being driven through strong execution of their core strategic growth initiatives, which are adding records to the database, a new product innovation, pursuing new growth opportunities in difficult verticals such as automotive, credit card, healthcare and government. The growth continues to be very broad-based across many verticals, penetrating new customers and offering new products.
Demand for affordable care line solution's known as ACA, the solutions for employers continue to be strong. And our current outlook for the year is now ahead of the expectations we stated early in the year. And you may recall that those expectations early in the year expected very significant growth over 2015, so that strength is getting even stronger as we move through 2016. 
We've also identified other interesting opportunities to help employers with their ACA compliance. That includes things like the IRS forms 1094 and 1095 and even beyond that. Workforce Solutions is emerging as a leader in what can be called compliance as a service to help employers solve increasingly complex compliance matters. A suite of services has expanded, and we continue to look for new opportunities to align our services with these emerging needs. An example that's an emerging need is new regulation coming out around overtime pay changes, and we are looking at leveraging our ACA analytic platform to solve those problems as well.
EWS' NPI Vitality Index is expected to be very strong again this year, reaching approximately 13%. The growth focus this year is on accelerating record growth in work number database and deepening market penetration in targeted markets, again, such as auto, card and government, and maximizing opportunities to help employers with their compliance needs. Fourth [ph], also continue to solve employer's complex HR compliance challenges. 
Workforce Solutions should have another outstanding year in 2016, with revenue growth well above the long-term range of 9% to 11%. EBITDA margins should be in the high 40s, just shy of a the target we gave to you early in the year of 50%.
On to Global Consumer Solutions. They also had an exceptional quarter, with 16% local currency revenue growth and 100 basis points margin -- hundred basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Indirect revenue was up over 50% as the team continues to sign large deals with established companies who seek to deepen and broaden their relationships with consumers.
Our customers and our pipeline is robust across multiple industries, including banking, retail, consumer products and services as well as our expanding relationship that we established last year with Credit Karma. Mid-single-digit revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities was consistent with our expectations and largely driven by higher average revenue per subscriber in the U.S. and account acquisition outside the U.S.
Global Consumer Solutions first quarter performance was outstanding, and we now expect that they too will comfortably exceed their long-term growth target. Constantly delivering doubled digit growth for the year, the adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to exceed 30%.
Before I go on to John, let me just give a couple of highlights at the corporate level, and then John will give you the financials.
Our enterprise growth initiatives are off to a very good start this year. 3 of our 4 transformational initiatives are: one, developing the work number into a global exchange; two, disrupting innovation by expanding our Cambrian platform throughout our global footprint and; three, unifying our Global Consumer Solutions business with a single-operating platform around the world that we call Renaissance. Let me jump into each of those for a second.
We've already completed the scope and the time line for creating an income and employment verification exchange in a select group of our larger markets. We have a platform, we have strong customer demand and we'll be moving forward with this efforts throughout 2016 and beyond.
We are -- the initial focus for globalizing Cambrian will be in Canada, Argentina and Australia. Canada will be the first while all the geographies will complete their initial assessment and define their requirements. We'll give you an update on other countries as we exit 2016. But that bodes well for growth opportunities in '17, '18 and beyond. 
Our global IT platform supporting Global Consumer Solutions, again, called Renaissance, is expected to go live this year. After deployment in our core markets in the U.S., Canada and U.K., we'll evaluate other market opportunities, obviously, including Australia and Latin America.
Cambrian has substantially enhanced our ability to provide unique, high-value insights to our customers, and it positions us well for the future. The platform can easily incorporate very contemporary analytic technologies, i.e. machine learning algorithms, analyze all types of unstructured data and provide customers with dashboards customized to their specific needs. 
In fraud, we will apply machine learning algorithms to increase prediction by over 20% by reducing false positives. For Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering, we will incorporate an unstructured data to reduce false positives by approximately 60%.
Some of our largest customers, we're providing them with access to over 50 metrics on over $3 billion trade lines from their customers. We've created a dashboard portal that will be updated on a periodic basis. These types of services uniquely enable us to further deepen our customer relationships and position us as the premier source of insights on their consumers. 
Although in the early year, our new product pipeline for 2016 looks very promising. We expect year 3 revenue from our 2016 launches to be up significantly from 2015 product launches in their 3-year revenue expectation, which, as most of you may recall, 2015 class was up significantly over 2014. Two very solid product classes will fuel growth through 2018. 
Our Lean -- our work with our customers leveraging our operational experience with Lean is creating great client stickiness. The activities we're helping our clients with are numerous and includes such things as mortgage lending, collections, auto lending, marketing and employee on boarding. So again, the activities are far beyond their interaction with us, just trying to make their processes more efficient. 
We've also extended the program to International now and have either completed or have projects in the pipeline in countries such as the U.K. and Canada. We have a number of clients where we have repeat engagements, including 2 where we have 5 separate engagements at 1 company since 2014.
Increasingly, client leaders are making Equifax a trusted adviser in times of change. With these relationships, we're able to increase utilization of our products and services across the enterprise, identify new customer opportunities we have from the value of our products and services and support and strength of long-term relationships.
Our broad-based performance continues to position us very nicely to exceed the targets we set for ourselves and have committed to our employees, our customers, shareholders and consumers. We are now adding the second quarter with strong momentum and in many respects, have yet to fully realize the benefit of a number of the strategic initiatives that were expected to make meaningful contributions not only to this year, but again, in 2017 and '18. 
With that, let me turn it over to John for the financials."
175749,330347953,966784,"Equifax Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, we'll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis.As we indicated previously, with the Veda acquisition, we will start focusing on adjusted E",1955,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, we'll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis.
As we indicated previously, with the Veda acquisition, we will start focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and of the company as a whole. Adjusted EBITDA margin has been defined as adjusted net income plus depreciation, net interest expense and taxes. At the segment level, adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted operating income plus depreciation, plus net equity and other income.
Given the change in our reporting structure, this metric will provide an improved understanding of segment performance as well as assessing their progress against our multiyear targets. 
The GAAP, non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provide a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin.
As you will recall, we'll be excluding Veda transaction expenses and integration expenses incurred through 1Q '17, the first year after the Veda acquisition, from our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA margin. In 1Q '16, total Veda transaction and integration pretax expense was about $22 million, virtually all of which was transaction-related. $16 million of these pretax expenses are reflected as operating expense. Of this $16 million, $12 million are investment banking, legal and accounting adviser transaction fees and impact general corporate expense.
The remainder of the operating expense is acquisition-related employee compensation expenses of Veda, which is included in the International operating segment. Net FX losses related to Veda financing were approximately $6 million in the first quarter and are reflected as other income.  As a reminder, we recognize $5 million in FX gains related to Veda financing in 4Q '15. 
Looking forward, the remaining Veda transaction expenses will be incurred in 2Q '16 and should be relatively smaller, principally final legal and financial advisory fees related to completing required government filings and FX losses of approximately $3 million related to completion of the extinguishment of certain Veda debts.
Veda integration expenses will increase in 2Q '16 as integration activities accelerate. Total Veda transaction and integration pretax expenses in 2Q '16 are expected to be approximately $7 million, which includes the $3 million in FX losses.
Now let me turn to the business units financial performance for the first quarter.
U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $295 million, up 4% when compared to the first quarter of 2015 and consistent with our expectation. Online Information Solutions revenue was $280 million, up 5% when compared to the year-ago period, reflecting double-digit growth in commercial information and fraud. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 1% compared to Q1 2015. 
Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 7% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 1% in the first quarter. USIS total mortgage revenue growth continues to outpace overall mortgage market growth, consistent with our historical performance. Although the mortgage market was slightly better than we anticipated for the quarter, our full year outlook for mortgage origination remains the same as last quarter at flat to down slightly. 
On to Financial Marketing Services in which revenue was $45 million, up 1% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions was a strong 48.7%. As expected, this was down from the very strong 50.8% delivered in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting the very strong mortgage market in 1Q '15. In addition, this decline reflects increased legal expenses versus 1Q '15. Legal expenses incurred in any given period can be choppy. And excluding this increased legal expense, the adjusted EBITDA margin for 1Q '16 would have been down only slightly versus the record levels of 1Q '15.
Workforce Solutions revenue was $180 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $99.2 million, up 16%, was driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and preemployment market segments. This reflects increased penetration with verifiers as well as continued growth and records to the database.
Employer Services revenue of $80.9 million was up 29% from last year. Our traditional Employer Services businesses of unemployment claims, Watsi, I-9 validations and onboarding performed well, with combined revenue growth consistent with our long-term expectations in the mid-single digits. Workforce Analytics had a very strong quarter as 1Q '16 and 2Q '16 represent the first in which employers are providing Form 1095-C to employees as part of their annual tax filings and as required by the ACA. As these forms are principally delivered in the first half of the year, we expect the strong growth in Workforce Analytics to continue into 2Q '16. 
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 49.5%, up from 47.3% in 1Q '15. This reflects a very strong growth of our higher-margin verifier and Workforce Analytics businesses.
Revenue from our combined USIS and Workforce Solutions businesses, which represent our total U.S. B2B business activities, was $475 million, representing organic growth of over 10%.
International's revenue was $158 million, up 17% on a reported basis and 30% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth, which excludes Veda revenue, was slightly above our long-term range of 8% to 10%. By region, Europe's revenue was 100 -- was $61 million, up 10% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $43 million, down 11% in U.S. dollars, but up 15% in local currency. 
As you probably know, Argentina's average FX rate in 1Q '16 depreciated almost 40% from 1Q '15. Argentina, when combined with the impact on the currency in Uruguay, contributed almost 75% of the negative foreign exchange impact on revenue in Latin America.
Asia Pacific revenue was $28 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda as well as revenue from NettPositive and our TDX debt management operations on Australia. Our current debt management revenue on Australia is very small. As a reminder, the Veda transaction closed on February 24, with Veda being a part of Equifax for about 40% of the quarter. 
Canada revenue was $28 million, down 10% in U.S. dollars, both flat and local currency. We saw a continuing improvement in Equifax Canada during the second half of 2015, both in terms of revenue growth and, importantly, the pipeline of new products we expect to begin to deliver revenue later in 2016 and 2017.  This flat performance in 1Q '16 reflects the relative weakness of the Canadian economy we referenced in our last earnings call. We expect improved performance as we -- as new products ramp later this year.
For the first quarter, International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3% and, as expected, down slightly from 1Q '15. The slight decline reflects the benefit of adding higher-margin Veda as well as improved EBITDA margin performance in debt management, which was offset by a decline in EBITDA margin in Latin America. This decline in Latin America is due to the substantial weakness of local currencies. A portion of our cost is in U.S. dollars, which does not benefit from the devaluation of the currency. Over the remainder of 2016 in International, we expect to show EBITDA margin growth, reflecting revenue growth on our high-margin countries, coupled with the cost benefit of the regionalization program started last year.
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $95 million, up 14% on a reported basis and up 16% on a local currency basis. Global Personal Solutions showed growth across all channels, B2C indirect and direct, and the strong growth in the quarter driven by -- principally by B2C and, to a lesser extent, our other channels. For the first quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 100 basis points from 1Q '15. This reflects strong revenue growth and leverage against GCS support costs.
In the first quarter, general corporate expense of $71.6 million was in line with our expectations and down 9% from last year. Onetime items impacted both 1Q '16 and 1Q '15. As I mentioned earlier, Veda integration expenses impacted corporate expense by just over $12 million in 1Q '16. As you will remember, in 1Q '15, we executed an organizational restructuring, which impacted corporate expense by $23 million. Excluding these items, general corporate expense was approximately $59 million in 1Q '16, an increase of about $4 million or about 8%.
For the second quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million, including the Veda integration expenses. The adjusted EBITDA margin at 34.2% was down from 34.5% in 2015 and consistent with our expectations for the quarter. The reduction reflects the expected decline in USIS and International that we discussed earlier, partially offset by very strong EBITDA margin performance at both Workforce Solutions and Global Consumer Solutions. We expect to see year-over-year growth in EBITDA margins in each of the second through fourth quarters and continue to expect 2016 EBITDA margins to be up approximately 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%, which was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted effective tax rate, excluding the tax impact of the Veda transaction integration expenses, was 32.7%. This was consistent with the 33% guidance we have provided. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be slightly below this level, approaching 32%.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be at the high end of our long-term range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This reflects expected spending related to the integration of Veda. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $90 million and consistent with our expectations. Operating cash flow was down from 1Q '15 due to working capital movements. We continue to expect strong growth in cash flow year-over-year for 2016.
Total debt in the quarter was $3.08 billion, slightly below our expectations. Yesterday we filed a Form 8-K, with the required Veda financial information as well as a new shelf registration statement, which will give us the flexibility to take advantage of market windows to refinance a portion of the Veda acquisition debt. 
As we indicated last quarter, we'll suspend our share repurchases during 2016 and focus our very strong cash flow and debt reduction to returning a leverage to a level consistent with our target leverage. We will, however, continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016, with the goal of delivering 1 to 2 points of additional ongoing revenue growth.
Finally, you'll recall that in our 2016 calendar year guidance, we indicated that we expect revenue from Veda of USD 220 million to USD 230 million. And that we expected a benefit of Veda to adjusted EPS of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. In addition, when we provided outlook for 1Q '16, we did not include any impact from Veda. As we indicated at that time, once we have completed the initial integration of Veda into our financial statements and had progressed in the transition of Veda to U.S. GAAP accounting, we'll provide an update of these estimates.
Based on the completion of this work to date, we are increasing our full year expectation for EPS accretion to approximately $0.20 per share. Our expectation for revenue in 2016 is now $230 million to $235 million, which reflects improved growth expectations, partially offset by a larger negative impact on revenue recognition from the movement to U.S. GAAP accounting. Veda's performance in 1Q '16 was consistent on a pro rata basis with these expectations. Acquisition amortization in 2016 from the Veda acquisition is expected to be approximately $65 million.
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

As I give you guidance for the second quarter and for the balance of the year, just to clarify, that does not assume any additional M&A at this juncture.

As I give you guidance for the second quarter and for the balance of the year, just to clarify, that does not assume any additional M&A at this juncture. So it's, obviously, the full year of Veda in the numbers plus organic growth. And as John alluded to in his comments, we are expecting to do additional tuck-in M&A this year. That's just not in the guidance I'm about to give you. I want to make sure that was clear.
For the second quarter, we are increasing our outlook for both revenues and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue, including Veda to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22%. That's partially offset by 3% of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.34 and $1.36. That's up 17% to 18% over 2015. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 19% to 21%.
With our strong first performance and second quarter -- and outlook for the second quarter, we're also increasing our full year outlook for the year. We expect revenue, including the impact of Veda, to be between $3.05 million to $3.15 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 17% to 21%. Again, partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. This is up from the previous guidance of $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion and will move us nicely above the high end of a multiyear financial model, a 6% to 8% organic growth. And we also, as we mentioned earlier, expect potential additional growth through acquisitions as the pipeline is strong, but not included in our outlook.
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.15 and $5.25, which is up 14% to 17% year-on-year. Excluding approximately $0.12 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency EPS growth of 17% and 19%. This, too, is up from $4.95 to $5.05 that we guided to during the fourth quarter earnings call a few months ago. We also continue to expect, as John had mentioned, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to continue to expand by approximately 75 basis points for all of 2016.

It's got those first 2 quarters of headwind it's going to have to get through. But the great thing is we've got a great balance across the portfolio. Number two is if you think of NPI, it takes a while to gain momentum. And they started building some momentum late last year, May to mid last year. That momentum is continuing now. So the number of products they have, like the rest of the company, are broad, across many verticals. Obviously, the one we talked about with the investors that will pay big dividends in the second half of the year is the launching of trended data for USIS, and that goes live, as I alluded to, in the third quarter of this year. So automotive continues to be a good market for us in USIS. Everything else I describe as a stable economic environment. And I think John did a great job. When  you think of the U.S. business, USIS, we separate 2 entities. We call one EWS; we call the other USIS. If you think about many of the activities that are going on, when you compare ourselves to others in the U.S. marketplace, fairly look at, I think, for you guys is to compare either all of EWS in with USIS or you take the Verification Services and analytics, which is health care, and look at it that way. When you look at it that way, as John said, you're getting double-digit growth. And that's the way we look at the business. We bring all of our products to bear to our customers. And it doesn't matter if it's in analytics or health care company, if it's The Work Number record or if it's fraud, identity management or credit file. They're all solving problems with customers in the U.S., and that's a strong, healthy double-digit growth."

But effectively, the drivers were -- our biggest driver was Latin -- in terms of reduction was Latin America. So it's Latin America because of this really substantial devaluation of currencies, which is much larger than we've seen in the last several years. We saw a margin impact there. It was planned. It was expected to occur. And that is specifically related to the fact that we do have non-local currency expenses and all-local currency revenues so that the margins just don't benefit on both the top and bottom line in the same way. Our Canada margins were slightly down as well because you saw our Canada revenue was flat on a local currency basis, expenses were up slightly. So yes, Canada margin was down slightly. But the big driver was Latin America. And the positive side in terms of International margins that partially offset those declines were obviously the adding of Veda because they have very good EBITDA margins. And then also, as Rick mentioned during his prepared comments and after, debt management grew and performed better. We took out some costs and we some better performance in overall margins in debt management. So that -- those were the drivers of why you saw basically flat EBITDA margins in International."

During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings. 
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS excludes acquisition-related amortization expense as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with earnings release and are also posted on our website.  Also refer to the investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.

Thanks as always for joining us this morning on the call.

Thanks as always for joining us this morning on the call. Our first quarter performance certainly exceeded our expectations and further underscored the strength and the ability of this management team to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed the commitments we made to you, our shareholders. And not only do have an experienced leadership team, but the entire organizational rhythm is geared to the management disciplines that we've created and built together over the last 10 or 11 years. Those disciplines are NPI, enterprise growth initiatives, Lean, growth playbook, account management, et cetera. Let me tell you one thing, this team is hungry and competitive to continue the winning streak that they've been on now for a number of years.
Our first quarter results are noteworthy as they are compared to a very strong performance in the first quarter 2015. 2016 first quarter was a record quarter, which is on top of a record year in 2015. For the quarter, total revenue was $728 million, that was up 12% on a reported basis and up 15% on a local currency basis from the first quarter of 2015. Organic constant currency revenue growth was very strong, up almost 11% over last year. Also in the quarter, foreign exchange created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.2% compared to 34.5% in the first quarter of 2015, and that was in line with our expectations when we guided for the full year during our fourth quarter release. And John will talk about that in detail as will I if you have any questions. Adjusted EPS was $1.23, up 15% from $1.07 last year and significantly above the upper end of our guidance range.
As always, before John gives you the financial details, I'd like to briefly cover some highlights for the first quarter as I always do. I'll talk about the business units specifically first and then transition into some corporate-level highlights. And then John will take the financials.
Starting, obviously, with USIS. They delivered solid 4% revenue growth in the quarter. Double-digit growth in fraud, automotive, commercial and mortgage resellers helped offset slower growth in Mortgage Solutions, which, as you know, last year first quarter, was a really, really strong quarter for us. New product innovation is expected to have significant impact on USIS's future growth. While some of this is being driven by Cambrian, the initiatives at USIS, like the company, are very, very broad-based. 
Our current estimate, sticking with USIS, for 2016's class of new products are expected to have 3-year revenue that is double the estimate of our 2015 class. We'll talk more about NPI at the company level later in my comments, but it's off to a very, very good start for USIS.
Also the pipeline of new products is much more robust than prior years. Our current pipeline is estimated to deliver significantly more revenue -- incremental revenue growth, reflecting both greater market demand and our increasing investments in products.
Cambrian, which you've heard now about for a number of quarters, is having a very positive impact with our customers. Since launching Cambria, our mix of projects has shifted significantly towards multi-data sources and deeper insights for many of our customers' traditional decision activities. Data extraction and analysis time have been reduced by well over 50%. What that allows us to do is fail fast, and as I've talked before, it shortens the cycle time to bring new products to market.
Initial applications have addressed customer needs across diverse verticals, including banking, auto and telecommunications. That's enabling us to leverage our entire customer base with unified technology and skill sets.
Our work with Fannie Mae on trended data is on track and expected to go live as we committed to you earlier in the year and will go live at the end of June, 1st of July of this year. IT integration with Fannie Mae and the ongoing platform for trended data is complete, and our global operations team is in the final stages of establishing their support readiness program, again, anticipating an end of June, early July launch.
USIS is expected to have another strong year in 2016, with growth at the lower end of the long-term range of 5% to 7% despite our continuing expectations for a flat to down mortgage market in 2016. EBITDA margins are expected to be at or above 50% for the year, which is slightly better than what we were expecting as we entered 2016.
On to International. They delivered 30% local currency revenue growth, benefiting from broad-based organic growth, which is above the upper end of the long-term growth model, which is 8% to 10%. The growth was also, obviously, contributed from the support of the acquisition of Veda. And John will go into a lot of detail on that.
Within International, NPI has been and will continue to be an important growth driver for them. Innovation in International is very broad-based. For instance, in the first quarter, over 60% of new product revenue was driven by our customers' core decisioning activities. The remainder was driven by new solutions for high-value offerings in ID, authentication, Data 360, fraud and debt management.
The relationship with the U.K. government for our debt management services is strong, and the initiative is off to a very good start. We have 5 central government agencies operationalized, including the HMRC, which is, as you recall, the equivalent to our IRS. And this represents most of the debt that has been placed for collections. We have placed over $800 million of debt with various agencies, who are performing the analytics and the collections effort. Our data is fully integrated in the process of segmenting consumer and business accounts to determine which agency is best suited to collect that particular segment.
Revenue in International's 4 largest verticals, which are financial institutions, telcos, government and SMEs, grew a very strong 12% in the quarter, which is very broad-based across verticals and countries. The decisioning platforms, Analytical Services and debt management revenue across International grew a very solid 19% in the quarter. The high-value solutions are deepening our relationship -- our customer relationships and strengthening our competitive position globally. 
Many of you know we delivered very healthy double-digit local currency growth in Latin America for a number of years, and we expect to do so again this year. Although the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso will have a negative impact on our reported results in 2016, it appears that Argentina's new government is moving in the right direction to restore credibility in the financial markets. In fact, I just returned from Argentina to spend some time with our customers, government officials and economists, and the outlook for Argentina in the next 2, 3, 4 years is as strong as I've seen in my 10.5 years here. 
Across the region, in Latin America, we have a very good management team, a very strong market position and our strategy continues to resonate well with our customers.
Finally, the integration of Veda is going very well. Our primary focus at this point is threefold: one, is the thoughtful integration of the backroom processes; two, deploying products and capabilities from around the company that will add value to our local customers; and three, ensuring that all of our customer-facing teams in that region continues to service our customers well.
We continue to expect International to have a strong 2016. Organic revenue growth should be above the upper end of the long-term model, again, which is 8% to 10%, with EBITDA margins improving sequentially throughout the course of the year as planned.
On to Workforce Solutions. They delivered an outstanding 21% revenue growth and over 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in the first quarter. Workforce Solutions continues to grow well above the upper end of our multiyear model of 9% to 11%. That's really being driven through strong execution of their core strategic growth initiatives, which are adding records to the database, a new product innovation, pursuing new growth opportunities in difficult verticals such as automotive, credit card, healthcare and government. The growth continues to be very broad-based across many verticals, penetrating new customers and offering new products.
Demand for our Affordable Care Act solutions, known as ACA, the solutions for employers, continue to be strong. And our current outlook for the year is now ahead of the expectations we stated earlier in the year. And you may recall that those expectations earlier in the year expected very significant growth over 2015, so that strength is getting even stronger as we move through 2016. 
We've also identified other interesting opportunities to help employers with their ACA compliance. That includes things like the IRS forms 1094 and 1095 and even beyond that. Workforce Solutions is emerging as a leader in what can be called compliance as a service to help employers solve increasingly complex compliance matters. A suite of services has expanded, and we continue to look for new opportunities to align our services for these emerging needs. An example that's an emerging need is new regulation coming out around overtime pay changes, and we are looking at leveraging our ACA analytic platform to solve those problems as well.
EWS' NPI Vitality Index is expected to be very strong again this year, reaching approximately 13%. The growth focus this year is on accelerating record growth in the work number database and deepening market penetration in targeted markets, again, such as auto, card and government, and maximizing opportunities to help employers with their compliance needs. Fourth, also continue to solve employer's complex HR compliance challenges. 
Workforce Solutions should have another outstanding year in 2016, with revenue growth well above the long-term range of 9% to 11%. EBITDA margins should be in the high 40s, just shy of a long-term target we gave to you early in the year of 50%.
On to Global Consumer Solutions. They also had an exceptional quarter, with 16% local currency revenue growth and 100 basis points margin -- hundred basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Indirect revenue was up over 50% as the team continues to sign large deals with established companies who seek to deepen and broaden their relationships with consumers.
Our customers and our pipeline is robust across multiple industries, including banking, retail, consumer products and services as well as our expanding relationship that we established last year with Credit Karma. Mid-single-digit revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities was consistent with our expectations and largely driven by higher average revenue per subscriber in the U.S. and account acquisition outside the U.S.
Global Consumer Solutions first quarter performance was outstanding, and we now expect that they too will comfortably exceed their long-term growth target, comfortably delivering double-digit growth for the year, the adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to exceed 30%.
Before I go on to John, let me just give a couple of highlights at the corporate level, and then John will give you the financials.
Our enterprise growth initiatives are off to a very good start this year. Three of our 4 transformational initiatives are: one, developing the work network into a global exchange; two, disrupting innovation by expanding our Cambrian platform throughout our global footprint and; three, unifying our Global Consumer Solutions business with a single-operating platform around the world that we call Renaissance. Let me jump into each of those for a second.
We've already completed the scope and the time line for creating an income and employment verification exchange in a select group of our larger markets. We have a platform, we have strong customer demand and we'll be moving forward with this effort throughout 2016 and beyond.
We are -- the initial focus for globalizing Cambrian will be in Canada, Argentina and Australia. Canada will be the first while other geographies will complete their initial assessment and define their requirements. We'll give you an update on other countries as we exit 2016. But that bodes well for growth opportunities in '17, '18 and beyond. 
Our global IT platform supporting Global Consumer Solutions, again, called Renaissance, is expected to go live this year. After deployment in our core markets in the U.S., Canada and U.K., we'll evaluate other market opportunities, obviously, including Australia and Latin America.
Cambrian has substantially enhanced our ability to provide unique, high-value insights to our customers, and it positions us well for the future. The platform can easily incorporate very contemporary analytic technologies, i.e. machine learning algorithms, analyze all types of unstructured data and provide customers with dashboards customized to their specific needs. 
In fraud, we will apply machine learning algorithms to increase prediction by over 20% by reducing false positives. For Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering, we will incorporate an unstructured data to reduce false positives by approximately 60%.
Four of our largest customers, we're providing them with access to over 50 metrics on over $3 billion trade lines from their customers. We've created a dashboard portal that will be updated on a periodic basis. These types of services uniquely enable us to further deepen our customer relationships and position us as the premier source of insights on their consumers. 
Although in the early year, our new product pipeline for 2016 looks very promising. We expect year 3 revenue from our 2016 launches to be up significantly from 2015 product launches in their 3-year revenue expectation, which, as most of you may recall, 2015 class was up significantly over 2014. Two very solid product classes will fuel growth through 2018. 
Our Lean -- our work with our customers leveraging our operational experience with Lean is creating great client stickiness. The activities we're helping our clients with are numerous and includes such things as mortgage lending, collections, auto lending, marketing and employee onboarding. So again, the activities are far beyond their interaction with us, just trying to make their processes more efficient. 
We've also extended the program to International now and have either completed or have projects in the pipeline in countries such as the U.K. and Canada. We have a number of clients where we have repeat engagements, including 2 where we have had 5 separate engagements at 1 company since 2014.
Increasingly, client leaders are making Equifax a trusted adviser in times of change. With these relationships, we're able to increase utilization of our products and services across the enterprise, identify new customer opportunities we have from the value of our products and services and support and strengthen long-term relationships.
Our broad-based performance continues to position us very nicely to exceed the targets we set for ourselves and have committed to our employees, our customers, shareholders and consumers. We are now adding the second quarter with strong momentum and in many respects, have yet to fully realize the benefit of a number of these strategic initiatives that were expected to make meaningful contributions not only to this year, but again, to 2017 and '18. 
With that, let me turn it over to John for the financials."
175749,330347953,966975,"Equifax Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, we'll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis.As we indicated previously, with the Veda acquisition, we will start focusing on adjusted E",1959,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, we'll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis.
As we indicated previously, with the Veda acquisition, we will start focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and of the company as a whole. Adjusted EBITDA margin has been defined as adjusted net income plus depreciation, net interest expense and taxes. At the segment level, adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted operating income plus depreciation, plus net equity and other income.
Given the change in our reporting structure, this metric will provide an improved understanding of segment performance as well as assessing their progress against our multiyear targets. 
The GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin.
As you will recall, we'll be excluding Veda transaction expenses and integration expenses incurred through 1Q '17, the first year after the Veda acquisition, from our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA margin. In 1Q '16, total Veda transaction and integration pretax expense was about $22 million, virtually all of which was transaction-related. $16 million of these pretax expenses are reflected as operating expense. Of this $16 million, $12 million are investment banking, legal and accounting adviser transaction fees and impact the general corporate expense.
The remainder of the operating expense is acquisition-related employee compensation expenses of Veda, which is included in the International operating segment. Net FX losses related to Veda financing were approximately $6 million in the first quarter and are reflected as other income. As a reminder, we recognize $5 million in FX gains related to Veda financing in 4Q '15. 
Looking forward, the remaining Veda transaction expenses will be incurred in 2Q '16 and should be relatively smaller, principally final legal and financial advisory fees related to completing required government filings and FX losses of approximately $3 million related to completion of the extinguishment of certain Veda debts.
Veda integration expenses will increase in 2Q '16 as integration activities accelerate. Total Veda transaction and integration pretax expenses in 2Q '16 are expected to be approximately $7 million, which includes the $3 million in FX losses.
Now let me turn to the business units’ financial performance for the first quarter.
U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $295 million, up 4% when compared to the first quarter of 2015 and consistent with our expectation. Online Information Solutions’ revenue was $280 million, up 5% when compared to the year-ago period, reflecting double-digit growth in commercial information and fraud. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 1% compared to Q1 2015. 
Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 7% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 1% in the first quarter. USIS total mortgage revenue growth continues to outpace overall mortgage market growth, consistent with our historical performance. Although the mortgage market was slightly better than we anticipated for the quarter, our full year outlook for mortgage origination remains the same as last quarter at flat to down slightly. 
On to Financial Marketing Services in which revenue was $45 million, up 1% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions was a strong 48.7%. As expected, this was down from the very strong 50.8% delivered in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting the very strong mortgage market in 1Q '15. In addition, this decline reflects increased legal expenses versus 1Q '15. Legal expenses incurred in any given period can be choppy. And excluding this increased legal expense, the adjusted EBITDA margin for 1Q '16 would have been down only slightly versus the record levels of 1Q '15.
Workforce Solutions revenue was $180 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $99.2 million, up 16%, was driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and preemployment market segments. This reflects increased penetration with verifiers as well as continued growth in records to the database.
Employer Services revenue of $80.9 million was up 29% from last year. Our traditional Employer Services businesses of unemployment claims, Watsi, I-9 validations and onboarding performed well, with combined revenue growth consistent with our long-term expectations in the mid-single digits. Workforce Analytics had a very strong quarter as 1Q '16 and 2Q '16 represent the first in which employers are providing Form 1095-Cs to employees as part of their annual tax filings and as required by the ACA. As these forms are principally delivering in the first half of the year, we expect the strong growth in Workforce Analytics to continue into 2Q '16. 
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 49.5%, up from 47.3% in 1Q '15. This reflects a very strong growth of our higher-margin verifier and Workforce Analytics businesses.
Revenue from our combined USIS and Workforce Solutions businesses, which represent our total U.S. B2B business activities, was $475 million, representing organic growth of over 10%.
International's revenue was $158 million, up 17% on a reported basis and 30% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth, which excludes Veda revenue, was slightly above our long-term range of 8% to 10%. By region, Europe's revenue was 100 -- was $61 million, up 10% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $43 million, down 11% in U.S. dollars, but up 15% in local currency. 
As you probably know, Argentina's average FX rate in 1Q '16 depreciated almost 40% from 1Q '15. Argentina, when combined with the impact on the currency in Uruguay, contributed almost 75% of the negative foreign exchange impact on revenue in Latin America.
Asia Pacific revenue was $28 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda as well as revenue from NettPositive and our TDX debt management operations in Australia. Our current debt management revenue in Australia is very small. As a reminder, the Veda transaction closed on February 24, with Veda being a part of Equifax for about 40% of the quarter. 
Canada revenue was $28 million, down 10% in U.S. dollars, both flat and local currency. We saw a continuing improvement in Equifax Canada during the second half of 2015, both in terms of revenue growth and, importantly, the pipeline of new products we expect to begin to deliver revenue later in 2016 and 2017.  This flat performance in 1Q '16 reflects the relative weakness of the Canadian economy we referenced in our last earnings call. We expect improved performance as we -- as new products ramp later this year.
For the first quarter, International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3% and, as expected, down slightly from 1Q '15. The slight decline reflects the benefit of adding higher-margin Veda as well as improved EBITDA margin performance in debt management, which was offset by a decline in EBITDA margin in Latin America. This decline in Latin America is due to the substantial weakness of local currencies. A portion of our cost is in U.S. dollars, which does not benefit from the devaluation of the currency. Over the remainder of 2016 in International, we expect to show EBITDA margin growth, reflecting revenue growth in our high-margin countries, coupled with the cost benefit of the regionalization program started last year.
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $95 million, up 14% on a reported basis and up 16% on a local currency basis. Global Personal Solutions showed growth across all channels, B2C indirect and direct, and the strong growth in the quarter driven by -- principally by B2C and, to a lesser extent, our other channels. For the first quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 100 basis points from 1Q '15. This reflects strong revenue growth and leverage against GCS support costs.
In the first quarter, general corporate expense of $71.6 million was in line with our expectations and down 9% from last year. Onetime items impacted both 1Q '16 and 1Q '15. As I mentioned earlier, Veda integration expenses impacted corporate expense by just over $12 million in 1Q '16. As you will remember, in 1Q '15, we executed an organizational restructuring, which impacted corporate expense by $23 million. Excluding these items, general corporate expense was approximately $59 million in 1Q '16, an increase of about $4 million or about 8%.
For the second quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million, including the Veda integration expenses. The adjusted EBITDA margin at 34.2% was down from 34.5% in 2015 and consistent with our expectations for the quarter. The reduction reflects the expected decline in USIS and International that we discussed earlier, partially offset by very strong EBITDA margin performance at both Workforce Solutions and Global Consumer Solutions. We expect to see year-over-year growth in EBITDA margins in each of the second through fourth quarters and continue to expect 2016 EBITDA margins to be up approximately 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%, which was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted effective tax rate, excluding the tax impact of the Veda transaction integration expenses, was 32.7%. This was consistent with the 33% guidance we have provided. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be slightly below this level, approaching 32%.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be at the high end of our long-term range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This reflects expected spending related to the integration of Veda. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $90 million and consistent with our expectations. Operating cash flow was down from 1Q '15 due to working capital movements. We continue to expect strong growth in cash flow year-over-year for 2016.
Total debt in the quarter was $3.08 billion, slightly below our expectations. Yesterday we filed a Form 8-K, with the required Veda financial information as well as a new shelf registration statement, which will give us the flexibility to take advantage of market windows to refinance a portion of the Veda acquisition debt. 
As we indicated last quarter, we will suspend our share repurchases during 2016 and focus our very strong cash flow on debt reduction and returning our leverage to a level consistent with our target leverage. We will, however, continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016, with the goal of delivering 1 to 2 points of additional ongoing revenue growth.
Finally, you'll recall that in our 2016 calendar year guidance, we had indicated that we expect revenue from Veda of USD 220 million to USD 230 million. And that we expected a benefit of Veda to adjusted EPS of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. In addition, when we provided outlook for 1Q '16, we did not include any impact from Veda. As we indicated at that time, once we have completed the initial integration of Veda into our financial statements and had progressed in the transition of Veda to U.S. GAAP accounting, we'll provide an update of these estimates.
Based on the completion of this work to date, we are increasing our full year expectation for EPS accretion to approximately $0.20 per share. Our expectation for revenue in 2016 is now $230 million to $235 million, which reflects improved growth expectations, partially offset by a larger negative impact on revenue recognition from the movement to U.S. GAAP accounting. Veda's performance in 1Q '16 was consistent on a pro rata basis with these expectations. Acquisition amortization in 2016 from the Veda acquisition is expected to be approximately $65 million.
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

As I give you guidance for the second quarter and for the balance of the year, just to clarify, that does not assume any additional M&A at this juncture. So it's, obviously, been the full year of Veda in the numbers plus organic growth. And",394,"Thanks, John. As I give you guidance for the second quarter and for the balance of the year, just to clarify, that does not assume any additional M&A at this juncture. So it's, obviously, been the full year of Veda in the numbers plus organic growth. And as John alluded to in his comments, we are expecting to do additional tuck-in M&A this year. That's just not in the guidance I'm about to give you. I want to make sure that was clear.
For the second quarter, we are increasing our outlook for both revenues and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue, including Veda, to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22%. That's partially offset by 3% of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.34 and $1.36. That's up 17% to 18% over 2015. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 19% to 21%.
With our strong first quarter performance and second quarter -- and outlook for the second quarter, we're also increasing our full year outlook for the year. We expect revenue, including the impact of Veda, to be between $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 17% to 21%. Again, partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. This is up from the previous guidance of $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion and will move us nicely above the high end of a multiyear financial model, a 6% to 8% organic growth. And we also, as we mentioned earlier, expect potential additional growth through acquisitions as the pipeline is strong, but not included in that outlook.
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.15 and $5.25, which is up 14% to 17% year-on-year. Excluding approximately $0.12 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency EPS growth of 17% and 19%. This, too, is up from the $4.95 to $5.05 that we guided to during the fourth quarter earnings call a few months ago. We also continue to expect, as John had mentioned, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to continue to expand by approximately 75 basis points for all of 2016.

I'll jump in and, John, if I miss something, please put an add to it. So one, I'm trying to be very direct in my guidance. When we wrapped up 2015, when I talked about USIS, knowing that 2015 first quarter and really the first couple of months of second quarter were very, very, very strong. I mean, the growth rates for mortgages in 2015 over 2014 in USIS in the first quarter was extremely strong double digit. So we knew there was some headwind there. So when I guided for USIS -- when we guided for USIS, right, I said it would be at the low end, if not below the low end of a multiyear range. So it came in exactly where we expected, and it's largely driven by those comps in mortgage. Business remains very healthy. It's got those first 2 quarters of headwind it's going to have to get through. But the great thing is we've got a great balance across the portfolio. Number two is if you think of NPI, it takes a while to gain momentum. And they started building some momentum late last year, May to mid last year. That momentum is continuing now. So the number of products they have, like the rest of the company, are broad, they’re across many verticals. Obviously, the one we talked about with the investors that will pay big dividends in the second half of the year is the launching of trended data for USIS, and that goes live, as I alluded to, in the third quarter of this year. So automotive continues to be a good market for us in USIS. Everything else I describe as a stable economic environment. And I think John did a great job. When you think of the U.S. business, USIS, we separate 2 entities. We call one EWS; we call the other USIS. If you think about many of the activities that are going on, when you compare ourselves to others in the U.S. marketplace, a fair way to look at it, I think, for you guys is to compare either all of EWS in with USIS or you take the Verification Services and analytics, which is health care, and look at it that way. When you look at it that way, as John said, you're getting double-digit growth. And that's the way we look at the business. We bring all of our products to bear to our customers. And it doesn't matter if it's in analytics for a health care company, if it's a Work Number record or if it's Fraud, Identity management or a credit file. They're all solving problems for customers in the U.S., and that's a strong, healthy double-digit growth."

I'm used to thinking about this business as being countercyclical and typically a slower growth business than the verification business at this point in the cycle. Is this because of the contribution you're now seeing from Workforce Analytics that you're getting this -- a high 20s growth? Or are there other big drivers that would tend to, let's say, modulate the countercyclicality of that business?"

But it's also a change in mindset. We used to always assume that the important business was there to feed records into the verification side and it would be countercyclical. So when unemployment claims rise, that business would grow and -- as it did in 2009, '10. We changed our views there. We've been investing over the years fairly heavily in platforms and capabilities. We changed the mindset of the leadership team there to think of it as a growth business. So what you're getting is clear growth in analytics but also growth in the core non-analytics businesses within employer. Not at the same rate as analytics, but when you put the 2 together, you get really good growth."

But effectively, the drivers were -- our biggest driver was Latin -- in terms of reduction was Latin America. So Latin America because of this really substantial devaluation of currencies, which is much larger than we've seen in the last several years. We saw a margin impact there. It was planned. It was expected to occur. And that is specifically related to the fact that we do have non-local currency expenses and all-local currency revenues so that the margins just don't benefit on both the top and bottom line in the same way. Our Canada margins were slightly down as well because you saw our Canada revenue was flat on a local currency basis, expenses were up slightly. So yes, Canada margin down slightly. But the big driver was Latin America. And the positive side in terms of International margins that partially offset those declines were obviously the adding of Veda because they have very good EBITDA margins. And then also, as Rick mentioned during his prepared comments and after, debt management grew and performed better. We took out some costs and we thought some better performance in overall margins in debt management. So that -- those were the drivers of why you saw basically flat EBITDA margins in International."

And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today at www.equifax.com. 
During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings. 
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS excludes acquisition-related amortization expense as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with earnings release and are also posted on our website. Also refer to the investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick."

Thanks as always for joining us this morning on the call. Our first quarter performance certainly exceeded our expectations and further underscored the strength and the ability of this management team to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed the commitments we made to you, our shareholders. And not only do have an experienced leadership team, but the entire organizational rhythm is geared to the management disciplines that we've created and built together over the last 10 or 11 years. Those disciplines are NPI, enterprise growth initiatives, Lean, growth playbook, account management, et cetera. Let me tell you one thing, this team is hungry and competitive to continue the winning streak that they've been on now for a number of years.
Our first quarter results are noteworthy as they are compared to a very strong performance in the first quarter 2015. 2016 first quarter was a record quarter, which is on top of a record year in 2015. For the quarter, total revenue was $728 million, that was up 12% on a reported basis and up 15% on a local currency basis from the first quarter of 2015. Organic constant currency revenue growth was very strong, up almost 11% over last year. Also in the quarter, foreign exchange created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.2% compared to 34.5% in the first quarter of 2015, and that was in line with our expectations when we guided for the full year during our fourth quarter release. And John will talk about that in detail as will I if you have any questions. Adjusted EPS was $1.23, up 15% from $1.07 last year and significantly above the upper end of our guidance range.
As always, before John gives you the financial details, I'd like to briefly cover some highlights for the first quarter as I always do. I'll talk about the business units specifically first and then transition into some corporate-level highlights. And then John will take the financials.
Starting, obviously, with USIS. They delivered solid 4% revenue growth in the quarter. Double-digit growth in fraud, automotive, commercial and mortgage resellers helped offset slower growth in Mortgage Solutions, which, as you know, last year first quarter, was a really, really strong quarter for us. New product innovation is expected to have significant impact on USIS's future growth. While some of this is being driven by Cambrian, the initiatives at USIS, like the company, are very, very broad-based. 
Our current estimate, sticking with USIS, for 2016's class of new products are expected to have 3-year revenue that is double the estimate of our 2015 class. We'll talk more about NPI at the company level later in my comments, but it's off to a very, very good start for USIS.
Also the pipeline of new products is much more robust than prior years. Our current pipeline is estimated to deliver significantly more revenue -- incremental revenue growth, reflecting both greater market demand and our increasing investments in products.
Cambrian, which you've heard now about for a number of quarters, is having a very positive impact with our customers. Since launching Cambria, our mix of projects has shifted significantly towards multi-data sources and deeper insights for many of our customers' traditional decision activities. Data extraction and analysis time have been reduced by well over 50%. What that allows us to do is fail fast, and as I've talked before, it shortens the cycle time to bring new products to market.
Initial applications have addressed customer needs across diverse verticals, including banking, auto and telecommunications. That's enabling us to leverage our entire customer base with unified technology and skill sets.
Our work with Fannie Mae on trended data is on track and expected to go live as we committed to you earlier in the year and will go live at the end of June, 1st of July of this year. IT integration with Fannie Mae and the ongoing platform for trended data is complete, and our global operations team is in the final stages of establishing their support readiness program, again, anticipating an end of June, early July launch.
USIS is expected to have another strong year in 2016, with growth at the lower end of the long-term range of 5% to 7% despite our continuing expectations for a flat to down mortgage market in 2016. EBITDA margins are expected to be at or above 50% for the year, which is slightly better than what we were expecting as we entered 2016.
On to International. They delivered 30% local currency revenue growth, benefiting from broad-based organic growth, which is above the upper end of the long-term growth model, which is 8% to 10%. The growth was also, obviously, contributed from the support of the acquisition of Veda. And John will go into a lot of detail on that.
Within International, NPI has been and will continue to be an important growth driver for them. Innovation in International is very broad-based. For instance, in the first quarter, over 60% of new product revenue was driven by our customers' core decisioning activities. The remainder was driven by new solutions for high-value offerings in ID, authentication, Data 360, fraud and debt management.
The relationship with the U.K. government for our debt management services is strong, and the initiative is off to a very good start. We have 5 central government agencies operationalized, including the HMRC, which is, as you recall, the equivalent to our IRS. And this represents most of the debt that has been placed for collections. We have placed over $800 million of debt with various agencies, who are performing the analytics and the collections effort. Our data is fully integrated in the process of segmenting consumer and business accounts to determine which agency is best suited to collect that particular segment.
Revenue in International's 4 largest verticals, which are financial institutions, telcos, government and SMEs, grew a very strong 12% in the quarter, which is very broad-based across verticals and countries. The decisioning platforms, Analytical Services and debt management revenue across International grew a very solid 19% in the quarter. The high-value solutions are deepening our relationship -- our customer relationships and strengthening our competitive position globally. 
Many of you know we delivered very healthy double-digit local currency growth in Latin America for a number of years, and we expect to do so again this year. Although the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso will have a negative impact on our reported results in 2016, it appears that Argentina's new government is moving in the right direction to restore credibility in the financial markets. In fact, I just returned from Argentina to spend some time with our customers, government officials and economists, and the outlook for Argentina in the next 2, 3, 4 years is as strong as I've seen in my 10.5 years here. 
Across the region, in Latin America, we have a very good management team, a very strong market position and our strategy continues to resonate well with our customers.
Finally, the integration of Veda is going very well. Our primary focus at this point is threefold: one, is the thoughtful integration of the backroom processes; two, deploying products and capabilities from around the company that will add value to our local customers; and three, ensuring that all of our customer-facing teams in that region continues to service our customers well.
We continue to expect International to have a strong 2016. Organic revenue growth should be above the upper end of the long-term model, again, which is 8% to 10%, with EBITDA margins improving sequentially throughout the course of the year as planned.
On to Workforce Solutions. They delivered an outstanding 21% revenue growth and over 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in the first quarter. Workforce Solutions continues to grow well above the upper end of our multiyear model of 9% to 11%. That's really being driven through strong execution of their core strategic growth initiatives, which are adding records to the database, a new product innovation, pursuing new growth opportunities in difficult verticals such as automotive, credit card, healthcare and government. The growth continues to be very broad-based across many verticals, penetrating new customers and offering new products.
Demand for our Affordable Care Act solutions, known as ACA, the solutions for employers, continue to be strong. And our current outlook for the year is now ahead of the expectations we stated earlier in the year. And you may recall that those expectations earlier in the year expected very significant growth over 2015, so that strength is getting even stronger as we move through 2016. 
We've also identified other interesting opportunities to help employers with their ACA compliance. That includes things like the IRS forms 1094 and 1095 and even beyond that. Workforce Solutions is emerging as a leader in what can be called compliance as a service to help employers solve increasingly complex compliance matters. A suite of services has expanded, and we continue to look for new opportunities to align our services for these emerging needs. An example that's an emerging need is new regulation coming out around overtime pay changes, and we are looking at leveraging our ACA analytic platform to solve those problems as well.
EWS' NPI Vitality Index is expected to be very strong again this year, reaching approximately 13%. The growth focus this year is on accelerating record growth in the work number database and deepening market penetration in targeted markets, again, such as auto, card and government, and maximizing opportunities to help employers with their compliance needs. Fourth, also continue to solve employer's complex HR compliance challenges. 
Workforce Solutions should have another outstanding year in 2016, with revenue growth well above the long-term range of 9% to 11%. EBITDA margins should be in the high 40s, just shy of a long-term target we gave to you early in the year of 50%.
On to Global Consumer Solutions. They also had an exceptional quarter, with 16% local currency revenue growth and 100 basis points margin -- hundred basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Indirect revenue was up over 50% as the team continues to sign large deals with established companies who seek to deepen and broaden their relationships with consumers.
Our customers and our pipeline is robust across multiple industries, including banking, retail, consumer products and services as well as our expanding relationship that we established last year with Credit Karma. Mid-single-digit revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities was consistent with our expectations and largely driven by higher average revenue per subscriber in the U.S. and account acquisition outside the U.S.
Global Consumer Solutions first quarter performance was outstanding, and we now expect that they too will comfortably exceed their long-term growth target, comfortably delivering double-digit growth for the year, the adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to exceed 30%.
Before I go on to John, let me just give a couple of highlights at the corporate level, and then John will give you the financials.
Our enterprise growth initiatives are off to a very good start this year. 3 of our 4 transformational initiatives are: one, developing the work network into a global exchange; two, disrupting innovation by expanding our Cambrian platform throughout our global footprint and; three, unifying our Global Consumer Solutions business with a single-operating platform around the world that we call Renaissance. Let me jump into each of those for a second.
We've already completed the scope and the time line for creating an income and employment verification exchange in a select group of our larger markets. We have a platform, we have strong customer demand and we'll be moving forward with this effort throughout 2016 and beyond.
We are -- the initial focus for globalizing Cambrian will be in Canada, Argentina and Australia. Canada will be the first while other geographies will complete their initial assessment and define their requirements. We'll give you an update on other countries as we exit 2016. But that bodes well for growth opportunities in '17, '18 and beyond. 
Our global IT platform supporting Global Consumer Solutions, again, called Renaissance, is expected to go live this year. After deployment in our core markets in the U.S., Canada and U.K., we'll evaluate other market opportunities, obviously, including Australia and Latin America.
Cambrian has substantially enhanced our ability to provide unique, high-value insights to our customers, and it positions us well for the future. The platform can easily incorporate very contemporary analytic technologies, i.e. machine learning algorithms, analyze all types of unstructured data and provide customers with dashboards customized to their specific needs. 
In fraud, we will apply machine learning algorithms to increase prediction by over 20% by reducing false positives. For Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering, we will incorporate an unstructured data to reduce false positives by approximately 60%.
Four of our largest customers, we're providing them with access to over 50 metrics on over $3 billion trade lines from their customers. We've created a dashboard portal that will be updated on a periodic basis. These types of services uniquely enable us to further deepen our customer relationships and position us as the premier source of insights on their consumers. 
Although in the early year, our new product pipeline for 2016 looks very promising. We expect year 3 revenue from our 2016 launches to be up significantly from 2015 product launches in their 3-year revenue expectation, which, as most of you may recall, 2015 class was up significantly over 2014. Two very solid product classes will fuel growth through 2018. 
Our Lean -- our work with our customers leveraging our operational experience with Lean is creating great client stickiness. The activities we're helping our clients with are numerous and includes such things as mortgage lending, collections, auto lending, marketing and employee onboarding. So again, the activities are far beyond their interaction with us, just trying to make their processes more efficient. 
We've also extended the program to International now and have either completed or have projects in the pipeline in countries such as the U.K. and Canada. We have a number of clients where we have repeat engagements, including 2 where we have had 5 separate engagements at 1 company since 2014.
Increasingly, client leaders are making Equifax a trusted adviser in times of change. With these relationships, we're able to increase utilization of our products and services across the enterprise, identify new customer opportunities we have from the value of our products and services and support and strengthen long-term relationships.
Our broad-based performance continues to position us very nicely to exceed the targets we set for ourselves and have committed to our employees, our customers, shareholders and consumers. We are now adding the second quarter with strong momentum and in many respects, have yet to fully realize the benefit of a number of these strategic initiatives that were expected to make meaningful contributions not only to this year, but again, to 2017 and '18. 
With that, let me turn it over to John for the financials."
175749,330347953,968526,"Equifax Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, we'll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis.As we indicated previously, with the Veda acquisition, we will start focusing on adjusted E",1959,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, we'll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis.
As we indicated previously, with the Veda acquisition, we will start focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and of the company as a whole. Adjusted EBITDA margin has been defined as adjusted net income plus depreciation, net interest expense and taxes. At the segment level, adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted operating income plus depreciation, plus net equity and other income.
Given the change in our reporting structure, this metric will provide an improved understanding of segment performance as well as assessing their progress against our multiyear targets. 
The GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin.
As you will recall, we'll be excluding Veda transaction expenses and integration expenses incurred through 1Q '17, the first year after the Veda acquisition, from our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA margin. In 1Q '16, total Veda transaction and integration pretax expense was about $22 million, virtually all of which was transaction-related. $16 million of these pretax expenses are reflected as operating expense. Of this $16 million, $12 million are investment banking, legal and accounting adviser transaction fees and impact the general corporate expense.
The remainder of the operating expense is acquisition-related employee compensation expenses of Veda, which is included in the International operating segment. Net FX losses related to Veda financing were approximately $6 million in the first quarter and are reflected as other income. As a reminder, we recognize $5 million in FX gains related to Veda financing in 4Q '15. 
Looking forward, the remaining Veda transaction expenses will be incurred in 2Q '16 and should be relatively smaller, principally final legal and financial advisory fees related to completing required government filings and FX losses of approximately $3 million related to completion of the extinguishment of certain Veda debts.
Veda integration expenses will increase in 2Q '16 as integration activities accelerate. Total Veda transaction and integration pretax expenses in 2Q '16 are expected to be approximately $7 million, which includes the $3 million in FX losses.
Now let me turn to the business units’ financial performance for the first quarter.
U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $295 million, up 4% when compared to the first quarter of 2015 and consistent with our expectation. Online Information Solutions’ revenue was $280 million, up 5% when compared to the year-ago period, reflecting double-digit growth in commercial information and fraud. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 1% compared to Q1 2015. 
Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 7% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 1% in the first quarter. USIS total mortgage revenue growth continues to outpace overall mortgage market growth, consistent with our historical performance. Although the mortgage market was slightly better than we anticipated for the quarter, our full year outlook for mortgage origination remains the same as last quarter at flat to down slightly. 
On to Financial Marketing Services in which revenue was $45 million, up 1% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions was a strong 48.7%. As expected, this was down from the very strong 50.8% delivered in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting the very strong mortgage market in 1Q '15. In addition, this decline reflects increased legal expenses versus 1Q '15. Legal expenses incurred in any given period can be choppy. And excluding this increased legal expense, the adjusted EBITDA margin for 1Q '16 would have been down only slightly versus the record levels of 1Q '15.
Workforce Solutions revenue was $180 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $99.2 million, up 16%, was driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and preemployment market segments. This reflects increased penetration with verifiers as well as continued growth in records to the database.
Employer Services revenue of $80.9 million was up 29% from last year. Our traditional Employer Services businesses of unemployment claims, Watsi, I-9 validations and onboarding performed well, with combined revenue growth consistent with our long-term expectations in the mid-single digits. Workforce Analytics had a very strong quarter as 1Q '16 and 2Q '16 represent the first in which employers are providing Form 1095-Cs to employees as part of their annual tax filings and as required by the ACA. As these forms are principally delivering in the first half of the year, we expect the strong growth in Workforce Analytics to continue into 2Q '16. 
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 49.5%, up from 47.3% in 1Q '15. This reflects a very strong growth of our higher-margin verifier and Workforce Analytics businesses.
Revenue from our combined USIS and Workforce Solutions businesses, which represent our total U.S. B2B business activities, was $475 million, representing organic growth of over 10%.
International's revenue was $158 million, up 17% on a reported basis and 30% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth, which excludes Veda revenue, was slightly above our long-term range of 8% to 10%. By region, Europe's revenue was 100 -- was $61 million, up 10% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $43 million, down 11% in U.S. dollars, but up 15% in local currency. 
As you probably know, Argentina's average FX rate in 1Q '16 depreciated almost 40% from 1Q '15. Argentina, when combined with the impact on the currency in Uruguay, contributed almost 75% of the negative foreign exchange impact on revenue in Latin America.
Asia Pacific revenue was $28 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda as well as revenue from NettPositive and our TDX debt management operations in Australia. Our current debt management revenue in Australia is very small. As a reminder, the Veda transaction closed on February 24, with Veda being a part of Equifax for about 40% of the quarter. 
Canada revenue was $28 million, down 10% in U.S. dollars, both flat and local currency. We saw a continuing improvement in Equifax Canada during the second half of 2015, both in terms of revenue growth and, importantly, the pipeline of new products we expect to begin to deliver revenue later in 2016 and 2017. This flat performance in 1Q '16 reflects the relative weakness of the Canadian economy we referenced in our last earnings call. We expect improved performance as we -- as new products ramp later this year.
For the first quarter, International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3% and, as expected, down slightly from 1Q '15. The slight decline reflects the benefit of adding higher-margin Veda as well as improved EBITDA margin performance in debt management, which was offset by a decline in EBITDA margin in Latin America. This decline in Latin America is due to the substantial weakness of local currencies. A portion of our cost is in U.S. dollars, which does not benefit from the devaluation of the currency. Over the remainder of 2016 in International, we expect to show EBITDA margin growth, reflecting revenue growth in our high-margin countries, coupled with the cost benefit of the regionalization program started last year.
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $95 million, up 14% on a reported basis and up 16% on a local currency basis. Global Personal Solutions showed growth across all channels, B2C indirect and direct, and the strong growth in the quarter driven by -- principally by B2C and, to a lesser extent, our other channels. For the first quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 100 basis points from 1Q '15. This reflects strong revenue growth and leverage against GCS support costs.
In the first quarter, general corporate expense of $71.6 million was in line with our expectations and down 9% from last year. Onetime items impacted both 1Q '16 and 1Q '15. As I mentioned earlier, Veda integration expenses impacted corporate expense by just over $12 million in 1Q '16. As you will remember, in 1Q '15, we executed an organizational restructuring, which impacted corporate expense by $23 million. Excluding these items, general corporate expense was approximately $59 million in 1Q '16, an increase of about $4 million or about 8%.
For the second quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million, including the Veda integration expenses. The adjusted EBITDA margin at 34.2% was down from 34.5% in 2015 and consistent with our expectations for the quarter. The reduction reflects the expected decline in USIS and International that we discussed earlier, partially offset by very strong EBITDA margin performance at both Workforce Solutions and Global Consumer Solutions. We expect to see year-over-year growth in EBITDA margins in each of the second through fourth quarters and continue to expect 2016 EBITDA margins to be up approximately 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%, which was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted effective tax rate, excluding the tax impact of the Veda transaction integration expenses, was 32.7%. This was consistent with the 33% guidance we have provided. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be slightly below this level, approaching 32%.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be at the high end of our long-term range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This reflects expected spending related to the integration of Veda. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $90 million and consistent with our expectations. Operating cash flow was down from 1Q '15 due to working capital movements. We continue to expect strong growth in cash flow year-over-year for 2016.
Total debt in the quarter was $3.08 billion, slightly below our expectations. Yesterday we filed a Form 8-K, with the required Veda financial information as well as a new shelf registration statement, which will give us the flexibility to take advantage of market windows to refinance a portion of the Veda acquisition debt. 
As we indicated last quarter, we will suspend our share repurchases during 2016 and focus our very strong cash flow on debt reduction and returning our leverage to a level consistent with our target leverage. We will, however, continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016, with the goal of delivering 1 to 2 points of additional ongoing revenue growth.
Finally, you'll recall that in our 2016 calendar year guidance, we had indicated that we expect revenue from Veda of USD 220 million to USD 230 million. And that we expected a benefit of Veda to adjusted EPS of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. In addition, when we provided outlook for 1Q '16, we did not include any impact from Veda. As we indicated at that time, once we have completed the initial integration of Veda into our financial statements and had progressed in the transition of Veda to U.S. GAAP accounting, we'll provide an update of these estimates.
Based on the completion of this work to date, we are increasing our full year expectation for EPS accretion to approximately $0.20 per share. Our expectation for revenue in 2016 is now $230 million to $235 million, which reflects improved growth expectations, partially offset by a larger negative impact on revenue recognition from the movement to U.S. GAAP accounting. Veda's performance in 1Q '16 was consistent on a pro rata basis with these expectations. Acquisition amortization in 2016 from the Veda acquisition is expected to be approximately $65 million.
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

As I give you guidance for the second quarter and for the balance of the year, just to clarify, that does not assume any additional M&A at this juncture. So it's, obviously, been the full year of Veda in the numbers plus organic growth. And as John alluded to in his comments, we are expecting to do additional tuck-in M&A this year. That's just not in the guidance I'm about to give you. I want to make sure that was clear.
For the second quarter, we are increasing our outlook for both revenues and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue, including Veda, to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22%. That's partially offset by 3% of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.34 and $1.36. That's up 17% to 18% over 2015. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 19% to 21%.
With our strong first quarter performance and second quarter -- and outlook for the second quarter, we're also increasing our full year outlook for the year. We expect revenue, including the impact of Veda, to be between $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 17% to 21%. Again, partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. This is up from the previous guidance of $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion and will move us nicely above the high end of a multiyear financial model, a 6% to 8% organic growth. And we also, as we mentioned earlier, expect potential additional growth through acquisitions as the pipeline is strong, but not included in that outlook.
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.15 and $5.25, which is up 14% to 17% year-on-year. Excluding approximately $0.12 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency EPS growth of 17% and 19%. This, too, is up from the $4.95 to $5.05 that we guided to during the fourth quarter earnings call a few months ago. We also continue to expect, as John had mentioned, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to continue to expand by approximately 75 basis points for all of 2016.
So with that, operator, I'd like to open up for any questions we may have from our audience."

I'll jump in and, John, if I miss something, please put an add to it. So one, I'm trying to be very direct in my guidance. When we wrapped up 2015, when I talked about USIS, knowing that 2015 first quarter and really the first couple of months of second quarter were very, very, very strong. I mean, the growth rates for mortgages in 2015 over 2014 in USIS in the first quarter was extremely strong double digit. So we knew there was some headwind there. So when I guided for USIS -- when we guided for USIS, right, I said it would be at the low end, if not below the low end of a multiyear range. So it came in exactly where we expected, and it's largely driven by those comps in mortgage. Business remains very healthy. It's got those first 2 quarters of headwind it's going to have to get through. But the great thing is we've got a great balance across the portfolio. Number two is if you think of NPI, it takes a while to gain momentum. And they started building some momentum late last year, May to mid-last year. That momentum is continuing now. So the number of products they have, like the rest of the company, are broad, they’re across many verticals. Obviously, the one we talked about with the investors that will pay big dividends in the second half of the year is the launching of trended data for USIS, and that goes live, as I alluded to, in the third quarter of this year. So automotive continues to be a good market for us in USIS. Everything else I describe as a stable economic environment. And I think John did a great job. When you think of the U.S. business, USIS, we separate 2 entities. We call one EWS; we call the other USIS. If you think about many of the activities that are going on, when you compare ourselves to others in the U.S. marketplace, a fair way to look at it, I think, for you guys is to compare either all of EWS in with USIS or you take the Verification Services and analytics, which is health care, and look at it that way. When you look at it that way, as John said, you're getting double-digit growth. And that's the way we look at the business. We bring all of our products to bear to our customers. And it doesn't matter if it's in analytics for a health care company, if it's a Work Number record or if it's Fraud, Identity management or a credit file. They're all solving problems for customers in the U.S., and that's a strong, healthy double-digit growth."

When we launched, as you'll recall, NPI 2.0 maybe 2 years ago, we kind of revamped the enthusiasm and the approach towards NPI. It was clearly not paying dividends. As you get other -- more business units into the game in a broader way. We've talked that USIS is now ramping up. We've talked about Canada ramping up in NPI. And lastly, you can't ignore the fact that the technology platforms we've invested in that facilitate the ability to build products faster with Cambrian, building platforms like TotalView, which allow our customers to consume multiple products quicker, so the combination -- maturation of NPI 2.0 plus the technology platforms of Cambrian and TotalView that we've invested in are all facilitating an unbelievable strength in innovation around the world."

We're expecting to see also continued improved performance in Europe as we move through the year. So generally speaking, the continued good revenue performance in International, which we've had for multiple years, we think is going to drive some improved performance in EBITDA margin. As well as, we're expecting cost performance improvements because of the regionalizations we started last year and we've been talking about for the past year."

During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax's business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the second quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Veda.
These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and our also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.

The second quarter performance continued to reflect outstanding execution across our business units, our verticals and our countries around the world. The team has developed good momentum which will carry us nicely through the remainder of the year and into 2017. Also, our Veda team has continued to deliver a performance that attracted us to the company, and they fully embraced the integration strategy, I'll give you more on that in a moment.
I'm optimistic about the opportunities that the Australia and Southeast Asian business will generate for us not just this year, but into the future.
For the quarter, total revenue was $811 million, up 20% on a reported basis and up 22% on local currency basis from the second quarter of 2015. Organic and constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first quarter, up very strong at 12%. Also, for the quarter, FX created a $17 million of year-over-year headwind. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.6% compared to 35% in the second quarter of 2015, a very solid year-on-year increase.
Adjusted EPS was $1.43, up 24% from $1.15 last year, and better than our expectations when we guided back in April.
I'll now go into some of the individual businesses, starting with USIS. A 3% revenue growth in the quarter, driven largely by mortgage originations, credit marketing activities, commercial information services and our fraud solutions with an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 50%.
Trended data from mortgage industry is expected to go live on September 24. We've been delivering trended data to our customers since April of this year, so they could develop familiarity with the content and better understand the value to their underwriting processes. And we've already signed agreements with 3 of the largest mortgage resellers and we'll start billing for these services in August of this year.
Revenue from our credit marketing services product offerings grew up single digits, driven by double-digit growth in both prescreen and portfolio review offerings. We believe that the majority of these project were focused on new account acquisitions and cross-selling. The growth was also broad-based across all of our major verticals.
The team continues to make very good progress on our commercial information database and solutions. We've been operating under numerous extensions of our agreement with the small business financial exchange. We've been developing an alternative database, which we call the Commercial Financial Network. We currently have over 1,200 institutions providing data for the database, including some of the largest financial institutions. And once again, our commercial business delivered double-digit growth for the quarter.
Our fraud solutions revenue was primarily driven by customer needs to authenticate consumer identity to online access. Growth was broad-based, including financial services, telco, government and our direct-to-consumer resellers.
Year-to-date, new product revenue for USIS is ahead of our expectation, driven mostly by nonmortgage-related products. And as you know, once the NPI pipeline up and running, that bodes well for the next 3 years.
We continued to expect USIS to deliver growth in the full year at the lower end of the long-term range of 5% to 7%. This is the range that we guided to for USIS back in February. EBITDA margins are expected to be above 50% for the year, which is slightly better than we were expecting when we give you guidance during the first quarter earnings call.
And on to international. International delivered outstanding 13% local currency organic revenue growth, as well above the upper end of the long-term range growth model we've talked about, which is 8 -- 10%. This is driven by broad based organic initiatives. Total local currency revenue growth of 62% reflects this strong organic growth and the full quarter of revenues from Veda.
Organic revenue growth in international's 4 largest verticals, which are financial institutions, telcos, government and auto, accelerated to 18% growth in the quarter, up from 13% growth in the first quarter versus first quarter of a year ago.
International platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew a solid 25% in the quarter, up from 19% in the first quarter, so again, accelerating growth sequentially. Our focus on delivering powerful insights continues to open new opportunities to help our customers operate their businesses more efficiently and effectively.
In the U.K., our customer management solutions, including loyal customer, have enhanced our competitive position and enabled us to continue winning share within the financial institutions.
Our U.K. government contract through TDX is performing well and in line with our expectations. Initial collections results and anticipated lift are consistent with our original expectations, and relationships with the departments and the Cabinet office remain very strong. We have also made proposals to other government agencies within the U.K. who are not included in the initial launch.
While still early, we do not expect Brexit to have any material impact on TALX or the U.K. government initiative. 
On to Canada. Canada has made great progress on extending our credit data capabilities into the markets. And the customers interest with both large banks and financial institutions has been very strong. Also in Canada, I think we've alluded to this a bit last call, we have recently landed a multi-year multimillion dollar deal to provide the TDX analytics solutions to one of our largest customers in Canada and that relationship started billing earlier this month.
We are excited about the opportunities in Australia to deliver solid long-term growth for the region. The integration really is going very, very well. To date, there have not been any surprises. The teams in both Australia and New Zealand are embracing the integration initiatives at all levels of their respective organizations. 
During the second quarter, we began the implementation of our global platforms in Australia, those including fraud management analytics, which were Cambrian and CAD technology. These are very important strategic platforms which we have been investing in for many years. These are best-in-class platforms and will provide Veda and our teams down there with tremendous capabilities to develop new products for their markets and customers who used to come. We have also identified a number of opportunities with Veda to both import and export new product ideas from that part of the world to other parts of the world and vice versa. 
Finally, the financial performance to date has met all of our expectations and is on track to beat our full year expectations.
International as a whole will have a very strong year 2016. We expect organic constant currency revenue growth will be above the upper end of the long-term model range of 8% to 10% and total growth for 2016 to be over 40% when you include Veda. EBITDA margins should exit the year comfortably above the second quarter level, which is up nicely, as you know, versus second quarter of a year ago.
On to the Workforce Solutions. They had another outstanding performance in the quarter with a 21% revenue growth and a 480 basis point expansion in their EBITDA margin. We continued to have records on the workforce create valuable insights for our customers. Our success in penetrating key verticals led to strong double-digit growth in auto, consumer finance, government, mortgage, preemployment and cars. Now for the healthcare vertical, which is comprised of our income and verification for CMS and ACA analytics for employers, grew almost 200% in the quarter and continues to look very promising going forward.
Within our suite of compliant center solutions, we've ed develop new series to help employers with the appeal management process under the Affordable Care Act. Employers can avoid penalties if they can prove to CMS that their employees were offered conforming affordable care coverage for those employees who applied and were approved for self-subsidies covered through the ACA exchange. 
During the quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Barnett Associates with EWS. The company we've known for a long time. This company with over 33 years of experience and is a nice tuck-in acquisition for EWS. We expect this acquisition to close during the current quarter.
Workforce Solutions. In summary, we'll have another outstanding year in 2016, with revenue growth substantially above the long-term range of 9% to 11% and adjusted EBITDA margins now in the high 40% range, just an outstanding strain of growth these guys have been on.
On to  -- We were used the word PSOL and our global consumer solutions. They delivered 22% local currency revenue growth, driven largely by our indirect retailer customers and also that solid adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter. Indirect and resale revenue was up over 70%, primarily driven by our relationships with Credit Karma and Life Lock. Our direct to consumer activities continued to deliver revenue and margin consistent with our expectations. And global consumer solutions will easily exceed their long-term growth target, comfortably delivering strong double-digit growth for the year. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to exceed 30%. And when John goes into his discussion, he will about margin in GCS in the second quarter to put some color and texture on that for you.
Back now to the corporate growth initiatives that you've grown familiar with. 
First is EGI, Enterprise Growth Initiatives, which you know we've been out for 7 years now. They're fundamental growth driver to our multi-year levers. This year, we have 8 initiatives in the EGI with very specific metrics and milestones with the management team of use, at least on a monthly basis, every 6 months, we are -- after 6 months, we are projecting the full year revenue from these 8 very important growth initiatives to now come in over 33% above the target we had set at the beginning of the year. That team just continues to execute at very high level.
Cambrian. You've heard us talk about that. It's truly have an amazing impact on how both we and our customers think about the effectiveness of our respective decisioning activities. For customers who are developing tools, they enabling them to increase approval rates while maintaining overall portfolio loss rates. By incorporating more data than just the credit data, we can expand the universe with applicants on which they can render decisions with competence. Both of which improve marketing effectiveness and contribute incrementally to the revenue growth with very modest to no increase in expenses for our customers.
And certainly, for Equifax, we use Cambrian to help us better understand the depth and quality of our data assets. With in Equifax, we can identify opportunities to broaden and enhance our data analysis, as well as specific steps to further improve the quality of our data.
On to NPI. New Product Innovation is also making strong contributions once again to our revenue growth. Through June, revenue from these initiatives is running 10% ahead of our expectations for 2016. You might recall that our expectations for third[ph] year revenue for our 2016 new product launches was already 130% greater than the 2015 launches third year revenue expectations. So we had come into the year with very high expectations when we classify some 2016, and it's already running at least 10% ahead of those expectations. 
International Workforce Solutions and USIS are all exceeding expectations, with the majority of the USIS growth coming from nonmortgage solutions when you think of new products. The pipeline is healthy. And we have a number of new launches scheduled for the second half of the year and expect to that to spur revenue growth in 2017 and beyond.
Our outlook for the mortgage market in the U.S. has changed given the recent trends in the yield on 10-year notes and the resulting strength in the refi activity. Previously, we expected mortgage originations for 2016 to be flat to slightly down. Our current view is that the mortgage originations will be in the range of now flat to up mid single digits for the full year. And that assumes that the 10-year treasury stays in the general range that they are now. Obviously, if they get weaker, that gives us some tailwind. If they rise at fast rate than anticipated, that might create some tailwind or headwind at the back end of the year.
Over the years, our annual growth playbook process has evolved to ensure we maintain an intense focus on the most critical opportunities that drive revenue growth. This year, we've completed, it's hard to believe, our 11th growth playbook. And with a focus on individual enterprisewide, vertical market growth playbooks develop much deeper insights into our opportunities across all of our business units. With these new playbooks, we can better leverage our resources, customer relationships and opportunities to capture incremental revenue growth going forward.
In summary, before I turn it over to John here, our strategic initiatives are at or ahead of what we have expected as we enter the year. My optimism for both 2016 and '17 continues to improve as the year unfolds. 
One comment I want to make, I'll spend a minute on before I give it to John is to put our USIS growth in perspective. A number of you have had an your early read last night, I want to make sure you understand how I think about that. 
We view our enterprisewide vertical market distribution efforts. You've heard us talk about that for a number of years now in the U.S. As a vital to our differentiation and our success in the U.S. marketplace. These vertical markets cut across our U.S. business units, so it's not just credit. So a good way to think about the health of our U.S. credit business is we combine, as we do, our USIS business with our Verification Services business, and as you know, besides in EWS, in our healthcare revenues, also residing in U.S. -- or in EWS. When you think about the enterprise of products we're bringing to the U.S. market, our revenue for the quarter actually grew a very solid 10%, well above the overall growth in our economy. And that's largely driven by, as you know, New Product Innovation, market penetration and insights. 
Let me talk more about that during the Q&A. With that, I'll turn it over to John for the performance summary."
175749,369858956,1015116,"Equifax Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone.

As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. As a reminder, following the Veda acquisition, we started focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and the company as a whole. The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin.
Now let me turn to the business units financial performance for the second quarter. 
U.S. Information Solutions revenue Was $308 million, up 3% when compared to the second quarter 2015. Online Information Solutions revenue was $220 million, up 2% when compared to the year ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 13% in the quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index accelerated late in the quarter coincident with the drop in the 10-year treasury ending the quarter of 20%. Revenue mix shifted significant, in the quarter with almost 60% of USIS mortgage revenue coming through resellers where revenue grew 22%.
Financial Marketing Services revenue was $53 million, up 7% when compared to the year-ago quarter. Our Commercial business continues to grow nicely, up 10% in 2Q and year-to-date. 
Identity and Fraud Solutions also continued to grow strongly, up 20% in 2Q and 25% year-to-date. 
As you recall, in 4Q '15, we realigned our business units, moving revenue with customers that have only direct-to-consumer relationships with Equifax from USIS to Global Consumer. During this realignment, customers with broader relationships with Equifax, including direct-to-consumer, principally other credit reporting agency, were retained by USIS. USIS revenue in 2Q '16 and first half '16 has been negatively impacted by declines in revenues from these retained direct-to-consumer customers by about 2 percentage points. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions for 2Q '16 was a very strong 50.4% and up from the 50.1% we had in the second quarter of 2015.
Workforce Solutions revenue was $177 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Verification Services revenue of $110 million, up 17%, continues to be driven by a strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto, preemployment and card segments. 
Employer Services revenue of $67 million was up 29% from last year. Again, the traditional employer service businesses of unemployment claims, I-9 validations and on boarding performed well, with combined revenue growth consistent with our long-term expectations of mid-single digits. 
Workforce Analytics, which provide services to employers to ensure they are in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, grew several hundred percent in 2Q '16. Seasonally, the first half of the year was the highest revenue for Workforce Analytic. This is the period in which employers are required to provide form 1095-C[ph] to employees, a service that Equifax provides. 
Employer Services revenue in 3Q '16 is expected to grow double digits, but will not be as strong as first half '16, reflecting the seasonal nature of Workforce Analytics revenue.
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 50.2%, up from 45.4% in 2Q '15. Seasonally, Workforce Solutions has higher adjusted EBITDA margins in the first half, reflecting seasonality in both and Workforce Analytics. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Workforce Solutions in 3Q '16 are expected to be up strongly year-to-year, but down sequentially due to the seasonality.
Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions, our total U.S. B2B revenue, was $485 million, representing organic growth exceeding 9%.
International's revenue was $219 million, up over 50% on a reported basis and over 60% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth, which excludes Veda revenue, was nicely above our long-term range of 8% to 10%.
By region, Europe's revenue was $67 million, up 12% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Given the sharp decline in the British pound following the Brexit vote, we anticipate that 3Q '16 Europe revenue measured in U.S. dollars will be negatively impacted by FX by approximately 10%.
Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 8% in U.S. dollars, but up 14% in local currency. The depreciation of the Argentinian peso that occurred in Q4 of last year represented almost 75% of the FX impacts in Latin America. 
Asia-Pacific revenue was $72 million, which was comprised mostly of revenue from Veda.
Canada revenue was $32 million, flat in U.S. dollars, but up 5% in local currency. This was a nice growth for Canada and reflects the renewed focus on NPI in Canada we referenced last quarter. 
For the second quarter, International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 25.9% in 2Q '15. We saw a nice growth in the adjusted EBITDA margins in Canada and Europe, as well as benefiting from a full quarter's EBITDA contribution from Veda in Asia-Pacific.
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $107 million, up 21% on a reported basis and 22% on a local currency basis. Growth was driven by our direct to consumer reseller customers. For the second quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%, down from 30.6% in 2Q '15. During the second quarter, we have program-related revenue and startup expenses associated with the launching of a relationship with a new B2C customer. Both these program revenue and the startup expenses will not continue into 3Q. As a result, revenue growth in 3Q is still expected to be double-digit, but will be below the level generated in 2Q. Also, as a result, adjusted EBITDA margin will improve significantly in the third quarter and for the remainder of the year.
In the second quarter, general corporate expense was $46 million. Excluding Veda integration expense, 2Q '16 general corporate expense was $44 million. 2Q '16 was down from 1Q '16, as in the first quarter, executive equity comp was issued with the bulk of that expense in the period. 2Q '16 corporate expense was lower than expected, as total employee bonuses accrued in the period were as expected, but more the bonuses were incurred in the business units than in corporate. Also, some corporate investments expected to be incurred in 2Q '16 were delayed. With the third and fourth quarters, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million, reflecting higher levels of corporate investments. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin for Equifax was 36.6%, up from 35% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins in 2Q '16 reflects the very strong adjusted EBITDA margins in Workforce Solutions, International and USIS, as well as lower corporate expenses. We expect that 3Q '16 EBITDA margin to decrease Sequentially, but increase year-to-year at a rate slightly lower than our expectations for full year improvement. We expect our full year 2016 EBITDA margin to be up about 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34%, which was slightly above our expectations due to unfavorable discrete items. Our expectations is that the full year 2016 effective tax rate will be just under 33%, consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year. In the third quarter, the effective tax rate will be below the full year rate.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $43 million and year-to-date are $83 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be at approximately 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range, reflecting investments made related to Veda integration. 
Year-to-date, operating cash flow remains strong at $280 million and consistent with our expectations. The slight decline from first half '15 was principally due to changes in working capital.
Total debt in the quarter was $2.95 billion. During the quarter, we issued $775 million of 5 and 10-year notes that refinanced the 364-day credit facility used to finance the acquisition of Veda.
As we indicated last quarter, we have suspended our share repurchase program and we will focus on debt reduction until we return credit metrics to a level consistent with our current credit ratings. We are contending with acquisitions, and in the quarter, announced acquisition of Barnet Associates, as rick referenced earlier. With regards to the Veda acquisition, integration continues to go well, and we continued to expect 2016 revenue from Veda to be $230 million to $235 million, with adjusted EPS accretion from Veda at approximately $0.20 a share.
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

A quick summary before we go to Q&A. It's the guidance looking forward. 
For the third quarter, we're increasing our outlook for both revenue and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth between 22% and 24%, which is partially offset by 3 points of FX headwind.
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.33 and $1.36 for the quarter, which is up 17% to 19%. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency EPS growth for the third quarter of 19% to 22%.
With our strong second quarter performance and our outlook -- strong outlook for the third quarter, we are also increasing our full year outlook. 
For the full year, we expect revenue to now be between $3.13 billion and $3.16 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22%, partially offset again by 3 points of FX headwind. This is an improvement from the previous guidance we provided you, which was $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion, and increases our confidence that we will end the year nicely above the high end of a multi-year model of 6% to 8% of organic revenue growth.
From a revenue perspective, 2016, I think you'll agree it's shaping up nicely. Constant currency organic revenue growth of 11% in the third quarter -- first quarter, accelerated to 12% in second quarter, and we're holding in the range of 11% to 13% in the second half, that gives 2 years of double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth. This will also, as you might guess, give us good momentum as we go into 2017.
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be now between $5.35 and $5.40, which is up 19% to 20%, excluding approximately $0.12 per share for the full year of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency EPS growth for the year of 22% to 23%. These 2[ph] is up from the $5.15 to $5.25 we guided to during our first quarter earnings call. And as John alluded to, we now expect our EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by 75 basis points as we have guided you earlier for the full year of 2016.
So with that, operator, we're going to open up to any questions."

During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the second quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Veda.
These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick."

Once again, thank you for joining us for our earnings call. As is normal practice, I will start by giving you some high-level overview on some financials, and go to some highlights by the individual business units, come back and give you some insight on the major corporate initiatives. And John will take you through the -- details on financials. I'll come back with a summary, and I will do Q&A.
The second quarter performance continues to reflect outstanding execution across our business units, our verticals and our countries around the world. The team has developed good momentum which will carry us nicely in -- through the remainder of the year and into 2017. Also, our Veda team has continued to deliver the performance that attracted us to the company, and they fully embraced the integration strategy. I'll give you more on that in a moment.
I'm optimistic about the opportunities that the Australia and Southeast Asian business will generate for us not just this year, but into the future.
For the quarter, the total revenue was $811 million, up 20% on a reported basis and up 22% on local currency basis from the second quarter of 2015. Organic and constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first quarter, up very strong at 12%. Also, in the quarter, FX created $17 million of year-over-year headwind. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.6% compared to 35% in the second quarter of 2015, a very solid year-on-year increase.
Adjusted EPS was $1.43, up 24% from $1.15 last year, and better than our expectations when we guided back in April.
And now going on to some of the individual -- each of the individual businesses, starting with USIS. A 3% revenue growth in the quarter, driven largely by mortgage originations, credit marketing activities, commercial information services and our fraud solutions with an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 50%.
Trended data from mortgage industry is expected to go live on September 24. We've been delivering trended data to our customers since April of this year, so they could develop familiarity with the content and better understand the value to their underwriting processes. And we've already signed agreements with 3 of the largest mortgage resellers, and we'll start billing for these services in August of this year.
Revenue from our credit marketing services product offerings grew up single digits, driven by double-digit growth in both prescreen and portfolio review offerings. We believe that the majority of these projects were focused on new account acquisitions and cross-selling. The growth was also broad-based across all of our major verticals.
The team continues to make very good progress on our commercial information database and solutions. We've been operating under numerous extensions of our agreement with the small business financial exchange. We've been developing an alternative database, which we call the Commercial Financial Network. We currently have over 1,200 institutions providing data for the database, including some of the largest financial institutions. And once again, our commercial business delivered double-digit growth for the quarter.
Our fraud solutions revenue was primarily driven by customer needs to authenticate consumer identity to online access. Growth was broad-based, including financial services, telco, government and our direct-to-consumer resellers.
Year-to-date, new product revenue for USIS is ahead of our expectation, driven mostly by nonmortgage-related products. And as you know, once the NPI pipeline up and running, that bodes well for the next 3 years.
We continued to expect USIS to deliver growth for the full year at the lower end of the long-term range of 5% to 7%. This is the range that we guided to for USIS back in February. EBITDA margins are expected to be above 50% for the year, which is slightly better than we were expecting when we give you guidance during the first quarter earnings call.
And on to International. International delivered outstanding 13% local currency organic revenue growth, as well above the upper end of the long-term range growth model we've talked about, which is 8 -- 10%. This is driven by broad based organic initiatives. Total local currency revenue growth of 62% reflects this strong organic growth and the full quarter of revenues from Veda.
Organic revenue growth in international's 4 largest verticals, which are financial institutions, telcos, government and auto, accelerated to 18% growth in the quarter, up from 13% growth in the first quarter versus first quarter of a year ago.
International decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew a solid 25% in the quarter, up from 19% in the first quarter, so again, accelerating growth sequentially. Our focus on delivering powerful insights continues to open new opportunities to help our customers operate their businesses more efficiently and effectively.
In the U.K., our customer management solutions, including loyal customer, have enhanced our competitive position and enabled us to continue winning share within the financial institutions.
Our U.K. government contract through TDX is performing well and in line with our expectations. Initial collections results and anticipated lift are consistent with our original expectations. And the relationships with the departments and the Cabinet office remain very strong. We have also made proposals to other government agencies within the U.K. who are not included in the initial launch.
While still early, we do not expect Brexit to have any material impact on TDX or the U.K. government initiative.
On to Canada. Canada has made great progress on extending our credit data capabilities into their markets. And the customers interest with both large banks and financial institutions has been very strong. Also in Canada, I think we've alluded to this a bit last call, we have recently landed a multi-year multimillion dollar deal to provide the TDX analytics solutions to one of our largest customers in Canada and that relationship started billing earlier this month.
We are excited about the opportunities in Australia to deliver solid long-term growth for the region. The integration really is going very, very well. To date, there have not been any surprises. And the teams in both Australia and New Zealand are embracing the integration initiatives at all levels of the respective organizations. 
During the second quarter, we began implementation of our global platforms in Australia, those including fraud management analytics, which were Cambrian and CAD technology. These are very important strategic platforms which we have been investing in for many years. These are best-in-class platforms and will provide Veda and our teams down there with tremendous capabilities to develop new products for their markets and customers for years to come. We have also identified a number of opportunities with Veda to both import and export new product ideas from that part of the world to other parts of the world and vice versa. 
Finally, performance -- the financial performance to date has met all of our expectations and is on track to beat our full year expectations.
International, as a whole, will have a very strong year 2016. We expect organic constant currency revenue growth will be above the upper end of the long-term model range of 8% to 10%. And total growth for 2016 to be over 40%, when you include Veda. EBITDA margins should exit the year comfortably above the second quarter level, which is up nicely, as you know, versus second quarter of a year ago.
On to Workforce Solutions. They had another outstanding performance in the quarter, with 21% revenue growth and a 480 basis point expansion in their EBITDA margin. We continued to have records to the work number database and create valuable insights for our customers. Our success in penetrating key verticals led to strong double-digit growth in auto, consumer finance, government, mortgage, preemployment and card. Revenue for healthcare vertical, which is comprised of our income and employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics for employers, grew almost 200% in the quarter and continues to look very promising going forward.
Within our suite of compliance center solutions, we've also developed a new series to help employers with the appeal management process under the Affordable Care Act. Employers can avoid penalties if they can prove to CMS that their employees were offered conforming affordable care coverage for those employees who applied and were approved for self-subsidies covered through the ACA exchange.
During the quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Barnett Associates with EWS. The company we've known for a long time. This company with over 33 years of experience and is a nice tuck-in acquisition for EWS. We expect this acquisition to close during the current quarter.
Workforce Solutions. In summary, we'll have another outstanding year in 2016, with revenue growth substantially above the long-term range of 9% to 11% and adjusted EBITDA margins now in the high 40% range, just an outstanding strength of growth these guys have been on.
On to  -- We used to call PSOL. We now call Global Consumer Solutions. They delivered 22% local currency revenue growth, driven largely by our indirect retailer customers and with -- also had solid adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter. Indirect and resale revenue was up over 70%, primarily driven by our relationships with Credit Karma and Life Lock. 
Our direct-to-consumer activities continued to deliver revenue and margin consistent with our expectations. And global consumer solutions will easily exceed their long-term growth target, comfortably delivering strong double-digit growth for the year. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to exceed 30%. And when John goes into his discussion, he will talk about margin in GCS in the second quarter to put some color and texture on that for you.
Back now to the corporate growth initiatives that you've grown familiar with. 
First is EGI, Enterprise Growth Initiatives, which you know, we've been out for 7 years now. They're fundamental growth driver to our multi-year growth levers. This year, we have 8 initiatives in the EGI with very specific metrics and milestones, with the management team reviews, at least on a monthly basis. Every 6 months, we are -- after 6 months, we are projecting the full year revenue from these 8 very important growth initiatives to now come in over 33% above the target we had set at the beginning of the year. That team just continues to execute at very high level.
Cambrian. You've heard us talk about that. It's truly have an amazing impact on how both we and our customers think about the effectiveness of our respective decisioning activities. For customers who are developing tools, they enabling them to increase approval rates while maintaining overall portfolio loss rates. By incorporating more data than just the credit data, we can expand the universe of applicants on which they can render decisions with confidence. Both of which improved marketing effectiveness and contribute incrementally to the revenue growth with very modest to no increase in expenses for our customers.
And certainly, for Equifax, we use Cambrian to help us better understand the depth and quality of our data assets. With in Equifax, we can identify opportunities to broaden and enhance our data assets, as well as specific steps to further improve the quality of our data.
On to NPI. New Product Innovation is also making strong contributions once again to our revenue growth. Through June, revenue from these initiatives is running 10% ahead of our expectations for 2016. You might recall that our expectations for third year revenue from our 2016 new product launches was already 130% greater than the 2015 launches third year revenue expectations. So we had come into the year with very high expectations when we classify some 2016, and it's already running at least 10% ahead of those expectations. 
International Workforce Solutions and USIS are all exceeding expectations, with the majority of the USIS growth coming from nonmortgage solutions when you think of new products. The pipeline is healthy. And we have a number of launches scheduled for the second half of the year and expect to support -- that to support revenue growth in 2017 and beyond.
Our outlook for mortgage -- the mortgage market in the U.S. has changed given the recent trends in the yield on 10-year notes and the resulting strength in the refi activity. Previously, we expected mortgage originations for 2016 to be flat to slightly down. Our current view is that the mortgage originations will be in the range of now flat to up mid-single digits for the full year. And that assumes that the 10-year treasury stay in the general range that they are now. Obviously, if they get weaker, that gives us some tailwind. If they rise at fast rate than anticipated, that might create some tailwind or headwind at the back end of the year.
Over the years, our annual growth playbook process has evolved to ensure we maintain an intense focus on the most critical opportunities that drive revenue growth. This year, we've completed, it's hard to believe, our 11th growth playbook. And with a focus on individual enterprise-wide, vertical market growth playbooks develop much deeper insights into our opportunities across all of our business units. With these new playbooks, we can better leverage our resources, customer relationships and opportunities to capture incremental revenue growth going forward.
In summary, before I turn it over to John here, our strategic initiatives are at or ahead of what we had expected as we entered the year. My optimism for both 2016 and '17 continues to improve as the year unfolds. 
One comment I want to make, I'll spend a minute on before I give it to John, is to put our USIS growth in perspective. A number of you have written about that in your early read last night. I want to make sure you understand how I think about that.
We view our enterprise-wide vertical market distribution efforts. You've heard us talk about that for a number of years now in the U.S. As a vital to our differentiation and our success in the U.S. marketplace. These vertical markets cut across our U.S. business units, so it's not just credit. So good way to think about the health of our U.S. credit business is they combine, as we do, our USIS business with our Verification Services business. And as you know, besides in EWS, and our healthcare revenues, also residing in U.S. -- or in EWS. When you think about that enterprise of products we're bringing to the U.S. market, our revenue for the quarter actually grew a very solid 10%, well above the overall growth in our economy. That's largely driven by, as you know, New Product Innovation, market penetration and insights.
Let me talk more about that during the Q&A. With that, I'll turn it over to John for detailed financials. John?"

As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. 
As a reminder, following the Veda acquisition, we started focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and the company as a whole. The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in adjusted EBITDA margin.
Now let me turn to the business units financial performance for the second quarter. 
U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $308 million, up 3% when compared to the second quarter 2015. Online Information Solutions revenue was $220 million, up 2% when compared to the year ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 13% in the quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index accelerated late in the quarter coincident with the drop in the 10-year treasury ending the quarter up 20%. Revenue mix shift is significantly in the quarter, with almost 60% of USIS mortgage revenue coming through resellers where revenue grew 22%.
Financial Marketing Services revenue was $53 million, up 7% when compared to the year-ago quarter. Our Commercial business continues to grow nicely, up 10% in 2Q and year-to-date. 
Identity and Fraud Solutions also continued to grow strongly, up 20% in 2Q and 25% year-to-date. 
As you recall, in 4Q '15, we realigned our business units, moving revenue with customers that have only direct-to-consumer relationships with Equifax from USIS to Global Consumer. During this realignment, customers with broader relationships with Equifax, including direct-to-consumer, principally other credit reporting agencies, were retained by USIS. USIS revenue in 2Q '16 and first half '16 has been negatively impacted by declines in revenues from these retained direct-to-consumer customers by about 2 percentage points. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions for 2Q '16 was a very strong 50.4% and up from the 50.1% we had in the second quarter of 2015.
Workforce Solutions revenue was $177 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Verification Services revenue of $110 million, up 17%, continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto, preemployment and card segments. 
Employer Services revenue of $67 million was up 29% from last year. Again, the traditional employer service businesses of unemployment claims, Watsi, I-9 validations and onboarding performed well, with combined revenue growth consistent with our long-term expectations of mid-single digits.
Workforce Analytics, which provide services to employers to ensure they are in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, grew several hundred percent in 2Q '16. Seasonally, the first half of the year was the highest revenue for Workforce Analytic. This is the period in which employers are required to provide Form 1095-C to employees, a service that Equifax provides.
Employer Services revenue in 3Q '16 is expected to grow double digits, but will not be as strong as first half '16, reflecting the seasonal nature of Workforce Analytics revenue.
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 50.2%, up from 45.4% in 2Q '15. Seasonally, Workforce Solutions has higher adjusted EBITDA margins in the first half, reflecting seasonality in both Watsi and Workforce Analytics. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Workforce Solutions in 3Q '16 are expected to be up strongly year-to-year, but down sequentially due to the seasonality.
Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions, our total U.S. B2B revenue, was $485 million, representing organic growth exceeding 9%.
International's revenue was $219 million, up over 50% on a reported basis and over 60% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth, which excludes Veda revenue, was nicely above our long-term range of 8% to 10%.
By region, Europe's revenue was $67 million, up 12% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Given the sharp decline in the British pound following the Brexit vote, we anticipate that 3Q '16 Europe revenue measured in U.S. dollars will be negatively impacted by FX, by approximately 10%.
Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 8% in U.S. dollars, but up 14% in local currency. The depreciation of the Argentinian peso that occurred in Q4 of last year represented almost 75% of the FX impact in Latin America. 
Asia-Pacific revenue was $72 million, which was comprised mostly of revenue from Veda.
Canada revenue was $32 million, flat in U.S. dollars, but up 5% in local currency. This was a nice growth for Canada and reflects the renewed focus on NPI in Canada we referenced last quarter. 
For the second quarter, International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 25.9% in 2Q '15. We saw a nice growth in the adjusted EBITDA margins in Canada and Europe, as well as benefiting from a full quarter's EBITDA contribution from Veda in Asia-Pacific.
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $107 million, up 21% on a reported basis and 22% on a local currency basis. Growth was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers. For the second quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%, down from 30.6% in 2Q '15. During the second quarter, we had program-related revenue and startup expenses associated with the launching of a relationship with a new B2C customer. Both these program revenue and the startup expenses will not continue into 3Q. As a result, revenue growth in 3Q is still expected to be double-digit, but will be below the level generated in 2Q. Also, as a result, adjusted EBITDA margin will improve significantly in the third quarter and for the remainder of the year.
In the second quarter, general corporate expense was $46 million. Excluding Veda integration expense, 2Q '16 general corporate expense was $44 million. 2Q '16 was down from 1Q '16, as in the first quarter, executive equity comp is issued, with the bulk of it expensed in the period. 2Q '16 corporate expense was lower than expected, as total employee bonuses accrued in the period were as expected, but more of the bonuses were incurred in the business units than in corporate. Also, some corporate investments expected to be incurred in 2Q '16 were delayed. With the third and fourth quarters, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million, reflecting higher levels of corporate investments. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin for Equifax was 36.6%, up from 35% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins in 2Q '16 reflects the very strong adjusted EBITDA margins in Workforce Solutions, International and USIS, as well as lower corporate expenses. We expect that 3Q '16 EBITDA margin to decrease Sequentially, but increase year-to-year at a rate slightly lower than our expectations for full year improvement. We expect our full year 2016 EBITDA margin to be up above 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34%, which was slightly above our expectations due to unfavorable discrete items. Our expectations is that the full year 2016 effective tax rate will be just under 33%, consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year. In the third quarter, the effective tax rate will be below the full year rate.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $43 million and year-to-date are $83 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be at approximately 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range, reflecting investments made related to Veda integration. 
Year-to-date, operating cash flow remains strong at $280 million and consistent with our expectations. The slight decline from first half '15 is principally due to changes in working capital.
Total debt in the quarter was $2.95 billion. During the quarter, we issued $775 million of 5- and 10-year notes that refinanced the 364-day credit facility used to finance the acquisition of Veda.
As we indicated last quarter, we have suspended our share repurchase program, and we will focus on debt reduction until we return credit metrics to a level consistent with our current credit ratings. We are continuing with acquisitions. And in the quarter, announced the acquisition of Barnet Associates, as Rick referenced earlier. With regards to the Veda acquisition, integration continues to go well, and we continue to expect 2016 revenue from Veda to be $230 million to $235 million, with adjusted EPS accretion from Veda at approximately $0.20 a share.
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

A quick summary before we go to Q&A. The guidance looking forward. 
For the third quarter, we're increasing our outlook for both revenue and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth between 22% and 24%, which is partially offset by 3 points of FX headwind.
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.33 and $1.36 for the quarter, which is up 17% to 19%. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency EPS growth for the third quarter of 19% to 22%.
With our strong second quarter performance and our outlook -- strong outlook for the third quarter, we are also increasing our full year outlook. 
For the full year, we expect revenue to now be between $3.13 billion and $3.16 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22%, partially offset again by 3 points of FX headwind. This is an improvement from the previous guidance we provided you, which was $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion, and increases our confidence that we will end the year nicely above the high end of a multi-year model of 6% to 8% of organic revenue growth.
From a revenue perspective, 2016, I think you'll agree, is shaping up nicely. Constant currency organic revenue growth of 11% in the fourth quarter -- first quarter, accelerated to 12% in second quarter. And we're holding in the range of 11% to 13% in the second half, that gives 2 years of double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth. This will also, as you might guess, give us good momentum as we go into 2017.
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be, now, between $5.35 and $5.40, which is up 19% to 20%, excluding approximately $0.12 per share for the full year of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency EPS growth for the year of 22% to 23%. This, too, is up from the $5.15 to $5.25, we guided to during our first quarter earnings call. And as John alluded to, we now expect our EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by 75 basis points as we have guided earlier for the full year of 2016.
So with that, operator, we'd like to open up to any questions."

As John alluded to, we made the restructuring of our PSOL business, now called GCS, in the last year and, of course, for this year. We left behind some traditional relationships that do the same thing. They sell those products, but not to the Credit Karma or Life Lock. So we'll have that behind with USIS. We could have easily removed that whole thing over to PSOL, then we behind as a shrinking business, as you know. And with that came about 2 points ahead. Once we think about the health of the core USIS business, it actually grew with tough comps year-on-year because of mortgage last year, actually grew when you adjust that direct-to-consumer business over 5% -- that on baseline. Now when you think of the acceleration going into second half of the year, it's really NPI, and part of the NPI, you alluded to, was credit data for Fannie Mae, but it's NPI generically in total also then aided by the trended data for Fannie Mae."

During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our businesses are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the second quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Veda.
These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.

Once again, thank you for joining us for our earnings call.

Once again, thank you for joining us for our earnings call. As is normal practice, I will start by giving some high-level overview on some financials, and go through some highlights by the individual business units, come back and give you some insight on the major corporate initiatives. And John will take it from there and go to details on financials. I'll come back with a summary, and then we'll do Q&A.
The second quarter performance continues to reflect outstanding execution across our business units, our verticals and our countries around the world. The team has developed good momentum which should carry us nicely in -- through the remainder of the year and into 2017. Also, our Veda team has continued to deliver the performance that attracted us to the company, and they fully embrace the integration strategy. I'll give you more on that in a moment.
I'm optimistic about the opportunities that the Australian and Southeast Asian business will generate for us, not just this year, but into the future.
For the quarter, the total revenue was $811 million, up 20% on a reported basis and up 22% on local currency basis from the second quarter of 2015. Organic and constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first quarter, up very strong at 12%. Also in the quarter, FX created $17 million of year-over-year headwind. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.6% compared to 35% in the second quarter of 2015, a very solid year-on-year increase.
Adjusted EPS was $1.43, up 24% from $1.15 last year, and better than our expectations when we guided back in April.
And now going on to some of the individual -- each of the individual businesses, starting with USIS. A 3% revenue growth in the quarter, driven largely by mortgage originations, credit marketing activities, commercial information services and our fraud solutions with an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 50%.
Trended data from mortgage industry is expected to go live on September 24. We've been delivering trended data to our customers since April of this year so they could develop familiarity with the content and better understand the value to their underwriting processes. And we've already signed agreements with 3 of the largest mortgage resellers, and we'll start billing for these services in August of this year.
Revenue from our credit marketing services product offerings grew up single digits, driven by double-digit growth in both prescreen and portfolio review offerings. We believe that the majority of these projects were focused on new account acquisitions and cross-selling. The growth was also broad-based across all of our major verticals.
The team continues to make very good progress on a commercial information database and solutions. We've been operating under numerous extensions of our agreement with the small business financial exchange. We've been developing an alternative database, which we call the Commercial Financial Network. We currently have over 1,200 institutions providing data for the database, including some of the largest financial institutions. And once again, our commercial business delivered double-digit growth for the quarter.
Our fraud solutions revenue was primarily driven by customer needs to authenticate consumer identity for online access. Growth was broad-based, including financial services, telco, government and our direct-to-consumer resellers.
Year-to-date, new product revenue for USIS is ahead of our expectation, driven mostly by nonmortgage-related products. And as you know, once you get the NPI pipeline up and running, that bodes well for the next 3 years.
We continue to expect USIS to deliver growth for the full year at the lower end of the long-term range of 5% to 7%. This is the range that we guided to for USIS back in February. EBITDA margins are expected to be above 50% for the year, which is slightly better than we were expecting when we give you guidance during our first quarter earnings call.
And on to International. International delivered outstanding 13% local currency organic revenue growth. That's well above the upper end of the long-term range growth model we've talked about, which is 8% to 10%. This is driven by broad-based organic initiatives. Total local currency revenue growth of 62% reflects this strong organic growth and the full quarter of revenues from Veda.
Organic revenue growth in International's 4 largest verticals, which are financial institutions, telcos, government and auto, accelerated to 18% growth in the quarter, up from 13% growth in the first quarter versus first quarter of a year ago.
International's decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew a solid 25% in the quarter, up from 19% in the first quarter, so again, accelerating growth sequentially. Our focus on delivering powerful insights continues to open new opportunities to help our customers operate their businesses more efficiently and effectively.
In the U.K., our customer management solutions, including Know Your Customer, have enhanced our competitive position and enabled us to continue winning share within the financial institutions.
Our U.K. government contract through TDX is performing well and in line with our expectations. Initial collections results and anticipated lift are consistent with our original expectations. And the relationships with the departments and the Cabinet office remain very strong. We have also made proposals to other government agencies within the U.K. who were not included in the initial launch.
While still early, we do not expect Brexit to have any material impact on TDX or the U.K. government initiative.
On to Canada. Canada has made great progress on extending our credit data capabilities into their markets. And the customers interest with both large banks and financial institutions has been very strong. Also in Canada, I think we've alluded to this a bit on the last call, we have recently landed a multi-year, multimillion dollar deal to provide the TDX analytic solutions to one of our largest customers in Canada and that relationship started billing earlier this month.
We are excited about the opportunities in Australia to deliver solid long-term growth for the region. The integration really is going very, very well. To date, there have not been any surprises. And the teams in both Australia and New Zealand are embracing the integration initiatives at all levels of their respective organizations. 
During the second quarter, we began implementation of our global platforms in Australia, those including fraud management, analytics, which have Cambrian and CAD technology. These are very important strategic platforms which we have been investing in for many years. These are best-in-class platforms and will provide Veda and our teams down there with tremendous capabilities to develop new products for their markets and customers for years to come. We have also identified a number of opportunities with Veda to both import and export new product ideas from that part of the world to other parts of the world and vice versa. 
Finally, performance -- the financial performance to date has met all of our expectations and is on track to meet our full year expectations.
International, as a whole, will have a very strong year 2016. We expect organic constant currency revenue growth will be above the upper end of the long-term model range of 8% to 10%. And total growth for 2016 to be over 40%, when you include Veda. EBITDA margins should exit the year comfortably above the second quarter level, which is up nicely, as you know, versus second quarter of a year ago.
On to Workforce Solutions. They had another outstanding performance in the quarter, with 21% revenue growth and a 480 basis point expansion in their EBITDA margin. We continued to add records to the work number database and create valuable insights for our customers. Our success in penetrating key verticals led to strong double-digit growth in auto, consumer finance, government, mortgage, preemployment and card. Revenue from our healthcare vertical, which is comprised of our income employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics for employers, grew almost 200% in the quarter and continues to look very promising moving forward.
Within our suite of compliance center solutions, we've also developed a new series to help employers with the appeal management process under the Affordable Care Act. Employers can avoid penalties if they can prove to CMS that their employees were offered conforming affordable care coverage for those employees who applied and were approved for subsidies covered through the ACA exchange.
During the quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Barnett Associates within EWS. It's a company we've known for a long time. It's a company with over 33 years of experience and is a nice tuck-in acquisition for EWS. We expect this acquisition to close during the current quarter.
Workforce Solutions. In summary, we'll have another outstanding year in 2016, with revenue growth substantially above the long-term range of 9% to 11% and adjusted EBITDA margins now in the high 40% range, just an outstanding string of growth these guys have been on.
On to -- what we used to call PSOL, we now call Global Consumer Solutions. They delivered 22% local currency revenue growth, driven largely by our indirect retailer customers and with -- also had solid adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter. Indirect and resale revenue was up over 70%, primarily driven by our relationships with Credit Karma and LifeLock. 
Our direct-to-consumer activities continued to deliver revenue and margin consistent with our expectations. And Global Consumer Solutions will easily exceed their long-term growth target, comfortably delivering strong double-digit growth for the year. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to exceed 30%. And when John goes into his discussion, he will talk about margins in GCS in the second quarter to put some color and texture on that for you.
Back now to the corporate growth initiatives that you've grown familiar with. 
First is EGI, Enterprise Growth Initiatives, which you know, we've been at for about 7 years now. They're a fundamental growth driver to our multi-year growth levers. This year, we have 8 initiatives in EGI, with very specific metrics and milestones, with the management team reviews, at least on a monthly basis. Every 6 months, we are -- after 6 months, we are projecting the full year revenue from these 8 very important growth initiatives to now come in over 33% above the target we had set at the beginning of the year. That team just continues to execute at a very high level.
Cambrian. You've heard us talk about that. It's truly having an amazing impact on how both we and our customers think about the effectiveness of our respective decisioning activities. For customers we are developing tools that enable them to increase approval rates while maintaining overall portfolio loss rates. By incorporating more data than just the credit data, we can expand the universe of applicants on which they can render decisions with confidence, both of which improve marketing effectiveness and contribute incrementally to the revenue growth with very modest to no increase in expenses for our customers.
Internally, for Equifax, we use Cambrian to help us better understand the depth and quality of our data assets. With these insights, we can identify opportunities to broaden and enhance our data assets as well as specific steps to further improve the quality of our data.
On to NPI. New Product Innovation is also making strong contributions once again to our revenue growth. Through June, revenue from these initiatives is running 10% ahead of our expectations for 2016. You might recall that our expectations for third year revenue from our 2016 new product launches was already 130% greater than the 2015 launches' third year revenue expectations. So we had come into the year with very high expectations for the class of products in 2016, and it's already running at least 10% ahead of those expectations. 
International Workforce Solutions and USIS are all exceeding expectations, with the majority of the USIS growth coming from nonmortgage solutions when you think of new products. The pipeline is healthy. And we have a number of launches scheduled for the second half of the year and expect to support -- that to support revenue growth in 2017 and beyond.
Our outlook for mortgage -- the mortgage market in the U.S. has changed given the recent trends in the yield on 10-year notes and the resulting strength in the refi activity. Previously, we expected mortgage originations for 2016 to be flat to slightly down. Our current view is that the mortgage originations will be in the range of now flat to up mid-single digits for the full year. And that assumes that the 10-year treasuries stay in the general range that they are now. Obviously, if they get weaker, that gives us some tailwind. If they rise at a faster rate than anticipated, that might create some tailwind -- or headwind at the back end of the year.
Over the years, our annual growth playbook process has evolved to ensure we maintain an intense focus on the most critical opportunities that drive revenue growth. This year, we've completed, it's hard to believe, our 11th growth playbook. And with a focus on individual enterprise-wide, vertical market growth playbooks, develop much deeper insights into our opportunities across all of our business units. With these new playbooks, we can better leverage our resources, customer relationships and opportunities to capture incremental revenue growth going forward.
In summary, before I turn it over to John here, our strategic initiatives are at or ahead of what we had expected as we entered the year. My optimism for both 2016 and '17 continues to improve as the year unfolds. 
One comment I want to make and spend a minute on before I give it to John, is to put our USIS growth in perspective. A number of you have written about that in your early read last night. I want to make sure you understand how I think about that.
We view our enterprise-wide vertical market distribution efforts -- you've heard us talk about that for a number of years now -- in the U.S., as vital to our differentiation and our success in the U.S. marketplace. These vertical markets cut across our U.S. business units, so it's not just credit. So good way to think about the health of our U.S. credit business is it combines, as we do, our USIS business with our Verification Services business -- and as you know, resides in EWS -- and our healthcare revenues, also residing in U.S. -- or in EWS. When you think about that enterprise of products we're bringing to the U.S. market, our revenue for the quarter actually grew a very solid 10%, well above the overall growth in our economy. That's largely driven by, as you know, New Product Innovation, market penetration and insights.
We'll talk more about that during the Q&A. With that, I'll turn it over to John for detailed financials. John?"

As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. 
As a reminder, following the Veda acquisition, we started focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and the company as a whole. The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in adjusted EBITDA margin.
Now let me turn to the business units financial performance for the second quarter. 
U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $308 million, up 3% when compared to the second quarter 2015. Online Information Solutions revenue was $220 million, up 2% when compared to the year ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 13% in the quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index accelerated late in the quarter coincident with the drop in the 10-year treasury, ending the quarter up 20%. Revenue mix shifted significantly in the quarter, with almost 60% of USIS mortgage revenue coming through resellers, where revenue grew 22%.
Financial Marketing Services revenue was $53 million, up 7% when compared to the year-ago quarter. Our Commercial business continues to grow nicely, up 10% in 2Q and year-to-date. 
Identity and Fraud Solutions also continued to grow strongly, up 20% in 2Q and 25% year-to-date. 
As you recall, in 4Q '15, we realigned our business units, moving revenue with customers that have only direct-to-consumer relationships with Equifax from USIS to Global Consumer. During this realignment, customers with broader relationships with Equifax, including direct-to-consumer, principally other credit reporting agencies, were retained by USIS. USIS revenue in 2Q '16 and first half '16 has been negatively impacted by declines in revenues from these retained direct-to-consumer customers by about 2 percentage points. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions for 2Q '16 was a very strong 50.4% and up from the 50.1% we had in the second quarter of 2015.
Workforce Solutions revenue was $177 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Verification Services revenue of $110 million, up 17%, continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto, preemployment and card segments. 
Employer Services revenue of $67 million was up 29% from last year. Again, the traditional employer service businesses of unemployment claims, Watsi, I-9 validations and onboarding performed well, with combined revenue growth consistent with our long-term expectations of mid-single digits.
Workforce Analytics, which provide services to employers to ensure they are in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, grew several hundred percent in 2Q '16. Seasonally, the first half of the year was the highest revenue for Workforce Analytics. This is the period in which employers are required to provide Form 1095-C to employees, a service that Equifax provides.
Employer Services revenue in 3Q '16 is expected to grow double digits, but will not be as strong as first half '16, reflecting the seasonal nature of Workforce Analytics revenue.
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 50.2%, up from 45.4% in 2Q '15. Seasonally, Workforce Solutions has higher adjusted EBITDA margins in the first half, reflecting seasonality in both Watsi and Workforce Analytics. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Workforce Solutions in 3Q '16 are expected to be up strongly year-to-year, but down sequentially due to the seasonality.
Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions, our total U.S. B2B revenue, was $485 million, representing organic growth exceeding 9%.
International's revenue was $219 million, up over 50% on a reported basis and over 60% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth, which excludes Veda revenue, was nicely above our long-term range of 8% to 10%.
By region, Europe's revenue was $67 million, up 12% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Given the sharp decline in the British pound following the Brexit vote, we anticipate that 3Q '16 Europe revenue measured in U.S. dollars will be negatively impacted by FX, by approximately 10%.
Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 8% in U.S. dollars, but up 14% in local currency. The depreciation of the Argentinian peso that occurred in Q4 of last year represented almost 75% of the FX impact in Latin America. 
Asia-Pacific revenue was $72 million, which was comprised mostly of revenue from Veda.
Canada revenue was $32 million, flat in U.S. dollars, but up 5% in local currency. This was nice growth for Canada and reflects the renewed focus on NPI in Canada we referenced last quarter. 
For the second quarter, International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 25.9% in 2Q '15. We saw a nice growth in the adjusted EBITDA margins in Canada and Europe, as well as benefiting from a full quarter's EBITDA contribution from Veda in Asia-Pacific.
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $107 million, up 21% on a reported basis and 22% on a local currency basis. Growth was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers. For the second quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%, down from 30.6% in 2Q '15. During the second quarter, we had program-related revenue and startup expenses associated with the launching of a relationship with a new B2C customer. Both this program revenue and these startup expenses will not continue into 3Q. As a result, revenue growth in 3Q is still expected to be double-digit, but will be below the level generated in 2Q. Also, as a result, adjusted EBITDA margin will improve significantly in the third quarter and for the remainder of the year.
In the second quarter, general corporate expense was $46 million. Excluding Veda integration expense, 2Q '16 general corporate expense was $44 million. 2Q '16 was down from 1Q '16, as in the first quarter, executive equity comp is issued, with the bulk of it expensed in the period. 2Q '16 corporate expense was lower than expected, as total employee bonuses accrued in the period were as expected, but more of the bonuses were incurred in the business units than in corporate. Also, some corporate investments expected to be incurred in 2Q '16 were delayed. For the third and fourth quarters, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million, reflecting higher levels of corporate investments. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin for Equifax was 36.6%, up from 35% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins in 2Q '16 reflects the very strong adjusted EBITDA margins in Workforce Solutions, International and USIS as well as lower corporate expenses. We expect the 3Q '16 EBITDA margin to decrease sequentially, but increase year-to-year at a rate slightly lower than our expectations for full year improvement. We expect our full year 2016 EBITDA margin to be up about 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34%, which was slightly above our expectations due to unfavorable discrete items. Our expectation is that the full year 2016 effective tax rate will be just under 33%, consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year. In the third quarter, the effective tax rate will be below the full year rate.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $43 million and year-to-date are $83 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be at approximately 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range, reflecting investments made related to Veda integration. 
Year-to-date, operating cash flow remains strong at $280 million and consistent with our expectations. The slight decline from first half '15 is principally due to changes in working capital.
Total debt in the quarter was $2.95 billion. During the quarter, we issued $775 million of 5- and 10-year notes that refinanced the 364-day credit facility used to finance the acquisition of Veda.
As we indicated last quarter, we have suspended our share repurchase program, and we will focus on debt reduction until we return credit metrics to a level consistent with our current credit ratings. We are continuing with acquisitions. And in the quarter, announced the acquisition of Barnett Associates, as Rick referenced earlier. With regards to the Veda acquisition, integration continues to go well, and we continue to expect 2016 revenue from Veda to be $230 million to $235 million, with adjusted EPS accretion from Veda at approximately $0.20 a share.
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

A quick summary before we go to Q&A. Some guidance, looking forward. 
For the third quarter, we're increasing our outlook for both revenue and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth between 22% and 24%, which is partially offset by 3 points of FX headwind.
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.33 and $1.36 for the quarter, which is up 17% to 19%. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency EPS growth for the third quarter of 19% to 22%.
With our strong second quarter performance and our outlook -- strong outlook for the third quarter, we are also increasing our full year outlook. 
For the full year, we expect revenue to now be between $3.13 billion and $3.16 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22%, partially offset, again, by 3 points of FX headwind. This is an improvement from the previous guidance we provided you, which was $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion, and increases our confidence that we will end the year nicely above the high end of a multi-year model of 6% to 8% of organic revenue growth.
From a revenue perspective, 2016, I think you'll agree, is shaping up nicely. Constant currency organic revenue growth of 11% in the fourth quarter -- first quarter, accelerated to 12% in second quarter. And we're holding in the range of 11% to 13% in the second half, to give us 2 years of double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth. This will also, as you might guess, give us good momentum as we go into 2017.
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be, now, between $5.35 and $5.40, which is up 19% to 20%, excluding approximately $0.12 per share for the full year of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency EPS growth for the year of 22% to 23%. This, too, is up from the $5.15 to $5.25 we guided to during our first quarter earnings call. And as John alluded to, we now expect our EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by 75 basis points as we have guided to earlier for the full year of 2016.
So with that, operator, we'd like to open up to any questions."

They sell those products, but not to the Credit Karmas or LifeLocks of the world. We left that behind with USIS. We could easily have moved that whole thing over to PSOL, then leave behind as a shrinking business, as you know. And with that came about 2 points of headwinds. So you think about the health of the core USIS business, it actually grew with tough comps year-on-year because of mortgage last year, actually grew when you adjust that direct-to-consumer business over 5% -- that on baseline.

Government is another. Around the world, we're doing some really cool things, in the U.S., as you know, around government. The debt management analytic platform in the U.K. is government. So government is going to be a continued big growth area for us. Healthcare is, I think, when we talked about growing almost 200% in the second quarter, would be another one. So those are a couple.

During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our businesses are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the second quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Veda.
These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.

And John will take it from there and go to details on financials. I'll come back with a summary, and then we'll do Q&A.
The second quarter performance continues to reflect outstanding execution across our business units, our verticals and our countries around the world. The team has developed good momentum which should carry us nicely in -- through the remainder of the year and into 2017. Also, our Veda team has continued to deliver the performance that attracted us to the company, and they fully embrace the integration strategy. I'll give you more on that in a moment.
I'm optimistic about the opportunities that the Australian and Southeast Asian business will generate for us, not just this year, but into the future.
For the quarter, the total revenue was $811 million, up 20% on a reported basis and up 22% on local currency basis from the second quarter of 2015. Organic and constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first quarter, up very strong at 12%. Also in the quarter, FX created $17 million of year-over-year headwind. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.6% compared to 35% in the second quarter of 2015, a very solid year-on-year increase.
Adjusted EPS was $1.43, up 24% from $1.15 last year, and better than our expectations when we guided back in April.
And now going on to some of the individual -- each of the individual businesses, starting with USIS. A 3% revenue growth in the quarter, driven largely by mortgage originations, credit marketing activities, commercial information services and our fraud solutions with an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 50%.
Trended data from mortgage industry is expected to go live on September 24. We've been delivering trended data to our customers since April of this year so they could develop familiarity with the content and better understand the value to their underwriting processes. And we've already signed agreements with 3 of the largest mortgage resellers, and we'll start billing for these services in August of this year.
Revenue from our credit marketing services product offerings grew up single digits, driven by double-digit growth in both prescreen and portfolio review offerings. We believe that the majority of these projects were focused on new account acquisitions and cross-selling. The growth was also broad-based across all of our major verticals.
The team continues to make very good progress on a commercial information database and solutions. We've been operating under numerous extensions of our agreement with the small business financial exchange. We've been developing an alternative database, which we call the Commercial Financial Network. We currently have over 1,200 institutions providing data for the database, including some of the largest financial institutions. And once again, our commercial business delivered double-digit growth for the quarter.
Our fraud solutions revenue was primarily driven by customer needs to authenticate consumer identity for online access. Growth was broad-based, including financial services, telco, government and our direct-to-consumer resellers.
Year-to-date, new product revenue for USIS is ahead of our expectation, driven mostly by nonmortgage-related products. And as you know, once you get the NPI pipeline up and running, that bodes well for the next 3 years.
We continue to expect USIS to deliver growth for the full year at the lower end of the long-term range of 5% to 7%. This is the range that we guided to for USIS back in February. EBITDA margins are expected to be above 50% for the year, which is slightly better than we were expecting when we give you guidance during our first quarter earnings call.
And on to International. International delivered outstanding 13% local currency organic revenue growth. That's well above the upper end of the long-term range growth model we've talked about, which is 8% to 10%. This is driven by broad-based organic initiatives. Total local currency revenue growth of 62% reflects this strong organic growth and the full quarter of revenues from Veda.
Organic revenue growth in International's 4 largest verticals, which are financial institutions, telcos, government and auto, accelerated to 18% growth in the quarter, up from 13% growth in the first quarter versus first quarter of a year ago.
International's decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew a solid 25% in the quarter, up from 19% in the first quarter, so again, accelerating growth sequentially. Our focus on delivering powerful insights continues to open new opportunities to help our customers operate their businesses more efficiently and effectively.
In the U.K., our customer management solutions, including Know Your Customer, have enhanced our competitive position and enabled us to continue winning share within the financial institutions.
Our U.K. government contract through TDX is performing well and in line with our expectations. Initial collections results and anticipated lift are consistent with our original expectations. And the relationships with the departments and the Cabinet office remain very strong. We have also made proposals to other government agencies within the U.K. who were not included in the initial launch.
While still early, we do not expect Brexit to have any material impact on TDX or the U.K. government initiative.
On to Canada. Canada has made great progress on extending our credit data capabilities into their markets. And the customers' interest with both large banks and financial institutions has been very strong. Also in Canada, I think we've alluded to this a bit on the last call, we have recently landed a multi-year, multimillion dollar deal to provide the TDX analytic solutions to one of our largest customers in Canada and that relationship started billing earlier this month.
We are excited about the opportunities in Australia to deliver solid long-term growth for the region. The integration really is going very, very well. To date, there have not been any surprises. And the teams in both Australia and New Zealand are embracing the integration initiatives at all levels of their respective organizations. 
During the second quarter, we began implementation of our global platforms in Australia, those including fraud management, analytics, which have Cambrian and CAD technology. These are very important strategic platforms which we have been investing in for many years. These are best-in-class platforms and will provide Veda and our teams down there with tremendous capabilities to develop new products for their markets and customers for years to come. We have also identified a number of opportunities with Veda to both import and export new product ideas from that part of the world to other parts of the world and vice versa. 
Finally, performance -- the financial performance to date has met all of our expectations and is on track to meet our full year expectations.
International, as a whole, will have a very strong year 2016. We expect organic constant currency revenue growth will be above the upper end of the long-term model range of 8% to 10%. And total growth for 2016 to be over 40%, when you include Veda. EBITDA margins should exit the year comfortably above the second quarter level, which is up nicely, as you know, versus second quarter of a year ago.
On to Workforce Solutions. They had another outstanding performance in the quarter, with 21% revenue growth and a 480 basis point expansion in their EBITDA margin. We continued to add records to the work number database and create valuable insights for our customers. Our success in penetrating key verticals led to strong double-digit growth in auto, consumer finance, government, mortgage, preemployment and card. Revenue from our healthcare vertical, which is comprised of our income employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics for employers, grew almost 200% in the quarter and continues to look very promising moving forward.
Within our suite of compliance center solutions, we've also developed a new series to help employers with the appeal management process under the Affordable Care Act. Employers can avoid penalties if they can prove to CMS that their employees were offered conforming affordable care coverage for those employees who applied and were approved for subsidies covered through the ACA exchange.
During the quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Barnett Associates within EWS. It's a company we've known for a long time. It's a company with over 33 years of experience and is a nice tuck-in acquisition for EWS. We expect this acquisition to close during the current quarter.
Workforce Solutions. In summary, we'll have another outstanding year in 2016, with revenue growth substantially above the long-term range of 9% to 11% and adjusted EBITDA margins now in the high 40% range, just an outstanding string of growth these guys have been on.
On to -- what we used to call PSOL, we now call Global Consumer Solutions. They delivered 22% local currency revenue growth, driven largely by our indirect retailer customers and with -- also had solid adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter. Indirect and resale revenue was up over 70%, primarily driven by our relationships with Credit Karma and LifeLock. 
Our direct-to-consumer activities continued to deliver revenue and margin consistent with our expectations. And Global Consumer Solutions will easily exceed their long-term growth target, comfortably delivering strong double-digit growth for the year. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to exceed 30%. And when John goes into his discussion, he will talk about margins in GCS in the second quarter to put some color and texture on that for you.
Back now to the corporate growth initiatives that you've grown familiar with. 
First is EGI, Enterprise Growth Initiatives, which you know, we've been at for about 7 years now. They're a fundamental growth driver to our multi-year growth levers. This year, we have 8 initiatives in EGI, with very specific metrics and milestones, with the management team reviews, at least on a monthly basis. Every 6 months, we are -- after 6 months, we are projecting the full year revenue from these 8 very important growth initiatives to now come in over 33% above the target we had set at the beginning of the year. That team just continues to execute at a very high level.
Cambrian. You've heard us talk about that. It's truly having an amazing impact on how both we and our customers think about the effectiveness of our respective decisioning activities. For customers we are developing tools that enable them to increase approval rates while maintaining overall portfolio loss rates. By incorporating more data than just the credit data, we can expand the universe of applicants on which they can render decisions with confidence, both of which improve marketing effectiveness and contribute incrementally to the revenue growth with very modest to no increase in expenses for our customers.
Internally, for Equifax, we use Cambrian to help us better understand the depth and quality of our data assets. With these insights, we can identify opportunities to broaden and enhance our data assets as well as specific steps to further improve the quality of our data.
On to NPI. New Product Innovation is also making strong contributions once again to our revenue growth. Through June, revenue from these initiatives is running 10% ahead of our expectations for 2016. You might recall that our expectations for third year revenue from our 2016 new product launches was already 130% greater than the 2015 launches' third year revenue expectations. So we had come into the year with very high expectations for the class of products in 2016, and it's already running at least 10% ahead of those expectations. 
International Workforce Solutions and USIS are all exceeding expectations, with the majority of the USIS growth coming from nonmortgage solutions when you think of new products. The pipeline is healthy. And we have a number of launches scheduled for the second half of the year and expect to support -- that to support revenue growth in 2017 and beyond.
Our outlook for mortgage -- the mortgage market in the U.S. has changed given the recent trends in the yield on 10-year notes and the resulting strength in the refi activity. Previously, we expected mortgage originations for 2016 to be flat to slightly down. Our current view is that the mortgage originations will be in the range of now flat to up mid-single digits for the full year. And that assumes that the 10-year treasuries stay in the general range that they are now. Obviously, if they get weaker, that gives us some tailwind. If they rise at a faster rate than anticipated, that might create some tailwind -- or headwind at the back end of the year.
Over the years, our annual growth playbook process has evolved to ensure we maintain an intense focus on the most critical opportunities that drive revenue growth. This year, we've completed, it's hard to believe, our 11th growth playbook. And with a focus on individual enterprise-wide, vertical market growth playbooks, develop much deeper insights into our opportunities across all of our business units. With these new playbooks, we can better leverage our resources, customer relationships and opportunities to capture incremental revenue growth going forward.
In summary, before I turn it over to John here, our strategic initiatives are at or ahead of what we had expected as we entered the year. My optimism for both 2016 and '17 continues to improve as the year unfolds. 
One comment I want to make and spend a minute on before I give it to John, is to put our USIS growth in perspective. A number of you have written about that in your early read last night. I want to make sure you understand how I think about that.
We view our enterprise-wide vertical market distribution efforts -- you've heard us talk about that for a number of years now -- in the U.S., as vital to our differentiation and our success in the U.S. marketplace. These vertical markets cut across our U.S. business units, so it's not just credit. So good way to think about the health of our U.S. credit business is it combines, as we do, our USIS business with our Verification Services business -- and as you know, resides in EWS -- and our healthcare revenues, also residing in U.S. -- or in EWS. When you think about that enterprise of products we're bringing to the U.S. market, our revenue for the quarter actually grew a very solid 10%, well above the overall growth in our economy. That's largely driven by, as you know, New Product Innovation, market penetration and insights.
We'll talk more about that during the Q&A. With that, I'll turn it over to John for detailed financials. John?"
175749,369858956,1016754,"Equifax Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone.

As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. 
As a reminder, following the Veda acquisition, we started focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and the company as a whole. The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in adjusted EBITDA margin.
Now let me turn to the business units financial performance for the second quarter. 
U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $308 million, up 3% when compared to the second quarter 2015. Online Information Solutions revenue was $220 million, up 2% when compared to the year ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 13% in the quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index accelerated late in the quarter coincident with the drop in the 10-year treasury, ending the quarter up 20%. Revenue mix shifted significantly in the quarter, with almost 60% of USIS mortgage revenue coming through resellers, where revenue grew 22%.
Financial Marketing Services revenue was $53 million, up 7% when compared to the year-ago quarter. Our Commercial business continues to grow nicely, up 10% in 2Q and year-to-date. 
Identity and Fraud Solutions also continued to grow strongly, up 20% in 2Q and 25% year-to-date. 
As you recall, in 4Q '15, we realigned our business units, moving revenue with customers that have only direct-to-consumer relationships with Equifax from USIS to Global Consumer. During this realignment, customers with broader relationships with Equifax, including direct-to-consumer, principally other credit reporting agencies, were retained by USIS. USIS revenue in 2Q '16 and first half '16 has been negatively impacted by declines in revenues from these retained direct-to-consumer customers by about 2 percentage points. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions for 2Q '16 was a very strong 50.4% and up from the 50.1% we had in the second quarter of 2015.
Workforce Solutions revenue was $177 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Verification Services revenue of $110 million, up 17%, continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto, preemployment and card segments. 
Employer Services revenue of $67 million was up 29% from last year. Again, the traditional employer service businesses of unemployment claims, Watsi, I-9 validations and onboarding performed well, with combined revenue growth consistent with our long-term expectations of mid-single digits.
Workforce Analytics, which provide services to employers to ensure they are in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, grew several hundred percent in 2Q '16. Seasonally, the first half of the year was the highest revenue for Workforce Analytics. This is the period in which employers are required to provide Form 1095-C to employees, a service that Equifax provides.
Employer Services revenue in 3Q '16 is expected to grow double digits, but will not be as strong as first half '16, reflecting the seasonal nature of Workforce Analytics revenue.
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 50.2%, up from 45.4% in 2Q '15. Seasonally, Workforce Solutions has higher adjusted EBITDA margins in the first half, reflecting seasonality in both Watsi and Workforce Analytics. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Workforce Solutions in 3Q '16 are expected to be up strongly year-to-year, but down sequentially due to the seasonality.
Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions, our total U.S. B2B revenue, was $485 million, representing organic growth exceeding 9%.
International's revenue was $219 million, up over 50% on a reported basis and over 60% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth, which excludes Veda revenue, was nicely above our long-term range of 8% to 10%.
By region, Europe's revenue was $67 million, up 12% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Given the sharp decline in the British pound following the Brexit vote, we anticipate that 3Q '16 Europe revenue measured in U.S. dollars will be negatively impacted by FX, by approximately 10%.
Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 8% in U.S. dollars, but up 14% in local currency. The depreciation of the Argentinian peso that occurred in Q4 of last year represented almost 75% of the FX impact in Latin America. 
Asia-Pacific revenue was $72 million, which was comprised mostly of revenue from Veda.
Canada revenue was $32 million, flat in U.S. dollars, but up 5% in local currency. This was nice growth for Canada and reflects the renewed focus on NPI in Canada we referenced last quarter. 
For the second quarter, International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 25.9% in 2Q '15. We saw a nice growth in the adjusted EBITDA margins in Canada and Europe, as well as benefiting from a full quarter's EBITDA contribution from Veda in Asia-Pacific.
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $107 million, up 21% on a reported basis and 22% on a local currency basis. Growth was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers. For the second quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%, down from 30.6% in 2Q '15. During the second quarter, we had program-related revenue and startup expenses associated with the launching of a relationship with a new B2C customer. Both this program revenue and these startup expenses will not continue into 3Q. As a result, revenue growth in 3Q is still expected to be double-digit, but will be below the level generated in 2Q. Also, as a result, adjusted EBITDA margin will improve significantly in the third quarter and for the remainder of the year.
In the second quarter, general corporate expense was $46 million. Excluding Veda integration expense, 2Q '16 general corporate expense was $44 million. 2Q '16 was down from 1Q '16, as in the first quarter, executive equity comp is issued, with the bulk of it expensed in the period. 2Q '16 corporate expense was lower than expected, as total employee bonuses accrued in the period were as expected, but more of the bonuses were incurred in the business units than in corporate. Also, some corporate investments expected to be incurred in 2Q '16 were delayed. For the third and fourth quarters, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million, reflecting higher levels of corporate investments. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin for Equifax was 36.6%, up from 35% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins in 2Q '16 reflects the very strong adjusted EBITDA margins in Workforce Solutions, International and USIS as well as lower corporate expenses. We expect the 3Q '16 EBITDA margin to decrease sequentially, but increase year-to-year at a rate slightly lower than our expectations for full year improvement. We expect our full year 2016 EBITDA margin to be up about 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34%, which was slightly above our expectations due to unfavorable discrete items. Our expectation is that the full year 2016 effective tax rate will be just under 33%, consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year. In the third quarter, the effective tax rate will be below the full year rate.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $43 million and year-to-date are $83 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be at approximately 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range, reflecting investments made related to Veda integration. 
Year-to-date, operating cash flow remains strong at $280 million and consistent with our expectations. The slight decline from first half '15 is principally due to changes in working capital.
Total debt in the quarter was $2.95 billion. During the quarter, we issued $775 million of 5- and 10-year notes that refinanced the 364-day credit facility used to finance the acquisition of Veda.
As we indicated last quarter, we have suspended our share repurchase program, and we will focus on debt reduction until we return credit metrics to a level consistent with our current credit ratings. We are continuing with acquisitions. And in the quarter, announced the acquisition of Barnett Associates, as Rick referenced earlier. With regards to the Veda acquisition, integration continues to go well, and we continue to expect 2016 revenue from Veda to be $230 million to $235 million, with adjusted EPS accretion from Veda at approximately $0.20 a share.
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

A quick summary before we go to Q&A. Some guidance, looking forward. 
For the third quarter, we're increasing our outlook for both revenue and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth between 22% and 24%, which is partially offset by 3 points of FX headwind.
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.33 and $1.36 for the quarter, which is up 17% to 19%. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency EPS growth for the third quarter of 19% to 22%.
With our strong second quarter performance and our outlook -- strong outlook for the third quarter, we are also increasing our full year outlook. 
For the full year, we expect revenue to now be between $3.13 billion and $3.16 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22%, partially offset, again, by 3 points of FX headwind. This is an improvement from the previous guidance we provided you, which was $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion, and increases our confidence that we will end the year nicely above the high end of a multi-year model of 6% to 8% of organic revenue growth.
From a revenue perspective, 2016, I think you'll agree, is shaping up nicely. Constant currency organic revenue growth of 11% in the fourth quarter -- first quarter, accelerated to 12% in second quarter. And we're holding in the range of 11% to 13% in the second half, to give us 2 years of double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth. This will also, as you might guess, give us good momentum as we go into 2017.
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be, now, between $5.35 and $5.40, which is up 19% to 20%, excluding approximately $0.12 per share for the full year of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency EPS growth for the year of 22% to 23%. This, too, is up from the $5.15 to $5.25 we guided to during our first quarter earnings call. And as John alluded to, we now expect our EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by 75 basis points as we have guided to earlier for the full year of 2016.
So with that, operator, we'd like to open up to any questions."

We could easily have moved that whole thing over to PSOL, then leave behind as a shrinking business, as you know. And with that came about 2 points of headwinds.

Specific to Credit Karma, yes, as you know, we have a contract with Credit Karma. That contract expires towards the end of this year. As is common practice with any good customer that we deal with, it's in both of our best interest to negotiate those contracts well before expiration and you might guess the team is doing that now. But beyond just that, we're looking at ways to enhance the partnership, add value to Credit Karma. And that value would be through things like insights that we provide, the unique data assets that we have, and an interest in partnering with them where it makes sense, in countries around the world where we've got very strong sizable platforms to help them expand their revenue streams beyond just the U.S. So all of those are being intertwined, as you might guess, in the discussion of a contract negotiation. And we remain very, very confident that we'll have a good resolution to the contract extension with Credit Karma."

But no, this -- and I think you know us well enough now -- our philosophy, when we think about relationships with clients, is to try to continue to add unique value and insights that make their business better, that make their revenue stronger, that make their profits stronger. If we can do things by leveraging capabilities we have that are unique to us, like the employment data, the income data, some fraud data, Cambrian. And I'd mentioned, I think, in my comments earlier, helping them get to countries that they want to get to that we are in and we are very significant players, as a way to make their business better and stronger. You wrap all those things together as we've done over the years, you tend to move away from price discussion or the value discussion. We do the same thing with them. By the way, they are a very, very good customer of ours, and I'd say even more than customer, they're a partner of ours.

During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.
For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Veda.
These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.

Third quarter was just another outstanding broad-based performance by the team. This really continues to impress me. The growth we had in the third quarter accelerated from the first half of the year and that added to our strong outperformance year-to-date. 
All the 4 business units continue to execute at a very high level, driving impressive expansion at our revenue, adjusted EBITDA margins and the bottom line results. 
For the quarter, total revenue was $804 million, up 20% on a reported basis and up 23% on a local currency basis from the third quarter of last year. 
Organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first half coming in strongly at 13%, up over last year. 
In the quarter, FX created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9% compared to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015, representing a very solid year-on-year increase and well above our annual 25 basis point target increase and the -- well above our 75 basis points expectation we have for the full year of 2016. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.44, up 26% from $1.14 in the third quarter last year and better than our expectations when we gave third quarter guidance back in July of this year. 
So let's jump to the individual BU, as always, I'll start with USIS. They delivered a solid 9% revenue growth, significant acceleration from the first half, driven by broad-based new product revenue, including trended data, and we can talk more about trended data in a second and we'll get it into the Q&A as well. 
Trended data now is a reality. As expected, Fannie Mae launched its desktop underwriter in late September and as we indicated in our second quarter call, billing for trended data began in August for all mortgage-related inquiries. Revenue for the third quarter largely came in as we had expected. 
We have a very good relationship with Fannie Mae, and initiated a discussion on trended data with them nearly 3 years ago. We continue to see opportunities to work with Fannie and transforming the mortgage space, including the announcement just this week of a launch of Fannie's desktop underwriter validation services, which incorporates verified consumer income and employment information from Workforce Solutions. We believe that will be a nice catalyst for continued growth for EWS going forward. 
Additionally, from our data and analytics team, they continue its efforts in -- to completed a variety of analyses to assess the lift from trended data for other decisioning activities. We've talked to you about that in the past. It's really going to granular levels by vertical, by subvertical, by unique data assets and understanding what the lists is. In catalyst, trended data provides approximately a 15% lift in assessing prime accounts for the propensity to open a home equity loan and a 20% lift in assessing prime accounts with default risk on home equity loans. 
With the advent of Cambrian, which you're familiar with, we now have an analytical environment containing over 80 months or more of the historical data across many of our unique data assets. 
Data Cambrian is a nonproduction environment providing unparallel ability to deliver compelling customer insights. But today, we building analytics and insights on trended data is 80 months or more, including the credit file and other unique data assets. In 2017, we're going to move the 24 months of trended data we have for the credit file to significantly beyond the 24 months in the production environment. I think that will open up a whole new realm of opportunities the work of our customers and solve problems that we couldn't solve before. 
Second, with USIS on September 30, we reached a long-term agreement with SBFE to become a certified vendor. We now will be able to combine our CFN, Commercial Financial Network, data assets with SBFE data to deliver best-in-class solutions for small business information customers. 
USIS is expected to deliver revenue growth for the fourth quarter at the high end of the targeted range, which we communicated, it's 5% to 7% and EBITDA margins will continue to be above 50% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
International. They continue to make great progress on its most -- on their most important strategic initiative while delivering third quarter local currency revenue growth of 60% and organic local currency revenue growth of 10%. 
In the quarter reported, adjusted -- in the quarter they reported, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by over 200 basis points from the year prior. Data integration continues to go well and remains on schedule. Some [indiscernible] bullets [indiscernible] we talked before our global platform deployments into Veda, which includes Cambrian and [ph], our fraud platform, are underway and expected to be operational in mid-2017. 
The NPI process has been established, the local leadership team and will be incorporating the Veda NPI revenue into our Vitality Index beginning in 2017. 
We've also identified a number of opportunities to export some of Veda's products to other international geographies. Debt placement from the U.K. government is now up to GBP 1.6 billion and our promotional date is exceeding the baseline performance we had established. 
We now have all 6 founding agencies of the U.K. government boarded and have analytical projects underway with 2 additional agencies. While the initiative is still in the early stages, we're extremely pleased with both our relationship with the U.K. agencies and the financial results we're delivering. 
Organic revenue in international's 5 largest verticals, FI, telco, government, retail and auto. In aggregate, it was up 13% for the quarter. International decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue were 19% in the quarter. This high-value -- the high-value solutions continues strengthen our relationships with customers and our market position. 
In the coming quarters, we will easily more sophisticated technology platforms i.e., InterConnect, our platform and Cambrian throughout our international footprint to drive future revenue growth. 
Canada continues to grow very good momentum with trended data. In the third quarter, we launched Cambrian platform, which will further enhance our competitive position with best-in-class solutions, leveraging trended data. 
International is expected to deliver organic constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full year, above the upper end of the long-term model of 8% to 10%. 
Reported revenue growth for 2016 is expected to approach 55% and adjusted EBITDA margins should increase sequentially and exit the year approaching 30%. 
Workforce Solutions, a strong moment has resulted in another outstanding performance in the third quarter, with 23% revenue growth and a 350 basis point expansion in the EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Total records in the Work Number database now approaches our short-term goal of $300 million with over 6,600 different data contributors to that database. Our initiative is to further penetrate key verticals lead to strong double-digit growth in mortgage, auto, government and preemployment, to name a few. 
Revenue from our health care vertical comprised of income and employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics from porters grew over 240% in the quarter. 
In the quarter, Workforce Solutions completed the acquisition of Barnet/VJS, a small regional provider of employment and income verification and unemployment insurance services, to further accelerate the growth of the Work Number database. It's early days, that's going very well. 
As I stated earlier this week, a little more color around Fannie Mae, they announced the integration of our full suite of employment and income verification services into their desktop underwriting platform. The employment and income verification Services includes data from Workforce Solutions that work number database providing instant and waterfall employment and income verification services. 
With these services, our earnings cycle times will be reduced and the lender's reliance on applicant providing W-2, [ph] or other income or documentation will be eliminated, and this gives them protection should they not perform protection from having the banks put the mortgages back to them. So it's a great benefit for EWS. 
Workforce Solutions is having an outstanding year in 2016 both organic and reported revenue growth are expected to exceed 15% in the fourth quarter and 20% for 2016, substantially above the long-term range of 9% to 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be nicely over 45% for the fourth quarter 2016 and high 40s for the full year. Global Consumer Solutions continues their great aggressive on strategic initiatives particularly noting strong market is and in both the DTC reseller and Indirect markets that include partnerships with a number of very successful companies that we've talked about before, such as Credit Karma, Life Lock, H&R Block and others. 
We're pleased to announce we have executed a new longer-term partnership with Credit Karma. The new and expanded partnership is focused on growing both of our businesses by leveraging unique data assets, innovation and analytics, including the use of our Cambrian platform and expanding our partnerships beyond the borders of the U.S. 
This quarter, we deployed our new Global Consumer platform called renaissance, a best-in-class SaaS-based e-commerce platform, which provides much greater marketing facility sort of our partners. During the quarter, we successfully transitioned one of our largest customers to this new platform and by the end of 2017, we will deploy this platform across all portions of our U.S. business and will be well in our way to deploying it across other geographies in which we operate. 
Global Consumer Solutions is expected to deliver fourth quarter and full year 2016 constant currency revenue growth exceeding 15% with fourth quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA margin at approximately 30%. 
A few high-level points at the corporate level before John gets into the financial details. As we're talking about before, this is so important into our culture, now results. First is our enterprise growth initiatives, which are our largest and most complex growth initiatives we have. They're performing very well in 2016, with revenue generation projected to be up over 35% from our expectations earlier this year and over 3x the revenue generated from AGI in 2015. 
Our overall performance in new product innovations, initiatives in 2016 is also outstanding. The 3-year revenue of our 2016 launches is expected to be more than 170% above the expected 3-year revenue on 2015 launches. This is the strongest NPI performance we've had since it was built and created some 10 years ago. 
Our Vitality Index that held last year and the pipeline of new products continues to be very robust. To date, we've launched approximately 40 new products and expect to launch another 20 products before year-end. 
In summary, our strategic initiatives continue to perform well and are ahead of our expectations that we have at the beginning of the year. With this continued focus on improving the process, allows us to drive continuous growth, expect these business will continue to drive and deliver incremental revenue growth in 2017 and beyond. 
So with that, John?"

As before, I will generally refer to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. As a reminder, following the Veda acquisition, we started focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin. So we'll consistently present the operating of the segments and the company as a whole. The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Now let me turn to the business units financial performance for the third quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $317 million, up 9% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Online Information Solutions revenue was $230 million, up 7% when compared to the year-ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 39% in the quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index growth accelerated significantly, up 35% in the third quarter compared to the 20% growth we saw in the second quarter. 
Given a much stronger mortgage market performance on 3Q '16 and continued accommodated interest rate environment, we now expect the mortgage market to grow solidly double-digit in 2016. 
Financial marketing services revenue was $48 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago quarter. Our commercial products suite grew 8% in 3Q. We have made great progress building the Equifax commercial financial network, which includes trade line data from banking and other financial institutions similar to BFE, as well as communications and utilities, wholesale trade, printing, publishing and chemicals and other products and rental and leasing data. 
When combined Equifax consumer credit data, we can offer substantially differentiated data analytics to our U.S. commercial customers. 
Identity and Fraud Solutions also continue to grow strongly, up 19% in 3Q and 23% year-to-date. USIS direct-to-consumer revenue principally our revenue with other CRAs was down over 20% in the quarter and largely in line with the first half. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions in 3Q '16 was 50.6%, up from 49.9% in the third quarter of 2015. Workforce Solutions revenue was $171 million for the quarter, up 23% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $115 million was also up 23% and continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and preemployment. 
Employer Services revenue of $57 million was up 23% from last year as well. Revenue growth from unemployment insurance, I-9, tax incentives and other HR services was consistent with annual model of mid-single digit growth. 
ACA analytics revenue was up substantially in the quarter versus 3Q '15, driving much of the growth. As we had indicated previously, ACA analytics revenue was down sequentially and from the first half run rate. As expected, given that the ACA business is seasonal with higher revenue in the first half of the year when 1095 are delivered to employees. 
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%, up from 43.5% in 3Q '15 and in line with our expectations. Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions are total U.S. B2B revenue was $489 million, representing organic growth of 13%. 
International's revenue was $214 million, up 47% on a reported basis and 60% on a local currency basis when compared to 3Q '15. Organic constant currency revenue growth was approximately 10%. 
By region, Europe's revenue was $62 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency. We have seen some moderate impact on local currency revenue following the Brexit vote, with selected large U.K. financial solutions. 
Debt management grew nicely in the quarter as our relationship with the U.K. government continues to perform as we had expected. The sharp depreciation of the British pound following the Brexit vote in late July significantly impacted U.S. dollar revenue growth in the region for the third quarter. 
The almost 7% decline in the British pound in early October will further impact 4Q '16 U.S. dollar revenue growth. Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars but up 9% in local currency. The over 60% depreciation of the Argentinian peso from late December of 2015 through March of '16 has negatively impacted the U.S. dollar performance of our largest and most profitable country in the region. 
Asia Pacific revenue was $74 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda. Canada revenue was $32 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currency. Canada continues to perform in line with our expectations, including substantial improvements and the New Product Innovation initiatives, which includes trended data. 
For the third quarter, international's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 26.2% in 3Q '15. On a constant currency basis, margins expanded over 300 basis points versus 3Q '15 and almost 50 basis points sequentially. As Rick indicated, 4Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase sequentially and approach 30% in 4Q '16. 
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $101 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis. Growth, again, was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers. For the third quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%, in line with our expectations. The adjusted EBITDA margin was down from 30.8% in 3Q '15, but up significantly from the 26.4% in 2Q '16 when we were boarding LifeLock. 
In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $52 million consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, total general corporate expense is expected to be slightly above $55 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9%, up 130 basis points from 34.6% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins reflect year-over-year growth in USIS, Workforce Solutions and international. 
We expect the fourth [ph] Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margin to be above Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin and our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin to be up more than 100 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015. 
As Rick mentioned before, this is nicely above the target for 2016 of a 75 basis point expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter at 29.1% was below the anticipated level of 32.5%, which we communicated during our July earnings call. 
The lower effective tax rate reflects several discrete or onetime items, which benefited our effective tax rate by over 3 percentage points and our adjusted EPS by about $0.05 a share. 
Our current expectation is that Q4 tax rate will be approximately 32.5%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48 million and year-to-date are $131 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be about 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range as investments are made related to our integration of Veda. 
Year-to-date, operating cash flow remain strong at $525 million. Total debt in the quarter was $2.86 billion. We continue to reduce our leverage following the Veda acquisition, which is now down at 2.58x. Our target is to reduce leverage back to approximately 2.25x EBITDA, which we expect to occur in 2017. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."
175749,403276336,1062983,"Equifax Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Of course, you agree, 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company.

Of course, you agree, 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company. Strong and consistent execution throughout the companies resulted in broad-based performance significantly exceeded expectations we had at the beginning of the year. We firmly this positions us well for growth in 2017. 
For the fourth quarter, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $797 million and $801 million. The effect in constant currency revenue growth of just over 22%, partially offset by about 2% of FX headwind. This reflects organic growth of over 12%. The almost 7% depreciation in the U.K. pound in early October, which John just referenced, resulted in the majority of the incremental $6 million of FX headwind versus our expectations for the fourth quarter when we gave guidance back in July. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.35 and $1.38, which is up 18% to 21% for the fourth quarter. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative FX, this reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 21% to 24%. 
With this outlook, our second half organic constant currency growth is approximately 12% and in line with the outlook we gave in the second half revenue growth during our second quarter earnings call, which I recall which we guided to 11% to 13%. 
For the year now, we expect revenue to be approximately $3.145 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of approximately 21%, partially offset by 3% of FX headwind. 
Adjusting for the significant depreciation and FX, principally the British pound, this is at the high-end of the guidance we provided in July. This is also impressive performance but it's a more when compared to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. For revenue, as you recall, we guided more than $3 billion, $3.1 billion in revenue. 
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.45 and $5.48, which is up 21% to 22%. Excluding approximately $0.14 per share full year negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency of adjusted EPS growth of 24% to 25%. This is up significantly from the guidance we provided you in July and compares favorably to the guidance we gave to the beginning of the year of our adjusted EPS, which you remember was $4.95 to $5.05. 
For the year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by over 100 basis points up from the previous expectations, which were 75 basis points. As we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term constant currency financial model of total revenue growth of 7% to 10% per year with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%. 
As we look to 2017, considering all the acquisitions closed to-date, which to refresh your memory, Veda and the small Barnett acquisition, we expect to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our total growth model. As it's too early to make a call in the U.S. mortgage market, this is the U.S. mortgage market will be largely flat in 2017. And as always, we'll provide you more detail on our outlook 2017 during our February call. 
But at this point in time, with the way the team is executing on the growth initiatives in EGI and NPI, we remain very bullish throughout [indiscernible] 2017.

During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.
For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.

For the corporation, we'll get into some details of the business unit level. John will go through the financial details. I'll come back with some closing comments before questions. 
Third quarter was just another outstanding broad-based performance by the team. This really continues to impress me. The growth we had in the third quarter accelerated from the first half of the year that added to our strong outperformance year-to-date. 
All our 4 business units continue to execute at a very high level, driving impressive expansion at our revenue, adjusted EBITDA margins and the bottom line results. 
For the quarter, total revenue was $804 million, up 20% on reported basis and up 23% on a local currency basis from the third quarter of last year. 
Organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first half coming in strongly at 13%, up over last year. 
In the quarter, FX created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9% compared to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015, representing a very solid year-on-year increase and well above our annual 25-basis-point target increase and the -- well above our 75-basis-point expectation we have for the full year of 2016. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.44, up 26% from $1.14 in the third quarter last year and better than our expectations when we gave third quarter guidance back in July of this year. 
So let's jump in to the individual BU's. As always, I'll start with USIS. They had delivered a solid 9% revenue growth, significant acceleration from the first half, driven by broad-based new product revenue, including trended data. We can talk more about trended data in a second and we'll get it into the Q&A as well. 
Trended data now is a reality. As expected, Fannie Mae launched its desktop underwriter in late September and as we indicated during our second quarter call, billing for trended data began in August for all mortgage-related inquiries. Revenue for the third quarter largely came in as we had expected. 
We have a very good relationship with Fannie Mae, and initiated a discussion on trended data with them nearly 3 years ago. We continue to see opportunities to work with Fannie in transforming the mortgage space, including the announcement just this week of a launch of Fannie's desktop underwriter validation services, which incorporates verified consumer income and employment information from Workforce Solutions. We believe that will be a nice catalyst for continued revenue growth for EWS going forward. 
Additionally, from our data and analytics team, they continue its efforts in -- to completed a variety of analyses to assess the lift from trended data for other decisioning activities. We've talked to you about that in the past. It's really getting on the granular levels by vertical, by subvertical, by unique data assets and understanding what the lifts is. In catalyst, trended data provides approximately a 15% lift in assessing prime accounts for the propensity to open a home equity loan and a 20% lift in assessing prime accounts with default risk on home equity loans. 
With the advent of Cambrian, which you're familiar with, we now have an analytical environment containing over 80 months or more of the historical data across many of our unique data assets. 
Data Cambrian is a nonproduction environment providing unparallel ability to deliver compelling customer insights. But today, we're onto building analytics and insights on trended data is 80 months or more, including the credit file and other unique data assets. In 2017, we're going to move the 24 months of trended data we have for the credit file to significantly beyond the 24 months in the production environment. I think that will open up a whole new realm of opportunities to work with our customers and solve problems that we couldn't solve before. 
Second, with USIS on September 30, we reached a long-term agreement with SBFE to become a certified vendor. We now will be able to combine our CFN, Commercial Financial Network data assets with SBFE data to deliver best-in-class solutions for small business information customers. 
USIS is expected to deliver revenue growth for the fourth quarter at the high-end of the targeted range, which we communicated, it's 5% to 7%. And EBITDA margins will continue to be above 50% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
International. They continue to make great progress on its most -- on their most important strategic initiatives while delivering third quarter local currency revenue growth of 60% and organic local currency revenue growth of 10%. 
In the quarter reported, adjusted -- In the quarter, they reported, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by over 200 basis points from the year prior. Veda integration continues to go well and remains on schedule. Some sub-bullets [ph] under Veda where we talked before our global platform deployments into Veda, which includes Cambrian and  [indiscernible], our fraud platform, are underway and expected to be operational in mid-2017. 
The NPI process has been established with the local leadership team and will be incorporating the Veda NPI revenue into our Vitality Index beginning in 2017. 
We've also identified a number of opportunities to export some of Veda's products to other international geographies. Debt placement from the U.K. government is now up to GBP 1.6 billion. And our performance year-to-date, it's exceeding the baseline performance we had established.  
We now have all 6 founding agencies of the U.K. government boarded and have analytical projects underway with 2 additional agencies. While the initiative is still in the early stages, we're extremely pleased with both our relationship with the U.K. agencies and the financial results we're delivering. 
Organic revenue in international's 5 largest verticals, FI, telco, government, retail and auto. In aggregate, it was up 13% for the quarter. International decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue were 19% in the quarter. This high-value -- the high-value solutions continues to strengthen our relationships with customers and our market position. 
In the coming quarters, we will be installing more sophisticated technology platforms i.e., InterConnect, our [indiscernible] platform and Cambrian throughout our international footprint to drive future revenue growth. 
Canada continues to grow very good momentum with trended data. In the third quarter, we launched Cambrian platform, which will further enhance our competitive position with best-in-class solutions, leveraging trended data. 
International is expected to deliver organic constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full year, above the upper end of this long-term model of 8% to 10%. 
Reported revenue growth for 2016 is expected to approach 55%.  Adjusted EBITDA margins should increase sequentially and exit the year approaching 30%. 
Workforce Solutions' strong moment has resulted in another outstanding performance in the third quarter, with 23% revenue growth and a 350-basis-point expansion in the EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Total records in the Work Number database now approaches our short-term goal of $300 million with over 6,600 different data contributors to that database. Our initiatives that further penetrate key verticals, lead a strong double-digit growth in mortgage, auto, government and preemployment, to name a few. 
Revenue from our health care vertical comprised of income and employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics from employers grew over 240% in the quarter. 
In the quarter, Workforce Solutions completed the acquisition of Barnett/VJS, a small regional provider of employment and income verification and unemployment insurance services, to further accelerate the growth of the Work Number database. Early days, that's going very well. 
As I stated earlier this week, a little more color around Fannie Mae, they announced the integration of our full suite of employment and income verification services into their desktop underwriting platform. The employment and income verification services includes data from Workforce Solutions with Work Number database providing instant and waterfall employment and income verification services. 
With these services, our earnings cycle times will be reduced and the lender's reliance on applicant providing W-2, pay stubs or other income or documentations will be eliminated, and this gives them protection since they normally is not performing a protection from having the banks put the mortgages back to them. So it's a great benefit for EWS. 
Workforce Solutions is having an outstanding year in 2016 both organic and reported revenue growth are expected to exceed 15% in the fourth quarter and 20% for 2016, substantially above this long-term range of 9% to 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be nicely over 45% for the fourth quarter 2016 and the high 40s for the full year. Global Consumer Solutions continues to make great progress on strategic initiatives particularly building out a strong market position in both DTC reseller and indirect markets that include partnerships with a number of very successful companies that we've talked about before, such as Credit Karma, LifeLock, H&R Block and others. 
We're pleased to announce we have executed a new longer-term partnership with Credit Karma. The new and expanded partnership is focused on growing both of our businesses by leveraging unique data assets, innovation and analytics, including the use of our Cambrian platform and expanding our partnerships beyond the borders of the U.S. 
This quarter, we deployed our new Global Consumer platform called renaissance, a best-in-class SaaS-based e-commerce platform, which provides much greater marketing flexibility to serve our partners. During the quarter, we successfully transitioned one of our largest customers to this new platform and by the end of 2017, we will deploy this newest platform across all portions of our U.S. business and will be well in our way to deploying it across other geographies in which we operate. 
Global Consumer Solutions is expected to deliver fourth quarter and full year 2016 constant currency revenue growth exceeding 15% with fourth quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA margin at approximately 30%. 
Few high-level points at the corporate level before John gets into the financial details. As we're talking about before, this is so important to our culture and our results. First is our enterprise growth initiatives, which are our largest and most complex growth initiatives we have. They're performing very well in 2016, with revenue generation projected to be up over 35% from our expectations earlier this year and over 3x the revenue generated from EGI in 2015. 
Our overall performance in new product innovations, initiatives in 2016 is also outstanding. The 3-year revenue of our 2016 launches is expected to be more than 170% above the expected 3-year revenue from out 2015 launches. This is the strongest NPI performance we've had since it was built and created some 10 years ago. 
Our Vitality Index that held last year and the pipeline of new products continues to be very robust. To date, we've launched approximately 40 new products and expect to launch another 20 products before year-end. 
In summary, our strategic initiatives continue to perform well and are ahead of our expectations that we have at the beginning of the year. With this continued focus on improving the process, allows us to drive continuous growth. I expect these initiatives will continue to drive and deliver incremental revenue growth in 2017 and beyond. 
So with that, John?"

As before, I will generally refer to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. As a reminder, following the Veda acquisition, we started focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin. So we'll consistently present the operating of the segments and the company as a whole. The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Now, let me turn to the business units financial performance for the third quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $317 million, up 9% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Online Information Solutions revenue was $230 million, up 7% when compared to the year-ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 39% in the quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index growth accelerated significantly, up 35% in the third quarter compared to the 20% growth we saw in the second quarter. 
Given a much stronger mortgage market performance on 3Q '16 and continued accommodated interest rate environment, we now expect the mortgage market to grow solidly double-digit in 2016. 
Financial marketing services revenue was $48 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago quarter. Our commercial products suite grew 8% in 3Q. We have made great progress building the Equifax commercial financial network, which includes tradeline data from banking and other financial institutions similar to the SBFE, as well as communications and utilities, wholesale trade, printing, publishing, chemicals and alloy products and rental and leasing data. 
When combined with Equifax consumer credit data, we can now offer substantially differentiated data and analytics to our U.S. commercial customers. 
Identity and Fraud Solutions also continue to grow strongly, up 19% in 3Q and 23% year-to-date. USIS direct-to-consumer revenue, principally our revenue with other CRAs, was down over 20% in the quarter and largely in line with the first half. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions in 3Q '16 was 50.6%, up from 49.9% in the third quarter of 2015. Workforce Solutions revenue was $171 million for the quarter, up 23% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $115 million was also up 23% and continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and preemployment. 
Employer Services revenue of $57 million was up 23% from last year as well. Revenue growth from unemployment insurance, I-9, tax incentives and other HR services was consistent with the annual model of mid-single digit growth. 
ACA analytics revenue was up substantially in the quarter versus 3Q '15, driving much of the growth. As we had indicated previously, ACA analytics revenue was down sequentially and from the first half run rate. As expected, given that the ACA business is seasonal with higher revenue in the first half of the year when 1095s are delivered to employees. 
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%, up from 43.5% in 3Q '15 and in line with our expectations. Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions are total U.S. B2B revenue was $489 million, representing organic growth of 13%. 
International's revenue was $214 million, up 47% on a reported basis and 60% on a local currency basis when compared to 3Q '15. Organic constant currency revenue growth was approximately 10%. 
By region, Europe's revenue was $62 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency. We have seen some moderate impact on local currency revenue following the Brexit vote, with selected large U.K. financial institutions. 
Debt management grew nicely in the quarter as our relationship with the U.K. government continues to perform as we had expected. The sharp depreciation of the British pound following the Brexit vote in late July significantly impacted U.S. dollar revenue growth in the region for the third quarter. 
The almost 7% decline in the British pound in early October will further impact 4Q '16 U.S. dollar revenue growth. Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars but up 9% in local currency. The over 60% depreciation of the Argentinian peso from late December of 2015 through March of '16 has negatively impacted the U.S. dollar performance of our largest and most profitable country in the regions. 
Asia Pacific revenue was $74 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda. Canada revenue was $32 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currency. Canada continues to perform in line with our expectations, including substantial improvements and the New Product Innovation initiatives, which includes trended data. 
For the third quarter, international's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 26.2% in 3Q '15. On a constant currency basis, margins expanded over 300 basis points versus 3Q '15 and almost 50 basis points sequentially. As Rick indicated, 4Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase sequentially and approach 30% in 4Q '16. 
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $101 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis. Growth, again, was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers. For the third quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%, in line with our expectations. The adjusted EBITDA margin was down from 30.8% in 3Q '15, but up significantly from the 26.4% in 2Q '16 when we were boarding LifeLock. 
In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $52 million consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, total general corporate expense is expected to be slightly above $55 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9%, up 130 basis points from 34.6% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins reflects year-over-year growth in USIS, Workforce Solutions and international. 
We expect the fourth Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margin to be above Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin and our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin to be up more than 100 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015. 
As Rick mentioned before, this is nicely above the target for 2016 of a 75-basis-point expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter at 29.1% was below the anticipated level of 32.5%, which we communicated during our July earnings call. 
The lower effective tax rate reflects several discrete or onetime items, which benefited our effective tax rate by over 3 percentage points and our adjusted EPS by about $0.05 a share. 
Our current expectation is that Q4 tax rate will be approximately 32.5%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48 million and year-to-date are $131 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be about 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range as investments are made related to our integration of Veda. 
Year-to-date, operating cash flow remained strong at $525 million. Total debt in the quarter was $2.86 billion. We continue to reduce our leverage following the Veda acquisition, which is now down at 2.58x. Our target is to reduce leverage back to approximately 2.25x EBITDA, which we expect to occur in 2017. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

Of course, you agree, 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company. Strong and consistent execution throughout the companies resulted in a broad-based performance that significantly exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. We firmly believe this positions us well for growth in 2017. 
For the fourth quarter, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $797 million and $801 million. The effect in constant currency revenue growth of just over 22%, partially offset by about 2% of FX headwind. This reflects organic growth of over 12%. The almost 7% depreciation in the U.K. pound in early October, which John just referenced, resulted in the majority of the incremental $6 million of FX headwind versus our expectations for the fourth quarter when we gave guidance back in July. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.35 and $1.38, which is up 18% to 21% for the fourth quarter. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative FX, this reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 21% to 24%. 
With this outlook, our second half organic constant currency growth is approximately 12% and in line with the outlook we gave in the second half revenue growth during our second quarter earnings call, which you will recall, which we guided to 11% to 13%. 
For the year now, we expect revenue to be approximately $3.145 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of approximately 21%, partially offset by 3% of FX headwind. 
Adjusting for the significant depreciation and FX, principally the British pound, this is at the high-end of the guidance we provided in July. This is also impressive performance by the team when compared to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. For revenue, as you recall, we guided more than $3 billion, $3.1 billion in revenue. 
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.45 and $5.48, which is up 21% to 22%. Excluding approximately $0.14 per share full year with negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency of adjusted EPS growth of 24% to 25%. This is up significantly from the guidance we provided you in July and compares favorably from the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year for adjusted EPS, which you remember was $4.95 to $5.05. 
For the year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by over 100 basis points up from the previous expectations, which were 75 basis points. As we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term constant currency financial model of total revenue growth of 7% to 10% per year with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%. 
As we look to 2017, considering all of the acquisitions closed to-date, which to refresh your memory were Veda and the small Barnett acquisition, we expect to achieve revenue growth at the high-end of our total growth model. As it's too early to make a call in the U.S. mortgage market, this assumes the the U.S. mortgage market will be largely flat in 2017. And as always, we'll provide you more detail on our outlook for 2017 during our February call. 
But at this point in time, with the way the team is executing on the growth initiatives in EGI and NPI, we remain very bullish throughout this in 2017.

During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.
For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.

For the corporation, we'll get into some details of the business unit level. John will go through the financial details. I'll come back with some closing comments before questions. 
Third quarter was just another outstanding broad-based performance by the team. This really continues to impress me. The growth we had in the third quarter accelerated from the first half of the year that added to our strong outperformance year-to-date. 
All our 4 business units continue to execute at a very high level, driving impressive expansion in our revenue, adjusted EBITDA margins and the bottom line results. 
For the quarter, total revenue was $804 million, up 20% on reported basis and up 23% on a local currency basis from the third quarter of last year. 
Organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first half coming in strongly at 13%, up over last year. 
In the quarter, FX created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9% compared to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015, representing a very solid year-on-year increase and well above our annual 25-basis-point target increase and the -- well above our 75-basis-point expectation we have for the full year of 2016. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.44, up 26% from $1.14 in the third quarter last year and better than our expectations when we gave third quarter guidance back in July of this year. 
So let me jump in to the individual BU's. As always, I'll start with USIS. They had delivered a solid 9% revenue growth, significant acceleration from the first half, driven by broad-based new product revenue, including trended data. We can talk more about trended data in a second and we'll get into it the Q&A as well. 
Trended data now is a reality. As expected, Fannie Mae launched its desktop underwriter in late September and as we indicated during our second quarter call, billing for trended data began in August for all mortgage-related inquiries. Revenue for the third quarter largely came in as we had expected. 
We have a very good relationship with Fannie Mae, and initiated discussions on trended data with them nearly 3 years ago. We continue to see opportunities to work with Fannie in transforming the mortgage space, including the announcement just this week of a launch of Fannie's desktop underwriter validation services, which incorporates verified consumer income and employment information from Workforce Solutions. We believe that will be a nice catalyst for continued mortgage growth for EWS going forward. 
Additionally, from our data and analytics team, they continue its efforts in -- to completed a variety of analyses to assess the lift from trended data for other decisioning activities. We've talked to you about that in the past. It's really getting on the granular levels by vertical, by subvertical, by unique data assets and understanding what the lifts is. In catalyst, trended data provides approximately a 15% lift in assessing prime accounts for the propensity to open a home equity loan and a 20% lift in assessing prime accounts for default risk on home equity loans. 
With the advent of Cambrian, which you're familiar with, we now have an analytical environment containing over 80 months or more of the historical data across many of our unique data assets. 
Data Cambrian is a nonproduction environment providing unparallelled ability to deliver compelling customer insights. But today, we're onto building analytics and insights on trended data is 80 months or more, including the credit file and other unique data assets. In 2017, we're going to move the 24 months of trended data we have in the credit file to significantly beyond the 24 months in the production environment. I think that will open up a whole new realm of opportunities to work with our customers and solve problems that we couldn't solve before. 
Second, with USIS on September 30, we reached a long-term agreement with SBFE to become a certified vendor. We now will be able to combine our CFN, Commercial Financial Network data assets with SBFE data to deliver best-in-class solutions for small business information customers. 
USIS is expected to deliver revenue growth for the fourth quarter at the high-end of the targeted range, which we communicated as 5% to 7%. And EBITDA margins will continue to be above 50% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
International. They continue to make great progress on its most -- on their most important strategic initiatives while delivering third quarter local currency revenue growth of 60% and organic local currency revenue growth of 10%. 
In the quarter reported, adjusted -- In the quarter, they reported, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by over 200 basis points from the year prior. Veda integration continues to go well and remains on schedule. Some sub-bullets under Veda where we talked before our global platform deployments into Veda, which includes Cambrian and Ostra [ph], our fraud platform, are underway and expected to be operational in mid-2017. 
The NPI process has been established with the local leadership team and will be incorporating the Veda NPI revenue into our Vitality Index beginning in 2017. 
We've also identified a number of opportunities to export some of Veda's products to other international geographies. Debt placement from the U.K. government is now up to GBP 1.6 billion. And our performance year-to-date, it's exceeding the baseline performance we had established.  
We now have all 6 founding agencies of the U.K. government boarded and have analytical projects underway with 2 additional agencies. While the initiative is still in the early stages, we're extremely pleased with both our relationship with the U.K. agencies and the financial results we're delivering. 
Organic revenue in international's 5 largest verticals, FI, telco, government, retail and auto. In aggregate, was up 13% for the quarter. International decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew 19% in the quarter. This high-value -- the high-value solutions continues to strengthen our relationships with customers and our market position. 
In the coming quarters, we will be installing more sophisticated technology platforms i.e., InterConnect, our Ostra [ph] platform and Cambrian throughout our international footprint drive future revenue growth. 
Canada continues to grow very good momentum with trended data. In the third quarter, we launched Cambrian platform, which will further enhance our competitive position with best-in-class solutions, leveraging trended data. 
International is expected to deliver organic constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full year, above the upper end of this long-term model of 8% to 10%. 
Reported revenue growth for 2016 is expected to approach 55%.  Adjusted EBITDA margins should increase sequentially and exit the year approaching 30%. 
Workforce Solutions' strong moment has resulted in another outstanding performance in the third quarter, with 23% revenue growth and a 350-basis-point expansion in the EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Total records in the Work Number database now approaches our short-term goal of $300 million with over 6,600 different data contributors to that database. Our initiatives to further penetrate key verticals led to strong double-digit growth in mortgage, auto, government and preemployment, to name a few. 
Revenue from our health care vertical comprised of income and employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics from employers grew over 240% in the quarter. 
In the quarter, Workforce Solutions completed the acquisition of Barnett/VJS, a small regional provider of employment and income verification and unemployment insurance services, to further accelerate the growth of the Work Number database. It's early days but it's going very well. 
As I stated earlier this week, a little more color around Fannie Mae, they announced the integration of our full suite of employment and income verification services into their desktop underwriting platform. The employment and income verification services includes data from Workforce Solutions with Work Number database providing instant and waterfall employment and income verification services. 
With these services, our earnings cycle times will be reduced and the lender's reliance on applicant providing W-2, pay stubs or other income or documentations will be eliminated, and this gives them protection should a mortgage not perform and protects them from having the banks put the mortgages back to them. So it's a great benefit for EWS. 
Workforce Solutions is having an outstanding year in 2016 both organic and reported revenue growth are expected to exceed 15% in the fourth quarter and 20% for 2016, substantially above it's long-term range of 9% to 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be nicely over 45% for the fourth quarter 2016 and the high 40s for the full year. Global Consumer Solutions continues to make great progress on strategic initiatives particularly building out a strong market position in both DTC reseller and indirect markets that include partnerships with a number of very successful companies that we've talked about before, such as Credit Karma, LifeLock, H&R Block and others. 
We're pleased to announce we have executed a new longer-term partnership with Credit Karma. The new and expanded partnership is focused on growing both of our businesses by leveraging unique data assets, innovation and analytics, including the use of our Cambrian platform and expanding our partnerships beyond the borders of the U.S. 
This quarter, we deployed our new Global Consumer platform called renaissance, a best-in-class SaaS-based e-commerce platform, which provides much greater marketing flexibility to serve our partners. During the quarter, we successfully transitioned one of our largest customers to this new platform and by the end of 2017, we will have deployed this newest platform across all portions of our U.S. business and will be well in our way to deploying it across other geographies in which we operate. 
Global Consumer Solutions is expected to deliver fourth quarter and full year 2016 constant currency revenue growth exceeding 15% with fourth quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA margin at approximately 30%. 
Few high-level points at the corporate level before John gets into the financial details. Things we've talked to you about before that's so important to our culture and our results. First is our enterprise growth initiatives, which are our largest and most complex growth initiatives we have. They're performing very well in 2016, with revenue generation projected to be up over 35% from our expectations earlier this year and over 3x the revenue generated from EGI in 2015. 
Our overall performance in new product innovations, initiatives in 2016 is also outstanding. The 3-year revenue from our 2016 launches is expected to be more than 170% above the expected 3-year revenue from out 2015 launches. This is the strongest NPI performance we've had since it was built and created some 10 years ago. 
Our Vitality Index we had last year and the pipeline of new products continues to be very robust. To date, we've launched approximately 40 new products and expect to launch another 20 products before year-end. 
In summary, our strategic initiatives continue to perform well and are ahead of our expectations that we had at the beginning of the year. With this continued focus on improving the process, allows us to drive continuous growth. I expect these initiatives will continue to drive and deliver incremental revenue growth in 2017 and beyond. 
So with that, John?"

Given a much stronger mortgage market performance on 3Q '16 and continued accommodative  interest rate environment, we now expect the mortgage market to grow solidly double-digit in 2016. 
Financial marketing services revenue was $48 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago quarter. Our commercial products suite grew 8% in 3Q. We have made great progress building the Equifax commercial financial network, which includes tradeline data from banking and other financial institutions similar to the SBFE, as well as communications and utilities, wholesale trade, printing, publishing, chemicals and allied products and rental and leasing data. 
When combined with Equifax consumer credit data, we can now offer substantially differentiated data and analytics to our U.S. commercial customers. 
Identity and Fraud Solutions also continue to grow strongly, up 19% in 3Q and 23% year-to-date. USIS direct-to-consumer revenue, principally our revenue with other CRAs, was down over 20% in the quarter and largely in line with the first half. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions in 3Q '16 was 50.6%, up from 49.9% in the third quarter of 2015. Workforce Solutions revenue was $171 million for the quarter, up 23% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $115 million was also up 23% and continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and preemployment. 
Employer Services revenue of $57 million was up 23% from last year as well. Revenue growth from unemployment insurance, I-9, tax incentives and other HR services was consistent with the annual model of mid-single digit growth. 
ACA analytics revenue was up substantially in the quarter versus 3Q '15, driving much of the growth. As we had indicated previously, ACA analytics revenue was down sequentially and from the first half run rate. As expected, given that the ACA business is seasonal with higher revenue in the first half of the year when 1095s are delivered to employees. 
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%, up from 43.5% in 3Q '15 and in line with our expectations. Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions, our total U.S. B2B revenue was $489 million, representing organic growth of 13%. 
International's revenue was $214 million, up 47% on a reported basis and 60% on a local currency basis when compared to 3Q '15. Organic constant currency revenue growth was approximately 10%. 
By region, Europe's revenue was $62 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency. We have seen some moderate impact on local currency revenue following the Brexit vote, with selected large U.K. financial institutions. 
Debt management grew nicely in the quarter as our relationship with the U.K. government continues to perform as we had expected. The sharp depreciation of the British pound following the Brexit vote in late July significantly impacted U.S. dollar revenue growth in the region for the third quarter. 
The almost 7% decline in the British pound in early October will further impact 4Q '16 U.S. dollar revenue growth. Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars but up 9% in local currency. The over 60% depreciation of the Argentinian peso from late December of 2015 through March of '16 has negatively impacted the U.S. dollar performance of our largest and most profitable country in the region. 
Asia Pacific revenue was $74 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda. Canada revenue was $32 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currency. Canada continues to perform in line with our expectations, including substantial improvements and the New Product Innovation initiatives, which includes trended data. 
For the third quarter, international's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 26.2% in 3Q '15. On a constant currency basis, margins expanded over 300 basis points versus 3Q '15 and almost 50 basis points sequentially. As Rick indicated, 4Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase sequentially and approach 30% in 4Q '16. 
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $101 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis. Growth, again, was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers. For the third quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%, in line with our expectations. The adjusted EBITDA margin was down from 30.8% in 3Q '15, but up significantly from the 26.4% in 2Q '16 when we were boarding LifeLock. 
In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $52 million consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, total general corporate expense is expected to be slightly above $55 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9%, up 130 basis points from 34.6% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins reflects year-over-year growth in USIS, Workforce Solutions and international. 
We expect the fourth Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margin to be above Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin and our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin to be up more than 100 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015. 
As Rick mentioned before, this is nicely above the target for 2016 of a 75-basis-point expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter at 29.1% was below the anticipated level of 32.5%, which we communicated during our July earnings call. 
The lower effective tax rate reflects several discrete or onetime items, which benefited our effective tax rate by over 3 percentage points and our adjusted EPS by about $0.05 a share. 
Our current expectation is that Q4 tax rate will be approximately 32.5%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48 million and year-to-date are $131 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be about 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range as investments are made related to our integration of Veda. 
Year-to-date, operating cash flow remained strong at $525 million. Total debt in the quarter was $2.86 billion. We continue to reduce our leverage following the Veda acquisition, which is now down at 2.58x. Our target is to reduce leverage back to approximately 2.25x EBITDA, which we expect to occur in 2017. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

I trust you agree 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company. Strong and consistent execution throughout the company has resulted in a broad-based performance that significantly exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the",570,"Thanks, John. I trust you agree 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company. Strong and consistent execution throughout the company has resulted in a broad-based performance that significantly exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. We firmly believe this positions us well for growth in 2017. 
For the fourth quarter, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $797 million and $801 million. Effective constant currency revenue growth of just over 22%, partially offset by about 2% of FX headwind. This reflects organic growth of over 12%. The almost 7% depreciation in the U.K. pound in early October, which John just referenced, resulted in the majority of the incremental $6 million of FX headwind versus our expectations for the fourth quarter when we gave guidance back in July. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.35 and $1.38, which is up 18% to 21% for the fourth quarter. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative FX, this reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 21% to 24%. 
With this outlook, our second half organic constant currency growth is approximately 12% and in line with the outlook we gave in the second half revenue growth during our second quarter earnings call, which you will recall, which we guided to 11% to 13%. 
For the year now, we expect revenue to be approximately $3.145 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of approximately 21%, partially offset by 3% of FX headwind. 
Adjusting for the significant depreciation and FX, principally the British pound, this is at the high-end of the guidance we provided in July. This is also impressive performance by the team when compared to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. For revenue, as you recall, we guided to more than $3 billion, $3.1 billion in revenue. 
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.45 and $5.48, which is up 21% to 22%. Excluding approximately $0.14 per share full year in negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 24% to 25%. This is up significantly from the guidance we provided you in July and compares favorably from the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year for adjusted EPS, which you remember was $4.95 to $5.05. 
For the year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by over 100 basis points up from the previous expectations, which were 75 basis points. As we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term constant currency financial model of total revenue growth of 7% to 10% per year with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%. 
As we look to 2017, considering all of the acquisitions closed to-date, which to refresh your memory were Veda and the small Barnett acquisition, we expect to achieve revenue growth at the high-end of our total growth model. As it's too early to make a call in the U.S. mortgage market, this assumes the U.S. mortgage market will be largely flat in 2017. And as always, we'll provide you more detail on our outlook for 2017 during our February call. 
But at this point in time, with the way the team is executing on the growth initiatives in EGI and NPI, we remain very bullish throughout this in 2017. 
So operator, with that, John, I'd like to open up for questions for our participants."

And I'll give you general vision on margin. We don't breakout trended data as a specific line item. But George, you should think of it this way, as we set up guidance back in July, in the second half of the year and specifically for the third quarter, the trended data contribution for USIS came in largely as expected, almost no -- in fact, no mutual deviation from our expectations. It was performing, as expected. It's fairly predicable for us to model that contribution. As far as margins, you've got, and you know this, you have fluctuations month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter. There are mix changes each and every quarter. There are seasonality changes. Mortgage is lower volume in the fourth quarter than other quarters. So you put it altogether, I don't really worry about minor changes by quarter. It's really the multiyear trends and USIS is starting up with a very, very high margin trending in the right direction."

Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today at www.equifax.com in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab.
During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.
For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.

For the corporation, we'll get into some details of the business unit level. John will go through the financial details. I'll come back with some closing comments before questions. 
Third quarter was just another outstanding broad-based performance by the team. This really continues to impress me. The growth we had in the third quarter accelerated from the first half of the year that added to our strong outperformance year-to-date. 
All our 4 business units continue to execute at a very high level, driving impressive expansion in our revenue, adjusted EBITDA margins and the bottom line results. 
For the quarter, total revenue was $804 million, up 20% on reported basis and up 23% on a local currency basis from the third quarter of last year. 
Organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first half coming in strongly at 13%, up over last year. 
In the quarter, FX created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9% compared to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015, representing a very solid year-on-year increase and well above our annual 25-basis-point target increase and the -- well above our 75-basis-point expectation we have for the full year of 2016. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.44, up 26% from $1.14 in the third quarter last year and better than our expectations when we gave third quarter guidance back in July of this year. 
So let me jump in to the individual BU's. As always, I'll start with USIS. They had delivered a solid 9% revenue growth, significant acceleration from the first half, driven by broad-based new product revenue, including trended data. We can talk more about trended data in a second and we'll get into it the Q&A as well. 
Trended data now is a reality. As expected, Fannie Mae launched its desktop underwriter in late September and as we indicated during our second quarter call, billing for trended data began in August for all mortgage-related inquiries. Revenue for the third quarter largely came in as we had expected. 
We have a very good relationship with Fannie Mae, and initiated discussions on trended data with them nearly 3 years ago. We continue to see opportunities to work with Fannie in transforming the mortgage space, including the announcement just this week of a launch of Fannie's desktop underwriter validation services, which incorporates verified consumer income and employment information from Workforce Solutions. We believe that will be a nice catalyst for continued mortgage growth for EWS going forward. 
Additionally, from our data and analytics team, they continue its efforts in -- to completed a variety of analyses to assess the lift from trended data for other decisioning activities. We've talked to you about that in the past. It's really getting on the granular levels by vertical, by subvertical, by unique data assets and understanding what the lifts is. In catalyst, trended data provides approximately a 15% lift in assessing prime accounts for the propensity to open a home equity loan and a 20% lift in assessing prime accounts for default risk on home equity loans. 
With the advent of Cambrian, which you're familiar with, we now have an analytical environment containing over 80 months or more of the historical data across many of our unique data assets. 
Data Cambrian is a nonproduction environment providing unparalleled ability to deliver compelling customer insights. But today, we're onto building analytics and insights on trended data is 80 months or more, including the credit file and other unique data assets. In 2017, we're going to move the 24 months of trended data we have in the credit file to significantly beyond the 24 months in the production environment. I think that will open up a whole new realm of opportunities to work with our customers and solve problems that we couldn't solve before. 
Second, with USIS on September 30, we reached a long-term agreement with SBFE to become a certified vendor. We now will be able to combine our CFN, Commercial Financial Network data assets with SBFE data to deliver best-in-class solutions for small business information customers. 
USIS is expected to deliver revenue growth for the fourth quarter at the high-end of the targeted range, which we communicated as 5% to 7%. And EBITDA margins will continue to be above 50% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
International. They continue to make great progress on its most -- on their most important strategic initiatives while delivering third quarter local currency revenue growth of 60% and organic local currency revenue growth of 10%. 
In the quarter reported, adjusted -- In the quarter, they reported, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by over 200 basis points from the year prior. Veda integration continues to go well and remains on schedule. Some sub-bullets under Veda where we talked before our global platform deployments into Veda, which includes Cambrian and Ostra [ph], our fraud platform, are underway and expected to be operational in mid-2017. 
The NPI process has been established with the local leadership team and will be incorporating the Veda NPI revenue into our Vitality Index beginning in 2017. 
We've also identified a number of opportunities to export some of Veda's products to other international geographies. Debt placement from the U.K. government is now up to GBP 1.6 billion. And our performance year-to-date, it's exceeding the baseline performance we had established.  
We now have all 6 founding agencies of the U.K. government boarded and have analytical projects underway with 2 additional agencies. While the initiative is still in the early stages, we're extremely pleased with both our relationship with the U.K. agencies and the financial results we're delivering. 
Organic revenue in international's 5 largest verticals, FI, telco, government, retail and auto. In aggregate, was up 13% for the quarter. International decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew 19% in the quarter. This high-value -- the high-value solutions continues to strengthen our relationships with customers and our market position. 
In the coming quarters, we will be installing more sophisticated technology platforms i.e., InterConnect, our Ostra [ph] platform and Cambrian throughout our international footprint drive future revenue growth. 
Canada continues to grow very good momentum with trended data. In the third quarter, we launched Cambrian platform, which will further enhance our competitive position with best-in-class solutions, leveraging trended data. 
International is expected to deliver organic constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full year, above the upper end of this long-term model of 8% to 10%. 
Reported revenue growth for 2016 is expected to approach 55%.  Adjusted EBITDA margins should increase sequentially and exit the year approaching 30%. 
Workforce Solutions' strong moment has resulted in another outstanding performance in the third quarter, with 23% revenue growth and a 350-basis-point expansion in the EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Total records in the Work Number database now approaches our short-term goal of $300 million with over 6,600 different data contributors to that database. Our initiatives to further penetrate key verticals led to strong double-digit growth in mortgage, auto, government and preemployment, to name a few. 
Revenue from our health care vertical comprised of income and employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics from employers grew over 240% in the quarter. 
In the quarter, Workforce Solutions completed the acquisition of Barnett/VJS, a small regional provider of employment and income verification and unemployment insurance services, to further accelerate the growth of the Work Number database. It's early days but it's going very well. 
As I stated earlier this week, a little more color around Fannie Mae, they announced the integration of our full suite of employment and income verification services into their desktop underwriting platform. The employment and income verification services includes data from Workforce Solutions with Work Number database providing instant and waterfall employment and income verification services. 
With these services, our earnings cycle times will be reduced and the lender's reliance on applicant providing W-2, pay stubs or other income or documentations will be eliminated, and this gives them protection should a mortgage not perform and protects them from having the banks put the mortgages back to them. So it's a great benefit for EWS. 
Workforce Solutions is having an outstanding year in 2016 both organic and reported revenue growth are expected to exceed 15% in the fourth quarter and 20% for 2016, substantially above its long-term range of 9% to 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be nicely over 45% for the fourth quarter 2016 and the high 40s for the full year. Global Consumer Solutions continues to make great progress on strategic initiatives particularly building out a strong market position in both DTC reseller and indirect markets that include partnerships with a number of very successful companies that we've talked about before, such as Credit Karma, LifeLock, H&R Block and others. 
We're pleased to announce we have executed a new longer-term partnership with Credit Karma. The new and expanded partnership is focused on growing both of our businesses by leveraging unique data assets, innovation and analytics, including the use of our Cambrian platform and expanding our partnerships beyond the borders of the U.S. 
This quarter, we deployed our new Global Consumer platform called renaissance, a best-in-class SaaS-based e-commerce platform, which provides much greater marketing flexibility to serve our partners. During the quarter, we successfully transitioned one of our largest customers to this new platform and by the end of 2017, we will have deployed this newest platform across all portions of our U.S. business and will be well in our way to deploying it across other geographies in which we operate. 
Global Consumer Solutions is expected to deliver fourth quarter and full year 2016 constant currency revenue growth exceeding 15% with fourth quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA margin at approximately 30%. 
Few high-level points at the corporate level before John gets into the financial details. Things we've talked to you about before that's so important to our culture and our results. First is our enterprise growth initiatives, which are our largest and most complex growth initiatives we have. They're performing very well in 2016, with revenue generation projected to be up over 35% from our expectations earlier this year and over 3x the revenue generated from EGI in 2015. 
Our overall performance in new product innovations, initiatives in 2016 is also outstanding. The 3-year revenue from our 2016 launches is expected to be more than 170% above the expected 3-year revenue from out 2015 launches. This is the strongest NPI performance we've had since it was built and created some 10 years ago. 
Our Vitality Index we had last year and the pipeline of new products continues to be very robust. To date, we've launched approximately 40 new products and expect to launch another 20 products before year-end. 
In summary, our strategic initiatives continue to perform well and are ahead of our expectations that we had at the beginning of the year. With this continued focus on improving the process, allows us to drive continuous growth. I expect these initiatives will continue to drive and deliver incremental revenue growth in 2017 and beyond. 
So with that, John?"

The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Now, let me turn to the business units financial performance for the third quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $317 million, up 9% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Online Information Solutions revenue was $230 million, up 7% when compared to the year-ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 39% in the quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index growth accelerated significantly, up 35% in the third quarter compared to the 20% growth we saw in the second quarter. 
Given a much stronger mortgage market performance on 3Q '16 and continued accommodative  interest rate environment, we now expect the mortgage market to grow solidly double-digit in 2016. 
Financial marketing services revenue was $48 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago quarter. Our commercial products suite grew 8% in 3Q. We have made great progress building the Equifax commercial financial network, which includes tradeline data from banking and other financial institutions similar to the SBFE, as well as communications and utilities, wholesale trade, printing, publishing, chemicals and allied products and rental and leasing data. 
When combined with Equifax consumer credit data, we can now offer substantially differentiated data and analytics to our U.S. commercial customers. 
Identity and Fraud Solutions also continue to grow strongly, up 19% in 3Q and 23% year-to-date. USIS direct-to-consumer revenue, principally our revenue with other CRAs, was down over 20% in the quarter and largely in line with the first half. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions in 3Q '16 was 50.6%, up from 49.9% in the third quarter of 2015. Workforce Solutions revenue was $171 million for the quarter, up 23% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $115 million was also up 23% and continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and preemployment. 
Employer Services revenue of $57 million was up 23% from last year as well. Revenue growth from unemployment insurance, I-9, tax incentives and other HR services was consistent with the annual model of mid-single digit growth. 
ACA analytics revenue was up substantially in the quarter versus 3Q '15, driving much of the growth. As we had indicated previously, ACA analytics revenue was down sequentially and from the first half run rate. As expected, given that the ACA business is seasonal with higher revenue in the first half of the year when 1095s are delivered to employees. 
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%, up from 43.5% in 3Q '15 and in line with our expectations. Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions, our total U.S. B2B revenue was $489 million, representing organic growth of 13%. 
International's revenue was $214 million, up 47% on a reported basis and 60% on a local currency basis when compared to 3Q '15. Organic constant currency revenue growth was approximately 10%. 
By region, Europe's revenue was $62 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency. We have seen some moderate impact on local currency revenue following the Brexit vote, with selected large U.K. financial institutions. 
Debt management grew nicely in the quarter as our relationship with the U.K. government continues to perform as we had expected. The sharp depreciation of the British pound following the Brexit vote in late July significantly impacted U.S. dollar revenue growth in the region for the third quarter. 
The almost 7% decline in the British pound in early October will further impact 4Q '16 U.S. dollar revenue growth. Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars but up 9% in local currency. The over 60% depreciation of the Argentinian peso from late December of 2015 through March of '16 has negatively impacted the U.S. dollar performance of our largest and most profitable country in the region. 
Asia Pacific revenue was $74 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda. Canada revenue was $32 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currency. Canada continues to perform in line with our expectations, including substantial improvements and the New Product Innovation initiatives, which includes trended data. 
For the third quarter, international's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 26.2% in 3Q '15. On a constant currency basis, margins expanded over 300 basis points versus 3Q '15 and almost 50 basis points sequentially. As Rick indicated, 4Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase sequentially and approach 30% in 4Q '16. 
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $101 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis. Growth, again, was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers. For the third quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%, in line with our expectations. The adjusted EBITDA margin was down from 30.8% in 3Q '15, but up significantly from the 26.4% in 2Q '16 when we were boarding LifeLock. 
In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $52 million consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, total general corporate expense is expected to be slightly above $55 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9%, up 130 basis points from 34.6% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins reflects year-over-year growth in USIS, Workforce Solutions and international. 
We expect the fourth Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margin to be above Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin and our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin to be up more than 100 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015. 
As Rick mentioned before, this is nicely above the target for 2016 of a 75-basis-point expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter at 29.1% was below the anticipated level of 32.5%, which we communicated during our July earnings call. 
The lower effective tax rate reflects several discrete or onetime items, which benefited our effective tax rate by over 3 percentage points and our adjusted EPS by about $0.05 a share. 
Our current expectation is that Q4 tax rate will be approximately 32.5%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48 million and year-to-date are $131 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be about 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range as investments are made related to our integration of Veda. 
Year-to-date, operating cash flow remained strong at $525 million. Total debt in the quarter was $2.86 billion. We continue to reduce our leverage following the Veda acquisition, which is now down at 2.58x. Our target is to reduce leverage back to approximately 2.25x EBITDA, which we expect to occur in 2017. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

I trust you agree 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company. Strong and consistent execution throughout the company has resulted in a broad-based performance that significantly exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the",570,"Thanks, John. I trust you agree 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company. Strong and consistent execution throughout the company has resulted in a broad-based performance that significantly exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. We firmly believe this positions us well for growth in 2017. 
For the fourth quarter, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $797 million and $801 million. Effective constant currency revenue growth of just over 22%, partially offset by about 2% of FX headwind. This reflects organic growth of over 12%. The almost 7% depreciation in the U.K. pound in early October, which John just referenced, resulted in the majority of the incremental $6 million of FX headwind versus our expectations for the fourth quarter when we gave guidance back in July. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.35 and $1.38, which is up 18% to 21% for the fourth quarter. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative FX, this reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 21% to 24%. 
With this outlook, our second half organic constant currency growth is approximately 12% and in line with the outlook we gave in the second half revenue growth during our second quarter earnings call, which you will recall, which we guided to 11% to 13%. 
For the year now, we expect revenue to be approximately $3.145 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of approximately 21%, partially offset by 3% of FX headwind. 
Adjusting for the significant depreciation and FX, principally the British pound, this is at the high-end of the guidance we provided in July. This is also impressive performance by the team when compared to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. For revenue, as you recall, we guided to more than $3 billion, $3.1 billion in revenue. 
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.45 and $5.48, which is up 21% to 22%. Excluding approximately $0.14 per share full year in negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 24% to 25%. This is up significantly from the guidance we provided you in July and compares favorably from the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year for adjusted EPS, which you remember was $4.95 to $5.05. 
For the year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by over 100 basis points up from the previous expectations, which were 75 basis points. As we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term constant currency financial model of total revenue growth of 7% to 10% per year with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%. 
As we look to 2017, considering all of the acquisitions closed to-date, which to refresh your memory were Veda and the small Barnett acquisition, we expect to achieve revenue growth at the high-end of our total growth model. As it's too early to make a call in the U.S. mortgage market, this assumes the U.S. mortgage market will be largely flat in 2017. And as always, we'll provide you more detail on our outlook for 2017 during our February call. 
But at this point in time, with the way the team is executing on the growth initiatives in EGI and NPI, we remain very bullish throughout this in 2017. 
So operator, with that, John, I'd like to open up for questions for our participants."

The projections for currency stabilization are better than what we have seen some time. I guess Jeff's got some numbers right here. The forecast right now, we have Argentina, as John alluded to us, is negative this year about 1% or so in GDP growth in the next 3 years, the consensus forecast is between 3% to 4% GDP growth through '17, '18 and '19. So we're in good position in Argentina. We're a leader in Argentina in all verticals. And analytics, as well as is the core credit business.

Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today at www.equifax.com in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab.
During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.
For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.

For the corporation, we'll get into some details of the business unit level. John will go through the financial details. I'll come back with some closing comments before questions. 
Third quarter was just another outstanding broad-based performance by the team. This really continues to impress me. The growth we had in the third quarter accelerated from the first half of the year that added to our strong outperformance year-to-date. 
All our 4 business units continue to execute at a very high level, driving impressive expansion in our revenue, adjusted EBITDA margins and the bottom line results. 
For the quarter, total revenue was $804 million, up 20% on reported basis and up 23% on a local currency basis from the third quarter of last year. 
Organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first half coming in strongly at 13%, up over last year. 
In the quarter, FX created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9% compared to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015, representing a very solid year-on-year increase and well above our annual 25-basis-point target increase and the -- well above our 75-basis-point expectation we have for the full year of 2016. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.44, up 26% from $1.14 in the third quarter last year and better than our expectations when we gave third quarter guidance back in July of this year. 
So let me jump in to the individual BU's. As always, I'll start with USIS. They had delivered a solid 9% revenue growth, significant acceleration from the first half, driven by broad-based new product revenue, including trended data. We can talk more about trended data in a second and we'll get into it the Q&A as well. 
Trended data now is a reality. As expected, Fannie Mae launched its desktop underwriter in late September and as we indicated during our second quarter call, billing for trended data began in August for all mortgage-related inquiries. Revenue for the third quarter largely came in as we had expected. 
We have a very good relationship with Fannie Mae, and initiated discussions on trended data with them nearly 3 years ago. We continue to see opportunities to work with Fannie in transforming the mortgage space, including the announcement just this week of a launch of Fannie's desktop underwriter validation services, which incorporates verified consumer income and employment information from Workforce Solutions. We believe that will be a nice catalyst for continued mortgage growth for EWS going forward. 
Additionally, from our data and analytics team, they continue its efforts in -- to completed a variety of analyses to assess the lift from trended data for other decisioning activities. We've talked to you about that in the past. It's really getting on the granular levels by vertical, by subvertical, by unique data assets and understanding what the lifts is. In catalyst, trended data provides approximately a 15% lift in assessing prime accounts for the propensity to open a home equity loan and a 20% lift in assessing prime accounts for default risk on home equity loans. 
With the advent of Cambrian, which you're familiar with, we now have an analytical environment containing over 80 months or more of the historical data across many of our unique data assets. 
Data Cambrian is a nonproduction environment providing unparalleled ability to deliver compelling customer insights. But today, we're onto building analytics and insights on trended data is 80 months or more, including the credit file and other unique data assets. In 2017, we're going to move the 24 months of trended data we have in the credit file to significantly beyond the 24 months in the production environment. I think that will open up a whole new realm of opportunities to work with our customers and solve problems that we couldn't solve before. 
Second, with USIS on September 30, we reached a long-term agreement with SBFE to become a certified vendor. We now will be able to combine our CFN, Commercial Financial Network data assets with SBFE data to deliver best-in-class solutions for small business information customers. 
USIS is expected to deliver revenue growth for the fourth quarter at the high-end of the targeted range, which we communicated as 5% to 7%. And EBITDA margins will continue to be above 50% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
International. They continue to make great progress on its most -- on their most important strategic initiatives while delivering third quarter local currency revenue growth of 60% and organic local currency revenue growth of 10%. 
In the quarter reported, adjusted -- In the quarter, they reported, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by over 200 basis points from the year prior. Veda integration continues to go well and remains on schedule. Some sub-bullets under Veda where we talked before our global platform deployments into Veda, which includes Cambrian and Ostra [ph], our fraud platform, are underway and expected to be operational in mid-2017. 
The NPI process has been established with the local leadership team and will be incorporating the Veda NPI revenue into our Vitality Index beginning in 2017. 
We've also identified a number of opportunities to export some of Veda's products to other international geographies. Debt placement from the U.K. government is now up to GBP 1.6 billion. And our performance year-to-date, it's exceeding the baseline performance we had established.  
We now have all 6 founding agencies of the U.K. government boarded and have analytical projects underway with 2 additional agencies. While the initiative is still in the early stages, we're extremely pleased with both our relationship with the U.K. agencies and the financial results we're delivering. 
Organic revenue in international's 5 largest verticals, FI, telco, government, retail and auto. In aggregate, was up 13% for the quarter. International decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew 19% in the quarter. This high-value -- the high-value solutions continues to strengthen our relationships with customers and our market position. 
In the coming quarters, we will be installing more sophisticated technology platforms i.e., InterConnect, our Ostra [ph] platform and Cambrian throughout our international footprint drive future revenue growth. 
Canada continues to grow very good momentum with trended data. In the third quarter, we launched Cambrian platform, which will further enhance our competitive position with best-in-class solutions, leveraging trended data. 
International is expected to deliver organic constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full year, above the upper end of this long-term model of 8% to 10%. 
Reported revenue growth for 2016 is expected to approach 55%.  Adjusted EBITDA margins should increase sequentially and exit the year approaching 30%. 
Workforce Solutions' strong moment has resulted in another outstanding performance in the third quarter, with 23% revenue growth and a 350-basis-point expansion in the EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Total records in the Work Number database now approaches our short-term goal of $300 million with over 6,600 different data contributors to that database. Our initiatives to further penetrate key verticals led to strong double-digit growth in mortgage, auto, government and preemployment, to name a few. 
Revenue from our health care vertical comprised of income and employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics from employers grew over 240% in the quarter. 
In the quarter, Workforce Solutions completed the acquisition of Barnett/VJS, a small regional provider of employment and income verification and unemployment insurance services, to further accelerate the growth of the Work Number database. It's early days but it's going very well. 
As I stated earlier this week, a little more color around Fannie Mae, they announced the integration of our full suite of employment and income verification services into their desktop underwriting platform. The employment and income verification services includes data from Workforce Solutions with Work Number database providing instant and waterfall employment and income verification services. 
With these services, our earnings cycle times will be reduced and the lender's reliance on applicant providing W-2, pay stubs or other income or documentations will be eliminated, and this gives them protection should a mortgage not perform and protects them from having the banks put the mortgages back to them. So it's a great benefit for EWS. 
Workforce Solutions is having an outstanding year in 2016 both organic and reported revenue growth are expected to exceed 15% in the fourth quarter and 20% for 2016, substantially above its long-term range of 9% to 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be nicely over 45% for the fourth quarter 2016 and the high 40s for the full year. Global Consumer Solutions continues to make great progress on strategic initiatives particularly building out a strong market position in both DTC reseller and indirect markets that include partnerships with a number of very successful companies that we've talked about before, such as Credit Karma, LifeLock, H&R Block and others. 
We're pleased to announce we have executed a new longer-term partnership with Credit Karma. The new and expanded partnership is focused on growing both of our businesses by leveraging unique data assets, innovation and analytics, including the use of our Cambrian platform and expanding our partnerships beyond the borders of the U.S. 
This quarter, we deployed our new Global Consumer platform called renaissance, a best-in-class SaaS-based e-commerce platform, which provides much greater marketing flexibility to serve our partners. During the quarter, we successfully transitioned one of our largest customers to this new platform and by the end of 2017, we will have deployed this newest platform across all portions of our U.S. business and will be well in our way to deploying it across other geographies in which we operate. 
Global Consumer Solutions is expected to deliver fourth quarter and full year 2016 constant currency revenue growth exceeding 15% with fourth quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA margin at approximately 30%. 
Few high-level points at the corporate level before John gets into the financial details. Things we've talked to you about before that's so important to our culture and our results. First is our enterprise growth initiatives, which are our largest and most complex growth initiatives we have. They're performing very well in 2016, with revenue generation projected to be up over 35% from our expectations earlier this year and over 3x the revenue generated from EGI in 2015. 
Our overall performance in new product innovations, initiatives in 2016 is also outstanding. The 3-year revenue from our 2016 launches is expected to be more than 170% above the expected 3-year revenue from out 2015 launches. This is the strongest NPI performance we've had since it was built and created some 10 years ago. 
Our Vitality Index we had last year and the pipeline of new products continues to be very robust. To date, we've launched approximately 40 new products and expect to launch another 20 products before year-end. 
In summary, our strategic initiatives continue to perform well and are ahead of our expectations that we had at the beginning of the year. With this continued focus on improving the process, allows us to drive continuous growth. I expect these initiatives will continue to drive and deliver incremental revenue growth in 2017 and beyond. 
So with that, John?"

The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Now, let me turn to the business units financial performance for the third quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $317 million, up 9% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Online Information Solutions revenue was $230 million, up 7% when compared to the year-ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 39% in the quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index growth accelerated significantly, up 35% in the third quarter compared to the 20% growth we saw in the second quarter. 
Given a much stronger mortgage market performance on 3Q '16 and continued accommodative  interest rate environment, we now expect the mortgage market to grow solidly double-digit in 2016. 
Financial marketing services revenue was $48 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago quarter. Our commercial products suite grew 8% in 3Q. We have made great progress building the Equifax commercial financial network, which includes tradeline data from banking and other financial institutions similar to the SBFE, as well as communications and utilities, wholesale trade, printing, publishing, chemicals and allied products and rental and leasing data. 
When combined with Equifax consumer credit data, we can now offer substantially differentiated data and analytics to our U.S. commercial customers. 
Identity and Fraud Solutions also continue to grow strongly, up 19% in 3Q and 23% year-to-date. USIS direct-to-consumer revenue, principally our revenue with other CRAs, was down over 20% in the quarter and largely in line with the first half. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions in 3Q '16 was 50.6%, up from 49.9% in the third quarter of 2015. Workforce Solutions revenue was $171 million for the quarter, up 23% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $115 million was also up 23% and continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and preemployment. 
Employer Services revenue of $57 million was up 23% from last year as well. Revenue growth from unemployment insurance, I-9, tax incentives and other HR services was consistent with the annual model of mid-single digit growth. 
ACA analytics revenue was up substantially in the quarter versus 3Q '15, driving much of the growth. As we had indicated previously, ACA analytics revenue was down sequentially and from the first half run rate. As expected, given that the ACA business is seasonal with higher revenue in the first half of the year when 1095s are delivered to employees. 
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%, up from 43.5% in 3Q '15 and in line with our expectations. Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions, our total U.S. B2B revenue was $489 million, representing organic growth of 13%. 
International's revenue was $214 million, up 47% on a reported basis and 60% on a local currency basis when compared to 3Q '15. Organic constant currency revenue growth was approximately 10%. 
By region, Europe's revenue was $62 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency. We have seen some moderate impact on local currency revenue following the Brexit vote, with selected large U.K. financial institutions. 
Debt management grew nicely in the quarter as our relationship with the U.K. government continues to perform as we had expected. The sharp depreciation of the British pound following the Brexit vote in late July significantly impacted U.S. dollar revenue growth in the region for the third quarter. 
The almost 7% decline in the British pound in early October will further impact 4Q '16 U.S. dollar revenue growth. Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars but up 9% in local currency. The over 60% depreciation of the Argentinian peso from late December of 2015 through March of '16 has negatively impacted the U.S. dollar performance of our largest and most profitable country in the region. 
Asia Pacific revenue was $74 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda. Canada revenue was $32 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currency. Canada continues to perform in line with our expectations, including substantial improvements and the New Product Innovation initiatives, which includes trended data. 
For the third quarter, international's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 26.2% in 3Q '15. On a constant currency basis, margins expanded over 300 basis points versus 3Q '15 and almost 50 basis points sequentially. As Rick indicated, 4Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase sequentially and approach 30% in 4Q '16. 
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $101 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis. Growth, again, was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers. For the third quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%, in line with our expectations. The adjusted EBITDA margin was down from 30.8% in 3Q '15, but up significantly from the 26.4% in 2Q '16 when we were boarding LifeLock. 
In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $52 million consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, total general corporate expense is expected to be slightly above $55 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9%, up 130 basis points from 34.6% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins reflects year-over-year growth in USIS, Workforce Solutions and international. 
We expect the fourth Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margin to be above Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin and our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin to be up more than 100 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015. 
As Rick mentioned before, this is nicely above the target for 2016 of a 75-basis-point expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter at 29.1% was below the anticipated level of 32.5%, which we communicated during our July earnings call. 
The lower effective tax rate reflects several discrete or onetime items, which benefited our effective tax rate by over 3 percentage points and our adjusted EPS by about $0.05 a share. 
Our current expectation is that Q4 tax rate will be approximately 32.5%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48 million and year-to-date are $131 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be about 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range as investments are made related to our integration of Veda. 
Year-to-date, operating cash flow remained strong at $525 million. Total debt in the quarter was $2.86 billion. We continue to reduce our leverage following the Veda acquisition, which is now down at 2.58x. Our target is to reduce leverage back to approximately 2.25x EBITDA, which we expect to occur in 2017. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

I trust you agree 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company. Strong and consistent execution throughout the company has resulted in a broad-based performance that significantly exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. We firmly believe this positions us well for growth in 2017. 
For the fourth quarter, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $797 million and $801 million. Effective constant currency revenue growth of just over 22%, partially offset by about 2% of FX headwind. This reflects organic growth of over 12%. The almost 7% depreciation in the U.K. pound in early October, which John just referenced, resulted in the majority of the incremental $6 million of FX headwind versus our expectations for the fourth quarter when we gave guidance back in July. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.35 and $1.38, which is up 18% to 21% for the fourth quarter. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative FX, this reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 21% to 24%. 
With this outlook, our second half organic constant currency growth is approximately 12% and in line with the outlook we gave in the second half revenue growth during our second quarter earnings call, which you will recall, which we guided to 11% to 13%. 
For the year now, we expect revenue to be approximately $3.145 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of approximately 21%, partially offset by 3% of FX headwind. 
Adjusting for the significant depreciation and FX, principally the British pound, this is at the high-end of the guidance we provided in July. This is also impressive performance by the team when compared to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. For revenue, as you recall, we guided to more than $3 billion, $3.1 billion in revenue. 
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.45 and $5.48, which is up 21% to 22%. Excluding approximately $0.14 per share full year in negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 24% to 25%. This is up significantly from the guidance we provided you in July and compares favorably from the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year for adjusted EPS, which you remember was $4.95 to $5.05. 
For the year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by over 100 basis points up from the previous expectations, which were 75 basis points. As we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term constant currency financial model of total revenue growth of 7% to 10% per year with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%. 
As we look to 2017, considering all of the acquisitions closed to-date, which to refresh your memory were Veda and the small Barnett acquisition, we expect to achieve revenue growth at the high-end of our total growth model. As it's too early to make a call in the U.S. mortgage market, this assumes the U.S. mortgage market will be largely flat in 2017. And as always, we'll provide you more detail on our outlook for 2017 during our February call. 
But at this point in time, with the way the team is executing on the growth initiatives in EGI and NPI, we remain very bullish throughout this in 2017. 
So operator, with that, John, I'd like to open up for questions for our participants."

Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today at www.equifax.com in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab.
During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.
For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.

For the corporation, we'll get into some details of the business unit level. John will go through the financial details. I'll come back with some closing comments before questions. 
Third quarter was just another outstanding broad-based performance by the team. This really continues to impress me. The growth we had in the third quarter accelerated from the first half of the year that added to our strong outperformance year-to-date. 
All our 4 business units continue to execute at a very high level, driving impressive expansion in our revenue, adjusted EBITDA margins and the bottom line results. 
For the quarter, total revenue was $804 million, up 20% on reported basis and up 23% on a local currency basis from the third quarter of last year. 
Organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first half coming in strongly at 13%, up over last year. 
In the quarter, FX created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9% compared to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015, representing a very solid year-on-year increase and well above our annual 25-basis-point target increase and the -- well above our 75-basis-point expectation we have for the full year of 2016. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.44, up 26% from $1.14 in the third quarter last year and better than our expectations when we gave third quarter guidance back in July of this year. 
So let me jump in to the individual BU's. As always, I'll start with USIS. They had delivered a solid 9% revenue growth, significant acceleration from the first half, driven by broad-based new product revenue, including trended data. We can talk more about trended data in a second and we'll get into it the Q&A as well. 
Trended data now is a reality. As expected, Fannie Mae launched its desktop underwriter in late September and as we indicated during our second quarter call, billing for trended data began in August for all mortgage-related inquiries. Revenue for the third quarter largely came in as we had expected. 
We have a very good relationship with Fannie Mae, and initiated discussions on trended data with them nearly 3 years ago. We continue to see opportunities to work with Fannie in transforming the mortgage space, including the announcement just this week of a launch of Fannie's desktop underwriter validation services, which incorporates verified consumer income and employment information from Workforce Solutions. We believe that will be a nice catalyst for continued mortgage growth for EWS going forward. 
Additionally, from our data and analytics team, they continue its efforts in -- to completed a variety of analyses to assess the lift from trended data for other decisioning activities. We've talked to you about that in the past. It's really getting on the granular levels by vertical, by subvertical, by unique data assets and understanding what the lifts is. In catalyst, trended data provides approximately a 15% lift in assessing prime accounts for the propensity to open a home equity loan and a 20% lift in assessing prime accounts for default risk on home equity loans. 
With the advent of Cambrian, which you're familiar with, we now have an analytical environment containing over 80 months or more of the historical data across many of our unique data assets. 
Data Cambrian is a nonproduction environment providing unparalleled ability to deliver compelling customer insights. But today, we're onto building analytics and insights on trended data is 80 months or more, including the credit file and other unique data assets. In 2017, we're going to move the 24 months of trended data we have in the credit file to significantly beyond the 24 months in the production environment. I think that will open up a whole new realm of opportunities to work with our customers and solve problems that we couldn't solve before. 
Second, with USIS on September 30, we reached a long-term agreement with SBFE to become a certified vendor. We now will be able to combine our CFN, Commercial Financial Network data assets with SBFE data to deliver best-in-class solutions for small business information customers. 
USIS is expected to deliver revenue growth for the fourth quarter at the high-end of the targeted range, which we communicated as 5% to 7%. And EBITDA margins will continue to be above 50% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
International. They continue to make great progress on its most -- on their most important strategic initiatives while delivering third quarter local currency revenue growth of 60% and organic local currency revenue growth of 10%. 
In the quarter reported, adjusted -- In the quarter, they reported, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by over 200 basis points from the year prior. Veda integration continues to go well and remains on schedule. Some sub-bullets under Veda where we talked before our global platform deployments into Veda, which includes Cambrian and Ostra [ph], our fraud platform, are underway and expected to be operational in mid-2017. 
The NPI process has been established with the local leadership team and will be incorporating the Veda NPI revenue into our Vitality Index beginning in 2017. 
We've also identified a number of opportunities to export some of Veda's products to other international geographies. Debt placement from the U.K. government is now up to GBP 1.6 billion. And our performance year-to-date, it's exceeding the baseline performance we had established.  
We now have all 6 founding agencies of the U.K. government boarded and have analytical projects underway with 2 additional agencies. While the initiative is still in the early stages, we're extremely pleased with both our relationship with the U.K. agencies and the financial results we're delivering. 
Organic revenue in international's 5 largest verticals, FI, telco, government, retail and auto. In aggregate, was up 13% for the quarter. International decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew 19% in the quarter. This high-value -- the high-value solutions continues to strengthen our relationships with customers and our market position. 
In the coming quarters, we will be installing more sophisticated technology platforms i.e., InterConnect, our Ostra [ph] platform and Cambrian throughout our international footprint drive future revenue growth. 
Canada continues to grow very good momentum with trended data. In the third quarter, we launched Cambrian platform, which will further enhance our competitive position with best-in-class solutions, leveraging trended data. 
International is expected to deliver organic constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full year, above the upper end of this long-term model of 8% to 10%. 
Reported revenue growth for 2016 is expected to approach 55%.  Adjusted EBITDA margins should increase sequentially and exit the year approaching 30%. 
Workforce Solutions' strong moment has resulted in another outstanding performance in the third quarter, with 23% revenue growth and a 350-basis-point expansion in the EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Total records in the Work Number database now approaches our short-term goal of $300 million with over 6,600 different data contributors to that database. Our initiatives to further penetrate key verticals led to strong double-digit growth in mortgage, auto, government and preemployment, to name a few. 
Revenue from our health care vertical comprised of income and employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics from employers grew over 240% in the quarter. 
In the quarter, Workforce Solutions completed the acquisition of Barnett/VJS, a small regional provider of employment and income verification and unemployment insurance services, to further accelerate the growth of the Work Number database. It's early days but it's going very well. 
As I stated earlier this week, a little more color around Fannie Mae, they announced the integration of our full suite of employment and income verification services into their desktop underwriting platform. The employment and income verification services includes data from Workforce Solutions with Work Number database providing instant and waterfall employment and income verification services. 
With these services, our earnings cycle times will be reduced and the lender's reliance on applicant providing W-2, pay stubs or other income or documentations will be eliminated, and this gives them protection should a mortgage not perform and protects them from having the banks put the mortgages back to them. So it's a great benefit for EWS. 
Workforce Solutions is having an outstanding year in 2016 both organic and reported revenue growth are expected to exceed 15% in the fourth quarter and 20% for 2016, substantially above its long-term range of 9% to 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be nicely over 45% for the fourth quarter 2016 and the high 40s for the full year. Global Consumer Solutions continues to make great progress on strategic initiatives particularly building out a strong market position in both DTC reseller and indirect markets that include partnerships with a number of very successful companies that we've talked about before, such as Credit Karma, LifeLock, H&R Block and others. 
We're pleased to announce we have executed a new longer-term partnership with Credit Karma. The new and expanded partnership is focused on growing both of our businesses by leveraging unique data assets, innovation and analytics, including the use of our Cambrian platform and expanding our partnerships beyond the borders of the U.S. 
This quarter, we deployed our new Global Consumer platform called renaissance, a best-in-class SaaS-based e-commerce platform, which provides much greater marketing flexibility to serve our partners. During the quarter, we successfully transitioned one of our largest customers to this new platform and by the end of 2017, we will have deployed this newest platform across all portions of our U.S. business and will be well in our way to deploying it across other geographies in which we operate. 
Global Consumer Solutions is expected to deliver fourth quarter and full year 2016 constant currency revenue growth exceeding 15% with fourth quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA margin at approximately 30%. 
Few high-level points at the corporate level before John gets into the financial details. Things we've talked to you about before that's so important to our culture and our results. First is our enterprise growth initiatives, which are our largest and most complex growth initiatives we have. They're performing very well in 2016, with revenue generation projected to be up over 35% from our expectations earlier this year and over 3x the revenue generated from EGI in 2015. 
Our overall performance in new product innovations, initiatives in 2016 is also outstanding. The 3-year revenue from our 2016 launches is expected to be more than 170% above the expected 3-year revenue from out 2015 launches. This is the strongest NPI performance we've had since it was built and created some 10 years ago. 
Our Vitality Index we had last year and the pipeline of new products continues to be very robust. To date, we've launched approximately 40 new products and expect to launch another 20 products before year-end. 
In summary, our strategic initiatives continue to perform well and are ahead of our expectations that we had at the beginning of the year. With this continued focus on improving the process, allows us to drive continuous growth. I expect these initiatives will continue to drive and deliver incremental revenue growth in 2017 and beyond. 
So with that, John?"

The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Now, let me turn to the business units financial performance for the third quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $317 million, up 9% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Online Information Solutions revenue was $230 million, up 7% when compared to the year-ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 39% in the quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index growth accelerated significantly, up 35% in the third quarter compared to the 20% growth we saw in the second quarter. 
Given a much stronger mortgage market performance on 3Q '16 and continued accommodative  interest rate environment, we now expect the mortgage market to grow solidly double-digit in 2016. 
Financial marketing services revenue was $48 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago quarter. Our commercial products suite grew 8% in 3Q. We have made great progress building the Equifax commercial financial network, which includes tradeline data from banking and other financial institutions similar to the SBFE, as well as communications and utilities, wholesale trade, printing, publishing, chemicals and allied products and rental and leasing data. 
When combined with Equifax consumer credit data, we can now offer substantially differentiated data and analytics to our U.S. commercial customers. 
Identity and Fraud Solutions also continue to grow strongly, up 19% in 3Q and 23% year-to-date. USIS direct-to-consumer revenue, principally our revenue with other CRAs, was down over 20% in the quarter and largely in line with the first half. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions in 3Q '16 was 50.6%, up from 49.9% in the third quarter of 2015. Workforce Solutions revenue was $171 million for the quarter, up 23% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $115 million was also up 23% and continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and preemployment. 
Employer Services revenue of $57 million was up 23% from last year as well. Revenue growth from unemployment insurance, I-9, tax incentives and other HR services was consistent with the annual model of mid-single digit growth. 
ACA analytics revenue was up substantially in the quarter versus 3Q '15, driving much of the growth. As we had indicated previously, ACA analytics revenue was down sequentially and from the first half run rate. As expected, given that the ACA business is seasonal with higher revenue in the first half of the year when 1095s are delivered to employees. 
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%, up from 43.5% in 3Q '15 and in line with our expectations. Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions, our total U.S. B2B revenue was $489 million, representing organic growth of 13%. 
International's revenue was $214 million, up 47% on a reported basis and 60% on a local currency basis when compared to 3Q '15. Organic constant currency revenue growth was approximately 10%. 
By region, Europe's revenue was $62 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency. We have seen some moderate impact on local currency revenue following the Brexit vote, with selected large U.K. financial institutions. 
Debt management grew nicely in the quarter as our relationship with the U.K. government continues to perform as we had expected. The sharp depreciation of the British pound following the Brexit vote in late July significantly impacted U.S. dollar revenue growth in the region for the third quarter. 
The almost 7% decline in the British pound in early October will further impact 4Q '16 U.S. dollar revenue growth. Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars but up 9% in local currency. The over 60% depreciation of the Argentinian peso from late December of 2015 through March of '16 has negatively impacted the U.S. dollar performance of our largest and most profitable country in the region. 
Asia Pacific revenue was $74 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda. Canada revenue was $32 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currency. Canada continues to perform in line with our expectations, including substantial improvements and the New Product Innovation initiatives, which includes trended data. 
For the third quarter, international's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 26.2% in 3Q '15. On a constant currency basis, margins expanded over 300 basis points versus 3Q '15 and almost 50 basis points sequentially. As Rick indicated, 4Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase sequentially and approach 30% in 4Q '16. 
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $101 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis. Growth, again, was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers. For the third quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%, in line with our expectations. The adjusted EBITDA margin was down from 30.8% in 3Q '15, but up significantly from the 26.4% in 2Q '16 when we were boarding LifeLock. 
In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $52 million consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, total general corporate expense is expected to be slightly above $55 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9%, up 130 basis points from 34.6% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins reflects year-over-year growth in USIS, Workforce Solutions and international. 
We expect the fourth Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margin to be above Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin and our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin to be up more than 100 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015. 
As Rick mentioned before, this is nicely above the target for 2016 of a 75-basis-point expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter at 29.1% was below the anticipated level of 32.5%, which we communicated during our July earnings call. 
The lower effective tax rate reflects several discrete or onetime items, which benefited our effective tax rate by over 3 percentage points and our adjusted EPS by about $0.05 a share. 
Our current expectation is that Q4 tax rate will be approximately 32.5%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48 million and year-to-date are $131 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be about 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range as investments are made related to our integration of Veda. 
Year-to-date, operating cash flow remained strong at $525 million. Total debt in the quarter was $2.86 billion. We continue to reduce our leverage following the Veda acquisition, which is now down at 2.58x. Our target is to reduce leverage back to approximately 2.25x EBITDA, which we expect to occur in 2017. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."
175749,403276336,1954186,"Equifax Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. I trust you agree 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company. Strong and consistent execution throughout the company has resulted in a broad-based performance that significantly exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the",570,"Thanks, John. I trust you agree 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company. Strong and consistent execution throughout the company has resulted in a broad-based performance that significantly exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. We firmly believe this positions us well for growth in 2017. 
For the fourth quarter, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $797 million and $801 million. Effective constant currency revenue growth of just over 22%, partially offset by about 2% of FX headwind. This reflects organic growth of over 12%. The almost 7% depreciation in the U.K. pound in early October, which John just referenced, resulted in the majority of the incremental $6 million of FX headwind versus our expectations for the fourth quarter when we gave guidance back in July. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.35 and $1.38, which is up 18% to 21% for the fourth quarter. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative FX, this reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 21% to 24%. 
With this outlook, our second half organic constant currency growth is approximately 12% and in line with the outlook we gave in the second half revenue growth during our second quarter earnings call, which you will recall, which we guided to 11% to 13%. 
For the year now, we expect revenue to be approximately $3.145 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of approximately 21%, partially offset by 3% of FX headwind. 
Adjusting for the significant depreciation and FX, principally the British pound, this is at the high-end of the guidance we provided in July. This is also impressive performance by the team when compared to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. For revenue, as you recall, we guided to more than $3 billion, $3.1 billion in revenue. 
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.45 and $5.48, which is up 21% to 22%. Excluding approximately $0.14 per share full year in negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 24% to 25%. This is up significantly from the guidance we provided you in July and compares favorably from the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year for adjusted EPS, which you remember was $4.95 to $5.05. 
For the year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by over 100 basis points up from the previous expectations, which were 75 basis points. As we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term constant currency financial model of total revenue growth of 7% to 10% per year with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%. 
As we look to 2017, considering all of the acquisitions closed to-date, which to refresh your memory were Veda and the small Barnett acquisition, we expect to achieve revenue growth at the high-end of our total growth model. As it's too early to make a call in the U.S. mortgage market, this assumes the U.S. mortgage market will be largely flat in 2017. And as always, we'll provide you more detail on our outlook for 2017 during our February call.

Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today at www.equifax.com in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab.
During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.
For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain onetime items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.
These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.

For the corporation, we'll get into some details of the business unit level. John will go through the financial details. I'll come back with some closing comments before questions. 
Third quarter was just another outstanding broad-based performance by the team. This really continues to impress me. The growth we had in the third quarter accelerated from the first half of the year that added to our strong outperformance year-to-date. 
All our 4 business units continue to execute at a very high level, driving impressive expansion in our revenue, adjusted EBITDA margins and the bottom line results. 
For the quarter, total revenue was $804 million, up 20% on reported basis and up 23% on a local currency basis from the third quarter of last year. 
Organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first half coming in strongly at 13%, up over last year. 
In the quarter, FX created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9% compared to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015, representing a very solid year-on-year increase and well above our annual 25-basis-point target increase and the -- well above our 75-basis-point expectation we have for the full year of 2016. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.44, up 26% from $1.14 in the third quarter last year and better than our expectations when we gave third quarter guidance back in July of this year. 
So let me jump in to the individual BU's. As always, I'll start with USIS. They had delivered a solid 9% revenue growth, significant acceleration from the first half, driven by broad-based new product revenue, including trended data. We can talk more about trended data in a second and we'll get into it the Q&A as well. 
Trended data now is a reality. As expected, Fannie Mae launched its desktop underwriter in late September and as we indicated during our second quarter call, billing for trended data began in August for all mortgage-related inquiries. Revenue for the third quarter largely came in as we had expected. 
We have a very good relationship with Fannie Mae, and initiated discussions on trended data with them nearly 3 years ago. We continue to see opportunities to work with Fannie in transforming the mortgage space, including the announcement just this week of a launch of Fannie's desktop underwriter validation services, which incorporates verified consumer income and employment information from Workforce Solutions. We believe that will be a nice catalyst for continued mortgage growth for EWS going forward. 
Additionally, from our data and analytics team, they continue its efforts in -- to completed a variety of analyses to assess the lift from trended data for other decisioning activities. We've talked to you about that in the past. It's really getting on the granular levels by vertical, by subvertical, by unique data assets and understanding what the lifts is. In catalyst, trended data provides approximately a 15% lift in assessing prime accounts for the propensity to open a home equity loan and a 20% lift in assessing prime accounts for default risk on home equity loans. 
With the advent of Cambrian, which you're familiar with, we now have an analytical environment containing over 80 months or more of the historical data across many of our unique data assets. 
Data Cambrian is a nonproduction environment providing unparalleled ability to deliver compelling customer insights. But today, we're onto building analytics and insights on trended data is 80 months or more, including the credit file and other unique data assets. In 2017, we're going to move the 24 months of trended data we have in the credit file to significantly beyond the 24 months in the production environment. I think that will open up a whole new realm of opportunities to work with our customers and solve problems that we couldn't solve before. 
Second, with USIS on September 30, we reached a long-term agreement with SBFE to become a certified vendor. We now will be able to combine our CFN, Commercial Financial Network data assets with SBFE data to deliver best-in-class solutions for small business information customers. 
USIS is expected to deliver revenue growth for the fourth quarter at the high-end of the targeted range, which we communicated as 5% to 7%. And EBITDA margins will continue to be above 50% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
International. They continue to make great progress on its most -- on their most important strategic initiatives while delivering third quarter local currency revenue growth of 60% and organic local currency revenue growth of 10%. 
In the quarter reported, adjusted -- In the quarter, they reported, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by over 200 basis points from the year prior. Veda integration continues to go well and remains on schedule. Some sub-bullets under Veda where we talked before our global platform deployments into Veda, which includes Cambrian and Ostra [ph], our fraud platform, are underway and expected to be operational in mid-2017. 
The NPI process has been established with the local leadership team and will be incorporating the Veda NPI revenue into our Vitality Index beginning in 2017. 
We've also identified a number of opportunities to export some of Veda's products to other international geographies. Debt placement from the U.K. government is now up to GBP 1.6 billion. And our performance year-to-date, it's exceeding the baseline performance we had established.  
We now have all 6 founding agencies of the U.K. government boarded and have analytical projects underway with 2 additional agencies. While the initiative is still in the early stages, we're extremely pleased with both our relationship with the U.K. agencies and the financial results we're delivering. 
Organic revenue in international's 5 largest verticals, FI, telco, government, retail and auto. In aggregate, was up 13% for the quarter. International decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew 19% in the quarter. This high-value -- the high-value solutions continues to strengthen our relationships with customers and our market position. 
In the coming quarters, we will be installing more sophisticated technology platforms i.e., InterConnect, our Ostra [ph] platform and Cambrian throughout our international footprint drive future revenue growth. 
Canada continues to grow very good momentum with trended data. In the third quarter, we launched Cambrian platform, which will further enhance our competitive position with best-in-class solutions, leveraging trended data. 
International is expected to deliver organic constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full year, above the upper end of this long-term model of 8% to 10%. 
Reported revenue growth for 2016 is expected to approach 55%.  Adjusted EBITDA margins should increase sequentially and exit the year approaching 30%. 
Workforce Solutions' strong moment has resulted in another outstanding performance in the third quarter, with 23% revenue growth and a 350-basis-point expansion in the EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Total records in the Work Number database now approaches our short-term goal of $300 million with over 6,600 different data contributors to that database. Our initiatives to further penetrate key verticals led to strong double-digit growth in mortgage, auto, government and preemployment, to name a few. 
Revenue from our health care vertical comprised of income and employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics from employers grew over 240% in the quarter. 
In the quarter, Workforce Solutions completed the acquisition of Barnett/VJS, a small regional provider of employment and income verification and unemployment insurance services, to further accelerate the growth of the Work Number database. It's early days but it's going very well. 
As I stated earlier this week, a little more color around Fannie Mae, they announced the integration of our full suite of employment and income verification services into their desktop underwriting platform. The employment and income verification services includes data from Workforce Solutions with Work Number database providing instant and waterfall employment and income verification services. 
With these services, our earnings cycle times will be reduced and the lender's reliance on applicant providing W-2, pay stubs or other income or documentations will be eliminated, and this gives them protection should a mortgage not perform and protects them from having the banks put the mortgages back to them. So it's a great benefit for EWS. 
Workforce Solutions is having an outstanding year in 2016 both organic and reported revenue growth are expected to exceed 15% in the fourth quarter and 20% for 2016, substantially above its long-term range of 9% to 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be nicely over 45% for the fourth quarter 2016 and the high 40s for the full year. Global Consumer Solutions continues to make great progress on strategic initiatives particularly building out a strong market position in both DTC reseller and indirect markets that include partnerships with a number of very successful companies that we've talked about before, such as Credit Karma, LifeLock, H&R Block and others. 
We're pleased to announce we have executed a new longer-term partnership with Credit Karma. The new and expanded partnership is focused on growing both of our businesses by leveraging unique data assets, innovation and analytics, including the use of our Cambrian platform and expanding our partnerships beyond the borders of the U.S. 
This quarter, we deployed our new Global Consumer platform called renaissance, a best-in-class SaaS-based e-commerce platform, which provides much greater marketing flexibility to serve our partners. During the quarter, we successfully transitioned one of our largest customers to this new platform and by the end of 2017, we will have deployed this newest platform across all portions of our U.S. business and will be well in our way to deploying it across other geographies in which we operate. 
Global Consumer Solutions is expected to deliver fourth quarter and full year 2016 constant currency revenue growth exceeding 15% with fourth quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA margin at approximately 30%. 
Few high-level points at the corporate level before John gets into the financial details. Things we've talked to you about before that's so important to our culture and our results. First is our enterprise growth initiatives, which are our largest and most complex growth initiatives we have. They're performing very well in 2016, with revenue generation projected to be up over 35% from our expectations earlier this year and over 3x the revenue generated from EGI in 2015. 
Our overall performance in new product innovations, initiatives in 2016 is also outstanding. The 3-year revenue from our 2016 launches is expected to be more than 170% above the expected 3-year revenue from out 2015 launches. This is the strongest NPI performance we've had since it was built and created some 10 years ago. 
Our Vitality Index we had last year and the pipeline of new products continues to be very robust. To date, we've launched approximately 40 new products and expect to launch another 20 products before year-end. 
In summary, our strategic initiatives continue to perform well and are ahead of our expectations that we had at the beginning of the year. With this continued focus on improving the process, allows us to drive continuous growth. I expect these initiatives will continue to drive and deliver incremental revenue growth in 2017 and beyond. 
So with that, John?"

The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Now, let me turn to the business units financial performance for the third quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $317 million, up 9% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Online Information Solutions revenue was $230 million, up 7% when compared to the year-ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 39% in the quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index growth accelerated significantly, up 35% in the third quarter compared to the 20% growth we saw in the second quarter. 
Given a much stronger mortgage market performance on 3Q '16 and continued accommodative  interest rate environment, we now expect the mortgage market to grow solidly double-digit in 2016. 
Financial marketing services revenue was $48 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago quarter. Our commercial products suite grew 8% in 3Q. We have made great progress building the Equifax commercial financial network, which includes tradeline data from banking and other financial institutions similar to the SBFE, as well as communications and utilities, wholesale trade, printing, publishing, chemicals and allied products and rental and leasing data. 
When combined with Equifax consumer credit data, we can now offer substantially differentiated data and analytics to our U.S. commercial customers. 
Identity and Fraud Solutions also continue to grow strongly, up 19% in 3Q and 23% year-to-date. USIS direct-to-consumer revenue, principally our revenue with other CRAs, was down over 20% in the quarter and largely in line with the first half. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions in 3Q '16 was 50.6%, up from 49.9% in the third quarter of 2015. Workforce Solutions revenue was $171 million for the quarter, up 23% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $115 million was also up 23% and continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and preemployment. 
Employer Services revenue of $57 million was up 23% from last year as well. Revenue growth from unemployment insurance, I-9, tax incentives and other HR services was consistent with the annual model of mid-single digit growth. 
ACA analytics revenue was up substantially in the quarter versus 3Q '15, driving much of the growth. As we had indicated previously, ACA analytics revenue was down sequentially and from the first half run rate. As expected, given that the ACA business is seasonal with higher revenue in the first half of the year when 1095s are delivered to employees. 
The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%, up from 43.5% in 3Q '15 and in line with our expectations. Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions, our total U.S. B2B revenue was $489 million, representing organic growth of 13%. 
International's revenue was $214 million, up 47% on a reported basis and 60% on a local currency basis when compared to 3Q '15. Organic constant currency revenue growth was approximately 10%. 
By region, Europe's revenue was $62 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency. We have seen some moderate impact on local currency revenue following the Brexit vote, with selected large U.K. financial institutions. 
Debt management grew nicely in the quarter as our relationship with the U.K. government continues to perform as we had expected. The sharp depreciation of the British pound following the Brexit vote in late July significantly impacted U.S. dollar revenue growth in the region for the third quarter. 
The almost 7% decline in the British pound in early October will further impact 4Q '16 U.S. dollar revenue growth. Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars but up 9% in local currency. The over 60% depreciation of the Argentinian peso from late December of 2015 through March of '16 has negatively impacted the U.S. dollar performance of our largest and most profitable country in the region. 
Asia Pacific revenue was $74 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda. Canada revenue was $32 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currency. Canada continues to perform in line with our expectations, including substantial improvements and the New Product Innovation initiatives, which includes trended data. 
For the third quarter, international's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 26.2% in 3Q '15. On a constant currency basis, margins expanded over 300 basis points versus 3Q '15 and almost 50 basis points sequentially. As Rick indicated, 4Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase sequentially and approach 30% in 4Q '16. 
Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $101 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis. Growth, again, was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers. For the third quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%, in line with our expectations. The adjusted EBITDA margin was down from 30.8% in 3Q '15, but up significantly from the 26.4% in 2Q '16 when we were boarding LifeLock. 
In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $52 million consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, total general corporate expense is expected to be slightly above $55 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9%, up 130 basis points from 34.6% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins reflects year-over-year growth in USIS, Workforce Solutions and international. 
We expect the fourth Q '16 adjusted EBITDA margin to be above Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin and our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin to be up more than 100 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015. 
As Rick mentioned before, this is nicely above the target for 2016 of a 75-basis-point expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter at 29.1% was below the anticipated level of 32.5%, which we communicated during our July earnings call. 
The lower effective tax rate reflects several discrete or onetime items, which benefited our effective tax rate by over 3 percentage points and our adjusted EPS by about $0.05 a share. 
Our current expectation is that Q4 tax rate will be approximately 32.5%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48 million and year-to-date are $131 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be about 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range as investments are made related to our integration of Veda. 
Year-to-date, operating cash flow remained strong at $525 million. Total debt in the quarter was $2.86 billion. We continue to reduce our leverage following the Veda acquisition, which is now down at 2.58x. Our target is to reduce leverage back to approximately 2.25x EBITDA, which we expect to occur in 2017. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."
175749,403276336,2008445,"Equifax Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John.

I trust you agree 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company. Strong and consistent execution throughout the company has resulted in a broad-based performance that significantly exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. We firmly believe this positions us well for growth in 2017. 
For the fourth quarter, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $797 million and $801 million. Effective constant currency revenue growth of just over 22%, partially offset by about 2% of FX headwind. This reflects organic growth of over 12%. The almost 7% depreciation in the U.K. pound in early October, which John just referenced, resulted in the majority of the incremental $6 million of FX headwind versus our expectations for the fourth quarter when we gave guidance back in July. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.35 and $1.38, which is up 18% to 21% for the fourth quarter. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative FX, this reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 21% to 24%. 
With this outlook, our second half organic constant currency growth is approximately 12% and in line with the outlook we gave in the second half revenue growth during our second quarter earnings call, which you will recall, which we guided to 11% to 13%. 
For the year now, we expect revenue to be approximately $3.145 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of approximately 21%, partially offset by 3% of FX headwind. 
Adjusting for the significant depreciation and FX, principally the British pound, this is at the high-end of the guidance we provided in July. This is also impressive performance by the team when compared to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. For revenue, as you recall, we guided to more than $3 billion, $3.1 billion in revenue. 
Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.45 and $5.48, which is up 21% to 22%. Excluding approximately $0.14 per share full year in negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 24% to 25%. This is up significantly from the guidance we provided you in July and compares favorably from the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year for adjusted EPS, which you remember was $4.95 to $5.05. 
For the year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by over 100 basis points up from the previous expectations, which were 75 basis points. As we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term constant currency financial model of total revenue growth of 7% to 10% per year with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%. 
As we look to 2017, considering all of the acquisitions closed to-date, which to refresh your memory were Veda and the small Barnett acquisition, we expect to achieve revenue growth at the high-end of our total growth model. As it's too early to make a call in the U.S. mortgage market, this assumes the U.S. mortgage market will be largely flat in 2017. And as always, we'll provide you more detail on our outlook for 2017 during our February call. 
But at this point in time, with the way the team is executing on the growth initiatives in EGI and NPI, we remain very bullish throughout this in 2017.

So assuming price appreciation on houses of maybe 6%, I guess, to around 20% down in terms of unit volumes.
