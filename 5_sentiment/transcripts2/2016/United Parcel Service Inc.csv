Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO, along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn. 
Before we begin, I want to review the safe harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2014 Form 10-K and 2015 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS' Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Before we begin, I would like to make you aware of a few adjusting entries that impact our reported results. UPS recorded a noncash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $79 million. The charred resulted from lower asset returns that were partially offset by higher discount rates. Investment returns on plan assets were negatively affected by the overall market performance. The impact of the shortfall was mostly offset by increased interest rates used to calculate the plan discount rate. In the prior year period, the company reported noncash after-tax charge of $692 million. The charge related to pension mark-to-market was $670 million and the amount of the health care liability transfer was $22 million. More details on mark-to-market accounting are available in the presentation that is on the IR website. 
Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2015 were $1.57 and GAAP earnings per share were $1.48, while fourth quarter 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.25 and GAAP earnings per share were $0.49. 
In our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS's free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. [Operator Instructions] 
Thank you for your cooperation. Now I will turn the call over to David."

Our results make it quite a good morning here at UPS. I'm pleased to report a very positive fourth quarter, capping our strong full year performance. A year ago, we laid out a plan for successful peak in 2015. This yea",915,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Our results make it quite a good morning here at UPS. I'm pleased to report a very positive fourth quarter, capping our strong full year performance. A year ago, we laid out a plan for successful peak in 2015. This year, through the extraordinary efforts of UPSs around the globe, we delivered the quality service that customers deserve and the financial discipline that shareowners expect. This was the fourth consecutive quarter that UPS exceeded financial expectations. In this quarter, we expanded margins and produced double-digit operating profit growth in all 3 business segments. That's worth repeating, all 3 segments demonstrated excellent operating profit growth. In fact, the International segment achieved its best quarterly and full year results ever, exceeding $2 billion in annual operating profit. UPS ended 2015 with record fourth quarter earnings per share and the highest operating profit ever reported. Full year 2015 diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $5.43, an all-time high. 
Although the industrial side of the economy has slowed, the explosive growth of e-commerce continues to create great opportunity. I want to spend some time discussing how we capitalize on our peak season opportunity by managing the challenges it creates. I can sum it up in 3 words: collaboration, control, commitment. Expanded collaboration with customers, combined with key investments, were central to our success. We work together with a shared interest in fully utilizing UPS network capacity while simultaneously maintaining excellent service. UPS implemented certain pricing controls and maintained disciplined operating plans to ensure our peak package value did not jeopardize the overall integrity of the network and could be delivered on time. 
For example, we optimized available capacity during the weekend prior to Christmas and collaborated with customers to tender shipments ahead of the original schedule. This moved our peak day up to December 21 and smoothed volume for the rest of the week, ensuring our customers' packages reached their customers' doorsteps before Christmas. This year, our customers worked more closely with us than ever, and I want to thank them for making adjustments and being flexible. Together, we delivered a successful peak season. Again, working closely with our customers, we delivered a successful peak season.
Turning to control. Our actions to tighten dispatch, reduce special sorts and implement just-in-time hiring resulted in significant cost benefits for UPS as we exercised more precise control over the network. We also expanded capacity, opened more than 8,000 UPS Access Points in the U.S. and completed several automation projects across the network. These investments provide year-round benefits. In fact, our automated air facilities were essential in servicing nearly 13% growth in U.S. Domestic air volume during the quarter. The flexibility of our integrated network also gave us the control needed to seamlessly move volume between air, rail and ground to maintain excellent on-time service. This year, we again implemented a management process called the control tower in the U.S. and expanded it to Canada and Europe. We handled customers unplanned volume surges by efficiently utilizing available UPS network capacity. Our goal was to find a solution that worked for our customers and UPS. Working together, we were able to service more than 90% of these last-minute requests. 
Another aspect of control is managing outside transportation cost, which spikes dramatically during this time of year. Our recent acquisition of Coyote Logistics helped manage this expense. They played an expanded role this peak season and provided truckload brokerage service for UPS and its customers. Coyote's synergies remained on plan.
The final [indiscernible] is commitment, exemplified by the actions of our employees to deliver on-time service during a period when our volume nearly doubles. There are numerous examples of UPSers going the extra mile every day for our customers and they again demonstrated that commitment this peak season. I want to take a moment to say thank you to all the UPSers around the globe whose enthusiasm and extraordinary efforts during the holiday season produced these great results. I am proud of their determination, dedication and hard work. While peak season 2015 helped drive strong fourth quarter results, we've turned our attention to 2016. Our business is more diverse than retail in peak season. Customers continue to choose UPS because of our broad portfolio of solutions across many industries like health care, aerospace, high-tech and manufacturing. We will continue to capitalize on opportunities within these market segments by further expanding our network, improving operational efficiency and focusing on high-growth and adjacent markets.
Looking at the global economy. Conditions remain uncertain with the first half of 2016 continuing the mixed economic trends from the last half of 2015. Across Europe and Asia, GDP growth was modest in 2015. However, slight improvements are expected this year. At the same time, we continue to see challenges in emerging markets in 2016.
Global macroeconomic conditions reinforced the need for nations to continue making progress on free trade agreements such as TPP and [indiscernible]. While the U.S. GDP growth outlook is muted for the first half of 2016, it is expected to gain straight in the second half. Further, the U.S. remains dependent on a consumer-based economy for growth, while industrial manufacturing continues to be held down by a strong dollar and lower global demand.
Through this uncertain backdrop, UPS will continue to implement our investment and growth strategies in 2016. Our strong execution of these strategies will enable UPS to continue to create excellent shareholder value. 
Now Richard will give you more details."

It's good to be with you this morning and report on an outstanding fourth quarter. All 3 segments performed better than expected. They achieve solid results by focusing on revenue management and operational execution. These efforts expanded",1278,"Thanks, David. It's good to be with you this morning and report on an outstanding fourth quarter. All 3 segments performed better than expected. They achieve solid results by focusing on revenue management and operational execution. These efforts expanded operating margins and increased shareowner value. Total fourth quarter revenue was up slightly to $16.1 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, it was up 2.4%. Changes to currency and lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue by more than $600 million. Overall, UPS produced fourth quarter earnings per share for 2015 of $1.57, up 26% from last year. Full year 2015 earnings per share were $5.43, a 14% increase over 2014. These results included discrete tax credits of about $0.07 for the quarter and $0.10 for the year. Excluding these on an annual basis, earnings per share grew more than 12%.
Now turning to details within the business segments. In the U.S., we had a great quarter. Revenue was up 2.6% to $10.3 billion. Lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue growth by about 250 basis points. Average daily volume increased 2.4%, led by deferred air products up 15% and Next Day Air up 10%. Clearly, UPS customers are choosing the value of our air products to meet their customers' expectations.
Both business and residential deliveries grew in the quarter with B2C outpacing B2B 2 to 1. E-commerce continued to drive higher residential shipments. In fact, in December, more than 60% of our deliveries were to consumers. Revenue per package increased slightly as strong base rates and product mix improvements were somewhat offset by lower fuel surcharges and changing customer mix. Operating profit jumped 18% to more than $1.3 billion, and margin expanded 170 basis points to 13.1%. 
Solid execution of the peak operating plan and our network investments led to productivity gains. Average daily direct labor hours declined about 1%, with package deliveries increased 2.4%, some of the best results we've produced. The growth in e-commerce continues to increase delivery stops in our network. During the fourth quarter, delivery stops increased 5.1%. That's more than twice as fast as our volume growth. Technology and investments such as ORION are enabling us to reduce the cost of residential stops. As a result, we held package delivery miles flat and reduced cost per piece. These results demonstrate our ability to adapt. We're bending the cost curve and the U.S. team is delivering high quality service while improving efficiency and cost.
Looking now at the International segment. We had a record-setting quarter and year, achieving a 16% improvement in our fourth quarter operating profit of $624 million, delivering greater than 10% profit growth every quarter in 2015. Our results are driven by 2 efforts. First, rate actions had begun late in 2015, resulted in losing some low-yielding accounts predominantly affecting the international domestic volume. And second, network management improvements continue to contribute to bottom line results as we modified international block hours to match volume and trade lane demand. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion. Base rates increased across all regions, although they were offset by about a 350 basis point drag from lower fuel surcharges. Total export shipment growth slowed, reflecting the execution of previously mentioned pricing initiatives along with varying market growth rates around the world. Imports from Europe into the U.S. was strong for the fourth consecutive quarter, aided in part by the appreciating U.S. dollar. The International business continues to demonstrate the ability to adjust in an unsteady economic environment.
Turning to the Supply Chain & Freight group. Operating profit grew more than 11% with an expanded operating margin. Overall revenue growth increased 6% with the addition of Coyote. However, organic revenue growth declined due to 2 factors: first, ongoing weakness in both forwarding and U.S. LTL markets; and secondly, the continuation of our targeted revenue management actions. Both the forwarding and UPS Freight units are executed initiatives that are driving change into customer mix to improve profitability. The forwarding unit improved operating margins as the group held firm with rates, achieving their highest buy-sell rate spread in the last few years. In UPS Freight, LTL revenue per hundredweight improved 2.1% with a drag of about 550 basis points from lower fuel surcharges. However, market conditions continue to challenge UPS Freight as they saw tonnage decline about 12%. The distribution unit saw double digit revenue growth from targeted industries, health care and aerospace, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe.
Now let's turn to our cash flow. Throughout 2015, UPS continued to generate healthy free cash flow, producing over $5 billion after $2.4 billion in capital investments. Once again, we returned more than 100% of net income to shareowners as UPS purchased 27 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion and paid down another $2.5 billion in dividends, up 9% per share over last year. 
Looking at our tax rate, as previously mentioned during the quarter, UPS results a few outstanding tax items. Together these resulted in $63 million of discrete credits of or about $0.07 per share. For 2016, we expect our tax rate to be 35.25%.
Now I'll cover the rest of our guidance. We expect 2016 to be another good year at UPS. Revenue should increase between 6% and 8%. Looking more closely at the segments. In the U.S., the domestic segment average daily volume should increase about 2% to 4%, driving revenue up 4% to 6%. Operating margin is forecasted to expand and operating profit should grow 5% to 9%.
In the International business, shipments per day are projected to increase 2% to 4%. Growth rates will be held down during the first half of the year due to the revenue management actions we discussed earlier. We anticipate a drag of about 150 basis points from nonhedged currencies and lower fuel surcharges. As a result, revenue will grow in a similar pace as volume. Operating profit is expected to be up 8% to 12% with some margin expansion. 
In the Supply Chain & Freight segment, revenue should be up 15% to 20% with Coyote adding for the full year. The segment's organic revenue growth is projected between 3% and 5%. Operating profit growth is forecasted between 6% and 10%. However, first quarter growth will likely be down about 8% to 12% from last year due to the continued softness in the LTL, freight brokerage and freight forwarding markets. As a reminder, the West Coast port strike provided some benefits in 2015. Operating margin for the Supply Chain & Freight segment should be around 7%. For the total company, we expect our 2016 operating profit distribution by quarter to be very similar to 2015. From a cash flow perspective, investment in the business remains our first priority with CapEx expected to be about 4.5% of revenue or $2.8 billion. Next we remain committed to paying a strong dividend. 
Finally, we have about $2.7 billion in share repurchases planned. As we've mentioned in the past, we will continue to follow this framework and make necessary adjustments if new opportunities arise. Overall, we expect 2016 to be a solid year for UPS. We will continue to execute on our investments as planned and the network improvements we're banking are producing financial benefits. As a result, we are projecting diluted earnings per share to increase within the range of $5.70 to $5.90, a growth rate of 5% to 9%, and when excluding the 2015 tax credits, our growth rate is 7% to 11%. 
In closing, despite the unsteady economic climate, we are well positioned to make significant progress again in 2016. Thank you for your attention. I'll ask the operator to open the lines so we can take your questions. Operator?"

In fact, it was 5% growth this year and we will really think 2016 is a continuation of what we did in 2015. It does have some cycles through the quarters. Obviously, we talked about each quarter kind of looking similar to the previous year. And so when you think about how our volume grows our revenue and our profits, I would point you back to that. But we feel really good about where we're at. We think it's not just what's happening outside -- externally on the macro environment. It's also all the initiatives and the things that we're doing inside UPS right now that are gaining traction and are actually the reasons that the results were so good for the fourth quarter and for all of 2015."

And the primary goal there was to optimize the network capacity and find solutions that work for our customers and UPS. And in fact, between Cyber Week and Super Weekend, we were able to accommodate all the customer requests. And during those final few days, there was a few that we needed to turn down. But even then, some of those were some dual source customers who chose not to make longer-term business commitments to UPS. So we thought it was a resounding success. We had a very disciplined approach to the volume, the capacity and managing the yields to produce the excellent fourth quarter that we had."

Joining me today are: David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn. 
Before we begin, I want to review the safe harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2014 Form 10-K and 2015 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Before we begin, I would like to make you aware of a few adjusting entries that impact our reported results. UPS recorded a noncash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $79 million. The charge resulted from lower asset returns that were partially offset by higher discount rates. Investment returns on plan assets were negatively affected by the overall market performance. The impact of the shortfall was mostly offset by increased interest rates used to calculate the plan discount rate. In the prior year period, the company reported a noncash after-tax charge of $692 million. The charge related to pension mark-to-market was $670 million and the amount of the health care liability transfer was $22 million. More details on mark-to-market accounting are available in the presentation that is on the IR website. Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2015 were $1.57 and GAAP earnings per share were $1.48 while fourth quarter 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.25 and GAAP earnings per share were $0.49. 
In our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS's free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. [Operator Instructions] 
Thank you for your cooperation. Now I will turn the call over to David."

A year ago, we laid out a plan for a successful peak in 2015. This y",917,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Our results make it quite a good morning here at UPS. I'm pleased to report a very positive fourth quarter, capping our strong full year performance. A year ago, we laid out a plan for a successful peak in 2015. This year, through the extraordinary efforts of UPSs around the globe, we delivered the high-quality service that customers deserve and the financial discipline that shareowners expect. 
This was the fourth consecutive quarter that UPS exceeded financial expectations. In this quarter, we expanded margins and produced double-digit operating profit growth in all 3 business segments. That's worth repeating, all 3 segments demonstrated excellent operating profit growth. In fact, the International segment achieved its best quarterly and full year results ever, exceeding $2 billion in annual operating profit. UPS ended 2015 with record fourth quarter earnings per share and the highest operating profit ever reported. Full year 2015 diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $5.43, an all-time high. 
Although the industrial side of the economy has slowed, the explosive growth of e-commerce continues to create great opportunity. I want to spend some time discussing how we capitalized on our peak season opportunity by managing the challenges it creates. I can sum it up in 3 words: collaboration, control, commitment. Expanded collaboration with customers, combined with key investments, were central to our success. We worked together with a shared interest in fully utilizing UPS network capacity while simultaneously maintaining excellent service. UPS implemented certain pricing controls and maintained disciplined operating plans to ensure our peak package volume did not jeopardize the overall integrity of the network and could be delivered on time. 
For example, we optimized available capacity during the weekend prior to Christmas and collaborated with customers to tender shipments ahead of the original schedule. This moved our peak day up to December 21 and smoothed volume for the rest of the week, ensuring our customers' packages reached their customers' doorsteps before Christmas. This year, our customers worked more closely with us than ever. And I want to thank them for making adjustments and being flexible. Together, we delivered a successful peak season. Again, working closely with our customers, we delivered a successful peak season.
Turning to control. Our actions to tighten dispatch, reduce special sorts and implement just-in-time hiring resulted in significant cost benefits for UPS as we exercised more precise control over the network. We also expanded capacity, opened more than 8,000 UPS Access Points in the U.S. and completed several automation projects across the network. These investments provide year-round benefits. In fact, our automated air facilities were essential in servicing nearly 13% growth in U.S. domestic air volume during the quarter. The flexibility of our integrated network also gave us the control needed to seamlessly move volume between air, rail and ground to maintain excellent on-time service. 
This year, we again implemented a management process called the control tower in the U.S. and expanded it to Canada and Europe. We handled customers unplanned volume surges by efficiently utilizing available UPS network capacity. Our goal was to find a solution that worked for our customers and UPS. Working together, we were able to service more than 90% of these last-minute requests. Another aspect of control is managing outside transportation cost, which spikes dramatically during this time of year. Our recent acquisition of Coyote Logistics helped manage this expense. They played an expanded role this peak season and provided truckload brokerage service for UPS and its customers. Coyote's synergies remained on plan.
The final C is commitment, exemplified by the actions of our employees to deliver on-time service during a period when our volume nearly doubles. There are numerous examples of UPSers going the extra mile every day for our customers. And they again demonstrated that commitment this peak season. I want to take a moment to say thank you to all the UPSers around the world, whose enthusiasm and extraordinary efforts during the holiday season produced these great results. I am proud of their determination, dedication and hard work. 
While peak season 2015 helped drive strong fourth quarter results, we've turned our attention to 2016. Our business is more diverse than retail in peak season. Customers continue to choose UPS because of our broad portfolio of solutions across many industries, like health care, aerospace, high tech and manufacturing. We will continue to capitalize on opportunities within these market segments by further expanding our network, improving operational efficiency and focusing on high-growth and adjacent markets.
Looking at the global economy. Conditions remain uncertain with the first half of 2016 continuing the mixed economic trends from the last half of 2015. Across Europe and Asia, GDP growth was modest in 2015. However, slight improvements are expected this year. At the same time, we continue to see challenges in emerging markets in 2016. Global macroeconomic conditions reinforce the need for nations to continue making progress on free trade agreements, such as TPP and TTIP. 
While the U.S. GDP growth outlook is muted for the first half of 2016, it is expected to gain strength in the second half. Further, the U.S. remains dependent on a consumer-based economy for growth while industrial manufacturing continues to be held down by a strong dollar and lower global demand. Through this uncertain backdrop, UPS will continue to implement our investment and growth strategies in 2016. Our strong execution of these strategies will enable UPS to continue to create excellent shareholder value. 
Now Richard will give you more details."

It's good to be with you this morning and report on an outstanding fourth quarter. All 3 segments performed better than expected.

It's good to be with you this morning and report on an outstanding fourth quarter. All 3 segments performed better than expected. They achieved solid results by focusing on revenue management and operational execution. These efforts expanded operating margins and increased shareowner value. 
Total fourth quarter revenue was up slightly to $16.1 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, it was up 2.4%. Changes to currency and lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue by more than $600 million. Overall, UPS produced fourth quarter earnings per share for 2015 of $1.57, up 26% from last year. Full year 2015 earnings per share were $5.43, a 14% increase over 2014. These results included discrete tax credits of about $0.07 for the quarter and $0.10 for the year. Excluding these on an annual basis, earnings per share grew more than 12%.
Now turning to details within the business segments. In the U.S., we had a great quarter. Revenue was up 2.6% to $10.3 billion. Lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue growth by about 250 basis points. Average daily volume increased 2.4%, led by Deferred Air products, up 15%, and Next Day Air, up 10%. Clearly, UPS customers are choosing the value of our air products to meet their customers' expectations.
Both business and residential deliveries grew in the quarter with B2C outpacing B2B 2:1. E-commerce continued to drive higher residential shipments. In fact, in December, more than 60% of our deliveries were to consumers. Revenue per package increased slightly as strong base rates and product mix improvements were somewhat offset by lower fuel surcharges and changing customer mix. Operating profit jumped 18% to more than $1.3 billion and margin expanded 170 basis points to 13.1%. Solid execution of the peak operating plan and our network investments led to productivity gains. Average daily direct labor hours declined about 1% while package deliveries increased 2.4%, some of the best results we've produced. 
The growth in e-commerce continues to increase delivery stops in our network. During the fourth quarter, delivery stops increased 5.1%. That's more than twice as fast as our volume growth. Technology investments, such as ORION, are enabling us to reduce the cost of residential stops. As a result, we held package delivery miles flat and reduced cost per piece. These results demonstrate our ability to adapt. We're bending the cost curve and the U.S. team is delivering high-quality service while improving efficiency and cost.
Looking now at the International segment. We had a record-setting quarter and year, achieving a 16% improvement in our fourth quarter operating profit of $624 million, delivering greater than 10% profit growth every quarter in 2015. Our results are driven by 2 efforts. First, rate actions that began late in 2015 resulted in losing some low-yielding accounts, predominantly affecting the International domestic volume. And second, network management improvements continued to contribute to bottom line results as we modified International block hours to match volume and trade lane demand. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion. Base rates increased across all regions, although they were offset by about a 350 basis point drag from lower fuel surcharges. Total export shipment growth slowed, reflecting the execution of previously mentioned pricing initiatives, along with varying market growth rates around the world. Imports from Europe into the U.S. was strong for the fourth consecutive quarter, aided in part by the appreciating U.S. dollar. The International business continues to demonstrate the ability to adjust in an unsteady economic environment.
Turning to the Supply Chain & Freight group. Operating profit grew more than 11% with an expanded operating margin. Overall revenue growth increased 6% with the addition of Coyote. However, organic revenue growth declined due to 2 factors: first, ongoing weakness in both forwarding and U.S. LTL markets; and secondly, the continuation of our targeted revenue management actions. Both the Forwarding and UPS Freight units are executing initiatives that are driving change into customer mix to improve profitability. 
The Forwarding unit improved operating margins as the group held firm with rates, achieving their highest buy-sell rate spread in the last few years. In UPS Freight, LTL revenue per hundredweight improved 2.1% with a drag of about 550 basis points from lower fuel surcharges. However, market conditions continued to challenge UPS Freight as they saw tonnage decline about 12%. The distribution unit saw double-digit revenue growth from targeted industries, health care and aerospace, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe.
Now let's turn to our cash flow. Throughout 2015, UPS continued to generate healthy free cash flow, producing over $5 billion after $2.4 billion in capital investments. Once again, we returned more than 100% of net income to shareowners as UPS purchased 27 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion and paid out another $2.5 billion in dividends, up 9% per share over last year. Looking at our tax rate, as previously mentioned during the quarter, UPS resolved a few outstanding tax items. Together, these resulted in $63 million of discrete credits or about $0.07 per share. For 2016, we expect our tax rate to be 35.25%.
Now I'll cover the rest of our guidance. We expect 2016 to be another good year at UPS. Revenue should increase between 6% and 8%. Looking more closely at the segments, in the U.S., the domestic segment average daily volume should increase about 2% to 4%, driving revenue up 4% to 6%. Operating margin is forecasted to expand and operating profit should grow 5% to 9%. In the International business, shipments per day are projected to increase 2% to 4%. Growth rates will be held down during the first half of the year due to the revenue management actions we discussed earlier. We anticipate a drag of about 150 basis points from non-hedged currencies and lower fuel surcharges. As a result, revenue will grow at a similar pace as volume. Operating profit is expected to be up 8% to 12% with some margin expansion. 
In the Supply Chain & Freight segment, revenue should be up 15% to 20% with Coyote added for the full year. The segment's organic revenue growth is projected between 3% and 5%. Operating profit growth is forecasted between 6% and 10%. However, first quarter growth will likely be down about 8% to 12% from last year due to the continued softness in the LTL, freight brokerage and freight forwarding markets. As a reminder, the West Coast port strike provided some benefits in 2015. Operating margin for the Supply Chain & Freight segment should be around 7%. For the total company, we expect our 2016 operating profit distribution by quarter to be very similar to 2015. From a cash flow perspective, investment in the business remains our first priority with CapEx expected to be about 4.5% of revenue or $2.8 billion. Next, we remain committed to paying a strong dividend. 
Finally, we have about $2.7 billion in share repurchases planned. As we've mentioned in the past, we will continue to follow this framework and make necessary adjustments if new opportunities arise. Overall, we expect 2016 to be a solid year for UPS. We will continue to execute on our investments as planned and the network improvements we're making are producing financial benefits. As a result, we are projecting diluted earnings per share to increase within the range of $5.70 to $5.90, a growth rate of 5% to 9%. And when excluding the 2015 tax credits, our growth rate is 7% to 11%. 
In closing, despite the unsteady economic climate, we are well positioned to make significant progress again in 2016. Thank you for your attention. I'll ask the operator to open the lines, so we can take your questions. Operator?"

Certainly, the soft industrial production that David mentioned and certainly some of the revenue management action on some of the low-yielding accounts earlier in the year for peak had some impact.

And I think that goes through the process, and we've done that each year the last few years whenever we make an adjustment. This year, it was a much smaller adjustment. And I think once you go through that, after some more questions, we can handle that appropriately. In terms of the volume and the guidance on volume, we did have solid top line growth this year. In fact, it was 5% growth this year. And we really see 2016 as a continuation of what we did in 2015. It does have some cycles through the quarters. Obviously, we talked about each quarter kind of looking similar to the previous year. And so when you think about how our volume grows our revenue and our profits, I would point you back to that. But we feel real good about where we're at. We think it's not just what's happening outside, externally on the macro environment, it's also all the initiatives and the things that we're doing inside UPS right now that are gaining traction and are actually the reasons that the results were so good for the fourth quarter and for all of 2015."

But from that perspective, I think as some of the guys mentioned earlier, the buy-sell spreads, which is reflective of capacity and demand, have been at its widest point through 2015. But early indications, there's a little bit of turn towards the end of 2015, but we don't see anything that spikes in a great way just yet. But that will lead us to a further evaluation of the inventory, so appreciate the question."

In fact, in the last few years, we actually doubled the spend in our buildings and facilities. And we expect that, that will continue. And that's probably the area where we'll be spending the most money next year. But the results of this quarter were really driven by the investments we made in the last few years.

Joining me today are: David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn. 
Before we begin, I want to review the safe harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2014 Form 10-K and 2015 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Before we begin, I would like to make you aware of a few adjusting entries that impact our reported results. UPS recorded a noncash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $79 million. The charge resulted from lower asset returns that were partially offset by higher discount rates. Investment returns on plan assets were negatively affected by the overall market performance. The impact of the shortfall was mostly offset by increased interest rates used to calculate the plan discount rate. In the prior year period, the company reported a noncash after-tax charge of $692 million. The charge related to pension mark-to-market was $670 million and the amount of the health care liability transfer was $22 million. More details on mark-to-market accounting are available in the presentation that is on the IR website. Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2015 were $1.57 and GAAP earnings per share were $1.48 while fourth quarter 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.25 and GAAP earnings per share were $0.49. 
In our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS's free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. [Operator Instructions]

Our results make it quite a good morning here at UPS. I'm pleased to report a very positive fourth quarter, capping our strong full year performance.

I'm pleased to report a very positive fourth quarter, capping our strong full year performance. A year ago, we laid out a plan for a successful peak in 2015. This year, through the extraordinary efforts of UPSs around the globe, we delivered the high-quality service that customers deserve and the financial discipline that shareowners expect. 
This was the fourth consecutive quarter that UPS exceeded financial expectations. In this quarter, we expanded margins and produced double-digit operating profit growth in all 3 business segments. That's worth repeating, all 3 segments demonstrated excellent operating profit growth. In fact, the International segment achieved its best quarterly and full year results ever, exceeding $2 billion in annual operating profit. UPS ended 2015 with record fourth quarter earnings per share and the highest operating profit ever reported. Full year 2015 diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $5.43, an all-time high. 
Although the industrial side of the economy has slowed, the explosive growth of e-commerce continues to create great opportunity. I want to spend some time discussing how we capitalized on our peak season opportunity by managing the challenges it creates. I can sum it up in 3 words: collaboration, control, commitment. Expanded collaboration with customers, combined with key investments, were central to our success. We worked together with a shared interest in fully utilizing UPS network capacity while simultaneously maintaining excellent service. UPS implemented certain pricing controls and maintained disciplined operating plans to ensure our peak package volume did not jeopardize the overall integrity of the network and could be delivered on time. 
For example, we optimized available capacity during the weekend prior to Christmas and collaborated with customers to tender shipments ahead of the original schedule. This moved our peak day up to December 21 and smoothed volume for the rest of the week, ensuring our customers' packages reached their customers' doorsteps before Christmas. This year, our customers worked more closely with us than ever. And I want to thank them for making adjustments and being flexible. Together, we delivered a successful peak season. Again, working closely with our customers, we delivered a successful peak season.
Turning to control. Our actions to tighten dispatch, reduce special sorts and implement just-in-time hiring resulted in significant cost benefits for UPS as we exercised more precise control over the network. We also expanded capacity, opened more than 8,000 UPS Access Points in the U.S. and completed several automation projects across the network. These investments provide year-round benefits. In fact, our automated air facilities were essential in servicing nearly 13% growth in U.S. domestic air volume during the quarter. The flexibility of our integrated network also gave us the control needed to seamlessly move volume between air, rail and ground to maintain excellent on-time service. 
This year, we again implemented a management process called the control tower in the U.S. and expanded it to Canada and Europe. We handled customers unplanned volume surges by efficiently utilizing available UPS network capacity. Our goal was to find a solution that worked for our customers and UPS. Working together, we were able to service more than 90% of these last-minute requests. Another aspect of control is managing outside transportation cost, which spikes dramatically during this time of year. Our recent acquisition of Coyote Logistics helped manage this expense. They played an expanded role this peak season and provided truckload brokerage service for UPS and its customers. Coyote's synergies remained on plan.
The final C is commitment, exemplified by the actions of our employees to deliver on-time service during a period when our volume nearly doubles. There are numerous examples of UPSers going the extra mile every day for our customers. And they again demonstrated that commitment this peak season. I want to take a moment to say thank you to all the UPSers around the world, whose enthusiasm and extraordinary efforts during the holiday season produced these great results. I am proud of their determination, dedication and hard work. 
While peak season 2015 helped drive strong fourth quarter results, we've turned our attention to 2016. Our business is more diverse than retail in peak season. Customers continue to choose UPS because of our broad portfolio of solutions across many industries, like health care, aerospace, high tech and manufacturing. We will continue to capitalize on opportunities within these market segments by further expanding our network, improving operational efficiency and focusing on high-growth and adjacent markets.
Looking at the global economy. Conditions remain uncertain with the first half of 2016 continuing the mixed economic trends from the last half of 2015. Across Europe and Asia, GDP growth was modest in 2015. However, slight improvements are expected this year. At the same time, we continue to see challenges in emerging markets in 2016. Global macroeconomic conditions reinforce the need for nations to continue making progress on free trade agreements, such as TPP and TTIP. 
While the U.S. GDP growth outlook is muted for the first half of 2016, it is expected to gain strength in the second half. Further, the U.S. remains dependent on a consumer-based economy for growth while industrial manufacturing continues to be held down by a strong dollar and lower global demand. Through this uncertain backdrop, UPS will continue to implement our investment and growth strategies in 2016. Our strong execution of these strategies will enable UPS to continue to create excellent shareholder value. 
Now Richard will give you more details."

It's good to be with you this morning and report on an outstanding fourth quarter. All 3 segments performed better than expected. They achieved solid results by focusing on revenue management and operational execution. These efforts expanded operating margins and increased shareowner value. 
Total fourth quarter revenue was up slightly to $16.1 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, it was up 2.4%. Changes to currency and lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue by more than $600 million. Overall, UPS produced fourth quarter earnings per share for 2015 of $1.57, up 26% from last year. Full year 2015 earnings per share were $5.43, a 14% increase over 2014. These results included discrete tax credits of about $0.07 for the quarter and $0.10 for the year. Excluding these on an annual basis, earnings per share grew more than 12%.
Now turning to details within the business segments. In the U.S., we had a great quarter. Revenue was up 2.6% to $10.3 billion. Lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue growth by about 250 basis points. Average daily volume increased 2.4%, led by Deferred Air products, up 15%, and Next Day Air, up 10%. Clearly, UPS customers are choosing the value of our air products to meet their customers' expectations.
Both business and residential deliveries grew in the quarter with B2C outpacing B2B 2:1. E-commerce continued to drive higher residential shipments. In fact, in December, more than 60% of our deliveries were to consumers. Revenue per package increased slightly as strong base rates and product mix improvements were somewhat offset by lower fuel surcharges and changing customer mix. Operating profit jumped 18% to more than $1.3 billion and margin expanded 170 basis points to 13.1%. Solid execution of the peak operating plan and our network investments led to productivity gains. Average daily direct labor hours declined about 1% while package deliveries increased 2.4%, some of the best results we've produced. 
The growth in e-commerce continues to increase delivery stops in our network. During the fourth quarter, delivery stops increased 5.1%. That's more than twice as fast as our volume growth. Technology investments, such as ORION, are enabling us to reduce the cost of residential stops. As a result, we held package delivery miles flat and reduced cost per piece. These results demonstrate our ability to adapt. We're bending the cost curve and the U.S. team is delivering high-quality service while improving efficiency and cost.
Looking now at the International segment. We had a record-setting quarter and year, achieving a 16% improvement in our fourth quarter operating profit to $624 million, delivering greater than 10% profit growth every quarter in 2015. Our results are driven by 2 efforts. First, rate actions that began late in 2015 resulted in losing some low-yielding accounts, predominantly affecting the International domestic volume. And second, network management improvements continued to contribute to bottom line results as we modified International block hours to match volume and trade lane demand. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion. Base rates increased across all regions, although they were offset by about a 350 basis point drag from lower fuel surcharges. Total export shipment growth slowed, reflecting the execution of previously mentioned pricing initiatives, along with varying market growth rates around the world. Imports from Europe into the U.S. were strong for the fourth consecutive quarter, aided in part by the appreciating U.S. dollar. The International business continues to demonstrate the ability to adjust in an unsteady economic environment.
Turning to the Supply Chain & Freight group. Operating profit grew more than 11% with an expanded operating margin. Overall revenue growth increased 6% with the addition of Coyote. However, organic revenue growth declined due to 2 factors: first, ongoing weakness in both forwarding and U.S. LTL markets; and secondly, the continuation of our targeted revenue management actions. Both the Forwarding and UPS Freight units are executing initiatives that are driving change into customer mix to improve profitability. 
The Forwarding unit improved operating margins as the group held firm with rates, achieving their highest buy-sell rate spread in the last few years. In UPS Freight, LTL revenue per hundredweight improved 2.1% with a drag of about 550 basis points from lower fuel surcharges. However, market conditions continued to challenge UPS Freight as they saw tonnage decline about 12%. The distribution unit saw double-digit revenue growth from targeted industries, health care and aerospace, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe.
Now let's turn to our cash flow. Throughout 2015, UPS continued to generate healthy free cash flow, producing over $5 billion after $2.4 billion in capital investments. Once again, we returned more than 100% of net income to shareowners as UPS purchased 27 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion and paid out another $2.5 billion in dividends, up 9% per share over last year. Looking at our tax rate, as previously mentioned during the quarter, UPS resolved a few outstanding tax items. Together, these resulted in $63 million of discrete credits or about $0.07 per share. For 2016, we expect our tax rate to be 35.25%.
Now I'll cover the rest of our guidance. We expect 2016 to be another good year at UPS. Revenue should increase between 6% and 8%. Looking more closely at the segments, in the U.S., the domestic segment average daily volume should increase about 2% to 4%, driving revenue up 4% to 6%. Operating margin is forecasted to expand and operating profit should grow 5% to 9%. In the International business, shipments per day are projected to increase 2% to 4%. Growth rates will be held down during the first half of the year due to the revenue management actions we discussed earlier. We anticipate a drag of about 150 basis points from non-hedged currencies and lower fuel surcharges. As a result, revenue will grow at a similar pace as volume. Operating profit is expected to be up 8% to 12% with some margin expansion. 
In the Supply Chain & Freight segment, revenue should be up 15% to 20% with Coyote added for the full year. The segment's organic revenue growth is projected between 3% and 5%. Operating profit growth is forecasted between 6% and 10%. However, first quarter growth will likely be down about 8% to 12% from last year due to the continued softness in the LTL, freight brokerage and freight forwarding markets. As a reminder, the West Coast port strike provided some benefits in 2015. Operating margin for the Supply Chain & Freight segment should be around 7%. For the total company, we expect our 2016 operating profit distribution by quarter to be very similar to 2015. From a cash flow perspective, investment in the business remains our first priority with CapEx expected to be about 4.5% of revenue or $2.8 billion. Next, we remain committed to paying a strong dividend. 
Finally, we have about $2.7 billion in share repurchases planned. As we've mentioned in the past, we will continue to follow this framework and make necessary adjustments if new opportunities arise. Overall, we expect 2016 to be a solid year for UPS. We will continue to execute on our investments as planned and the network improvements we're making are producing financial benefits. As a result, we are projecting diluted earnings per share to increase within the range of $5.70 to $5.90, a growth rate of 5% to 9%. And when excluding the 2015 tax credits, our growth rate is 7% to 11%. 
In closing, despite the unsteady economic climate, we are well positioned to make significant progress again in 2016. Thank you for your attention. I'll ask the operator to open the lines, so we can take your questions. Operator?"

And I think once you go through that, after some more questions, we can handle that appropriately. In terms of the volume and the guidance on volume, we did have solid top line growth this year. In fact, it was 5% growth this year. And we really see 2016 as a continuation of what we did in 2015. It does have some cycles through the quarters. Obviously, we talked about each quarter kind of looking similar to the previous year. And so when you think about how our volume grows our revenue and our profits, I would point you back to that. But we feel real good about where we're at. We think it's not just what's happening outside, externally on the macro environment, it's also all the initiatives and the things that we're doing inside UPS right now that are gaining traction and are actually the reasons that the results were so good for the fourth quarter and for all of 2015."

So one of the ways that we address what you were just referring to is the way that we do manage the peak week. We also add substantial capacity this year for peak. And from our CapEx plans, that's going to continue. And the increase in technology, ORION that you heard Myron talk about, over 70% utilized and Access Points and other technologies like that.

Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn. 
Before we begin, I want to review the safe harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2014 Form 10-K and 2015 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Before we begin, I would like to make you aware of a few adjusting entries that impact our reported results. UPS recorded a noncash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $79 million. The charge resulted from lower asset returns that were partially offset by higher discount rates. Investment returns on plan assets were negatively affected by the overall market performance. The impact of the shortfall was mostly offset by increased interest rates used to calculate the plan discount rate. In the prior year period, the company reported a noncash after-tax charge of $692 million. The charge related to pension mark-to-market was $670 million and the amount of the health care liability transfer was $22 million. More details on mark-to-market accounting are available in the presentation that is on the IR website. Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2015 were $1.57 and GAAP earnings per share were $1.48 while fourth quarter 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.25 and GAAP earnings per share were $0.49. 
In our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS's free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. [Operator Instructions] 
Thank you for your cooperation. Now I will turn the call over to David."

Our results make it quite a good morning here at UPS. I'm pleased to report a very positive fourth quarter, capping our strong full year performance.

I'm pleased to report a very positive fourth quarter, capping our strong full year performance. A year ago, we laid out a plan for a successful peak in 2015. This year, through the extraordinary efforts of UPSs around the globe, we delivered the high-quality service that customers deserve and the financial discipline that shareowners expect. 
This was the fourth consecutive quarter that UPS exceeded financial expectations. In this quarter, we expanded margins and produced double-digit operating profit growth in all 3 business segments. That's worth repeating, all 3 segments demonstrated excellent operating profit growth. In fact, the International segment achieved its best quarterly and full year results ever, exceeding $2 billion in annual operating profit. UPS ended 2015 with record fourth quarter earnings per share and the highest operating profit ever reported. Full year 2015 diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $5.43, an all-time high. 
Although the industrial side of the economy has slowed, the explosive growth of e-commerce continues to create great opportunity. I want to spend some time discussing how we capitalized on our peak season opportunity by managing the challenges it creates. I can sum it up in 3 words: collaboration, control, commitment. Expanded collaboration with customers, combined with key investments, were central to our success. We worked together with a shared interest in fully utilizing UPS network capacity while simultaneously maintaining excellent service. UPS implemented certain pricing controls and maintained disciplined operating plans to ensure our peak package volume did not jeopardize the overall integrity of the network and could be delivered on time. 
For example, we optimized available capacity during the weekend prior to Christmas and collaborated with customers to tender shipments ahead of the original schedule. This moved our peak day up to December 21 and smoothed volume for the rest of the week, ensuring our customers' packages reached their customers' doorsteps before Christmas. This year, our customers worked more closely with us than ever. And I want to thank them for making adjustments and being flexible. Together, we delivered a successful peak season. Again, working closely with our customers, we delivered a successful peak season.
Turning to control. Our actions to tighten dispatch, reduce special sorts and implement just-in-time hiring resulted in significant cost benefits for UPS as we exercised more precise control over the network. We also expanded capacity, opened more than 8,000 UPS Access Points in the U.S. and completed several automation projects across the network. These investments provide year-round benefits. In fact, our automated air facilities were essential in servicing nearly 13% growth in U.S. domestic air volume during the quarter. The flexibility of our integrated network also gave us the control needed to seamlessly move volume between air, rail and ground to maintain excellent on-time service. 
This year, we again implemented a management process called the control tower in the U.S. and expanded it to Canada and Europe. We handled customers unplanned volume surges by efficiently utilizing available UPS network capacity. Our goal was to find a solution that worked for our customers and UPS. Working together, we were able to service more than 90% of these last-minute requests. Another aspect of control is managing outside transportation cost, which spikes dramatically during this time of year. Our recent acquisition of Coyote Logistics helped manage this expense. They played an expanded role this peak season and provided truckload brokerage service for UPS and its customers. Coyote's synergies remained on plan.
The final C is commitment, exemplified by the actions of our employees to deliver on-time service during a period when our volume nearly doubles. There are numerous examples of UPSers going the extra mile every day for our customers. And they again demonstrated that commitment this peak season. I want to take a moment to say thank you to all the UPSers around the world, whose enthusiasm and extraordinary efforts during the holiday season produced these great results. I am proud of their determination, dedication and hard work. 
While peak season 2015 helped drive strong fourth quarter results, we've turned our attention to 2016. Our business is more diverse than retail in peak season. Customers continue to choose UPS because of our broad portfolio of solutions across many industries, like health care, aerospace, high tech and manufacturing. We will continue to capitalize on opportunities within these market segments by further expanding our network, improving operational efficiency and focusing on high-growth and adjacent markets.
Looking at the global economy. Conditions remain uncertain with the first half of 2016 continuing the mixed economic trends from the last half of 2015. Across Europe and Asia, GDP growth was modest in 2015. However, slight improvements are expected this year. At the same time, we continue to see challenges in emerging markets in 2016. Global macroeconomic conditions reinforce the need for nations to continue making progress on free trade agreements, such as TPP and TTIP. 
While the U.S. GDP growth outlook is muted for the first half of 2016, it is expected to gain strength in the second half. Further, the U.S. remains dependent on a consumer-based economy for growth while industrial manufacturing continues to be held down by a strong dollar and lower global demand. Through this uncertain backdrop, UPS will continue to implement our investment and growth strategies in 2016. Our strong execution of these strategies will enable UPS to continue to create excellent shareholder value. 
Now Richard will give you more details."

It's good to be with you this morning and report on an outstanding fourth quarter. All 3 segments performed better than expected.

It's good to be with you this morning and report on an outstanding fourth quarter. All 3 segments performed better than expected. They achieved solid results by focusing on revenue management and operational execution. These efforts expanded operating margins and increased shareowner value. 
Total fourth quarter revenue was up slightly to $16.1 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, it was up 2.4%. Changes to currency and lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue by more than $600 million. Overall, UPS produced fourth quarter earnings per share for 2015 of $1.57, up 26% from last year. Full year 2015 earnings per share were $5.43, a 14% increase over 2014. These results included discrete tax credits of about $0.07 for the quarter and $0.10 for the year. Excluding these on an annual basis, earnings per share grew more than 12%.
Now turning to details within the business segments. In the U.S., we had a great quarter. Revenue was up 2.6% to $10.3 billion. Lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue growth by about 250 basis points. Average daily volume increased 2.4%, led by Deferred Air products, up 15%, and Next Day Air, up 10%. Clearly, UPS customers are choosing the value of our air products to meet their customers' expectations.
Both business and residential deliveries grew in the quarter with B2C outpacing B2B 2:1. E-commerce continued to drive higher residential shipments. In fact, in December, more than 60% of our deliveries were to consumers. Revenue per package increased slightly as strong base rates and product mix improvements were somewhat offset by lower fuel surcharges and changing customer mix. Operating profit jumped 18% to more than $1.3 billion and margin expanded 170 basis points to 13.1%. Solid execution of the peak operating plan and our network investments led to productivity gains. Average daily direct labor hours declined about 1% while package deliveries increased 2.4%, some of the best results we've produced. 
The growth in e-commerce continues to increase delivery stops in our network. During the fourth quarter, delivery stops increased 5.1%. That's more than twice as fast as our volume growth. Technology investments, such as ORION, are enabling us to reduce the cost of residential stops. As a result, we held package delivery miles flat and reduced cost per piece. These results demonstrate our ability to adapt. We're bending the cost curve and the U.S. team is delivering high-quality service while improving efficiency and cost.
Looking now at the International segment. We had a record-setting quarter and year, achieving a 16% improvement in our fourth quarter operating profit to $624 million, delivering greater than 10% profit growth every quarter in 2015. Our results are driven by 2 efforts. First, rate actions that began late in 2015 resulted in losing some low-yielding accounts, predominantly affecting the International domestic volume. And second, network management improvements continued to contribute to bottom line results as we modified International block hours to match volume and trade lane demand. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion. Base rates increased across all regions, although they were offset by about a 350 basis point drag from lower fuel surcharges. Total export shipment growth slowed, reflecting the execution of previously mentioned pricing initiatives, along with varying market growth rates around the world. Imports from Europe into the U.S. were strong for the fourth consecutive quarter, aided in part by the appreciating U.S. dollar. The International business continues to demonstrate the ability to adjust in an unsteady economic environment.
Turning to the Supply Chain & Freight group. Operating profit grew more than 11% with an expanded operating margin. Overall revenue growth increased 6% with the addition of Coyote. However, organic revenue growth declined due to 2 factors: first, ongoing weakness in both forwarding and U.S. LTL markets; and secondly, the continuation of our targeted revenue management actions. Both the Forwarding and UPS Freight units are executing initiatives that are driving change into customer mix to improve profitability. 
The Forwarding unit improved operating margins as the group held firm with rates, achieving their highest buy-sell rate spread in the last few years. In UPS Freight, LTL revenue per hundredweight improved 2.1% with a drag of about 550 basis points from lower fuel surcharges. However, market conditions continued to challenge UPS Freight as they saw tonnage decline about 12%. The distribution unit saw double-digit revenue growth from targeted industries, health care and aerospace, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe.
Now let's turn to our cash flow. Throughout 2015, UPS continued to generate healthy free cash flow, producing over $5 billion after $2.4 billion in capital investments. Once again, we returned more than 100% of net income to shareowners as UPS purchased 27 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion and paid out another $2.5 billion in dividends, up 9% per share over last year. Looking at our tax rate, as previously mentioned during the quarter, UPS resolved a few outstanding tax items. Together, these resulted in $63 million of discrete credits or about $0.07 per share. For 2016, we expect our tax rate to be 35.25%.
Now I'll cover the rest of our guidance. We expect 2016 to be another good year at UPS. Revenue should increase between 6% and 8%. Looking more closely at the segments, in the U.S., the domestic segment average daily volume should increase about 2% to 4%, driving revenue up 4% to 6%. Operating margin is forecasted to expand and operating profit should grow 5% to 9%. In the International business, shipments per day are projected to increase 2% to 4%. Growth rates will be held down during the first half of the year due to the revenue management actions we discussed earlier. We anticipate a drag of about 150 basis points from non-hedged currencies and lower fuel surcharges. As a result, revenue will grow at a similar pace as volume. Operating profit is expected to be up 8% to 12% with some margin expansion. 
In the Supply Chain & Freight segment, revenue should be up 15% to 20% with Coyote added for the full year. The segment's organic revenue growth is projected between 3% and 5%. Operating profit growth is forecasted between 6% and 10%. However, first quarter growth will likely be down about 8% to 12% from last year due to the continued softness in the LTL, freight brokerage and freight forwarding markets. As a reminder, the West Coast port strike provided some benefits in 2015. Operating margin for the Supply Chain & Freight segment should be around 7%. For the total company, we expect our 2016 operating profit distribution by quarter to be very similar to 2015. From a cash flow perspective, investment in the business remains our first priority with CapEx expected to be about 4.5% of revenue or $2.8 billion. Next, we remain committed to paying a strong dividend. 
Finally, we have about $2.7 billion in share repurchases planned. As we've mentioned in the past, we will continue to follow this framework and make necessary adjustments if new opportunities arise. Overall, we expect 2016 to be a solid year for UPS. We will continue to execute on our investments as planned and the network improvements we're making are producing financial benefits. As a result, we are projecting diluted earnings per share to increase within the range of $5.70 to $5.90, a growth rate of 5% to 9%. And when excluding the 2015 tax credits, our growth rate is 7% to 11%. 
In closing, despite the unsteady economic climate, we are well positioned to make significant progress again in 2016. Thank you for your attention. I'll ask the operator to open the lines, so we can take your questions. Operator?"

It was -- I know you've had a spread of strong air volumes driven by e-commerce, but it seems that spread versus ground widened out. So I was just wondering if you could give a sense of what were some of the key drivers of the Domestic Package volume and that spread in fourth quarter. What was B2B like in ground? What was the impact of your controls? To have a peak, was that a big factor on the softer ground? And just was there weakness of the economy? What were some of the key drivers for the net domestic volume?"

Certainly, the soft industrial production that David mentioned and certainly some of the revenue management action on some of the low-yielding accounts earlier in the year for peak had some impact. Our B2B growth was positive. If you remember last quarter, it went negative, but it rebounded last quarter. And as Rich mentioned, our resi grew at about a 2:1 ratio to the commercial. Thanks."

And I think once you go through that, after some more questions, we can handle that appropriately. In terms of the volume and the guidance on volume, we did have solid top line growth this year. In fact, it was 5% growth this year. And we really see 2016 as a continuation of what we did in 2015. It does have some cycles through the quarters. Obviously, we talked about each quarter kind of looking similar to the previous year. And so when you think about how our volume grows our revenue and our profits, I would point you back to that. But we feel real good about where we're at. We think it's not just what's happening outside, externally on the macro environment, it's also all the initiatives and the things that we're doing inside UPS right now that are gaining traction and are actually the reasons that the results were so good for the fourth quarter and for all of 2015."

So one of the ways that we address what you were just referring to is the way that we do manage the peak week. We also add substantial capacity this year for peak. And from our CapEx plans, that's going to continue. And the increase in technology, ORION that you heard Myron talk about, over 70% utilized and Access Points and other technologies like that.

The international segment sustained its momentum on its 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. The U.S. domestic business also expanded operating margins as efficiency gains enhanced bottom line results, while Supply Chain & Freight performed slightly ahead of our expectations.
Our accelerated investments in the UPS network are improving business results. This is enabling us to deliver strong financial results despite the current mixed macro environment. In the U.S., GDP forecast continue to be revised downward, yet consumer spending remains the primary catalyst for growth in the economy and e-commerce sales have again exceeded expectations.
On the other hand, industrial production remains below 2015 levels. In Europe, economic expansion has slowed slightly, but the pace of growth remains healthy. While in Asia, the major economy showed positive signs of stabilization as exports from China improved in March. 
Despite these mixed economic conditions, we remain committed to making investments for growth and efficiency. We will continue to implement our enterprise strategy, providing UPS customers with increased choice, convenience and control.
During the quarter, we launched enhanced products to support customer's needs for earlier delivery. Our Next Day Air early now serves almost 30% more ZIP Codes, strengthening our leadership position in offering the earliest next-day deliveries.
We also increased our Worldwide Express small package offering to 23 new countries and territories. UPS now offers guaranteed delivery on the next possible business day to 88 countries around the world.
In addition to broadening our service portfolio for growth, we also are investing in our infrastructure with innovative technology in major facility expansions. The ability to combine our integrated network with the latest operating technology helps UPS deliver industry-leading margins and provides tremendous value to our customers.
ORION is a great example of how we use predictive analytics and big data to improve service while bending the cost curve lower. Our future plans for Orion will enhance the benefits for UPS and our customers. In fact, I recently had the great honor, on behalf of all UPSers, to accept the prestigious 2016 Fond-Zenaman [ph] Award recognizing ORION and UPS's leadership in operations research. 
In addition to innovation in honor of technologies like ORION, we're making major investments in new capacity and modernized facilities, both in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we are expanding major facilities in Metro LA, Denver, Chicago and other areas around the country. In Europe, as part of our $2 billion European investment plan announced in 2014, we opened a larger automated hub in Lyon, France, tripling our capacity in the area.  And we also announced an automated facility expansion in Herne [ph], Germany.
Adding to these examples of our innovated infrastructure is our commitment to global leadership in alternative fuels. This quarter, we announced an additional $100 million investment to expand compressed natural gas in our delivery and facility network. Our alternative fuel vehicles are now 6% of our global fleet and have helped UPS reduce its annual use of conventional fuel by 10%.
We are well on our way to achieving our goal of driving 1 billion miles worldwide by 2017 with our alternative fuel vehicles. 
As we invest in the U.S. and abroad, the ability to grow our business is accelerated by global trade. Recently, the President signed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act. This important legislation is designed to modernize, strengthen and streamline cross-border trade, facilitating [indiscernible] of goods into the U.S. UPS strongly supports the expansion of free-trade around the world. We are developing additional solutions that assist buyers and sellers to transact business across borders. 
So in summary, the first quarter results demonstrate the differentiating value of our integrated network and global portfolio.
Our investments in technology and capacity are producing network efficiencies in giving us more control over the cost drivers in our business. And this is providing improved financial results. 
At UPS, we are innovating and investing to ensure we anticipate the needs of our 10 million customers.
Before Richard covers the quarterly financial results, I've asked Norm Broadus, our General Counsel, to provide an update on developments surrounding the central states proposed benefit reduction plan. Norm?"

This is a topic that we first disclosed in our third quarter 2015 10-Q. The central state's plan proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to its participants, including certain UPS employees. When UPS withdrew from t",348,"Thanks, David, and good morning. This is a topic that we first disclosed in our third quarter 2015 10-Q. The central state's plan proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to its participants, including certain UPS employees. When UPS withdrew from the fund in 2007, the [indiscernible] Collective Bargaining Agreement with the International Brotherhood Teamsters, we agreed to provide supplemental benefits in the event that certain benefits were lawfully reduced. 
As a reminder, in December 2014, Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, which for the first time ever, allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees, subject to specific guidelines written into the statute and government oversight. As a result of this law, the Central State Pension Fund submitted a benefit reduction plan for approval to the U.S. Department of Treasury in the fall of 2015.
As we explained in our 2015 10-K, we are challenging Central State's plan because we firmly believe that it does not comply with the law. According to this new statute, we currently expect the decision from the Department of Treasury on or before May 7. Unless there are some agreement to delay the process. Of course, Treasury could reject Central State's proposal, confirming our position. If this happens, the benefits paid from Central  States will not be reduced without further action. 
In the event these plans approved as proposed, we fully intend to continue challenging it and pursue all legal remedies available to UPS. As we gained additional information during the quarter, we continue to assess the possible impact of Treasury's review of the plan on UPS. This is a new law and the first time the approval process has ever been used. 
And as I stated, we firmly believe the proposed benefit reduction plan does not comply with the law. We recognized there are a lot of unanswered questions but without Treasury's decision, we are not going to speculate. However, we still thought it was important to provide you an update on the process. 
Now I will turn it over to Richard for a financial view of the issue."
238570,328441303,965520,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Norm.

We estimate that the Central States plan is approved as proposed and implemented, we will be required to record a charge of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion later this year. Our estimates are based on the information currently available to UPS, and assumes, among other things, that the plan's implementation is not delayed.
If this charge is necessary, we expect it will be treated as an interim mark-to-market pension charge and will be reflected in this year's financial results. In addition, there may be an increase in the ongoing pension expense that could impact 2016. 
Following our call today, we'll provide a presentation on the website regarding the subject. Now let's move on to business and how it continues to perform.
As David said, the consumer is driving the economy, and that translates into opportunities for UPS. During the quarter, we turned e-commerce growth to expanded margins and increased operating profit in the U.S. Domestic segment. This, combined with momentum in our international business and slightly better than expected performance in supply chain and freight segment, produced another strong quarter. 
Now let's go a little deeper into the results, starting with the U.S. domestic segment, where operating profit increased $78 million or almost 8%, and operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 12.1%.
Revenue was up 3.1% over last year to $9.1 billion. However, lower fuel surcharges were a drag of about 120 basis points on the growth rate. Average daily volume increased 2.8%, with the Ground products up 3.3%, and Next Day Air, up 3%. 
After 5 continuous quarter of double-digit growth, deferred products declined slightly. E-Commerce customers drove both B2C and B2B shipments higher, with B2C up more than 6%. Interestingly, supporting B2B growth during the quarter, online purchases drove demand for UPS's best-in-class return services portfolio, which grew double-digit this quarter.
Base rates increased about 2%, but were offset by changes in package characteristics and a mix of product and customers. There was 120-basis point drag from lower fuel surcharges that weighed on the reported deals. As a result, total revenue per piece was down 1.3% from the prior year. 
This quarter, the margin expansion was driven by the excellent cost management demonstrated. Cost per piece was down 1.9% compared to last year. Network efficiencies continue to improve, and we're seeing those improvements in our bottom line.
At the foundation of our success this quarter is the continued benefits of the UPS integrated network overlaid with our unique technology. Looking at our key daily statistics, and this is where we are seeing good improvement as the expansion of ORION lowered driver miles by about 1%, despite the fact that total stops grew by about 6%. In addition, overall productivity gains helped direct labor hours to an increase of 1.8%, well below the average daily volume growth.
As these trends continue, UPS is improving the stop economics of e-commerce. Now let's turn to the international segment. 
As David said, we are reporting our 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. International operating profit increased more than 15%, reflecting the impact of discipline pricing, better network efficiencies and in-country cost control.
Revenue on a currency neutral basis was slowed this quarter by management actions we implemented in the third quarter last year. In addition, lower fuel surcharges negatively affected the growth rate by about 200 basis points. Currency neutral revenue per piece was up 1.6%, with domestic products up 2.8%. Strong base rate improvements were across all regions of the world and contributed to the best yield growth in more than 2 years.
Revenue management actions also affected international volume, mainly the non-U.S. domestic products. Meanwhile, we saw increased demand out of Asia and Europe into the U.S, offsetting lower U.S. exports. Export volume has start recovering from the revenue management actions we started in mid-2015. Fewer local operating days, mostly due to the timing of the Easter holiday, lowered the growth rate by about 200 basis points. 
Now let's discuss the Supply Chain & Freight segment, where operating profit was better than anticipated but slightly less than last year. As the segment managed through a tough economic backdrop.
Total revenue on a currency neutral basis was up more than 11%, driven by the addition of Coyote Logistics. The asset-light truckload brokerage business is managing well, even in a market that remains [indiscernible]and in the synergies remain plain. In addition, market conditions remain weak, both in the airfreight 40 [ph] and UPS Freight markets. In the freight 40 unit, international air freight kilos were down and it's due to a combination of repricing efforts in 2015 and an overall softer market. Margins expanded as the unit held firm with rates and achieved higher by sell rate spreads.
Distribution revenue, on a currency neutral basis, was up around 7%. Supported by our industry-specific solutions, we had double-digit gains in health care, aerospace and industrial manufacturing sectors.
UPS Freight remains committed to disciplined revenue management. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 2.1% as the unit continue  to focus on serving higher-yielding middle market customers, yet total tonnage declined as market conditions remain challenging.
Now for an update in our cash position. The company generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow after investing almost $430 million in capital expenditures. UPS improved its quarterly dividend by almost 7% during the quarter and paid about $670 million in dividends. And the company repurchased 6.8 million shares for approximately $680 million. 
Now I'd like to update you on our guidance for 2016. 
The first quarter results continued our momentum from last year, and we remain on track for 2016. Economic conditions around the world remain mixed. However, our business model is adapting well in this environment. In addition, international and supply chain & freight will lap certain pricing actions we took last year. 
Based on our current performance, we'll reaffirm our 2016 full year guidance of 570 [ph] to 590 [ph] adjusted earnings per share. This guidance does not include any impact for the Department of Treasury's decision on the benefit reduction plan. Regardless of how UPS chooses to respond to Treasury's decision, we still expect to remain within our 2016 guidance. However, if the plan is approved and implemented without delay, the ongoing expense could possibly push us to its lower end of the range.  As we stated earlier, we fully intend to continue challenging the plan if it is approved by the treasury. 
To summarize. This quarter as an example of how our accelerated investments are providing benefits across the company. We are adapting to the changing market conditions, bending the cost curve and at the same time, producing strong financial results. We are well-positioned to continue to make progress through the rest of the 2016.

And yes, GDP is obviously, weakened even today, the numbers that came out quarter-over-quarter showed weakness and year-over-year, slight deterioration. But again, you can look and you can find bright spots and you can find things that worry  you. On the  one hand consumer spending, continue to be the primary economic driver in the U.S. On the other hand, industrial production has been disappointing. Although I can't say there has been some recent data on manufacturing that are showing some sign of expansion. On the  one hand again, online retail is continuing to grow much faster than many expected. On the other hand, especially brick-and-mortar retailers have not done so well. Again, on one hand, inflation and unemployment have stabilized, although wage growth from courses has been muted. And when you look at it internationally, I think the same thing. You're going to see positives and when you go see things that concern you. From the European Union, we still expect to see that economy grow, at a fairly solid pace compared to recent past. But there are signs of slowing, especially in some countries. Emerging markets, you see some concerns there, especially in Brazil and Russia. China though, GDP forecast is stabilized. If you look at U.S's. exports, because of the strength of the dollar, that, of course, is weakened. But when you look at European exports imported into the U.S., that is -- that has been pretty solid. But my final point, and I think it's what's led to our success the last 4, 5 quarters and will continue to lead to it is that regardless of these challenges, we hope to make challenges opportunities. And that's how we execute our investments, our strategic initiatives. If we continue to execute, we have proven and we will continue to prove that we can have success in this mixed economic environment. So thank you for the question. I appreciate it."

So what we're hearing from our customers is that we continue to provide value and they continue to give us more of their share of the business. So we think it's a very positive environment for us."

We've had our eyes on that for some time obviously, on the road we travel. And so we are kind of looking at our customer solutions specifically, and our network and making sure that it leans into those risks and opportunities and any merger brings for us.

And your question also mentioned fuel and let me also remind you that we don't use fuel as a profit center.

But certainly, all of our brick-and-mortar retailers are also in the e-commerce business. So it's about providing them a total solution. And omnichannel is a growing trend in the retail industry. We're seeing 30% year-over-year growth in UPS accounts in 2015, and that means at the store level, we've got over 120,000 ship-from-store locations that are shipping or have the potential to ship. We're starting to see this phenomenal start to take place also outside the U.S. and our international business. So we think it's a real advantage for the retailers to optimize for a number of things. Sometimes it's inventory saving the order, because the order is not in the e-commerce fulfillment center but it's in the store. Other times, it's to speed up the delivery. Other times, it's to get to the lowest cost option. So it's really about the whole platform that we offer with UPS My Choice, UPS Access Point, the omnichannel, the SurePost, Returns, the marketplace tools we provide, so on and so forth that we're out there selling along with obviously, the power of our whole product portfolio aligned to the integrated network that's really driving that success. And I guess last thing I'd say is that one of the questions earlier were about the density creation. Where we're really creating this density synthetically through all those e-commerce solutions that I just spoke of because all of them both drive customer and consumer convenience as well as density for UPS. And you combine that with some of the things that we're doing on the efficiency side with ORION and automation and things that Myron talked about, we really believe we've got a great platform for e-commerce for both retailers, consumers and to continue to enhance UPS profitability."

Our accelerated investments in the UPS network are improving business results. This is enabling us to deliver strong financial results despite the current mixed macro environment. In the U.S., GDP forecast continue to be revised downward, yet consumer spending remains the primary catalyst for growth in the economy and e-commerce sales have again exceeded expectations.
On the other hand, industrial production remains below 2015 levels. In Europe, economic expansion has slowed slightly, but the pace of growth remains healthy. While in Asia, the major economy showed positive signs of stabilization as exports from China improved in March. 
Despite these mixed economic conditions, we remain committed to making investments for growth and efficiency. We will continue to implement our enterprise strategy, providing UPS customers with increased choice, convenience and control.
During the quarter, we launched enhanced products to support customer's needs for earlier delivery. Our Next Day Air early now serves almost 30% more ZIP Codes, strengthening our leadership position in offering the earliest next-day deliveries.
We also increased our Worldwide Express small package offering to 23 new countries and territories. UPS now offers guaranteed delivery on the next possible business day to 88 countries around the world.
In addition to broadening our service portfolio for growth, we also are investing in our infrastructure with innovative technology in major facility expansions. The ability to combine our integrated network with the latest operating technology helps UPS deliver industry-leading margins and provides tremendous value to our customers.
ORION is a great example of how we use predictive analytics and big data to improve service while bending the cost curve lower. Our future plans for Orion will enhance the benefits for UPS and our customers. In fact, I recently had the great honor, on behalf of all UPSers, to accept the prestigious 2016 Fond-Zenaman [ph] Award recognizing ORION and UPS's leadership in operations research. 
In addition to innovation in honor of technologies like ORION, we're making major investments in new capacity and modernized facilities, both in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we are expanding major facilities in Metro LA, Denver, Chicago and other areas around the country. In Europe, as part of our $2 billion European investment plan announced in 2014, we opened a larger automated hub in Lyon, France, tripling our capacity in the area.  And we also announced an automated facility expansion in Herne [ph], Germany.
Adding to these examples of our innovated infrastructure is our commitment to global leadership in alternative fuels. This quarter, we announced an additional $100 million investment to expand compressed natural gas in our delivery and facility network. Our alternative fuel vehicles are now 6% of our global fleet and have helped UPS reduce its annual use of conventional fuel by 10%.
We are well on our way to achieving our goal of driving 1 billion miles worldwide by 2017 with our alternative fuel vehicles. 
As we invest in the U.S. and abroad, the ability to grow our business is accelerated by global trade. Recently, the President signed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act. This important legislation is designed to modernize, strengthen and streamline cross-border trade, facilitating [indiscernible] of goods into the U.S. UPS strongly supports the expansion of free-trade around the world. We are developing additional solutions that assist buyers and sellers to transact business across borders. 
So in summary, the first quarter results demonstrate the differentiating value of our integrated network and global portfolio.
Our investments in technology and capacity are producing network efficiencies in giving us more control over the cost drivers in our business. And this is providing improved financial results. 
At UPS, we are innovating and investing to ensure we anticipate the needs of our 10 million customers.
Before Richard covers the quarterly financial results, I've asked Norm Broadus, our General Counsel, to provide an update on developments surrounding the central states proposed benefit reduction plan. Norm?"

This is a topic that we first disclosed in our third quarter 2015 10-Q. The central state's plan proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to its participants, including certain UPS employees. When UPS withdrew from t",348,"Thanks, David, and good morning. This is a topic that we first disclosed in our third quarter 2015 10-Q. The central state's plan proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to its participants, including certain UPS employees. When UPS withdrew from the fund in 2007, the [indiscernible] Collective Bargaining Agreement with the International Brotherhood Teamsters, we agreed to provide supplemental benefits in the event that certain benefits were lawfully reduced. 
As a reminder, in December 2014, Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, which for the first time ever, allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees, subject to specific guidelines written into the statute and government oversight. As a result of this law, the Central State Pension Fund submitted a benefit reduction plan for approval to the U.S. Department of Treasury in the fall of 2015.
As we explained in our 2015 10-K, we are challenging Central State's plan because we firmly believe that it does not comply with the law. According to this new statute, we currently expect the decision from the Department of Treasury on or before May 7. Unless there are some agreement to delay the process. Of course, Treasury could reject Central State's proposal, confirming our position. If this happens, the benefits paid from Central  States will not be reduced without further action. 
In the event these plans approved as proposed, we fully intend to continue challenging it and pursue all legal remedies available to UPS. As we gained additional information during the quarter, we continue to assess the possible impact of Treasury's review of the plan on UPS. This is a new law and the first time the approval process has ever been used. 
And as I stated, we firmly believe the proposed benefit reduction plan does not comply with the law. We recognized there are a lot of unanswered questions but without Treasury's decision, we are not going to speculate. However, we still thought it was important to provide you an update on the process. 
Now I will turn it over to Richard for a financial view of the issue."
238570,328441303,965523,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Norm.

We estimate that the Central States plan is approved as proposed and implemented, we will be required to record a charge of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion later this year. Our estimates are based on the information currently available to UPS, and assumes, among other things, that the plan's implementation is not delayed.
If this charge is necessary, we expect it will be treated as an interim mark-to-market pension charge and will be reflected in this year's financial results. In addition, there may be an increase in the ongoing pension expense that could impact 2016. 
Following our call today, we'll provide a presentation on the website regarding the subject. Now let's move on to business and how it continues to perform.
As David said, the consumer is driving the economy, and that translates into opportunities for UPS. During the quarter, we turned e-commerce growth to expanded margins and increased operating profit in the U.S. Domestic segment. This, combined with momentum in our international business and slightly better than expected performance in supply chain and freight segment, produced another strong quarter. 
Now let's go a little deeper into the results, starting with the U.S. domestic segment, where operating profit increased $78 million or almost 8%, and operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 12.1%.
Revenue was up 3.1% over last year to $9.1 billion. However, lower fuel surcharges were a drag of about 120 basis points on the growth rate. Average daily volume increased 2.8%, with the Ground products up 3.3%, and Next Day Air, up 3%. 
After 5 continuous quarter of double-digit growth, deferred products declined slightly. E-Commerce customers drove both B2C and B2B shipments higher, with B2C up more than 6%. Interestingly, supporting B2B growth during the quarter, online purchases drove demand for UPS's best-in-class return services portfolio, which grew double-digit this quarter.
Base rates increased about 2%, but were offset by changes in package characteristics and a mix of product and customers. There was 120-basis point drag from lower fuel surcharges that weighed on the reported deals. As a result, total revenue per piece was down 1.3% from the prior year. 
This quarter, the margin expansion was driven by the excellent cost management demonstrated. Cost per piece was down 1.9% compared to last year. Network efficiencies continue to improve, and we're seeing those improvements in our bottom line.
At the foundation of our success this quarter is the continued benefits of the UPS integrated network overlaid with our unique technology. Looking at our key daily statistics, and this is where we are seeing good improvement as the expansion of ORION lowered driver miles by about 1%, despite the fact that total stops grew by about 6%. In addition, overall productivity gains helped direct labor hours to an increase of 1.8%, well below the average daily volume growth.
As these trends continue, UPS is improving the stop economics of e-commerce. Now let's turn to the international segment. 
As David said, we are reporting our 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. International operating profit increased more than 15%, reflecting the impact of discipline pricing, better network efficiencies and in-country cost control.
Revenue on a currency neutral basis was slowed this quarter by management actions we implemented in the third quarter last year. In addition, lower fuel surcharges negatively affected the growth rate by about 200 basis points. Currency neutral revenue per piece was up 1.6%, with domestic products up 2.8%. Strong base rate improvements were across all regions of the world and contributed to the best yield growth in more than 2 years.
Revenue management actions also affected international volume, mainly the non-U.S. domestic products. Meanwhile, we saw increased demand out of Asia and Europe into the U.S, offsetting lower U.S. exports. Export volume has start recovering from the revenue management actions we started in mid-2015. Fewer local operating days, mostly due to the timing of the Easter holiday, lowered the growth rate by about 200 basis points. 
Now let's discuss the Supply Chain & Freight segment, where operating profit was better than anticipated but slightly less than last year. As the segment managed through a tough economic backdrop.
Total revenue on a currency neutral basis was up more than 11%, driven by the addition of Coyote Logistics. The asset-light truckload brokerage business is managing well, even in a market that remains [indiscernible]and in the synergies remain plain. In addition, market conditions remain weak, both in the airfreight 40 [ph] and UPS Freight markets. In the freight 40 unit, international air freight kilos were down and it's due to a combination of repricing efforts in 2015 and an overall softer market. Margins expanded as the unit held firm with rates and achieved higher by sell rate spreads.
Distribution revenue, on a currency neutral basis, was up around 7%. Supported by our industry-specific solutions, we had double-digit gains in health care, aerospace and industrial manufacturing sectors.
UPS Freight remains committed to disciplined revenue management. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 2.1% as the unit continue  to focus on serving higher-yielding middle market customers, yet total tonnage declined as market conditions remain challenging.
Now for an update in our cash position. The company generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow after investing almost $430 million in capital expenditures. UPS improved its quarterly dividend by almost 7% during the quarter and paid about $670 million in dividends. And the company repurchased 6.8 million shares for approximately $680 million. 
Now I'd like to update you on our guidance for 2016. 
The first quarter results continued our momentum from last year, and we remain on track for 2016. Economic conditions around the world remain mixed. However, our business model is adapting well in this environment. In addition, international and supply chain & freight will lap certain pricing actions we took last year. 
Based on our current performance, we'll reaffirm our 2016 full year guidance of 570 [ph] to 590 [ph] adjusted earnings per share. This guidance does not include any impact for the Department of Treasury's decision on the benefit reduction plan. Regardless of how UPS chooses to respond to Treasury's decision, we still expect to remain within our 2016 guidance. However, if the plan is approved and implemented without delay, the ongoing expense could possibly push us to its lower end of the range.  As we stated earlier, we fully intend to continue challenging the plan if it is approved by the treasury. 
To summarize. This quarter as an example of how our accelerated investments are providing benefits across the company. We are adapting to the changing market conditions, bending the cost curve and at the same time, producing strong financial results. We are well-positioned to continue to make progress through the rest of the 2016. 
And now I'll ask the operator to open the lines for the questions. Operator?"

It was offset by about 120 basis points to lower fuel surcharges as well as continue to still see some significant changes in the customer and the product mix and the package characteristics that were also weighing on that base rate increase. Just one quick example here. SurePost, it's the lowest revenue piece product in our portfolio by its nature. It achieved double-digit growth this quarter. It also has some of the highest delivery density in our network and it generates excellent profitability [indiscernible] and it's even more profitable when we combine that with our SurePost Redirect.

And maybe if you expect that ground growth to continue through the rest of the year here, outside of what we saw from e-Commerce which is probably at least partially holiday-related? Some comments will be helpful."

The online purchases are continuing to drive demand for UPS best-in-class services, which are essentially the business delivery and we did see mid-teens return growth there. We think as B2C grows, we're going to see very strong returns growth there, that's going to be help our B2B segment. So overall, B2B still in positive territory impacted by the softness in industrial production, but we've been positive on B2B growth for the last few years now, with the exception of 1 quarter. So -- we -- the economy is certainly soft after when it comes to industrial production, but we think the combination of our B2C and our B2B value proposition to the non-retail segment is going to allow us to continue to grow that B2B business."

And I'll give the same impression to that, that I would [indiscernible] is very mixed. And yes, GDP is obviously, weakened even today, the numbers that came out quarter-over-quarter showed weakness and year-over-year, slight deterioration. But again, you can look and you can find bright spots and you can find things that worry  you. On the  one hand consumer spending, continue to be the primary economic driver in the U.S. On the other hand, industrial production has been disappointing. Although I can't say there has been some recent data on manufacturing that are showing some sign of expansion. On the  one hand again, online retail is continuing to grow much faster than many expected. On the other hand, especially brick-and-mortar retailers have not done so well. Again, on one hand, inflation and unemployment have stabilized, although wage growth from courses has been muted. And when you look at it internationally, I think the same thing. You're going to see positives and when you go see things that concern you. From the European Union, we still expect to see that economy grow, at a fairly solid pace compared to recent past. But there are signs of slowing, especially in some countries. Emerging markets, you see some concerns there, especially in Brazil and Russia. China though, GDP forecast is stabilized. If you look at U.S's. exports, because of the strength of the dollar, that, of course, is weakened. But when you look at European exports imported into the U.S., that is -- that has been pretty solid. But my final point, and I think it's what's led to our success the last 4, 5 quarters and will continue to lead to it is that regardless of these challenges, we hope to make challenges opportunities. And that's how we execute our investments, our strategic initiatives. If we continue to execute, we have proven and we will continue to prove that we can have success in this mixed economic environment. So thank you for the question. I appreciate it."

So we made that investment in, to better understand the economics demand and value proposition and certainly we are a leader in that particular space. At the same time, we believe that because the lion share of shopping takes place in the late afternoon and evenings, there is much more demand for local next day, which really speaks to the latter part of your question about omnichannel. And we're very focused on those local store solutions that enable us to take evening orders that are dropped to the stores, let the stores fulfill them locally that same evening over the UPS late-night pickup. We can get next day or morning delivery. So we can make the delivery in as little as 10 to 12 hours from the time the order is dropped and checked out.

But certainly, all of our brick-and-mortar retailers are also in the e-commerce business. So it's about providing them a total solution. And omnichannel is a growing trend in the retail industry. We're seeing 30% year-over-year growth in UPS accounts in 2015, and that means at the store level, we've got over 120,000 ship-from-store locations that are shipping or have the potential to ship. We're starting to see this phenomenal start to take place also outside the U.S. and our international business. So we think it's a real advantage for the retailers to optimize for a number of things. Sometimes it's inventory saving the order, because the order is not in the e-commerce fulfillment center but it's in the store. Other times, it's to speed up the delivery. Other times, it's to get to the lowest cost option. So it's really about the whole platform that we offer with UPS My Choice, UPS Access Point, the omnichannel, the SurePost, Returns, the marketplace tools we provide, so on and so forth that we're out there selling along with obviously, the power of our whole product portfolio aligned to the integrated network that's really driving that success. And I guess last thing I'd say is that one of the questions earlier were about the density creation. Where we're really creating this density synthetically through all those e-commerce solutions that I just spoke of because all of them both drive customer and consumer convenience as well as density for UPS. And you combine that with some of the things that we're doing on the efficiency side with ORION and automation and things that Myron talked about, we really believe we've got a great platform for e-commerce for both retailers, consumers and to continue to enhance UPS profitability."

The international segment sustained its momentum with 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. The U.S. domestic business also expanded operating margins as efficiency gains enhanced bottom line results, while Supply Chain  and Freight performed slightly ahead of our expectations.
Our accelerated investments in the UPS network are improving business results. This is enabling us to deliver strong financial results despite the current mixed macro environment. In the U.S., GDP forecast continue to be revised downward, yet consumer spending remains the primary catalyst for growth in the economy, and e-commerce sales have again exceeded expectations.
On the other hand, industrial production remains below 2015 levels. In Europe, economic expansion has slowed slightly, but the pace of growth remains healthy. While in Asia, the major economy showed positive signs of stabilization as exports from China improved in March. 
Despite these mixed economic conditions, we remain committed to making investments for growth and efficiency. We will continue to implement our enterprise strategy, providing UPS customers with increased choice, convenience and control.
During the quarter, we launched enhanced products to support customers' needs for earlier delivery. Our Next Day Air Early now serves almost 30% more ZIP codes, strengthening our leadership position in offering the earliest next-day deliveries.
We also increased our Worldwide Express small package offering to 23 new countries and territories. UPS now offers guaranteed noon delivery on the next possible business day to 88 countries around the world.
In addition to broadening our service portfolio for growth, we also are investing in our infrastructure with innovative technology and major facility expansions. The ability to combine our integrated network with the latest operating technology helps UPS deliver industry-leading margins and provides tremendous value to our customers.
ORION is a great example of how we use predictive analytics and big data to improve service, while bending the cost curve lower. Our future plans for ORION will enhance the benefits for UPS and our customers. In fact, I recently had the great honor, on behalf of all UPSers, to accept the prestigious 2016 Franz Edelman Award, recognizing ORION and UPS' leadership in operations research.
In addition to innovation in honor of technologies like ORION, we're making major investments in new capacity and modernized facilities, both in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we are expanding major facilities in Metro LA, Denver, Chicago and other areas around the country. In Europe, as part of our $2 billion European investment plan announced in 2014, we opened a larger automated hub in Lyon, France, tripling our capacity in the area. And we also announced an automated facility expansion in Herne, Germany.
Adding to these examples of our innovated infrastructure is our commitment to global leadership in alternative fuels. This quarter, we announced an additional $100 million investment to expand compressed natural gas in our delivery and facility network. Our alternative fuel vehicles are now 6% of our global fleet and have helped UPS reduce its annual use of conventional fuel by 10%. We are well on our way to achieving our goal of driving 1 billion miles worldwide by 2017 with our alternative fuel vehicles.
As we invest in the U.S. and abroad, the ability to grow our business is accelerated by global trade. Recently, the President signed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act. This important legislation is designed to modernize, strengthen and streamline cross-border trade, facilitating faster clearance of goods into the U.S. UPS strongly supports the expansion of free-trade around the world. We are developing additional solutions that assist buyers and sellers to transact business across borders.
So in summary, the first quarter results demonstrate the differentiating value of our integrated network and global portfolio. Our investments in technology and capacity are producing network efficiencies and giving us more control over the cost drivers in our business. And this is providing improved financial results.
At UPS, we are innovating and investing to ensure we anticipate the needs of our 10 million customers.
Before Richard covers the quarterly financial results, I've asked Norm Brothers, our General Counsel, to provide an update on developments surrounding the Central States' proposed benefit reduction plan. Norm?"

This is a topic that we first disclosed in our third quarter 2015 10-Q. The Central States' plan proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to its participants, including certain UPS employees. When UPS withdrew from t",351,"Thanks, David, and good morning. This is a topic that we first disclosed in our third quarter 2015 10-Q. The Central States' plan proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to its participants, including certain UPS employees. When UPS withdrew from the fund in 2007, as part of our collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, we agreed to provide supplemental benefits in the event that certain benefits were lawfully reduced.
As a reminder, in December 2014, Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, which, for the first time ever, allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees, subject to specific guidelines written into the statute and government oversight. As a result of this law, the Central State Pension Fund submitted a benefit reduction plan for approval to the U.S. Department of Treasury in the fall of 2015.
As we explained in our 2015 10-K, we are challenging Central States' plan because we firmly believe that it does not comply with the law. According to this new statute, we currently expect the decision from the Department of Treasury on or before May 7, unless there's some agreement to delay the process. Of course, Treasury could reject Central States' proposal, confirming our position. If this happens, the benefits paid from Central States will not be reduced without further action.
In the event this plan is approved as proposed, we fully intend to continue challenging it and pursue all legal remedies available to UPS. As we gained additional information during the quarter, we continue to assess the possible impact of Treasury's review of the plan on UPS. This is a new law and the first time the approval process has ever been used.
And as I stated, we firmly believe the proposed benefit reduction plan does not comply with the law. We recognize there are a lot of unanswered questions, but without Treasury's decision, we are not going to speculate. However, we still thought it was important to provide you an update on the process.
Now I will turn it over to Richard for a financial view of the issue."

We estimate that if Central States' plan is approved as proposed and implemented, we will be required to record a charge of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion later this year. Our estimates are based on the information currently available to UPS and assumes, among other things, that the plan's implementation is not delayed.
If this charge is necessary, we expect it will be treated as an interim mark-to-market pension charge and will be reflected in this year's financial results. In addition, there may be an increase in the ongoing pension expense that could impact 2016.
Following our call today, we'll provide a presentation on the IR website regarding this subject.
Now let's move on [indiscernible] business and how it continues to perform.
As David said, the consumer is driving the economy, and that translates into opportunities for UPS. During the quarter, we turned e-commerce growth into expanded margins and increased operating profit in the U.S. domestic segment. This, combined with momentum in our international business and slightly better than expected performance in supply chain and freight segment, produced another strong quarter.
Now let's go a little deeper into the results, starting with the U.S. domestic segment, where operating profit increased $78 million or almost 8% and operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 12.1%.
Revenue was up 3.1% over last year to $9.1 billion. However, lower fuel surcharges were a drag of about 120 basis points on the growth rate. Average daily volume increased 2.8% with the Ground products up 3.3% and Next Day Air up 3%.
After 5 continuous quarter of double-digit growth, deferred products declined slightly. E-commerce customers drove both B2C and B2B shipments higher, with B2C up more than 6%. Interestingly, supporting B2B growth during the quarter, online purchases drove demand for UPS' best-in-class return services portfolio, which grew double-digit this quarter.
Base rates increased about 2%, but were offset by changes in package characteristics and a mix of product and customers. There was a 120 basis point drag from lower fuel surcharges that weighed on the reported deals. As a result, total revenue per piece was down 1.3% from the prior year.
This quarter, the margin expansion was driven by the excellent cost management demonstrated. Cost per piece was down 1.9% compared to last year. Network efficiencies continue to improve, and we're seeing those improvements in our bottom line.
At the foundation of our success this quarter is the continued benefits of the UPS integrated network overlaid with our unique technology. Looking at our key daily statistics, and this is where we are seeing good improvement as the expansion of ORION lowered driver miles by about 1% despite the fact that total stops grew by about 6%. In addition, overall productivity gains helped direct labor hours to an increase of 1.8%, well below the average daily volume growth. As these trends continue, UPS is improving the stop economics of e-commerce.
Now let's turn to the international segment. As David said, we are reporting our 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. International operating profit increased more than 15%, reflecting the impact of discipline pricing, better network efficiencies and in-country cost control.
Revenue on a currency neutral basis was slow this quarter by management actions we implemented in the third quarter of last year. In addition, lower fuel surcharges negatively affected the growth rate by about 200 basis points. Currency neutral revenue per piece was up 1.6% with domestic products up 2.8%. Strong base rate improvements were across all regions of the world and contributed to the best yield growth in more than 2 years.
Revenue management actions also affected international volume, mainly the non-U.S. domestic products. Meanwhile, we saw increased demand out of Asia and Europe into the U.S, offsetting lower U.S. exports. Export volume has start recovering from the revenue management actions we started in mid-2015. Fewer local operating days, mostly due to the timing of the Easter holiday, lowered the growth rate by about 200 basis points.
Now let's discuss the Supply Chain and Freight segment, where operating profit was better than anticipated, but slightly less than last year as the segment managed through a tough economic backdrop. Total revenue on a currency neutral basis was up more than 11%, driven by the addition of Coyote Logistics. The asset-light truckload brokerage business is managing well, even in a market that remains soft, and the synergies remain per plan. In addition, market conditions remain weak, both in the air freight forwarding and UPS Freight markets. In the freight forwarding unit, international air freight kilos were down, and it's due to a combination of repricing efforts in 2015 and an overall softer market. Margins expanded as the unit held firm with rates and achieved higher buy/sell rate spreads.
Distribution revenue, on a currency neutral basis, was up around 7%. Supported by our industry-specific solutions, we had double-digit gains in health care, aerospace and industrial manufacturing sectors.
UPS Freight remain committed to disciplined revenue management. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 2.1% as the unit continued to focus on serving higher-yielding middle market customers, yet total tonnage declined as market conditions remain challenging.
Now for an update on our cash position. The company generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow after investing almost $430 million in capital expenditures. UPS improved its quarterly dividend by almost 7% during the quarter and paid about $670 million in dividends. And the company repurchased 6.8 million shares for approximately $680 million.
Now I'd like to update you on our guidance for 2016. The first quarter results continued our momentum from last year, and we remain on track for 2016. Economic conditions around the world remain mixed. However, our business model is adapting well in this environment. In addition, international and supply chain and freight will lap certain pricing actions we took last year.
Based on our current performance, we reaffirm our 2016 full year guidance of 570 to 590 adjusted earnings per share. This guidance does not include any impact for the Department of Treasury's decision on the benefit reduction plan. Regardless of how UPS chooses to respond to Treasury's decision, we still expect to remain within our 2016 guidance. However, if the plan is approved and implemented without delay, the ongoing expense could possibly push us towards the lower end of the range. As we stated earlier, we fully intend to continue challenging the plan if it is approved by Treasury.
To summarize. This quarter is an example of how our accelerated investments are providing benefits across the company. We are adapting to the changing market conditions, bending the cost curve and at the same time, producing strong financial results. We are well positioned to continue to make progress through the rest of the 2016.
And now I'll ask the operator to open the lines for the questions. Operator?"

It was offset by about 120 basis points to lower fuel surcharges as well as continued to still see some significant changes in the customer and the product mix and the package characteristics that were also weighing on that base rate increase. Just one quick example here. SurePost, it's the lowest revenue piece product in our portfolio by its nature. It achieved double-digit growth this quarter. It also has some of the highest delivery density in our network, and it generates excellent profitability and [indiscernible], and it's even more profitable when we combine that with our SurePost redirects.

Even today, the numbers that came out quarter-over-quarter has showed weakness and year-over-year, slight deterioration. But again, you can look and you can find bright spots, and then you can find things that worry you. On the one hand, consumer spending continued to be the primary economic driver in the U.S. On the other hand, industrial production has been disappointing. Although, I can't say there has been some recent data on manufacturing that are showing some sign of expansion. On the one hand, again, online retail is continuing to grow much faster than many expected. On the other hand, especially brick-and-mortar retailers have not done so well. Again, on one hand, inflation and unemployment have stabilized, although wage growth, of course, has been muted. And when you look at it internationally, I think the same thing. You're going to see positives and you're going to see things that concern you. From the European Union, we still expect to see that economy grow at a fairly solid pace compared to recent past. But there are signs of slowing, especially in some countries. Emerging markets, you see some concerns there, especially in Brazil and Russia. China, though, GDP forecast has stabilized. You look at U.S.' exports, because of the strength of the dollar, that, of course, has weakened. But when you look at European exports imported into the U.S., that is -- has been pretty solid. But my final point, and I think it's what's led to our success the last 4, 5 quarters and will continue to lead to it, is that regardless of these challenges, we have to make challenges opportunities. And that's how we execute our investments, our strategic initiatives. If we continue to execute, we have proven, and we will continue to prove that we can have success in this mixed economic environment. So thank you for the question. I appreciate it."

And your question also mentioned fuel, and let me also remind you that we don't use fuel as a profit center, so it does impact the revenue line, but it's really not a big impact to what happens on the bottom line.

As you guys know, we've been in the same-day business for a long time with Express Credit goal and our world-class service parts logistics network, but certainly, there's a lot of buzz with e-commerce with same-day. And the real challenge is, obviously, low-cost e-commerce delivery because the consumers are looking for a low-cost option there. Currently, as you know, same-day for e-commerce has challenges with consolidating density in single piece stop economics that create profitability issues as these companies look for the low-cost model. Deliv's goal is pretty unique, it consolidates multiple deliveries on one driver with pickups from multiple stores at a mall, for example. So we're looking to get some key learnings there. So we made that SEF investment in Deliv to better understand the economics demand and value proposition, and certainly, they're a leader in that particular space. At the same time, we believe that because the lion share of shopping takes place in the late afternoon and evenings, there is much more demand for local next day, which really speaks to the latter part of your question about omnichannel, and we're very focused on those local store solutions that enable us to take evening orders that you're going to drop to these stores, let the stores fulfill them locally that same evening, and with the UPS late-night pickup, we can get next day or morning delivery. So we can make the delivery in as little as 10 to 12 hours from the time the order is dropped into checkout.

But certainly, all of our brick-and-mortar retailers are also in the e-commerce business. So it's about providing them a total solution. And omnichannel is a growing trend in the retail industry. We're seeing 30% year-over-year growth in UPS accounts in 2015, and that means, at the store level, we've got over 120,000 ship-from-store locations that are shipping or have the potential to ship. We're starting to see this phenomenal start to take place also outside the U.S. in our international business. So we think it's a real advantage for the retailers to optimize for a number of things. Sometimes, it's inventory saving the order because the order is not in the e-commerce fulfillment center, but it's in the store. Other times, it's to speed up the delivery. Other times, it's to get to the lowest cost option. So it's really about the whole platform that we offer with UPS My Choice, UPS Access Point, omnichannel, the SurePost, Returns, marketplace tools we provide, so on and so forth, that we're out there selling along with, obviously, the power of our whole product portfolio aligned to the integrated network that's really driving that success. And I guess the last thing I'd say is that it's kind of one of the questions earlier were about the density creation, where we're really creating this density synthetically through all those e-commerce solutions that I just spoke of because all of them both drive customer and consumer convenience as well as density for UPS and you combine that with some of the things that we're doing on the efficiency side with ORION and automation and things that Myron talked about, we really believe we've got a great platform for e-commerce, for both -- for retailers, consumers, and to continue to enhance UPS profitability."

The international segment sustained its momentum with its 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. The U.S. domestic business also expanded operating margins as efficiency gains enhanced bottom line results, while Supply Chain and Freight performed slightly ahead of our expectations.
Our accelerated investments in the UPS network are improving business results. This is enabling us to deliver strong financial results despite the current mixed macro environment. In the U.S., GDP forecast continue to be revised downward, yet consumer spending remains the primary catalyst for growth in the economy, and e-commerce sales have again exceeded expectations.
On the other hand, industrial production remains below 2015 levels. In Europe, economic expansion has slowed slightly, but the pace of growth remains healthy. While in Asia, the major economy showed positive signs of stabilization as exports from China improved in March. 
Despite these mixed economic conditions, we remain committed to making investments for growth and efficiency. We will continue to implement our enterprise strategy, providing UPS customers with increased choice, convenience and control.
During the quarter, we launched enhanced products to support customers' needs for earlier delivery. Our Next Day Air Early now serves almost 30% more ZIP codes, strengthening our leadership position in offering the earliest next-day deliveries.
We also increased our Worldwide Express small package offering to 23 new countries and territories. UPS now offers guaranteed noon delivery on the next possible business day to 88 countries around the world.
In addition to broadening our service portfolio for growth, we also are investing in our infrastructure with innovative technology and major facility expansions. The ability to combine our integrated network with the latest operating technology helps UPS deliver industry-leading margins and provides tremendous value to our customers.
ORION is a great example of how we use predictive analytics and big data to improve service, while bending the cost curve lower. Our future plans for ORION will enhance the benefits for UPS and our customers. In fact, I recently had the great honor, on behalf of all UPSers, to accept the prestigious 2016 Franz Edelman Award, recognizing ORION and UPS' leadership in operations research.
In addition to innovation in own-road technologies like ORION, we're making major investments in new capacity and modernized facilities, both in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we are expanding major facilities in Metro LA, Denver, Chicago and other areas around the country. In Europe, as part of our $2 billion European investment plan announced in 2014, we opened a larger automated hub in Lyon, France, tripling our capacity in the area. And we also announced an automated facility expansion in Herne, Germany.
Adding to these examples of our innovated infrastructure is our commitment to global leadership in alternative fuels. This quarter, we announced an additional $100 million investment to expand compressed natural gas in our delivery and facility network. Our alternative fuel vehicles are now 6% of our global fleet and have helped UPS reduce its annual use of conventional fuel by 10%. We are well on our way to achieving our goal of driving 1 billion miles worldwide by 2017 with our alternative fuel vehicles.
As we invest in the U.S. and abroad, the ability to grow our business is accelerated by global trade. Recently, the President signed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act. This important legislation is designed to modernize, strengthen and streamline cross-border trade, facilitating faster clearance of goods into the U.S. UPS strongly supports the expansion of free-trade around the world. We are developing additional solutions that assist buyers and sellers to transact business across borders.
So in summary, the first quarter results demonstrate the differentiating value of our integrated network and global portfolio. Our investments in technology and capacity are producing network efficiencies and giving us more control over the cost drivers in our business. And this is providing improved financial results.
At UPS, we are innovating and investing to ensure we anticipate the needs of our 10 million customers.
Before Richard covers the quarterly financial results, I've asked Norm Brothers, our General Counsel, to provide an update on developments surrounding the Central States' proposed benefit reduction plan. Norm?"

This is a topic that we first disclosed in our third quarter 2015 10-Q. The Central States' plan proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to its participants, including certain UPS employees. When UPS withdrew from t",351,"Thanks, David, and good morning. This is a topic that we first disclosed in our third quarter 2015 10-Q. The Central States' plan proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to its participants, including certain UPS employees. When UPS withdrew from the fund in 2007, as part of our collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, we agreed to provide supplemental benefits in the event that certain benefits were lawfully reduced.
As a reminder, in December 2014, Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, which, for the first time ever, allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees, subject to specific guidelines written into the statute and government oversight. As a result of this law, the Central States Pension Fund submitted a benefit reduction plan for approval to the U.S. Department of Treasury in the fall of 2015.
As we explained in our 2015 10-K, we are challenging Central States' plan because we firmly believe that it does not comply with the law. According to this new statute, we currently expect the decision from the Department of Treasury on or before May 7, unless there's some agreement to delay the process. Of course, Treasury could reject Central States' proposal, confirming our position. If this happens, the benefits paid from Central States will not be reduced without further action.
In the event this plan is approved as proposed, we fully intend to continue challenging it and pursue all legal remedies available to UPS. As we gained additional information during the quarter, we continue to assess the possible impact of Treasury's review of the plan on UPS. This is a new law and the first time the approval process has ever been used.
And as I stated, we firmly believe the proposed benefit reduction plan does not comply with the law. We recognize there are a lot of unanswered questions, but without Treasury's decision, we are not going to speculate. However, we still thought it was important to provide you an update on the process.
Now I will turn it over to Richard for a financial view of the issue."

We estimate that if Central States' plan is approved as proposed and implemented, we will be required to record a charge of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion later this year. Our estimates are based on the information currently available to UPS and assumes, among other things, that the plan's implementation is not delayed.
If this charge is necessary, we expect it will be treated as an interim mark-to-market pension charge and will be reflected in this year's financial results. In addition, there may be an increase in the ongoing pension expense that could impact 2016.
Following our call today, we'll provide a presentation on the IR website regarding this subject.
Now let's move on 
[Audio Gap] 
business and how it continues to perform.
As David said, the consumer is driving the economy, and that translates into opportunities for UPS. During the quarter, we turned e-commerce growth into expanded margins and increased operating profit in the U.S. domestic segment. This, combined with momentum in our international business and slightly better than expected performance in supply chain and freight segment, produced another strong quarter.
Now let's go a little deeper into the results, starting with the U.S. domestic segment, where operating profit increased $78 million or almost 8% and operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 12.1%.
Revenue was up 3.1% over last year to $9.1 billion. However, lower fuel surcharges were a drag of about 120 basis points on the growth rate. Average daily volume increased 2.8% with the Ground products up 3.3% and Next Day Air up 3%.
After 5 continuous quarter of double-digit growth, deferred products declined slightly. E-commerce customers drove both B2C and B2B shipments higher, with B2C up more than 6%. Interestingly, supporting B2B growth during the quarter, online purchases drove demand for UPS' best-in-class return services portfolio, which grew double-digit this quarter.
Base rates increased about 2%, but were offset by changes in package characteristics and a mix of product and customers. There was a 120-basis-point drag from lower fuel surcharges that weighed on the reported deals. As a result, total revenue per piece was down 1.3% from the prior year.
This quarter, the margin expansion was driven by the excellent cost management demonstrated. Cost per piece was down 1.9% compared to last year. Network efficiencies continue to improve, and we're seeing those improvements in our bottom line.
At the foundation of our success this quarter is the continued benefits of the UPS integrated network overlaid with our unique technology. Looking at our key daily statistics, and this is where we are seeing good improvement as the expansion of ORION lowered driver miles by about 1% despite the fact that total stops grew by about 6%. In addition, overall productivity gains held direct labor hours to an increase of 1.8%, well below the average daily volume growth. As these trends continue, UPS is improving the stop economics of e-commerce.
Now let's turn to the international segment. As David said, we are reporting our 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. International operating profit increased more than 15%, reflecting the impact of disciplined pricing, better network efficiencies and in-country cost control.
Revenue on a currency neutral basis was slow this quarter by management actions we implemented in the third quarter of last year. In addition, lower fuel surcharges negatively affected the growth rate by about 200 basis points. Currency neutral revenue per piece was up 1.6% with domestic products up 2.8%. Strong base rate improvements were across all regions of the world and contributed to the best yield growth in more than 2 years.
Revenue management actions also affected international volume, mainly the non-U.S. domestic products. Meanwhile, we saw increased demand out of Asia and Europe into the U.S, offsetting lower U.S. exports. Export volume has start recovering from the revenue management actions we started in mid-2015. Fewer local operating days, mostly due to the timing of the Easter holiday, lowered the growth rate by about 200 basis points.
Now let's discuss the Supply Chain and Freight segment, where operating profit was better than anticipated, but slightly less than last year as the segment managed through a tough economic backdrop. Total revenue on a currency neutral basis was up more than 11%, driven by the addition of Coyote Logistics. The asset-light truckload brokerage business is managing well, even in a market that remains soft, and the synergies remain per plan. In addition, market conditions remain weak, both in the air freight forwarding and UPS Freight markets. In the freight forwarding unit, international air freight kilos were down, and it's due to a combination of repricing efforts in 2015 and an overall softer market. Margins expanded as the unit held firm with rates and achieved higher buy/sell rate spreads.
Distribution revenue, on a currency neutral basis, was up around 7%. Supported by our industry-specific solutions, we had double-digit gains in health care, aerospace and industrial manufacturing sectors.
UPS Freight remained committed to disciplined revenue management. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 2.1% as the unit continued to focus on serving higher-yielding middle market customers, yet total tonnage declined as market conditions remain challenging.
Now for an update on our cash position. The company generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow after investing almost $430 million in capital expenditures. UPS improved its quarterly dividend by almost 7% during the quarter and paid about $670 million in dividends. And the company repurchased 6.8 million shares for approximately $680 million.
Now I'd like to update you on our guidance for 2016. The first quarter results continued our momentum from last year, and we remain on track for 2016. Economic conditions around the world remain mixed. However, our business model is adapting well in this environment. In addition, international and supply chain and freight will lap certain pricing actions we took last year.
Based on our current performance, we reaffirm our 2016 full year guidance of 570 to 590 adjusted earnings per share. This guidance does not include any impact for the Department of Treasury's decision on the benefit reduction plan. Regardless of how UPS chooses to respond to Treasury's decision, we still expect to remain within our 2016 guidance. However, if the plan is approved and implemented without delay, the ongoing expense could possibly push us towards the lower end of the range. As we stated earlier, we fully intend to continue challenging the plan if it is approved by Treasury.
To summarize. This quarter is an example of how our accelerated investments are providing benefits across the company. We are adapting to the changing market conditions, bending the cost curve and at the same time, producing strong financial results. We are well positioned to continue to make progress through the rest of 2016.

It was offset by about 120 basis points to lower fuel surcharges as well as continuing to still see some significant changes in the customer and the product mix and the package characteristics that were also weighing on that base rate increase. Just one quick example here. SurePost, it's the lowest revenue piece product in our portfolio by its nature. It achieved double-digit growth this quarter. It also has some of the highest delivery density in our network, and it generates excellent profitability and ROIC, and it's even more profitable when we combine that with our SurePost redirects. We've got a lot of examples where we're focusing on driving profits, where the revenue to cost ratio is -- where the RPP is actually lower than average like SDS, UPS Access Point, Returns, they're all significant density creators.

The e-commerce customers drove both B2C and B2B shipments higher, with the B2C up more than 6%. And by the way, that was our best B2C growth in the last 5 quarters, and like Rich said, we've achieved margin expansion with that growth of B2C. The online purchases are continuing to drive demand for UPS' best-in-class return services, which are essentially a business delivery, and we did see mid-teens return growth there. We think as B2C grows, we're going to continue to see very strong returns growth there that's going to be help our B2B segment. So overall, B2B is still in positive territory, but it's still being impacted by the softness in industrial production, but we've been positive on B2B growth for the last few years now with the exception of 1 quarter.

[Audio Gap] 
and that is it's very mixed. And U.S. GDP has, obviously, weakened. Even today, the numbers that came out quarter-over-quarter has showed weakness and year-over-year, slight deterioration. But again, you can look and you can find bright spots, and then you can find things that worry you. On the one hand, consumer spending continued to be the primary economic driver in the U.S. On the other hand, industrial production has been disappointing. Although, I can say there has been some recent data on manufacturing that is showing some sign of expansion. On the one hand, again, online retail is continuing to grow much faster than many expected. On the other hand, especially brick-and-mortar retailers have not done so well. Again, on one hand, inflation and unemployment have stabilized, although wage growth, of course, has been muted. And when you look at it internationally, I think the same thing. You're going to see positives and you're going to see things that concern you. From the European Union, we still expect to see that economy grow at a fairly solid pace compared to recent past. But there are signs of slowing, especially in some countries. Emerging markets, you see some concerns there, especially in Brazil and Russia. China, though, the GDP forecast has stabilized. You look at U.S. exports, because of the strength of the dollar, that, of course, has weakened. But when you look at European exports imported into the U.S., that is -- has been pretty solid. But my final point, and I think it's what's led to our success the last 4, 5 quarters and will continue to lead to it, is that regardless of these challenges, we have to make challenges opportunities. And it's how we execute our investments, our strategic initiatives. If we continue to execute, we have proven, and we will continue to prove that we can have success in this mixed economic environment. So thank you for the question. I appreciate it."

First, let me start by saying that I had mentioned that even adjusting out currency, we are talking about almost a 17% operating margin. So it's a very positive and it's actually the best margin in the industry. The other big thing to remember is -- and we talked about it, I think, in some of my talk a little bit, was that when you look at the yields for international, it was the strongest yields we've seen in quite some time, both in the non-U.S. domestic and in the international exports as well. And your question also mentioned fuel, and let me also remind you that we don't use fuel as a profit center, so it does impact the revenue line, but it's really not a big impact to what happens on the bottom line. This quarter is really about great cost control and the quality of revenue. And it was really something that Jim and his folks started mid last year when we took on some revenue management initiatives, and we know we'll wrap that in the second half of the year. We guided that way at the beginning of the year. And so this was really a very balanced profit picture and a return for the quarter for international."

If you go back to January and you look at what GDP was doing and what expectations were around the globe, those have all come down. On the other side, what's happened is -- what's happening in UPS and what we're seeing is the continued margin expansion, the things that we talked about in both international and domestic around both from a cost and network efficiency standpoint as well as making the adjustments as the volume looks different. So today, I'd say it's more about what's happening at UPS, but we also have to continue to think about what's happening externally so that does have an impact.

As you guys know, we've been in the same-day business for a long time with Express Critical and our world-class service parts logistics network, but certainly, there's a lot of buzz with e-commerce with same-day. And the real challenge is, obviously, low-cost e-commerce delivery because the consumers are looking for a low-cost option there. Currently, as you know, same-day for e-commerce has challenges with consolidating density in single piece stopped economics that create profitability issues as these companies look for the low-cost model. Deliv's goal is pretty unique; it consolidates multiple deliveries on one driver with pickups from multiple stores at a mall, for example. So we're looking to get some key learnings there. So we made that SEF investment in Deliv to better understand the economics demand and value proposition, and certainly, they're a leader in that particular space. At the same time, we believe that because the lion's share of shopping takes place in the late afternoon and evenings, there is much more demand for local next day, which really speaks to the latter part of your question about omnichannel, and we're very focused on those local store solutions that enable us to take evening orders that are dropped to these stores, let the stores fulfill them locally that same evening, and with the UPS late-night pickup, we can get next day or morning delivery. So we can make the delivery in as little as 10 to 12 hours from the time the order is dropped into checkout. And you combine that again with our industry-leading e-commerce platform, and we're really leading the way in the B2C e-commerce market. Thanks."

But certainly, all of our brick-and-mortar retailers are also in the e-commerce business. So it's about providing them a total solution. And omnichannel is a growing trend in the retail industry. We're seeing 30% year-over-year growth in UPS accounts in 2015, and that means, at the store level, we've got over 120,000 ship-from-store locations that are shipping or have the potential to ship. We're starting to see this phenomenal start to take place also outside the U.S. in our international business. So we think it's a real advantage for the retailers to optimize for a number of things. Sometimes, it's inventory saving the order because the order is not in the e-commerce fulfillment center, but it's in the store. Other times, it's to speed up the delivery. Other times, it's to get to the lowest cost option. So it's really about the whole platform that we offer with UPS My Choice, UPS Access Point, omnichannel, the SurePost, Returns, marketplace tools we provide, so on and so forth, that we're out there selling along with, obviously, the power of our whole product portfolio aligned to the integrated network that's really driving that success. And I guess the last thing I'd say is that it's kind of one of the questions earlier. We're about density creation, where we're really creating this density synthetically through all those e-commerce solutions that I just spoke of because all of them both drive customer and consumer convenience as well as density for UPS and you combine that with some of the things we're doing on the efficiency side with ORION and automation and things that Myron talked about, we really believe we've got a great platform for e-commerce, for both -- for retailers, consumers, and to continue to enhance UPS profitability."

The international segment sustained its momentum with its 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. The U.S. domestic business also expanded operating margins as efficiency gains enhanced bottom line results, while Supply Chain and Freight performed slightly ahead of our expectations.
Our accelerated investments in the UPS network are improving business results. This is enabling us to deliver strong financial results despite the current mixed macro environment. In the U.S., GDP forecast continue to be revised downward, yet consumer spending remains the primary catalyst for growth in the economy, and e-commerce sales have again exceeded expectations.
On the other hand, industrial production remains below 2015 levels. In Europe, economic expansion has slowed slightly, but the pace of growth remains healthy. While in Asia, the major economy showed positive signs of stabilization as exports from China improved in March. 
Despite these mixed economic conditions, we remain committed to making investments for growth and efficiency. We will continue to implement our enterprise strategy, providing UPS customers with increased choice, convenience and control.
During the quarter, we launched enhanced products to support customers' needs for earlier delivery. Our Next Day Air Early now serves almost 30% more ZIP codes, strengthening our leadership position in offering the earliest next-day deliveries.
We also increased our Worldwide Express small package offering to 23 new countries and territories. UPS now offers guaranteed noon delivery on the next possible business day to 88 countries around the world.
In addition to broadening our service portfolio for growth, we also are investing in our infrastructure with innovative technology and major facility expansions. The ability to combine our integrated network with the latest operating technology helps UPS deliver industry-leading margins and provides tremendous value to our customers.
ORION is a great example of how we use predictive analytics and big data to improve service, while bending the cost curve lower. Our future plans for ORION will enhance the benefits for UPS and our customers. In fact, I recently had the great honor, on behalf of all UPSers, to accept the prestigious 2016 Franz Edelman Award, recognizing ORION and UPS' leadership in operations research.
In addition to innovation in own-road technologies like ORION, we're making major investments in new capacity and modernized facilities, both in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we are expanding major facilities in Metro LA, Denver, Chicago and other areas around the country. In Europe, as part of our $2 billion European investment plan announced in 2014, we opened a larger automated hub in Lyon, France, tripling our capacity in the area. And we also announced an automated facility expansion in Herne, Germany.
Adding to these examples of our innovated infrastructure is our commitment to global leadership in alternative fuels. This quarter, we announced an additional $100 million investment to expand compressed natural gas in our delivery and facility network. Our alternative fuel vehicles are now 6% of our global fleet and have helped UPS reduce its annual use of conventional fuel by 10%. We are well on our way to achieving our goal of driving 1 billion miles worldwide by 2017 with our alternative fuel vehicles.
As we invest in the U.S. and abroad, the ability to grow our business is accelerated by global trade. Recently, the President signed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act. This important legislation is designed to modernize, strengthen and streamline cross-border trade, facilitating faster clearance of goods into the U.S. UPS strongly supports the expansion of free-trade around the world. We are developing additional solutions that assist buyers and sellers to transact business across borders.
So in summary, the first quarter results demonstrate the differentiating value of our integrated network and global portfolio. Our investments in technology and capacity are producing network efficiencies and giving us more control over the cost drivers in our business. And this is providing improved financial results.
At UPS, we are innovating and investing to ensure we anticipate the needs of our 10 million customers.
Before Richard covers the quarterly financial results, I've asked Norm Brothers, our General Counsel, to provide an update on developments surrounding the Central States' proposed benefit reduction plan. Norm?"

This is a topic that we first disclosed in our third quarter 2015 10-Q. The Central States' plan proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to its participants, including certain UPS employees. When UPS withdrew from t",351,"Thanks, David, and good morning. This is a topic that we first disclosed in our third quarter 2015 10-Q. The Central States' plan proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to its participants, including certain UPS employees. When UPS withdrew from the fund in 2007, as part of our collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, we agreed to provide supplemental benefits in the event that certain benefits were lawfully reduced.
As a reminder, in December 2014, Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, which, for the first time ever, allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees, subject to specific guidelines written into the statute and government oversight. As a result of this law, the Central States Pension Fund submitted a benefit reduction plan for approval to the U.S. Department of Treasury in the fall of 2015.
As we explained in our 2015 10-K, we are challenging Central States' plan because we firmly believe that it does not comply with the law. According to this new statute, we currently expect the decision from the Department of Treasury on or before May 7, unless there's some agreement to delay the process. Of course, Treasury could reject Central States' proposal, confirming our position. If this happens, the benefits paid from Central States will not be reduced without further action.
In the event this plan is approved as proposed, we fully intend to continue challenging it and pursue all legal remedies available to UPS. As we gained additional information during the quarter, we continue to assess the possible impact of Treasury's review of the plan on UPS. This is a new law and the first time the approval process has ever been used.
And as I stated, we firmly believe the proposed benefit reduction plan does not comply with the law. We recognize there are a lot of unanswered questions, but without Treasury's decision, we are not going to speculate. However, we still thought it was important to provide you an update on the process.
Now I will turn it over to Richard for a financial view of the issue."

We estimate that if Central States' plan is approved as proposed and implemented, we will be required to record a charge of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion later this year. Our estimates are based on the information currently available to UPS and assumes, among other things, that the plan's implementation is not delayed.
If this charge is necessary, we expect it will be treated as an interim mark-to-market pension charge and will be reflected in this year's financial results. In addition, there may be an increase in the ongoing pension expense that could impact 2016.
Following our call today, we'll provide a presentation on the IR website regarding this subject.
Now let's move on 
[Audio Gap] 
business and how it continues to perform.
As David said, the consumer is driving the economy, and that translates into opportunities for UPS. During the quarter, we turned e-commerce growth into expanded margins and increased operating profit in the U.S. domestic segment. This, combined with momentum in our international business and slightly better than expected performance in supply chain and freight segment, produced another strong quarter.
Now let's go a little deeper into the results, starting with the U.S. domestic segment, where operating profit increased $78 million or almost 8% and operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 12.1%.
Revenue was up 3.1% over last year to $9.1 billion. However, lower fuel surcharges were a drag of about 120 basis points on the growth rate. Average daily volume increased 2.8% with the Ground products up 3.3% and Next Day Air up 3%.
After 5 continuous quarter of double-digit growth, deferred products declined slightly. E-commerce customers drove both B2C and B2B shipments higher, with B2C up more than 6%. Interestingly, supporting B2B growth during the quarter, online purchases drove demand for UPS' best-in-class return services portfolio, which grew double-digit this quarter.
Base rates increased about 2%, but were offset by changes in package characteristics and a mix of product and customers. There was a 120 basis point drag from lower fuel surcharges that weighed on the reported deals. As a result, total revenue per piece was down 1.3% from the prior year.
This quarter, the margin expansion was driven by the excellent cost management demonstrated. Cost per piece was down 1.9% compared to last year. Network efficiencies continue to improve, and we're seeing those improvements in our bottom line.
At the foundation of our success this quarter is the continued benefits of the UPS integrated network overlaid with our unique technology. Looking at our key daily statistics, and this is where we are seeing good improvement as the expansion of ORION lowered driver miles by about 1% despite the fact that total stops grew by about 6%. In addition, overall productivity gains held direct labor hours to an increase of 1.8%, well below the average daily volume growth. As these trends continue, UPS is improving the stop economics of e-commerce.
Now let's turn to the international segment. As David said, we are reporting our 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. International operating profit increased more than 15%, reflecting the impact of disciplined pricing, better network efficiencies and in-country cost control.
Revenue on a currency neutral basis was slow this quarter by management actions we implemented in the third quarter of last year. In addition, lower fuel surcharges negatively affected the growth rate by about 200 basis points. Currency neutral revenue per piece was up 1.6% with domestic products up 2.8%. Strong base rate improvements were across all regions of the world and contributed to the best yield growth in more than 2 years.
Revenue management actions also affected international volume, mainly the non-U.S. domestic products. Meanwhile, we saw increased demand out of Asia and Europe into the U.S, offsetting lower U.S. exports. Export volume has start recovering from the revenue management actions we started in mid-2015. Fewer local operating days, mostly due to the timing of the Easter holiday, lowered the growth rate by about 200 basis points.
Now let's discuss the Supply Chain and Freight segment, where operating profit was better than anticipated, but slightly less than last year as the segment managed through a tough economic backdrop. Total revenue on a currency neutral basis was up more than 11%, driven by the addition of Coyote Logistics. The asset-light truckload brokerage business is managing well, even in a market that remains soft, and the synergies remain per plan. In addition, market conditions remain weak, both in the air freight forwarding and UPS Freight markets. In the freight forwarding unit, international air freight kilos were down, and it's due to a combination of repricing efforts in 2015 and an overall softer market. Margins expanded as the unit held firm with rates and achieved higher buy/sell rate spreads.
Distribution revenue, on a currency neutral basis, was up around 7%. Supported by our industry-specific solutions, we had double-digit gains in health care, aerospace and industrial manufacturing sectors.
UPS Freight remained committed to disciplined revenue management. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 2.1% as the unit continued to focus on serving higher-yielding middle market customers, yet total tonnage declined as market conditions remain challenging.
Now for an update on our cash position. The company generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow after investing almost $430 million in capital expenditures. UPS improved its quarterly dividend by almost 7% during the quarter and paid about $670 million in dividends. And the company repurchased 6.8 million shares for approximately $680 million.
Now I'd like to update you on our guidance for 2016. The first quarter results continued our momentum from last year, and we remain on track for 2016. Economic conditions around the world remain mixed. However, our business model is adapting well in this environment. In addition, international and supply chain and freight will lap certain pricing actions we took last year.
Based on our current performance, we reaffirm our 2016 full year guidance of 570 to 590 adjusted earnings per share. This guidance does not include any impact for the Department of Treasury's decision on the benefit reduction plan. Regardless of how UPS chooses to respond to Treasury's decision, we still expect to remain within our 2016 guidance. However, if the plan is approved and implemented without delay, the ongoing expense could possibly push us towards the lower end of the range. As we stated earlier, we fully intend to continue challenging the plan if it is approved by Treasury.
To summarize. This quarter is an example of how our accelerated investments are providing benefits across the company. We are adapting to the changing market conditions, bending the cost curve and at the same time, producing strong financial results. We are well positioned to continue to make progress through the rest of 2016.
And now I'll ask the operator to open the lines for the questions. Operator?"

It was offset by about 120 basis points to lower fuel surcharges as well as continuing to still see some significant changes in the customer and the product mix and the package characteristics that were also weighing on that base rate increase. Just one quick example here. SurePost, it's the lowest revenue piece product in our portfolio by its nature. It achieved double-digit growth this quarter. It also has some of the highest delivery density in our network, and it generates excellent profitability and ROIC, and it's even more profitable when we combine that with our SurePost redirects. We've got a lot of examples where we're focusing on driving profits, where the revenue to cost ratio is -- where the RPP is actually lower than average like SDS, UPS Access Point, Returns, they're all significant density creators.

We think as B2C grows, we're going to continue to see very strong returns growth there that's going to be help our B2B segment.

I can tell you, though, that we have -- we value our mutually beneficial relationship. And obviously, we evaluate any market moves that any company or customer makes, and we look at it from a competitive standpoint. Where I really want to focus is our integrated network creates efficiencies and just gives us a value proposition that is very difficult to match our diverse customer base. Also just from a density standpoint, no single company is going to be able to match that. So we add value of global scale and scope. We continue to invest in technology to deliver high-value solutions, and there are going to be customers that are going to utilize us as a single source. There's going to be other customers that are going to adjust and sometimes go single source, sometimes go multiple vendors. And sometimes, they will bring some work inside of -- take it in-house. And that's going to adjust as conditions adjust. But we feel we have a good relationship with that customer and feel that we will continue to add value for many, many years to come."

And I'll give the same impression to that, that I would to the 
[Audio Gap] 
and that is it's very mixed. And U.S. GDP has, obviously, weakened. Even today, the numbers that came out quarter-over-quarter has showed weakness and year-over-year, slight deterioration. But again, you can look and you can find bright spots, and then you can find things that worry you. On the one hand, consumer spending continued to be the primary economic driver in the U.S. On the other hand, industrial production has been disappointing. Although, I can say there has been some recent data on manufacturing that is showing some sign of expansion. On the one hand, again, online retail is continuing to grow much faster than many expected. On the other hand, especially brick-and-mortar retailers have not done so well. Again, on one hand, inflation and unemployment have stabilized, although wage growth, of course, has been muted. And when you look at it internationally, I think the same thing. You're going to see positives and you're going to see things that concern you. From the European Union, we still expect to see that economy grow at a fairly solid pace compared to recent past. But there are signs of slowing, especially in some countries. Emerging markets, you see some concerns there, especially in Brazil and Russia. China, though, the GDP forecast has stabilized. You look at U.S. exports, because of the strength of the dollar, that, of course, has weakened. But when you look at European exports imported into the U.S., that is -- has been pretty solid. But my final point, and I think it's what's led to our success the last 4, 5 quarters and will continue to lead to it, is that regardless of these challenges, we have to make challenges opportunities. And it's how we execute our investments, our strategic initiatives. If we continue to execute, we have proven, and we will continue to prove that we can have success in this mixed economic environment. So thank you for the question. I appreciate it."

And your question also mentioned fuel, and let me also remind you that we don't use fuel as a profit center, so it does impact the revenue line, but it's really not a big impact to what happens on the bottom line.

As you guys know, we've been in the same-day business for a long time with Express Critical and our world-class service parts logistics network, but certainly, there's a lot of buzz with e-commerce with same-day. And the real challenge is, obviously, low-cost e-commerce delivery because the consumers are looking for a low-cost option there. Currently, as you know, same-day for e-commerce has challenges with consolidating density in single piece stopped economics that create profitability issues as these companies look for the low-cost model. Deliv's goal is pretty unique; it consolidates multiple deliveries on one driver with pickups from multiple stores at a mall, for example. So we're looking to get some key learnings there. So we made that SEF investment in Deliv to better understand the economics demand and value proposition, and certainly, they're a leader in that particular space. At the same time, we believe that because the lion's share of shopping takes place in the late afternoon and evenings, there is much more demand for local next day, which really speaks to the latter part of your question about omnichannel, and we're very focused on those local store solutions that enable us to take evening orders that are dropped to these stores, let the stores fulfill them locally that same evening, and with the UPS late-night pickup, we can get next day or morning delivery. So we can make the delivery in as little as 10 to 12 hours from the time the order is dropped into checkout. And you combine that again with our industry-leading e-commerce platform, and we're really leading the way in the B2C e-commerce market. Thanks."

But certainly, all of our brick-and-mortar retailers are also in the e-commerce business. So it's about providing them a total solution. And omnichannel is a growing trend in the retail industry. We're seeing 30% year-over-year growth in UPS accounts in 2015, and that means, at the store level, we've got over 120,000 ship-from-store locations that are shipping or have the potential to ship. We're starting to see this phenomenal start to take place also outside the U.S. in our international business. So we think it's a real advantage for the retailers to optimize for a number of things. Sometimes, it's inventory saving the order because the order is not in the e-commerce fulfillment center, but it's in the store. Other times, it's to speed up the delivery. Other times, it's to get to the lowest cost option. So it's really about the whole platform that we offer with UPS My Choice, UPS Access Point, omnichannel, the SurePost, Returns, marketplace tools we provide, so on and so forth, that we're out there selling along with, obviously, the power of our whole product portfolio aligned to the integrated network that's really driving that success. And I guess the last thing I'd say is that it's kind of one of the questions earlier. We're about density creation, where we're really creating this density synthetically through all those e-commerce solutions that I just spoke of because all of them both drive customer and consumer convenience as well as density for UPS and you combine that with some of the things we're doing on the efficiency side with ORION and automation and things that Myron talked about, we really believe we've got a great platform for e-commerce, for both -- for retailers, consumers, and to continue to enhance UPS profitability."

This is the sixth con",896,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial result that demonstrate the power of UPS's diversified business model. 
Again, this quarter, the international segment led the way. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. 
The U.S. domestic business is growing operating profit, on higher B2C demand. Supply chain and freight continued to execute in a challenging macro environment.
Turning to the economy, the consumer market in the U.S. remains healthy and e-commerce forecast have been elevated for 2016. And we are seeing that growth. On the other hand, our B2B volume is affected by the continuing weakness in industrial production. In fact, global GDP and industrial production growth forecast have been downgraded slightly.
Delay in the droid [ph] drawdowns and soft export demand, likely will remain headwinds in the latter part of 2016. Additionally, we are mindful of the current political commentary on trade.
Increased trade not only bolsters business but also produces jobs here in the U.S. and abroad. Historically, following ratification of trade deals, we have seen about a 20% increase in U.S. exports to the countries involved. UPS is a steadfast proponent of trade, and supports agreements that minimize friction in the global supply chain. Trade legislation to accelerate economic expansion like the Trans-Pacific Partnership is vital to the health of the U.S. economy.
We encourage our political leaders to support and pass pending trade legislation.
Turning to our business, the strategic initiatives implemented over the last 2 years are ensuring we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial goals. We continue investing in 4 priority areas. We are adding network capacity; achieving greater efficiency through technology; deploying industry-specific solutions; and expanding in high-growth markets. 
In Europe, we have completed about 1/4 of the projects associated with our $2 billion capital investment plan.
During the second quarter, we announced new automated facilities in Belgium and France. In addition, we began an extensive program that would dramatically improve time and transit in our intra-Europe ground network, with some trade lanes improving by as much as 2 business days.
The majority of the benefits of these investments are still ahead of us, and would guarantee our position as a market leader in Europe for many years to come.
We're also investing heavily in our U.S. operations, and in a few minutes, Richard will update you on our technology and capacity projects. A pillar of our strategy in the U.S. is deploying industry-leading e-commerce capabilities that help online retailers take advantage of consumer trends. 
We recently released the fifth annual U.S. Post of the Online Shopper Study that highlights some of these changing trends. This year's survey revealed that most shoppers prefer home delivery, while also expressing an interest in an alternative delivery location. To provide more delivery options, UPS is expanding our Access Point Locker Program in several major U.S. markets. These automated pickup locations augment our more than 8,000 existing U.S. retail locations, and the more than 25,000 access points worldwide.
We are providing more convenient alternatives for urban online shoppers. New technology features were also introduced for the 24  million My Choice users in the U.S. For example, members can now use to follow My Delivery feature to track their package using real-time maps. These new capabilities are unique solutions to create value for our customers and further differentiate their online offering. 
Our investments are broad-based and targeted for the needs of customers in multiple industries. 
This quarter, we announced a specialized set of global services for health care companies performing clinical trials. And in Europe, we expanded our field stocking locations for medical device distributors.
UPS health care customers are gaining additional alternatives for shipping their sensitive materials globally, with the assurance of our guaranteed services. 
UPS also launched a market-leading partnership with SAP and Pass Radius [ph] to support end-to-end 3D printing solutions. This capability is linked to more than 60 UPS store locations and the urgent delivery capabilities of the UPS network.
This partnership is enabling UPS to expand into an adjacent market with great growth potential. We entered another adjacent industry in 2015, with the acquisition of asset light truckload brokerage services of Coyote Logistics. The combination of Coyote's capabilities and the UPS integrated network is providing customers with unmatched flexibility. Next month, we'll mark the one year anniversary of the acquisition.
The synergies in procurement, asset utilization and cost selling remain on track to achieve our 2017 targets.  In fact, cross-selling has already produced several great wins. 
Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to recognize a milestone we will achieve in August. 
UPS marks our 48th year in Germany and our entrance into Europe. Over that time, our business has matured rapidly and the European operations have become a cornerstone for our integrated network. 
To date, we operate in every European country, generating more than $6 billion in annual revenue, using our best-in-class, pan-European network. The expansion in Europe and the growth of our business around the world are made possible through the hard work and dedication of UPSers. 
As our strong momentum carries into the second half of the year, I want to thank all of our employees around the globe for helping make and maintain UPS as the market leader.
Now Richard will review the financial highlights."

The second quarter operating results demonstrate the value of our flexible business model as we had another solid quarter. Additionally, we are seeing high growth in the e-commerce and health care sectors, while the LTL and 40 [ph] markets remain challenged. 
Even with these dynamics, currency neutral revenue growth increased 4%, while fuel surcharges were drag of around 120 basis points. Second quarter earnings per share were in line with expectations. 
Our performance reflected the gains from our investment strategies, despite the mixed macro environment. 
The international segment outperformed, while U.S. domestic was on target. And finally, supply chain and freight was slightly below expectations. 
Now for some details by segment. U.S. domestic revenue increased 2.4%, as lower fuel surcharges reduced total revenue growth by about 100 basis points. Average daily volume increased 2.5%, led by Next Day Air products, which are up about 6%.
The Next Day Air gains were produced by customers of all sizes. Demand was consumer-based as more online retailers are providing faster delivery options to stay competitive. 
During the quarter, ground products increased 2.4% over last year, as B2C expansion outpaced B2B by more than 5:1. Base rates accelerated slightly from last quarter. Lower fuel surcharges reduced yield growth by about 100 basis points. The higher base rates were able to compensate for some of the changes in product and customer mix. 
Operating profit increased about 3% and operating margin expanded to 13.7%. Enhanced productivity and lower fuel costs resulted in operating cost per piece declining 0.02%. 
Once again, we have seen good improvement in our daily operating statistics despite the fact that delivery stops were up over 3%. ORION lowered driver miles by 0.03%. In addition, overall productivity gains continued as direct labor hours grew less than the volume. Our investment in ORION is bending the cost curve and we remain on track to complete Phase I implementation later in 2016.
We are continuing our multiyear investment strategy in hub automation in the U.S. operations. So far in 2016, we have announced new projects in California, Colorado, Illinois and Texas. These facilities are adding increased capacity and improved productivity. 
Now turning to the international segment, which had another remarkable quarter, with operating profit expanding more than 11%.
On a 2-year stack basis, operating profit is up more than 30%. Export daily volume increased almost 4% as improvements in all international regions offset slower U.S. exports. Europe led the way with significant gains in cross-border products and expert growth to all regions of the world.  In fact, the Europe to U.S. line grew with double-digit pace this quarter. 
Cycling out of the revenue management initiatives that we started in the last half of 2015, we are seeing good non-U.S. domestic daily shipment growth, which is up 4.5%, while at the same time, currency neutral revenue per piece increased 1%. 
We saw higher base rates, however, they were offset by changes in product and trade lane mix. Currency neutral revenue for the segment increased 1.5%. The lower fuel surcharge did impact revenue growth by about 170 basis points. The cost and productivity improvement held operating expenses down during the quarter. As a result of operating margin expanded to 19.9%.
The international segment had a record second quarter, with its highest second quarter delivery volume, operating profit and one of the best margins ever.
Now let's turn to look at supply chain and freight. Total revenue increased more than 13% due to the addition of Coyote Logistics. The new Truckload Brokerage revenue offset tonnage shortfalls in international boarding and the U.S. LTL business. 
Freight forwarding revenue and operating profit declined as we wrapped last year's rate actions. Cargo capacity continues to outpace demand, contributing to the weak market conditions I mentioned earlier. 
Expansion of the bi-sell rate and cost containment efforts led to the operating margin expansion. The unit remains focused on growing the more profitable middle market. 
In the distribution unit, we experienced strong revenue growth in the health care, aerospace and automotive sectors this quarter. In fact, this quarter, health care became the top revenue sector within the contract logistics business. 
Distribution operating profit jumped more than 10% and the margin expanded. The UPS Freight business remains disciplined on pricing, with revenue per hundredweight, up 3%. The unit's execution of revenue quality initiatives is driving higher shipment yields.  Total tonnage was lower by about 10%, due in part to the weak LTL market conditions.
Now to update you on our cash position. For the 6 months ended June 30, UPS generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow, a 13% increase over last year. And this was after spending $1 billion on CapEx.
The company paid just over $1.3 billion in dividends, an increase of almost 7%. In addition, we purchased over 13 million shares for more than $1.3 billion. Combined, we are on schedule to meet our return to shareholders goals we set for the year.
Looking at the rest of the year, our strong international performance and a return on investments we are making in our network give us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year earnings guidance of $570 million of $590 per share. As I discussed in February, we expect 2016 operating profit by quarter to follow the same pattern as it did in 2015. We still expect the fourth quarter operating profit growth to be above our annual guidance, somewhere between 9% and 11%. 
The additional work day between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the continued strength in e-commerce and our strategic investments position us well for another solid fourth quarter. 
Looking at the segments. In the U.S. domestic, we expect strong fourth quarter results. However, we will face tough comparisons in the third as a result of 1 less operating day and lower workers compensation costs last year. Therefore, we anticipate third quarter operating profit to be relatively flat year-over-year. 
For the international segment, we expect to continue into the second half of the year the progress we've made with operating profit growth in the 8% to 12% range. The supply chain and freight segment is where we anticipate the current market trends in international air freight in the U.S. trucking markets to remain solid. In addition, lower fuel surcharges will weigh on reported revenue growth. Therefore, total annual revenue growth for the segment should be around 10%.
Now let's look at taxes. The faster growth of our profits from the international segment means that we'll have a slightly lower tax rate in 2016. 
In summary, UPS's financial performance this year clearly demonstrates the value of our diverse business. We are bracing the opportunities created by the evolution of the global e-commerce marketplace as it expands beyond traditional retail base. We continue investing in strategic technologies, systems and expanded capacity. And by our execution, we are strengthening our leadership position. 
At the halfway point of the year, our business is responding well to the changing macro environment, and we are confident about the remainder of 2016.

So I want to remind you that even adjusting for that, we're still over a 17.5% margin, which is the highest in any player in the industry. And along that route, if you would call the currency we've been using in the multiyear hedge strategy. And what happened is in 2015, you saw a lot of volatility in the year-ago to the dollar from $1.35 down to $1.11. So 2017 will be a transition year, where we expect to have somewhere around $300 million impact for the change in the currency. We have moved to a different hedge strategy because of the volatility has increased so on currency where we're using more rolling average. So the year-over-year, going forward, we'll not see these dips if you see a lot of volatility in currency. But overall, that 17.5% is really a result of all the efforts that Jim and spoke really putting together and making adjustments in the network and at the same time, the quality of revenues that we're bringing in."

When you look at the third quarter specifically, there is 1 less work day and that does have an impact. As well as last year, we had some workers' comp credits that won't repeat this coming year. So when you take all of that into account, you have to kind of look at -- we did at the beginning of the year, understanding how the quarters would look. What we saw is that we need to make sure that you guys have transparency to understand that work day shifts some of the profit around. And if you look at this quarter, this quarter, we had a good improvement. And that improvement was really driven by the operational improvements, even though we saw so much volatility in fuel this year in the second quarter. We actually saw a 25% increase in fuel from April to June. So we were chasing the revenue.

It's not unusual and if our large shippers to make position, whether they're going to outsource or insource different parts of their business. Our focus is our diverse customer base, just makes its difficult for anyone company to be able to much lower density no matter their size. So with our integrated network, it creates efficiencies.

Mails have soften somewhat from first quarter to second quarter. The other side of it course, is what's happening internally, the things Myron has talked about in his operation.

But I think, to give a little bit of back drop, when I go back and just remind you of something here. Back in 2008, when we bought Links, it was our choice in the U.K. to strengthen that market. To feed the network, we talked about a lot and obviously also feed that country and the consumers. It took us a couple of years to get it done. We're done in 2010. And although we don't talk much about country level performance, I think, this question will give us pretty close to it. I could just tell you that from the years 2010 through '15, that U.K. operation for us, is best-in-class in many ways that we measure our business. So that acquisition and integration that took us about 3 years, has paid dividends for many, many, many years now. Brexit, we don't see changing that for that market quite frankly. Our job is to continue the priority number one, to take care of that economy and the consumers. Our employees and the shareholders and link it into that European network. So that's priority one. The issue obviously becomes what this pretrade agreement's set up to be. Don't forget a couple of things, I think, for my perspective. One, is there are many -- there is a number of free-trade agreements in that union as well. You've got the Norway model, you got the Swiss model and then you've got the EU model. So how it would unfold, we will see, but there are various models that could unfold. We've analyzed scenarios as far left as the WTO set up, all the way back to something close to what they have today. In the end, I think, our priority is to advise and advocate and support consumers as the free trade agreements are finalized in the coming years.

New opportunities that would help us to add more value to our customers. And then, any time that we can expand capability, them up within our network set, so it something that we don't feel strong about this would like to then -- would be that second great tier. And then, third, in all the trade lanes are shifting throughout the world, and so geographic presence is always important. Over the last few years, the emerging markets has been a place that put a lot of attention.

And then just lastly, I'll just say that as far as the synergies related to the acquisition, we were seeing some good work happening there, in procurement asset utilization, cross-selling and then organizational synergies that are benefiting both Coyote and also U.S. domestic and Supply Chain Freight segments, and we're on track.

And then I guess the last thing I'd say is that we continue to be bullish about access points, and we're expanding the current model and then as you probably saw, we invested in our locker expansion after some tests we ran last year, we're laying in 300 lockers into the United States in the -- your point about urban America and urban anywhere in the world, lots of consumers out there that have challenges receiving packages at home in urban areas and the access points and the lockers is a great resolution for them and it also benefits UPS."

It's a little early to talk about exactly what's going to happen, and that's really because there's a lot of things going on in volatility of currency too. So the year is, here we are in end of July, we have time still and if you tell me where in November the dollar or euro is or the sterling dollar, that will be a lot about the story of how much variation, that's why we say the plus or minus numbers. The important thing is that we have a plan, it will improve by segment. Our first priority is to reinvest in this business, because of the strength of the company. We continue to deliver the highest row we can the highest margin in the business. And our plan is to continue to do that.

238570,346563028,1017486,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results that demonstrate the power of UPS's diversified business model. Again, this quarter, the International segment led the way. This is the sixth cons",892,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results that demonstrate the power of UPS's diversified business model. Again, this quarter, the International segment led the way. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. The U.S. domestic business is growing operating profit on higher B2C demand. Supply chain and freight continued to execute in a challenging macro environment.
Turning to the economy, the consumer market in the U.S. remains healthy and e-commerce forecast have been elevated for 2016, and we are seeing that growth. On the other hand, our B2B volume is affected by the continuing weakness in industrial production. In fact, global GDP and industrial production growth forecast have been downgraded slightly. Delay in the drawdowns and soft export demand likely will remain headwinds in the latter part of 2016. Additionally, we are mindful of the current political commentary on trade.
Increased trade not only bolsters business but also produces jobs here in the U.S. and abroad. Historically, following ratification of trade deals, we have seen about a 20% increase in U.S. exports to the countries involved. UPS is a steadfast proponent of trade and supports agreements that minimize friction in the global supply chain. Trade legislation to accelerate economic expansion, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is vital to the health of the U.S. economy. We encourage our political leaders to support and pass pending trade legislation.
Turning to our business. The strategic initiatives implemented over the last 2 years are ensuring we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial goals. We continue investing in 4 priority areas. We are adding network capacity, achieving greater efficiency through technology, deploying industry-specific solutions and expanding in high-growth markets.
In Europe, we have completed about 1/4 of the projects associated with our $2 billion capital investment plan. During the second quarter, we announced new automated facilities in Belgium and France. In addition, we began an extensive program that would dramatically improve time and transit in our intra-Europe ground network, with some trade lanes improving by as much as 2 business days. The majority of the benefits of these investments are still ahead of us and would guarantee our position as a market leader in Europe for many years to come.
We're also investing heavily in our U.S. operations, and in a few minutes, Richard will update you on our technology and capacity projects. A pillar of our strategy in the U.S. is deploying industry-leading e-commerce capabilities that help online retailers take advantage of consumer trends.
We recently released the fifth annual U.S. Pulse of the Online Shopper study that highlights some of these changing trends. This year's survey revealed that most shoppers prefer home delivery, while also expressing an interest in an alternative delivery location. To provide more delivery options, UPS is expanding our Access Point locker program in several major U.S. markets. These automated pickup locations augment our more than 8,000 existing U.S. retail locations, and the more than 25,000 access points worldwide.
We're providing more convenient alternatives for urban online shoppers. New technology features were also introduced for the 24 million My Choice users in the U.S. For example, members can now use to follow My Delivery feature to track their package using real-time maps. These new capabilities are unique solutions to create value for our customers and further differentiate their online offering. Our investments are broad based and targeted for the needs of customers in multiple industries.
This quarter, we announced a specialized set of global services for health care companies performing clinical trials. And in Europe, we expanded our field stocking locations for medical device distributors. UPS health care customers are gaining additional alternatives for shipping their sensitive materials globally with the assurance of our guaranteed services.
UPS also launched a market-leading partnership with SAP and Fast Radius to support end-to-end 3D printing solutions. This capability is linked to more than 60 UPS store locations and the urgent delivery capabilities of the UPS network.
This partnership is enabling UPS to expand into an adjacent market with great growth potential. We entered another adjacent industry in 2015, with the acquisition of asset-light truckload brokerage services of Coyote Logistics. The combination of Coyote's capabilities and the UPS integrated network is providing customers with unmatched flexibility. Next month will mark the one year anniversary of the acquisition.
The synergies in procurement, asset utilization and cost selling remain on track to achieve our 2017 targets. In fact, cross-selling has already produced several great wins.
Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to recognize a milestone we will achieve in August. UPS marks our 48th year in Germany and our entrance into Europe. Over that time, our business has matured rapidly and the European operations have become a cornerstone for our integrated network.
To date, we operate in every European country, generating more than $6 billion in annual revenue using our best-in-class pan-European network. The expansion in Europe and the growth of our business around the world are made possible through the hard work and dedication of UPSers.
As our strong momentum carries into the second half of the year, I want to thank all of our employees around the globe for helping make and maintain UPS as the market leader.
Now Richard will review the financial highlights."

The second quarter operating results demonstrate the value of our flexible business model as we had another solid quarter. Additionally, we are seeing high growth in the e-commerce and health care sectors, while the LTL and forwarding markets remain challenged.
Even with these dynamics, currency neutral revenue growth increased 4%, while fuel surcharges were dragged at around 120 basis points. Second quarter earnings per share were in line with expectations. Our performance reflected the gains from our investment strategies despite the mixed macro environment. The international segment outperformed, while U.S. domestic was on target. And finally, supply chain and freight was slightly below expectations.
Now for some details by segment. U.S. domestic revenue increased 2.4%, as lower fuel surcharges reduced total revenue growth by about 100 basis points. Average daily volume increased 2.5%, led by Next Day Air products, which were up about 6%. The Next Day Air gains were produced by customers of all sizes. Demand was consumer based as more online retailers are providing faster delivery options to stay competitive.
During the quarter, ground products increased 2.4% over last year, as B2C expansion outpaced B2B by more than 5:1. Base rates accelerated slightly from last quarter. Lower fuel surcharges reduced yield growth by about 100 basis points. The higher base rates were able to compensate for some of the changes in product and customer mix. Operating profit increased about 3% and operating margin expanded to 13.7%. Enhanced productivity and lower fuel costs resulted in operating cost per piece declining 0.02%.
Once again, we have seen good improvements in our daily operating statistics. Despite the fact that delivery stops were up over 3%, ORION lowered driver miles by 0.03%. In addition, overall productivity gains continued as direct labor hours grew less than the volume. Our investment in ORION is bending the cost curve, and we remain on track to complete Phase I implementation later in 2016.
We are continuing our multiyear investment strategy in hub automation in the U.S. operations. So far in 2016, we have announced new projects in California, Colorado, Illinois and Texas. These facilities are adding increased capacity and improved productivity.
Now turning to the International segment, which had another remarkable quarter, with operating profit expanding more than 11%. On a 2-year stack basis, operating profit is up more than 30%. Export daily volume increased almost 4% as improvements in all international regions offset slower U.S. exports. Europe led the way with significant gains in cross-border products and export growth to all regions of the world. In fact, the Europe to U.S. lane grew with double-digit pace this quarter.
Cycling out of the revenue management initiatives that we started in the last half of 2015, we have seen good non-U.S. domestic daily shipment growth, which is up 4.5%, while at the same time, currency neutral revenue per piece increased 1%.
We saw higher base rates. However, they were offset by changes in product and trade lane mix. Currency neutral revenue for the segment increased 1.5%. The lower fuel surcharge did impact revenue growth by about 170 basis points. The cost and productivity improvements held operating expenses down during the quarter. As a result of operating margin expanded to 19.9%. The international segment had a record second quarter, with its highest second quarter delivery volume, operating profit and one of the best margins ever.
Now let's turn and look at supply chain and freight. Total revenue increased more than 13% due to the addition of Coyote Logistics. The new truckload brokerage revenue offset tonnage shortfalls in international forwarding and the U.S. LTL business. Freight forwarding revenue and operating profit declined as we wrapped last year's rate actions. Cargo capacity continues to outpace demand, contributing to the weak market conditions I mentioned earlier. Expansion of the buy-sell rate and cost containment efforts led to the operating margin expansion. The unit remains focused on growing the more profitable middle market.
In the distribution unit, we experienced strong revenue growth in the health care, aerospace and automotive sectors this quarter. In fact, this quarter, health care became the top revenue sector within the contract logistics business.
Distribution operating profit jumped more than 10% and the margin expanded. The UPS Freight business remains disciplined on pricing, with revenue per hundredweight up 3%. The unit's execution of revenue quality initiatives is driving higher shipment yields. Total tonnage was lower by about 10%, due in part to the weak LTL market conditions.
Now to update you on our cash position. For the 6 months ended June 30, UPS generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow, a 13% increase over last year. And this was after spending $1 billion on CapEx. The company paid just over $1.3 billion in dividends, an increase of almost 7%. In addition, we purchased over 13 million shares for more than $1.3 billion. Combined, we are on schedule to meet our return to shareholders goals we set for the year.
Looking at the rest of the year, our strong international performance and the return on investments we are making in our network give us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year earnings guidance of $5.70 to $5.90 per share. As I discussed in February, we expect 2016 operating profit by quarter to follow the same pattern as it did in 2015. We still expect the fourth quarter operating profit growth to be above our annual guidance, somewhere between 9% and 11%.
The additional workday between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the continued strength in e-commerce and our strategic investments position us well for another solid fourth quarter.
Looking at the segments. In the U.S. domestic, we expect strong fourth quarter results. However, we will face tough comparisons in the third as a result of 1 less operating day and lower workers' compensation costs last year. Therefore, we anticipate third quarter operating profit to be relatively flat year-over-year.
For the International segment, we expect to continue into the second half of the year the progress we've made with operating profit growth in the 8% to 12% range. The supply chain and freight segment is where we anticipate the current market trends in international air freight and the U.S. trucking markets to remain solid. In addition, lower fuel surcharges will weigh on reported revenue growth. Therefore, total annual revenue growth for the segment should be around 10%.
Now let's look at taxes. The faster growth of our profits from the International segment means that we'll have a slightly lower tax rate in 2016.
In summary, UPS's financial performance this year clearly demonstrates the value of our diverse business. We are embracing the opportunities created by the evolution of the global e-commerce marketplace as it expands beyond traditional retail base. We continue investing in strategic technologies, systems and expanded capacity. And by our execution, we are strengthening our leadership position.
At the halfway point of the year, our business is responding well to the changing macro environment, and we are confident about the remainder of 2016.

I do want to point out that the margin of 19.9% is very strong, and it does include that multiyear hedge that we talked about on the call the last few quarters. So I want to remind you that even adjusting for that, we're still over a 17.5% margin, which is the highest in any player in the industry. And along that route, if you would call the currency, we've been using multiyear hedge strategy. And what happened is in 2015, you saw a lot of volatility in the year ago to the dollar from $1.35 down to $1.11. So 2017 will be a transition year where we expect to have somewhere around $300 million impact for the change in the currency. We have moved to a different hedge strategy because the volatility has increased so much on currency where we're using more rolling average so that year-over-year, going forward, we'll not see these dips if you see a lot of volatility in currency. But overall, that 17.5% is really a result of all the efforts that Jim just spoke, really putting together and making adjustments in the network and at the same time, the quality of revenues that we're bringing in."

But over the year to year, we kind of guided that we continue to see improvement, expect to see going improvement as well. When you look at the third quarter specifically, there is 1 less workday, and that does have an impact. As well as last year, we had some workers' comp credits that won't repeat this coming year. So when you take all of that into account, you have to kind of look at -- and we did at the beginning of the year, understanding how the quarters would look. And what we saw is that we need to make sure that you guys had some transparency to understand that workday shifts some of the profit around. And if you look at this quarter, this quarter, we had a good improvement. And that improvement was really driven by the operational improvements, even though we saw so much volatility in fuel this year in the second quarter. We actually saw a 25% increase in fuel from April to June, so we were chasing the revenue. But when you step back and look at what we expect for the fourth quarter, we're going to have a strong fourth quarter.

The good part about this year is even with that softness, we're putting initiatives and investments in that are bringing returns, and that's why we're able to leave our guidance right where we expect it to be at the first part of the year. That being said, we are in a multiyear process of investments both in the ORION that David talked about in his talk as well as the hub automation and how that will continue. So all of those things are about putting together the multiyear process of where we're going to improve the margin that we laid out really at the end of '14. We're putting those investments in. Those investments are paying the return we expected. And we just expect, as we get more of that integrated into our network, we'll continue to see the benefits of that.

And as a large e-commerce shipper takes over more of its own delivery within the denser cities, does that change the density equation at all and the need to retrofit all of the regional sort facilities? And how is that project progressing? And what have you learned thus far in terms of benefits heading into another peak?
So Nate got his bang for his buck in that question. And I will start and address the first part of it, then we'll turn it over to Myron to talk to a little bit about the retrofit and peak. And it's not unusual for any of our large shippers to make decisions, whether they're going to outsource or insource different parts of their business. Our focus is our diverse customer base, just makes it so difficult for any one company to be able to match our density, no matter their size. So with our integrated network, it creates efficiencies. We're constantly increasing our value proposition. So we always believe that our -- even our large customers would have more density with us than going in another direction. So I feel very confident in our strategy from that regard. Why don't you talk about the retrofit and peak preparation, Myron?"

And we will continue to see the benefits that we have alluded to earlier, more than 8 miles per driver in savings. For example, this quarter, we saw our delivery stops grow more than 3% on 2.5% average daily volume gains. However, we were able to reduce our miles driven by 0.3%, which helped keep our costs per piece down by 0.2%. So as the volume continues to grow, our wages are growing at a lesser pace than the volume. So we're continuing to see benefits. And there -- that's Phase 1. Phase 2 will actually begin in the back half of this year, well into 2017, and we hope to have this Phase 2 completed by 2017, but we hope to see additional benefits from ORION. And again, that's just one of many technology projects that we'll continue to roll out that should help us continue to bend the cost curves. So we're really pleased with what we are seeing."

The first is the external and what's happening on the external measures because that -- our volume does have some correlation, especially when you get to B2B to what's happening with both domestic GDP, things like industrial production and things like that, and they all have softened somewhat from first quarter to second quarter. The other side of it, of course, is what's happening internally, the things Myron has talked about in his operation. And those improvements that we're seeing. So we put all that together, and we say do we have economic -- assumptions are realistic? And then how are we benefiting from the initiatives that we've implemented? And so we think we've balanced all that, and that's what we're seeing in 2016. We're seeing a nice balance where we're making up for some softness externally with what we're doing internally, and that's allowed us to grow our earnings per share for 6 quarters in a row, and we'll continue to work those plans for guidance going forward."

I think I get this question every day, quite frankly, over the last couple of months. But I think to give a little bit of backdrop, when I go back to -- and just remind you of something here. Back in 2008,",392,"So David, thanks for that one and Helane as well. I think I get this question every day, quite frankly, over the last couple of months. But I think to give a little bit of backdrop, when I go back to -- and just remind you of something here. Back in 2008, when we bought Lynx, it was our choice in the U.K. to strengthen that market. To feed the network, we talked about a lot and obviously, also feed that country and the consumers. It took us a couple of years to get it done. We're done in 2010. And although we don't talk much about country-level performance, I think, this question will get us pretty close to it. I could just tell you that from the years 2010 through '15, that U.K. operation for us is best in class in many ways that we measure our business. So that acquisition and integration, that took us about 3 years, has paid dividends for many, many, many years now. Brexit, we don't see changing that for that market quite frankly. Our job is to continue that priority, number one, to take care of that economy and the consumers, our employees and the shareholders and link it into that European network. So that's priority 1. The issue obviously becomes what this free trade agreement's set up to be. Don't forget a couple of things, I think, for my perspective. One is, there are many -- there is a number of free trade agreements in that union as well. You've got the Norway model, you got the Swiss model and then you've got the EU model. So how it unfolds, we will see, but there are various models that could unfold. We've analyzed scenarios as far left as the WTO setup, all the way back at something close to what they have today. In the end, I think our priority is to advise and advocate and support consumers as the free trade agreements are finalized in the coming years, and then continue to whatever happens, support that market and the network, and I think we could easily say there will be somewhat more complexity. But I think our job is to simplify the complex in the network for consumers and continue the great service, and that's what we plan to do as that unfolds."

First is new opportunities, new opportunities that would help us add more value to our customers and then, any time that we can expand capability within our networks. So if it's something that we don't feel as strong about as we'd like to, then that would be that second criteria. And then, third, the trade lanes are shifting throughout the world, and so geographic presence is always important. Over the last few years, the emerging markets has been a place that we put a lot of attention on. So adjacent markets, which is what we did with the Coyote acquisition, is keen on our mind.

On Access Points, right now, we'll probably finish the year at about 27,000 access points, globally and we continue to expand there. So yes, so when you think about bending the cost curve, I guess, the 1/10 contributes to about $200 million in bottom line costs, if we -- when we increase the density by 1/10. And then I guess, the last thing I'll say is that we continue to be bullish about Access Points, and we're expanding the current model.

The -- certainly, the e-commerce growth drives significant growth in our ground business and our SurePost business and then on the overnight and deferred side, mainly in the saver and the second day air business. But the key here is that we've got this great portfolio. So when a customer absolutely has to have it, they're usually willing to pay for that, and we have the full gamut of services to get those goods to them when they want it. And then we have the more economical alternatives along with some of the other value adds like UPS Access Point, UPS My Choice and omnichannel that really drive those retailers and those consumers to UPS."

And I think the important thing is we have said that as we move forward, we have continued initiatives that will continue to improve the operating margin. That being said, obviously, different segments, things will happen and growth rates might have to be adjusted. It's a little early to talk about exactly what's going to happen, and that's really because there's a lot of things going on in volatility of currency too. So the year is -- here we are in end of July, we have time still. And if you tell me where, in November, the dollar-euro is or the sterling-dollar, that will be a lot about the story of how much variation. That's why we say the plus or minus numbers. The important thing is that we have a plan. It will improve by segment. Our first priority is to reinvest in this business because of the strength of the company. We continue to deliver the highest ROIC and the highest margins in the business, and our plan is to continue to do that. And we will continue to do that while at the same time, having dividends of over 3% or around 3%. So as we get closer to 2017, I'll guide you appropriately, but we are in the middle of putting all those plans together. And then your second question around the percentage of our share of any one customer, it's something that we -- we obviously continue to win customers based on our strategy. To win customers, we don't come in any one customer, but you can see our volume growth for the U.S. was up about 2.5%. You just -- for fuel, we saw revenue growth of about 3.4%. So it was a strong quarter. We laid out for you how we think the fourth quarter is going to look, and that's another strong quarter. And we're going to end up delivering on the guidance numbers that we gave you at the beginning of the year. And I think that's the most important thing."

I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results that demonstrate the power of UPS's diversified business model. Again, this quarter, the International segment led the way. This is the sixth cons",888,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results that demonstrate the power of UPS's diversified business model. Again, this quarter, the International segment led the way. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. The U.S. domestic business is growing operating profit on higher B2C demand. Supply chain and freight continued to execute in a challenging macro environment.
Turning to the economy, the consumer market in the U.S. remains healthy and e-commerce forecast have been elevated for 2016, and we are seeing that growth. On the other hand, our B2B volume is affected by the continuing weakness in industrial production. In fact, global GDP and industrial production growth forecast have been downgraded slightly. Delayed inventory drawdowns and soft export demand likely will remain headwinds in the latter part of 2016. Additionally, we are mindful of the current political commentary on trade.
Increased trade not only bolsters business but also produces jobs here in the U.S. and abroad. Historically, following ratification of trade deals, we have seen about a 20% increase in U.S. exports to the countries involved. UPS is a steadfast proponent of trade and supports agreements that minimize friction in the global supply chain. Trade legislation to accelerate economic expansion, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is vital to the health of the U.S. economy. We encourage our political leaders to support and pass pending trade legislation.
Turning to our business. The strategic initiatives implemented over the last 2 years are ensuring we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial goals. We continue investing in 4 priority areas. We are adding network capacity, achieving greater efficiency through technology, deploying industry-specific solutions and expanding in high-growth markets.
In Europe, we have completed about 1/4 of the projects associated with our $2 billion capital investment plan. During the second quarter, we announced new automated facilities in Belgium and France. In addition, we began an extensive program that would dramatically improve time and transit in our intra-Europe ground network, with some trade lanes improving by as much as 2 business days. The majority of the benefits of these investments are still ahead of us and would guarantee our position as a market leader in Europe for many years to come.
We're also investing heavily in our U.S. operations, and in a few minutes, Richard will update you on our technology and capacity projects. A pillar of our strategy in the U.S. is deploying industry-leading e-commerce capabilities that help online retailers take advantage of consumer trends.
We recently released the fifth annual U.S. Pulse of the Online Shopper study that highlights some of these changing trends. This year's survey revealed that most shoppers prefer home delivery, while also expressing an interest in an alternative delivery location. To provide more delivery options, UPS is expanding our Access Point locker program in several major U.S. markets. These automated pickup locations augment our more than 8,000 existing U.S. retail locations, and the more than 25,000 access points worldwide.
We're providing more convenient alternatives for urban online shoppers. New technology features were also introduced for the 24 million My Choice users in the U.S. For example, members can now use the Follow My Delivery feature to track their package using real-time maps. These new capabilities are unique solutions to create value for our customers and further differentiate their online offering. Our investments are broad based and targeted for the needs of customers in multiple industries.
This quarter, we announced a specialized set of global services for health care companies performing clinical trials. And in Europe, we expanded our field stocking locations for medical device distributors. UPS health care customers are gaining additional alternatives for shipping their sensitive materials globally with the assurance of our guaranteed services.
UPS also launched a market-leading partnership with SAP and Fast Radius to support end-to-end 3D printing solutions. This capability is linked to more than 60 UPS store locations and the urgent delivery capabilities of the UPS network.
This partnership is enabling UPS to expand into an adjacent market with great growth potential. We entered another adjacent industry in 2015, with the acquisition of asset-light truckload brokerage services of Coyote Logistics. The combination of Coyote's capabilities and the UPS integrated network is providing customers with unmatched flexibility. Next month will mark the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition.
The synergies in procurement, asset utilization and cross-selling remain on track to achieve our 2017 targets. In fact, cross-selling has already produced several great wins.
Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to recognize a milestone we will achieve in August. UPS marks our 40th year in Germany and our entrance into Europe. Over that time, our business has matured rapidly and the European operations have become a cornerstone for our integrated network.
Today, we operate in every European country, generating more than $6 billion in annual revenue using our best-in-class pan-European network. The expansion in Europe and the growth of our business around the world are made possible through the hard work and dedication of UPSers.
As our strong momentum carries into the second half of the year, I want to thank all of our employees around the globe for helping make and maintain UPS as the market leader.
Now Richard will review the financial highlights."

The second quarter operating results demonstrate the value of our flexible business model as we had another solid quarter. Additionally, we are seeing high growth in the e-commerce and health care sectors, while the LTL and forwarding markets remain challenged.
Even with these dynamics, currency neutral revenue growth increased 4%, while fuel surcharges were a drag of around 120 basis points. Second quarter earnings per share were in line with expectations. Our performance reflected the gains from our investment strategies despite the mixed macro environment. The international segment outperformed, while U.S. domestic was on target. And finally, supply chain and freight was slightly below expectations.
Now for some details by segment. U.S. domestic revenue increased 2.4%, as lower fuel surcharges reduced total revenue growth by about 100 basis points. Average daily volume increased 2.5%, led by Next Day Air products, which were up about 6%. The Next Day Air gains were produced by customers of all sizes. Demand was consumer based as more online retailers are providing faster delivery options to stay competitive.
During the quarter, ground products increased 2.4% over last year, as B2C expansion outpaced B2B by more than 5:1. Base rates accelerated slightly from last quarter. Lower fuel surcharges reduced yield growth by about 100 basis points. The higher base rates were able to compensate for some of the changes in product and customer mix. Operating profit increased about 3% and operating margin expanded to 13.7%. Enhanced productivity and lower fuel costs resulted in operating cost per piece declining 0.2%.
Once again, we have seen good improvements in our daily operating statistics. Despite the fact that delivery stops were up over 3%, ORION lowered driver miles by 0.3%. In addition, overall productivity gains continued as direct labor hours grew less than the volume. Our investment in ORION is bending the cost curve, and we remain on track to complete Phase I implementation later in 2016.
We are continuing our multiyear investment strategy in hub automation in the U.S. operations. So far in 2016, we have announced new projects in California, Colorado, Illinois and Texas. These facilities are adding increased capacity and improved productivity.
Now turning to the International segment, which had another remarkable quarter, with operating profit expanding more than 11%. On a 2-year stack basis, operating profit is up more than 30%. Export daily volume increased almost 4% as improvements in all international regions offset slower U.S. exports. Europe led the way with significant gains in cross-border products and export growth to all regions of the world. In fact, the Europe to U.S. lane grew at double-digit pace this quarter.
Cycling out of the revenue management initiatives that we started in the last half of 2015, we have seen good non-U.S. domestic daily shipment growth, which is up 4.5%, while at the same time, currency neutral revenue per piece increased 1%.
We saw higher base rates. However, they were offset by changes in product and trade lane mix. Currency neutral revenue for the segment increased 1.5%. The lower fuel surcharge did impact revenue growth by about 170 basis points. The cost and productivity improvements held operating expenses down during the quarter. As a result of operating margin expanded to 19.9%. The international segment had a record second quarter, with its highest second quarter delivery volume, operating profit and one of the best margins ever.
Now let's turn and look at supply chain and freight. Total revenue increased more than 13% due to the addition of Coyote Logistics. The new truckload brokerage revenue offset tonnage shortfalls in international forwarding and the U.S. LTL business. Freight forwarding revenue and operating profit declined as we wrapped last year's rate actions. Cargo capacity continues to outpace demand, contributing to the weak market conditions I mentioned earlier. Expansion of the buy-sell rate and cost containment efforts led to the operating margin expansion. The unit remains focused on growing the more profitable middle market.
In the distribution unit, we experienced strong revenue growth in the health care, aerospace and automotive sectors this quarter. In fact, this quarter, health care became the top revenue sector within the contract logistics business.
Distribution operating profit jumped more than 10% and the margin expanded. The UPS Freight business remains disciplined on pricing, with revenue per hundredweight up 3%. The unit's execution of revenue quality initiatives is driving higher shipment yields. Total tonnage was lower by about 10%, due in part to the weak LTL market conditions.
Now to update you on our cash position. For the 6 months ended June 30, UPS generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow, a 13% increase over last year. And this was after spending $1 billion on CapEx. The company paid just over $1.3 billion in dividends, an increase of almost 7%. In addition, we purchased over 13 million shares for more than $1.3 billion. Combined, we are on schedule to meet our return to shareholders goals we set for the year.
Looking at the rest of the year, our strong international performance and the return on investments we are making in our network give us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year earnings guidance of $5.70 to $5.90 per share. As I discussed in February, we expect 2016 operating profit by quarter to follow the same pattern as it did in 2015. We still expect the fourth quarter operating profit growth to be above our annual guidance, somewhere between 9% and 11%.
The additional workday between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the continued strength in e-commerce and our strategic investments position us well for another solid fourth quarter.
Looking at the segments. In the U.S. domestic, we expect strong fourth quarter results. However, we will face tough comparisons in the third as a result of 1 less operating day and lower workers' compensation costs last year. Therefore, we anticipate third quarter operating profit to be relatively flat year-over-year.
For the International segment, we expect to continue into the second half of the year the progress we've made with operating profit growth in the 8% to 12% range. The supply chain and freight segment is where we anticipate the current market trends in international air freight and the U.S. trucking markets to remain solid. In addition, lower fuel surcharges will weigh on reported revenue growth. Therefore, total annual revenue growth for the segment should be around 10%.
Now let's look at taxes. The faster growth of our profits from the International segment means that we'll have a slightly lower tax rate in 2016.
In summary, UPS's financial performance this year clearly demonstrates the value of our diverse business. We are embracing the opportunities created by the evolution of the global e-commerce marketplace as it expands beyond traditional retail base. We continue investing in strategic technologies, systems and expanded capacity. And by our execution, we are strengthening our leadership position.
At the halfway point of the year, our business is responding well to the changing macro environment, and we are confident about the remainder of 2016.

I do want to point out that the margin of 19.9% is very strong, and it does include that multiyear hedge that we talked about on the call the last few quarters. So I want to remind you that even adjusting for that, we're still over a 17.5% margin, which is the highest in any player in the industry. And along that route, if you recall, the currency, we've been using multiyear hedge strategy. And what happened is in 2015, you saw a lot of volatility in the year ago to the dollar from $1.35 down to $1.11. So 2017 will be a transition year where we expect to have somewhere around $300 million impact for the change in the currency. We have moved to a different hedge strategy because the volatility has increased so much on currency where we're using more rolling average so that year-over-year, going forward, we'll not see these dips if you see a lot of volatility in currency. But overall, that 17.5% is really a result of all the efforts that Jim just spoke, really putting together and making adjustments in the network and at the same time, the quality of revenues that we're bringing in."

But over the year to year, we kind of guided that we continue to see improvement, expect to see going improvement as well. When you look at the third quarter specifically, there is 1 less workday, and that does have an impact. As well as last year, we had some workers' comp credits that won't repeat this coming year. So when you take all of that into account, you have to kind of look at -- and we did at the beginning of the year, understanding how the quarters would look. And what we saw is that we need to make sure that you guys had some transparency to understand that workday shifts some of the profit around. And if you look at this quarter, this quarter, we had a good improvement. And that improvement was really driven by the operational improvements, even though we saw so much volatility in fuel this year in the second quarter. We actually saw a 25% increase in fuel from April to June, so we were chasing the revenue. But when you step back and look at what we expect for the fourth quarter, we're going to have a strong fourth quarter. We're putting our plans in place and we look forward to completing 2016, very much like we told you we would at the beginning of the year."

That being said, we are in a multiyear process of investments both in the ORION that David talked about in his talk as well as the hub automation and how that will continue. So all of those things are about putting together the multiyear process of where we're going to improve the margin that we laid out really at the end of '14. We're putting those investments in. Those investments are paying the return we expected. And we just expect, as we get more of that integrated into our network, we'll continue to see the benefits of that.

And as a large e-commerce shipper takes over more of its own delivery within the denser cities, does that change the density equation at all and the need to retrofit all of the regional sort facilities? And how is that project progressing? And what have you learned thus far in terms of benefits heading into another peak?
So Nate got his bang for his buck in that question. And I will start and address the first part of it, then I'm going to turn it over to Myron to talk to a little bit about the retrofit and peak. And it's not unusual for any of our large shippers to make decisions, whether they're going to outsource or insource different parts of their business. Our focus is our diverse customer base, just makes it so difficult for any one company to be able to match our density, no matter their size. So with our integrated network, it creates efficiencies. We're constantly increasing our value proposition. So we always believe that our -- even our large customers would have more density with us than going in another direction. So I feel very confident in our strategy from that regard. Why don't you talk about the retrofit and peak preparation, Myron?"

We are investing in our network, and it's pulling through when you see the reduction in miles and things like that.

The first is the external and what's happening on the external measures because that -- our volume does have some correlation, especially when you get to B2B to what's happening with both domestic GDP, things like industrial production and things like that, and they all have softened somewhat from first quarter to second quarter. The other side of it, of course, is what's happening internally, the things Myron has talked about in his operation. And those improvements that we're seeing. So we put all that together, and we say do we have economic -- assumptions are realistic? And then how are we benefiting from the initiatives that we've implemented? And so we think we've balanced all that, and that's what we're seeing in 2016.

But I think to give a little bit of backdrop, when I go back to -- and just remind you of something here. Back in 2008, when we bought Lynx, it was our choice in the U.K. to strengthen that market. To feed the network, we talked about a lot and obviously, also feed that country and the consumers. It took us a couple of years to get it done. We're done in 2010. And although we don't talk much about country-level performance, I think, this question will get us pretty close to it. I could just tell you that from the years 2010 through '15, that U.K. operation for us is best in class in many ways that we measure our business. So that acquisition and integration, that took us about 3 years, has paid dividends for many, many, many years now. Brexit, we don't see changing that for that market quite frankly. Our job is to continue that priority, number one, to take care of that economy and the consumers, our employees and the shareholders and link it into that European network. So that's priority 1. The issue obviously becomes what this free trade agreement's set up to be. Don't forget a couple of things, I think, for my perspective. One is, there are many -- there is a number of free trade agreements in that union as well. You've got the Norway model, you got the Swiss model and then you've got the EU model. So how it unfolds, we will see, but there are various models that could unfold. We've analyzed scenarios as far left as the WTO setup, all the way back to something close to what they have today. In the end, I think our priority is to advise and advocate and support consumers as the free trade agreements are finalized in the coming years, and then continue to whatever happens, support that market and the network, and I think we could easily say there will be somewhat more complexity. But I think our job is to simplify the complex in the network for consumers and continue the great service, and that's what we plan to do as that unfolds."

But from an acquisition standpoint, we have an active process. And we're really looking in what I'll call just 3 general buckets that we're always taking a look at. First is new opportunities, new opportunities that would help us add more value to our customers and then, any time that we can expand capability within our networks. So if it's something that we don't feel as strong about as we'd like to, then that would be that second criteria. And then, third, the trade lanes are shifting throughout the world, and so geographic presence is always important. Over the last few years, the emerging markets has been a place that we put a lot of attention on. So adjacent markets, which is what we did with the Coyote acquisition, is keen on our mind. But at the end of the day, whether it's organic growth or it's inorganic growth, our focus is on growing this business and at the same time, having profitable returns. So from a Coyote standpoint, Alan?"

Certainly, their customers and our customers and new customers are responding very well to the new Coyote and UPS combined value prop. For the quarter, we continue to see strong year-over-year growth in loads. And our gross margin is also expanded for the quarter. As I think we all know, the truckload market remained soft. But certainly, this asset-light model has provided some great flexibility in the up and down cycles. And then just lastly, I'll just say that as far as the synergies related to the acquisition, we're seeing some good work happening there in procurement, asset utilization, cross-selling and then organizational synergies that are benefiting both Coyote and also our U.S. domestic and Supply Chain Freight segments and we're on track. And now I guess, I'll turn it over to Myron to talk a little bit about the LTL."

The UPS Access Points, UPS My Choice, the Synchronized Delivery Solutions and certainly, SurePost Redirect, which is now at about the 30% of those packages are being redirected back into the Ground network. On Access Points, right now, we'll probably finish the year at about 27,000 access points, globally and we continue to expand there. So yes, so when you think about bending the cost curve, I guess, the 1/10 contributes to about $200 million in bottom line costs, if we -- when we increase the density by 1/10. And then I guess, the last thing I'll say is that we continue to be bullish about Access Points, and we're expanding the current model. And as you probably saw, we invested in our locker expansion after some tests we ran last year, and we're laying in 300 lockers into the United States in the -- your point about urban America and urban anywhere in the world, lots of consumers out there who have challenges receiving packages at home in urban areas and the Access Points and the lockers is a great solution for them and it also benefits UPS."

Certainly, the network that we have in place has served us well for many years. This quarter, overall, I think the block hours were down about 0.5%. You saw in the early opening comments of the call this morning and the releases that the export volume continues to grow at UPS, and that includes our Asia Pacific region as well as our Latin America region at the same time. So we continue on. One of our big focuses out there is our intra-Asia network. It's a great opportunity for us. We've laid that in, in 2010. We think it has lots more upside.

They're a leader in this new space, and we're excited to learn more from that. The other thing I would say is that Coyote is really a technology platform that's doing the same thing. It's matching up excess capacity in the marketplace from thousands upon thousands of carriers that have backhaul excess capacity. And we're providing a similar service with Coyote. So we are excited about that in the heavier truckload type business as well as for the prospects potentially on the pickup and delivery side."

That being said, obviously, different segments, things will happen and growth rates might have to be adjusted. It's a little early to talk about exactly what's going to happen, and that's really because there's a lot of things going on, and volatility of currency too. So the year is -- here we are in end of July, we have time still. And if you tell me where, in November, the dollar-euro is or the sterling-dollar, that will be a lot about the story of how much variation. That's why we say the plus or minus numbers. The important thing is that we have a plan. It will improve by segment. Our first priority is to reinvest in this business because of the strength of the company. We continue to deliver the highest ROIC and the highest margins in the business, and our plan is to continue to do that. And we will continue to do that while at the same time, having dividends of over 3% or around 3%. So as we get closer to 2017, I'll guide you appropriately, but we are in the middle of putting all those plans together. And then your second question around the percentage of our share of any one customer, it's something that we -- we obviously continue to win customers based on our strategy. To win customers, we don't come in any one customer, but you can see our volume growth for the U.S. was up about 2.5%. You adjust for fuel, we saw revenue growth of about 3.4%. So it was a strong quarter. We laid out for you how we think the fourth quarter is going to look, and that's another strong quarter.

This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. The U.S. domestic business is growing operating profit on higher B2C demand. Supply chain and freight continued to execute in a challenging macro environment.
Turning to the economy, the consumer market in the U.S. remains healthy and e-commerce forecast have been elevated for 2016, and we are seeing that growth. On the other hand, our B2B volume is affected by the continuing weakness in industrial production. In fact, global GDP and industrial production growth forecast have been downgraded slightly. Delayed inventory drawdowns and soft export demand likely will remain headwinds in the latter part of 2016. Additionally, we are mindful of the current political commentary on trade.
Increased trade not only bolsters business but also produces jobs here in the U.S. and abroad. Historically, following ratification of trade deals, we have seen about a 20% increase in U.S. exports to the countries involved. UPS is a steadfast proponent of trade and supports agreements that minimize friction in the global supply chain. Trade legislation to accelerate economic expansion, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is vital to the health of the U.S. economy. We encourage our political leaders to support and pass pending trade legislation.
Turning to our business. The strategic initiatives implemented over the last 2 years are ensuring we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial goals. We continue investing in 4 priority areas. We are adding network capacity, achieving greater efficiency through technology, deploying industry-specific solutions and expanding in high-growth markets.
In Europe, we have completed about 1/4 of the projects associated with our $2 billion capital investment plan. During the second quarter, we announced new automated facilities in Belgium and France. In addition, we began an extensive program that would dramatically improve time and transit in our intra-Europe ground network, with some trade lanes improving by as much as 2 business days. The majority of the benefits of these investments are still ahead of us and would guarantee our position as a market leader in Europe for many years to come.
We're also investing heavily in our U.S. operations, and in a few minutes, Richard will update you on our technology and capacity projects. A pillar of our strategy in the U.S. is deploying industry-leading e-commerce capabilities that help online retailers take advantage of consumer trends.
We recently released the fifth annual U.S. Pulse of the Online Shopper study that highlights some of these changing trends. This year's survey revealed that most shoppers prefer home delivery, while also expressing an interest in an alternative delivery location. To provide more delivery options, UPS is expanding our Access Point locker program in several major U.S. markets. These automated pickup locations augment our more than 8,000 existing U.S. retail locations, and the more than 25,000 access points worldwide.
We're providing more convenient alternatives for urban online shoppers. New technology features were also introduced for the 24 million My Choice users in the U.S. For example, members can now use the Follow My Delivery feature to track their package using real-time maps. These new capabilities are unique solutions to create value for our customers and further differentiate their online offering. Our investments are broad based and targeted for the needs of customers in multiple industries.
This quarter, we announced a specialized set of global services for health care companies performing clinical trials. And in Europe, we expanded our field stocking locations for medical device distributors. UPS health care customers are gaining additional alternatives for shipping their sensitive materials globally with the assurance of our guaranteed services.
UPS also launched a market-leading partnership with SAP and Fast Radius to support end-to-end 3D printing solutions. This capability is linked to more than 60 UPS store locations and the urgent delivery capabilities of the UPS network.
This partnership is enabling UPS to expand into an adjacent market with great growth potential. We entered another adjacent industry in 2015, with the acquisition of asset-light truckload brokerage services of Coyote Logistics. The combination of Coyote's capabilities and the UPS integrated network is providing customers with unmatched flexibility. Next month will mark the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition.
The synergies in procurement, asset utilization and cross-selling remain on track to achieve our 2017 targets. In fact, cross-selling has already produced several great wins.
Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to recognize a milestone we will achieve in August. UPS marks our 40th year in Germany and our entrance into Europe. Over that time, our business has matured rapidly and the European operations have become a cornerstone for our integrated network.
Today, we operate in every European country, generating more than $6 billion in annual revenue using our best-in-class pan-European network. The expansion in Europe and the growth of our business around the world are made possible through the hard work and dedication of UPSers.
As our strong momentum carries into the second half of the year, I want to thank all of our employees around the globe for helping make and maintain UPS as the market leader.
Now Richard will review the financial highlights."

The second quarter operating results demonstrate the value of our flexible business model as we had another solid quarter. Additionally, we are seeing high growth in the e-commerce and health care sectors, while the LTL and forwarding markets remain challenged.
Even with these dynamics, currency neutral revenue growth increased 4%, while fuel surcharges were a drag of around 120 basis points. Second quarter earnings per share were in line with expectations. Our performance reflected the gains from our investment strategies despite the mixed macro environment. The international segment outperformed, while U.S. domestic was on target. And finally, supply chain and freight was slightly below expectations.
Now for some details by segment. U.S. domestic revenue increased 2.4%, as lower fuel surcharges reduced total revenue growth by about 100 basis points. Average daily volume increased 2.5%, led by Next Day Air products, which were up about 6%. The Next Day Air gains were produced by customers of all sizes. Demand was consumer based as more online retailers are providing faster delivery options to stay competitive.
During the quarter, ground products increased 2.4% over last year, as B2C expansion outpaced B2B by more than 5:1. Base rates accelerated slightly from last quarter. Lower fuel surcharges reduced yield growth by about 100 basis points. The higher base rates were able to compensate for some of the changes in product and customer mix. Operating profit increased about 3% and operating margin expanded to 13.7%. Enhanced productivity and lower fuel costs resulted in operating cost per piece declining 0.2%.
Once again, we have seen good improvements in our daily operating statistics. Despite the fact that delivery stops were up over 3%, ORION lowered driver miles by 0.3%. In addition, overall productivity gains continued as direct labor hours grew less than the volume. Our investment in ORION is bending the cost curve, and we remain on track to complete Phase I implementation later in 2016.
We are continuing our multiyear investment strategy in hub automation in the U.S. operations. So far in 2016, we have announced new projects in California, Colorado, Illinois and Texas. These facilities are adding increased capacity and improved productivity.
Now turning to the International segment, which had another remarkable quarter, with operating profit expanding more than 11%. On a 2-year stack basis, operating profit is up more than 30%. Export daily volume increased almost 4% as improvements in all international regions offset slower U.S. exports. Europe led the way with significant gains in cross-border products and export growth to all regions of the world. In fact, the Europe to U.S. lane grew at double-digit pace this quarter.
Cycling out of the revenue management initiatives that we started in the last half of 2015, we have seen good non-U.S. domestic daily shipment growth, which is up 4.5%, while at the same time, currency neutral revenue per piece increased 1%.
We saw higher base rates. However, they were offset by changes in product and trade lane mix. Currency neutral revenue for the segment increased 1.5%. The lower fuel surcharge did impact revenue growth by about 170 basis points. The cost and productivity improvements held operating expenses down during the quarter. As a result of operating margin expanded to 19.9%. The international segment had a record second quarter, with its highest second quarter delivery volume, operating profit and one of the best margins ever.
Now let's turn and look at supply chain and freight. Total revenue increased more than 13% due to the addition of Coyote Logistics. The new truckload brokerage revenue offset tonnage shortfalls in international forwarding and the U.S. LTL business. Freight forwarding revenue and operating profit declined as we wrapped last year's rate actions. Cargo capacity continues to outpace demand, contributing to the weak market conditions I mentioned earlier. Expansion of the buy-sell rate and cost containment efforts led to the operating margin expansion. The unit remains focused on growing the more profitable middle market.
In the distribution unit, we experienced strong revenue growth in the health care, aerospace and automotive sectors this quarter. In fact, this quarter, health care became the top revenue sector within the contract logistics business.
Distribution operating profit jumped more than 10% and the margin expanded. The UPS Freight business remains disciplined on pricing, with revenue per hundredweight up 3%. The unit's execution of revenue quality initiatives is driving higher shipment yields. Total tonnage was lower by about 10%, due in part to the weak LTL market conditions.
Now to update you on our cash position. For the 6 months ended June 30, UPS generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow, a 13% increase over last year. And this was after spending $1 billion on CapEx. The company paid just over $1.3 billion in dividends, an increase of almost 7%. In addition, we purchased over 13 million shares for more than $1.3 billion. Combined, we are on schedule to meet our return to shareholders goals we set for the year.
Looking at the rest of the year, our strong international performance and the return on investments we are making in our network give us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year earnings guidance of $5.70 to $5.90 per share. As I discussed in February, we expect 2016 operating profit by quarter to follow the same pattern as it did in 2015. We still expect the fourth quarter operating profit growth to be above our annual guidance, somewhere between 9% and 11%.
The additional workday between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the continued strength in e-commerce and our strategic investments position us well for another solid fourth quarter.
Looking at the segments. In the U.S. domestic, we expect strong fourth quarter results. However, we will face tough comparisons in the third as a result of 1 less operating day and lower workers' compensation costs last year. Therefore, we anticipate third quarter operating profit to be relatively flat year-over-year.
For the International segment, we expect to continue into the second half of the year the progress we've made with operating profit growth in the 8% to 12% range. The supply chain and freight segment is where we anticipate the current market trends in international air freight and the U.S. trucking markets to remain solid. In addition, lower fuel surcharges will weigh on reported revenue growth. Therefore, total annual revenue growth for the segment should be around 10%.
Now let's look at taxes. The faster growth of our profits from the International segment means that we'll have a slightly lower tax rate in 2016.
In summary, UPS's financial performance this year clearly demonstrates the value of our diverse business. We are embracing the opportunities created by the evolution of the global e-commerce marketplace as it expands beyond traditional retail base. We continue investing in strategic technologies, systems and expanded capacity. And by our execution, we are strengthening our leadership position.
At the halfway point of the year, our business is responding well to the changing macro environment, and we are confident about the remainder of 2016.
Thanks for your attention today. Now I'll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?"

I do want to point out that the margin of 19.9% is very strong, and it does include that multiyear hedge that we talked about on the call the last few quarters. So I want to remind you that even adjusting for that, we're still over a 17.5% margin, which is the highest in any player in the industry. And along that route, if you recall, the currency, we've been using multiyear hedge strategy. And what happened is in 2015, you saw a lot of volatility in the year ago to the dollar from $1.35 down to $1.11. So 2017 will be a transition year where we expect to have somewhere around $300 million impact for the change in the currency. We have moved to a different hedge strategy because the volatility has increased so much on currency where we're using more rolling average so that year-over-year, going forward, we'll not see these dips if you see a lot of volatility in currency. But overall, that 17.5% is really a result of all the efforts that Jim just spoke, really putting together and making adjustments in the network and at the same time, the quality of revenues that we're bringing in."

But over the year to year, we kind of guided that we continue to see improvement, expect to see going improvement as well. When you look at the third quarter specifically, there is 1 less workday, and that does have an impact. As well as last year, we had some workers' comp credits that won't repeat this coming year. So when you take all of that into account, you have to kind of look at -- and we did at the beginning of the year, understanding how the quarters would look. And what we saw is that we need to make sure that you guys had some transparency to understand that workday shifts some of the profit around. And if you look at this quarter, this quarter, we had a good improvement. And that improvement was really driven by the operational improvements, even though we saw so much volatility in fuel this year in the second quarter. We actually saw a 25% increase in fuel from April to June, so we were chasing the revenue.

That being said, we are in a multiyear process of investments both in the ORION that David talked about in his talk as well as the hub automation and how that will continue. So all of those things are about putting together the multiyear process of where we're going to improve the margin that we laid out really at the end of '14. We're putting those investments in.

And as a large e-commerce shipper takes over more of its own delivery within the denser cities, does that change the density equation at all and the need to retrofit all of the regional sort facilities? And how is that project progressing? And what have you learned thus far in terms of benefits heading into another peak?
So Nate got his bang for his buck in that question. And I will start and address the first part of it, then I'm going to turn it over to Myron to talk to a little bit about the retrofit and peak. And it's not unusual for any of our large shippers to make decisions, whether they're going to outsource or insource different parts of their business. Our focus is our diverse customer base, just makes it so difficult for any one company to be able to match our density, no matter their size. So with our integrated network, it creates efficiencies. We're constantly increasing our value proposition. So we always believe that our -- even our large customers would have more density with us than going in another direction. So I feel very confident in our strategy from that regard. Why don't you talk about the retrofit and peak preparation, Myron?"

Phase 2 will actually begin in the back half of this year, well into 2017, and we hope to have this Phase 2 completed by 2017, but we hope to see additional benefits from ORION.

The first is the external and what's happening on the external measures because that -- our volume does have some correlation, especially when you get to B2B to what's happening with both domestic GDP, things like industrial production and things like that, and they all have softened somewhat from first quarter to second quarter. The other side of it, of course, is what's happening internally, the things Myron has talked about in his operation. And those improvements that we're seeing. So we put all that together, and we say do we have economic -- assumptions are realistic? And then how are we benefiting from the initiatives that we've implemented? And so we think we've balanced all that, and that's what we're seeing in 2016. We're seeing a nice balance where we're making up for some softness externally with what we're doing internally, and that's allowed us to grow our earnings per share for 6 quarters in a row, and we'll continue to work those plans for guidance going forward."

Back in 2008,",392,"So David, thanks for that one and Helane as well. I think I get this question every day, quite frankly, over the last couple of months. But I think to give a little bit of backdrop, when I go back to -- and just remind you of something here. Back in 2008, when we bought Lynx, it was our choice in the U.K. to strengthen that market. To feed the network, we talked about a lot and obviously, also feed that country and the consumers. It took us a couple of years to get it done. We're done in 2010. And although we don't talk much about country-level performance, I think, this question will get us pretty close to it. I could just tell you that from the years 2010 through '15, that U.K. operation for us is best in class in many ways that we measure our business. So that acquisition and integration, that took us about 3 years, has paid dividends for many, many, many years now. Brexit, we don't see changing that for that market quite frankly. Our job is to continue that priority, number one, to take care of that economy and the consumers, our employees and the shareholders and link it into that European network. So that's priority 1. The issue obviously becomes what this free trade agreement's set up to be. Don't forget a couple of things, I think, for my perspective. One is, there are many -- there is a number of free trade agreements in that union as well. You've got the Norway model, you got the Swiss model and then you've got the EU model. So how it unfolds, we will see, but there are various models that could unfold. We've analyzed scenarios as far left as the WTO setup, all the way back to something close to what they have today. In the end, I think our priority is to advise and advocate and support consumers as the free trade agreements are finalized in the coming years, and then continue to whatever happens, support that market and the network, and I think we could easily say there will be somewhat more complexity. But I think our job is to simplify the complex in the network for consumers and continue the great service, and that's what we plan to do as that unfolds."

First is new opportunities, new opportunities that would help us add more value to our customers and then, any time that we can expand capability within our networks. So if it's something that we don't feel as strong about as we'd like to, then that would be that second criteria. And then, third, the trade lanes are shifting throughout the world, and so geographic presence is always important. Over the last few years, the emerging markets has been a place that we put a lot of attention on. So adjacent markets, which is what we did with the Coyote acquisition, is keen on our mind.

On Access Points, right now, we'll probably finish the year at about 27,000 access points, globally and we continue to expand there. So yes, so when you think about bending the cost curve, I guess, the 1/10 contributes to about $200 million in bottom line costs, if we -- when we increase the density by 1/10. And then I guess, the last thing I'll say is that we continue to be bullish about Access Points, and we're expanding the current model.

And I think the important thing is we have said that as we move forward, we have continued initiatives that will continue to improve the operating margin. That being said, obviously, different segments, things will happen and growth rates might have to be adjusted. It's a little early to talk about exactly what's going to happen, and that's really because there's a lot of things going on, and volatility of currency too. So the year is -- here we are in end of July, we have time still. And if you tell me where, in November, the dollar-euro is or the sterling-dollar, that will be a lot about the story of how much variation. That's why we say the plus or minus numbers. The important thing is that we have a plan. It will improve by segment. Our first priority is to reinvest in this business because of the strength of the company. We continue to deliver the highest ROIC and the highest margins in the business, and our plan is to continue to do that. And we will continue to do that while at the same time, having dividends of over 3% or around 3%. So as we get closer to 2017, I'll guide you appropriately, but we are in the middle of putting all those plans together. And then your second question around the percentage of our share of any one customer, it's something that we -- we obviously continue to win customers based on our strategy. To win customers, we don't come in any one customer, but you can see our volume growth for the U.S. was up about 2.5%. You adjust for fuel, we saw revenue growth of about 3.4%. So it was a strong quarter. We laid out for you how we think the fourth quarter is going to look, and that's another strong quarter. And we're going to end up delivering on the guidance numbers that we gave you at the beginning of the year. And I think that's the most important thing."

These results demonstrate increased demand for our products and disciplined execution of our initiatives. 
I'll provide an update of our Q3 highlights, and then Kate will give you an update on peak season. 
During Q3, the International segment increased operating profit by 14% on more than 7% package volume growth. 
Our international strategy is achieving outstanding results. This was the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit expansion. Yes, I said, seventh consecutive quarters of international operating profit growth. 
The U.S. domestic business produced higher than anticipated package volume, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of e-commerce solutions. We continue to see increased demand for our air products, and this quarter was no exception. 
Shippers are choosing UPS air products because our value is a differentiator. 
The Supply Chain & Freight segment is navigating prolonged weak market conditions. We are making progress in adapting their business model and focusing on capturing the right revenue opportunities.
We are confident in our long-term strategies, and as a result of our performance this quarter, we remain on plan with this year's guidance.
Turning now to the economy, where global growth has continued to be modest. 
In the U.S., consumer fundamentals remain healthy and account for most of the economic expansion, while the outlook for industrial production remains weak. Overall, global GDP forecasts are slightly down. For the balance of 2016, we continue to see mixed economic signals across some industrial markets. 
Under these conditions, our diversified business model and our winning strategies still enable UPS to take advantage of the high-growth markets, such as cross-border trade and e-commerce.
To facilitate growth, we are adding capacity and increasing efficiency in our globally-integrated network. Trade lane and product portfolio enhancements are important components of our plans. 
We have significantly improved time-in-transit from several cities in the U.S. and Canada based on increased export opportunities. We have also dramatically improved service times for cross-border shipments between several major European cities. 
During the quarter, we strengthened our portfolio of urgent delivery options by expanding our worldwide Express Plus product. We've doubled the number of countries served and are now reaching 90% of the world's GDP by the next day. 
We've also expanded solutions for our specialized shippers by strengthening our clinical trial service used by pharmaceutical companies. We see excellent opportunities for growth in this part of the health care segment. 
Our actions are providing more delivery options, faster transit times and earlier guaranteed deliveries, helping UPS customers achieve their growth objectives.
In addition, we are following a disciplined capital approach to invest in our business. 
In 2016, we announced 12 highly-automated facility upgrades as part of our multiyear strategy, and we plan to announce several significant new projects before the end of the year. These projects will help us to increase operating efficiencies, while simultaneously better serving our customers.
Expectations in the e-commerce sector and specialized markets, like health care logistics, have continued to shift to faster delivery options. As a result, demand for both domestic and international air products has been strong. 
Since we took delivery of our last new plane in 2013, UPS Air Products have increased more than 15%. Clearly, over the last several years, UPS has expanded market share in the air segment, and we expect these trends to continue. 
In response, we are announcing the purchase of 14 Boeing 747-8 jumbo freighters, along with options to buy 14 more in the future. We will take delivery of the first 2 at the end of 2017. This is a net add to our fleet. These new 747s will enable UPS to begin a cascade of aircraft route assignments that will add significant capacity in our busiest lanes.
This would optimize global air network capacity, these new cargo jets. All of these investments are in line to meet expanding customer needs and produce positive financial returns.
Looking now at the upcoming holiday season, we have created extensive [indiscernible] and plans and built the foundation for another successful holiday for our customers and shareholders. Our strategy is to follow the same framework outlined last year. It's the 4 Cs: collaboration, capacity, control and commitment.
To conclude, I want to recognize the hard-working and dedicated UPS-ers around the world for the progress we've made year-to-date and to thank them in advance for their commitment to another successful peak season.
And now Kate will update you on our peak plans."

It's my pleasure to review our 2016 Peak Season plans with you. The dramatic growth of online shopping and subsequent returns is expected to lift UPS package levels to a record high during this upcoming holiday",659,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to review our 2016 Peak Season plans with you. 
The dramatic growth of online shopping and subsequent returns is expected to lift UPS package levels to a record high during this upcoming holiday period. Between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve 2016, there are 2 additional operating days, and we expect to complete over 700 million deliveries worldwide, about 100 million more than last year. 
In the overall U.S. market, the National Retail Federation expects total holiday retail sales to increase 3.6%. They are also estimating non-store retail sales growth between 7% and 10%. 
At UPS, our peak strategies are focused on executing the 4 Cs that David mentioned earlier. 
To begin with, we've deepened the level of collaboration with even more customers. We started earlier and our communicating more frequently. This better aligns UPS solutions and capacity with their seasonal promotion plans and fulfillment strategy, helping customers ship demand, sell inventory earlier and optimize their operation.
Customer experience continues to gain importance in the marketplace, making collaboration as shared objective for both shippers and UPS. Whether you're in health care, retail or any industry, our work together is creating consumer loyalty and a preference for the UPS delivery experience.
Looking at our second area of focus, capacity, UPS customers will benefit from several key automation and expansion projects. We've opened new automated facilities and updated existing hubs in the U.S. and Europe in cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Paris and London. In the U.S., we are supplementing our capacity with the addition of temporary facilities. These investments and technology and capacity make our integrated network more flexible and efficient.
This peak, our partners at Coyote Logistics will be supporting our entire domestic operation, helping UPS help customer needs during this high demand period. 
In addition, our driver dispatch will be even more effective. I'm pleased to announce that we've completed Phase 1 of the ORION implementation in the U.S., ahead of schedule. 100% of eligible U.S. drivers will be utilizing this dispatch technology during peak, up from 70% last year. 
The third focus area is control, both control of deliveries for UPS customers and control of the UPS network.
UPS My Choice will provide greater control to 30 million global members, an increase of 10 million from last year. My Choice enables members to exert preferences with their inbound UPS shipment and take action on their packages when desired. They can choose to redirect delivers to alternate delivery locations, including a UPS Access Point location.
In fact, this year, we've expanded our reach and we'll have over 27,000 convenient Access Point locations opened around the world, with approximately 8,000 in the U.S. 
Looking at the UPS network, we are exercising real-time control to ensure our customers can properly respond to peak demand, and one important tool we use is the UPS Control Tower. This decision-making body enables us to say yes to more customer request, leveraging the flexibility of our operations to accept volume surges when possible.
It also assures that our capacity, value, cost to serve and price are appropriately aligned throughout peak season. 
The final area of focus for UPS is commitment. The 450,000 UPS employees, together with 95,000 temporary hires, will be working diligently to provide world-class value in service during this upcoming holiday season. 
Each year, the needs of peak season create special memories for all UPS-ers. Last year, I had a chance to visit the building I started in, 27 years ago, the same energy, determination and customer focus that I was drawn to Day 1, was clear in everyone I met.  Spending time making deliveries really reinforced to me how the peak planning and collaboration with customers resonate throughout the entire organization. 
Thank you for your time today. And I want to assure you that the UPS team is ready to deliver another successful peak season. Now I'll turn it over to Richard."
238570,403459825,1062885,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kate. UPS performed as we projected this quarter, with total reported revenue up about 5% and daily shipments up, almost 6%.

UPS performed as we projected this quarter, with total reported revenue up about 5% and daily shipments up, almost 6%. The International segment produced another quarter of double-digit profit expansion.  And the U.S. domestic delivered results as we had anticipated, while supply chain & Freight results were somewhat below expectations.
UPS third quarter earnings per share were up about 4%. In 2016, the EPS change across the enterprise was lowered by headwinds in the U.S. domestic business and approximately $0.02 due to discrete tax credit taken in 2015.
This was a good quarter. UPS generated strong topline revenue. Great momentum in our international business and solid results from the other segments. 
Now for a closer look at how the segments performed. 
U.S. domestic revenue increased 4.8%, driven by daily package gains of 5.7%. All products contributed to volume growth, with deferred [ph] air up, more than 10%. Next Day Air up, almost 6%, and Ground, up 5.2%.  Growth was balanced from enterprise and middle market customers. 
High demand for online retailers was evident as B2C delivers were up 11%. Despite negative industrial production, B2B deliveries were up 2%, with the majority of the increase driven by our e-commerce return portfolio.
Base rate improvements were able to somewhat offset lower fuel surcharges in a drag from a changing product mix. As a result, revenue per package was up, about 1%. E-commerce customers are helping drive higher daily shipments across our entire portfolio of services,  from high single-digit growth in air products to a 20% jump in our most economical product, Sure Post. 
Even with accelerated growth of e-commerce, our investment in ORION continue to allow UPS to bend the cost curve lower and create positive return. 
ORION added efficiency again this quarter, delivery stops and volume were both up 5.7%, yet ORION have package miles to only 1.4% increase. Direct labor hours also grew slower than the average daily volume growth. 
As we guided, operating profit growth comparisons with 2015 were restrained by 1 less operating day in 2016 and higher casualty credits realized last year. Excluding these profit headwinds, operating margins expanded as we took advantage of the benefits of our investments.
Now for some details on the International segment, where we had another record, with double-digit operating profit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. 
Profit jumped 14% as shipments climbed 7.5%. Revenue was up more than 3% on a currency-neutral basis and fuel surcharge did decline, lowering the growth rate by about 70 basis points.
U.S. export packages per day rose over 7%, growth was well-balanced on solid shipment out of Asia and across Europe. The non-U.S. domestic product increased 7.8% as we transition to pricing actions we took in 2015.
This quarter, it shows it's about getting the right volume in our network. Our International segment is delivering balanced results, with great growth and superior returns.
Let's turn a look at the supply chain and freight segment now. 
The segment produced top line growth of 8.1%, primarily driven by the Coyote acquisition. Economic conditions in the U.S. truckload and LTL market as well as the international Air Freight business continued to place downward pressure on demand. 
The [indiscernible] unit remained disciplined on revenue management and cost control, gains from the small and medium-sized customers reduced the year-over-year shortfall in total tonnage. UPS Freight has been adversely impacted by industry conditions total tonnage however, they are executing a disciplined middle market strategy which has resulted in revenue per hundredweight pricing improvement of 3.7% this quarter.
Turning to our distribution group, revenue growth was broad-based with contributions from almost all sectors. The business unit maintained its industry-leading margins in the mid-to upper single digits. 
Now to update you on our cash position. UPS again generated healthy free cash flow. Through the first 9 months, we produced $3.6 billion after investing over $1.8 billion in capital expenditures. 
Please note that we accelerate our planned discretionary pension contribution to September. This allows us to capture additional financial benefits in 2016. 
UPS also repurchased 19.5 million shares for $2 billion and paid down another $2 billion in dividends, up 7% per share over the last year. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate total operating profit growth to be slightly higher than our full year guidance of 6% to 8%. 
Supply chain and freight is continuing to manage industry challenges. And is expected to produce a modest low single-digit revenue expansion by holding operating margins flat with last year.
For the full year, the macro environment is suppressing revenue growth. Therefore, supply chain and freight operating profit is anticipated to be slightly below 2015 levels.
We are projecting an effective tax rate for UPS of 35% in the fourth quarter. Due to the unknown, related to the mark-to-market at year-end, we are not able to provide guidance on our GAAP earnings per share. However, we are affirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5.70 to $5.90. 
In summary, on a year-to-date basis, our business is adapting to the opportunities and challenges presented by the high-growth digital economy. We continue to reduce the industry's best margin and create free cash flow. As we look at the fourth quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver another outstanding peak season for both our customers and our investors. 
Before we take your questions, I want to take a moment to announce our plans to hold an investor conference in early 2017. On February 21, in New York, we'll have a half day conference. David, along with the senior leaders and myself, will be on hand to lay out our recent progress and update you on our strategy. We plan to allow ample time for your questions.

So does this imply that you would think that the strong growth in air volumes would continue? And then if you look out the next 5 years, is that kind of a reason, any implication?

Obviously, given the ability to put larger plane on the lanes that have greater needs, allows us to reduce the number of frequencies for those routes. In addition to that, the Dash 8 will give us an ability to cascade capacity throughout our entire network. We plan to deploy these first aircraft into our International segment and it will allow us to bring back our current 747-400s [ph] to the U.S. that will give us capacity throughout the entire system. In addition to that, it's a much smarter choice because it allows us to take the current Dash 4 [ph] pilots who will require a very minimal amount of additional training, who can then fly the Dash 8. So we believe it was a very smart choice for us. And I'll hand it off to Alan who can talk about growth."

At the end, when you look at what's happening and where we're going with it, it really is about International continuing to deliver on what they have really done for 7 quarters and in the Domestic, we will see margin expansion for the year. We have, as I mentioned last quarter, some change because of workdays and some year-over-year comp issues in the third quarter, but we expect the whole year that we will see a margin expansion. We'll take an online question next. This comes from Jack Atkins at Stevens. Jack really asked can we speak a little bit more about the long term capital spending over the next few years, both with the hub automation and the aircraft.
So again, this is Richard. And Jack, I think, the first and you have to remember here is that our capital policy remains consistently unchanged. Our number one priority for many years had continued to be to reinvest in the business. And you see that in our [indiscernible] having the highest return on invested capital is not only good for the enterprise, but it's also good for the shareholders. We continue to see strong returns for all the investments we've made over the last few years, we've talked about that only what we're doing in the house, but we'll also Orion and again, this quarter, we continue to see the benefits of almost a 6% volume growth and muted miles growth. And so all of that comes to the bottom line. We're always evaluating ways to look at can we accelerate some of this investment because it such high return on these investments we're making.
[Audio Gap]
We're going to actually bring everyone together in early February to really talk about where the Enterprise is going, what great opportunities we have, were we'll see growth come from and what our plans are for next you. And I think, at that time, you'll see that the future is very bright. We continue to have year-over-year improvements in margin, and that's our plan going forward as well."

However, we are not guiding any different for 2016. It's in the $2.8 billion we've been talking about, because a portion of it is paid this year. And most important thing to remember here is we're great stewards of capital. We had not bought a plane in 2013 until today, but since 1989, that was the very first time since we've been an airline, that we were able to continue to create efficiencies within our network.

We mentioned, David, and the beginning that a couple of pockets across the world from Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific and specifically, China and Hong Kong for us right now are growing at rates we've never seen before, but more broadly, it's coming from our middle markets there. Historically, we've had big enterprise growth supply chain expanded across the world, but we really becoming more local in a lot of these markets. So our -- some of those markets like China, we are seeing middle market growth rates at 20% and 30%, year-over-year. So that's great for us. Europe continues to speed itself up. Again, in some of the opening comments, we've taken a look at the network and continue to speed it up. And obviously, we have -- we're up to about 80% of the cities in Europe we can reach by 2 days in the ground network, then we'll continue to invest air. So all in all, we think fourth quarter will be great, and we'll continue on, absent the currency headwinds that Richard has mentioned, to continue to growth in the International segment."

I'll start with automation first. We are continuing to make good progress with our long-term initiatives to add more capacity, offer greater efficiency and our integrated network by introducing automation throughout our top tier 30 hubs across the U.S, where we process as much as 60% through those locations. I mentioned earlier that we had announced 12 automated facilities this year including 4 this quarter. We are on pace and we're making great progress. Those include retrofitting, expansion and in some cases, new facilities. And we're again, we're getting as much as 25% production improvements in those locations. This of course, allows us to have additional flexibilities and reduce handle in the network. When it comes to the use of drones as well as vehicles that allow us to have autonomous trucks on the road, we have experimented with drone, with a number of vendors. You should have seen an announcement, what we launched at first try in the Northeast earlier this year, was very successful as well as our use in [indiscernible] medications in Africa. So we'll continue to experiment until we get the ability to use it. As it pertains to vehicles, we are continuing to work with a number of vendors to explore what works best for us. We have what we term as a roaming laboratory. We have over 6,500 vehicles in the U.S. right now that are considered CNG [ph] , LNG and the sort. Of course, all of these will require the approval from the National Highway and Traffic Association. So when it becomes available to us, we certainly expect to be ready."

We talked about in our investor conference a few years ago and throughout each year that we're investing and year-over-year, we're having to reinvest to get into the endpoint. And all of that together, along with things like SurePost redirect and the ability to take almost 1/3 of the volume that's destined to be delivered by the post office, and we put it in our system because we're already going to those stops. Those are all key components of how going to continue to improve the margin. And really, it's a long term story that we're talking about. Earlier, I've actually mentioned and perhaps I said the wrong year, that we do expect margin expansion for the entire year of 2016.

During Q3, the International segment increased operating profit by 14% on more than 7% package volume growth. Our international strategy is achieving outstanding results. This was the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit expansion. Yes, I said seven consecutive quarters of international operating profit growth. 
The U.S. domestic business produced higher-than-anticipated package volume, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of e-commerce solutions. We continue to see increased demand for our air products, and this quarter was no exception. Shippers are choosing UPS air products because our value is a differentiator.

Turning now to the economy, where global growth has continued to be modest. In the U.S., consumer fundamentals remain healthy and accounted for most of the economic expansion, while the outlook for industrial production remains weak. Overall, global GDP forecasts are slightly down. For the balance of 2016, we continue to see mixed economic signals across some industrial markets. Under these conditions, our diversified business model and our winning strategies still enable UPS to take advantage of high-growth markets, such as cross-border trade and e-commerce.
To facilitate growth, we are adding capacity and increasing efficiency in our globally integrated network. Trade lane and product portfolio enhancements are important components of our plans. We have significantly improved time-in-transit from several cities in the U.S. and Canada based on increased export opportunities. We have also dramatically improved service times for cross-border shipments between several major European cities. 
During the quarter, we strengthened our portfolio of urgent delivery options by expanding our Worldwide Express Plus product. We've doubled the number of countries served, and are now reaching 90% of the world's GDP by the next day. We've also expanded solutions for our specialized shippers by strengthening our clinical trial service used by pharmaceutical companies. We see excellent opportunities for growth in this part of the health care segment. Our actions are providing more delivery options, faster transit times and earlier guaranteed deliveries, helping UPS customers achieve their growth objectives.
In addition, we're following a disciplined capital approach to invest in our business. In 2016, we announced 12 highly-automated facility upgrades as part of our multiyear strategy, and we plan to announce several significant new projects before the end of the year. These projects will help us to increase operating efficiency, while simultaneously better serving our customers.
Expectations in the e-commerce sector and specialized markets, like health care logistics, have continued to shift to faster delivery options. As a result, demand for both domestic and international air products has been strong. Since we took delivery of our last new plane in 2013, UPS air products have increased more than 15%. Clearly, over the last several years, UPS has expanded market share in the air segment, and we expect these trends to continue. 
In response, we're announcing the purchase of 14 Boeing 747-8 jumbo freighters, along with options to buy 14 more in the future. We will take delivery of the first 2 at the end of 2017. This is a net add to our fleet. These new 747s will enable UPS to begin a cascade of aircraft route assignments that will add significant capacity in our busiest lanes. This will optimize global air network capacity, these new cargo jets. All of these investments are in line to meet expanding customer needs and produce positive financial returns.
Looking now at the upcoming holiday season, we have created extensive peak season plans and built the foundation for another successful holiday for our customers and shareowners. Our strategy is to follow the same framework outlined last year. It's the 4 Cs: collaboration, capacity, control and commitment.
To conclude, I want to recognize the hard-working and dedicated UPSers around the world for the progress we've made year-to-date, and to thank them in advance for their commitment to another successful peak season.
And now Kate will update you on our peak plans."
238570,403459825,1063347,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to review our 2016 peak season plans with you. The dramatic growth of online shopping and subsequent returns is expected to lift UPS package levels to a record high during this upcoming holiday",659,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to review our 2016 peak season plans with you. 
The dramatic growth of online shopping and subsequent returns is expected to lift UPS package levels to a record high during this upcoming holiday period. Between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve 2016, there are 2 additional operating days, and we expect to complete over 700 million deliveries worldwide, about 100 million more than last year. In the overall U.S. market, the National Retail Federation expects total holiday retail sales to increase 3.6%. They are also estimating nonstore retail sales growth between 7% and 10%. 
At UPS, our peak strategies are focused on executing the 4 Cs that David mentioned earlier. To begin with, we've deepened the level of collaboration with even more customers. We started earlier and are communicating more frequently. This better aligns UPS solutions and capacity with their seasonal promotion plans and fulfillment strategies, helping customers ship demand, sell inventory earlier and optimize their operation.
Customer experience continues to gain importance in the marketplace, making collaboration a shared objective for both shippers and UPS. Whether you're in health care, retail or any industry, our work together is creating consumer loyalty and a preference for the UPS delivery experience.
Looking at our second area of focus, capacity, UPS customers will benefit from several key automation and expansion projects. We've opened new automated facilities and updated existing hubs in the U.S. and Europe, in cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Paris and London. In the U.S., we are supplementing our capacity with the addition of temporary facilities. These investments in technology and capacity make our integrated network more flexible and efficient.
This peak, our partners at Coyote Logistics will be supporting our entire domestic operation, helping UPS solve customer needs during this high demand period. In addition, our driver dispatch will be even more effective. I'm pleased to announce that we've completed Phase 1 of the ORION implementation in the U.S. ahead of schedule. 100% of eligible U.S. drivers will be utilizing this dispatch technology during peak, up from 70% last year. 
The third focus area is control, both control of deliveries for UPS customers and control of the UPS network. UPS My Choice will provide greater control to 30 million global members, an increase of 10 million from last year. My Choice enables members to exert preferences with their inbound UPS shipment and take action on their packages when desired. They can choose to redirect deliveries to alternate delivery locations, including a UPS Access Point location. In fact, this year, we've expanded our reach, and we'll have over 27,000 convenient Access Point locations opened around the world, with approximately 8,000 in the U.S.
Looking at the UPS network, we are exercising real-time control to ensure our customers can properly respond to peak demand, and one important tool we use is the UPS control tower. This decision-making body enables us to say yes to more customer requests, leveraging the flexibility of our operations to accept volume surges when possible. It also assures that our capacity, value, cost to serve and price are appropriately aligned throughout peak season. 
The final area of focus for UPS is commitment. The 450,000 UPS employees, together with 95,000 temporary hires, will be working diligently to provide world-class value and service during this upcoming holiday season. Each year, the needs of peak season create special memories for all UPSers. Last year, I had a chance to visit the building I started in 27 years ago, the same energy, determination and customer focus that I was drawn to, Day 1, was clear in everyone I met.  Spending time making deliveries really reinforced to me how the peak planning and collaboration with customers resonates throughout the entire organization. 
Thank you for your time today. And I want to assure you that the UPS team is ready to deliver another successful peak season. Now I'll turn it over to Richard."
238570,403459825,1063347,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kate. UPS performed as we projected this quarter, with total reported revenue up about 5% and daily shipments up almost 6%. The International segment produced another quarter of double-digit profit expansion, and the U.S. domestic delivered result",984,"Thanks, Kate. UPS performed as we projected this quarter, with total reported revenue up about 5% and daily shipments up almost 6%. The International segment produced another quarter of double-digit profit expansion, and the U.S. domestic delivered results as we had anticipated, while Supply Chain & Freight results were somewhat below expectations.
UPS third quarter earnings per share were up about 4%. In 2016, the EPS change across the enterprise was lowered by headwinds in the U.S. domestic business and approximately $0.02 due to discrete tax credits taken in 2015. This was a good quarter. UPS generated strong topline revenue. Great momentum in our international business and solid results from the other segments. 
Now for a closer look at how the segments performed. U.S. domestic revenue increased 4.8%, driven by daily package gains of 5.7%. All products contributed to volume growth, with Deferred Air up more than 10%, Next Day Air up almost 6% and Ground up 5.2%. Growth was balanced from enterprise and middle market customers. 
High demand for online retailers was evident as B2C delivers were up 11%. Despite negative industrial production, B2B deliveries were up 2%, with the majority of the increase driven by our e-commerce return portfolio.
Base rate improvements were able to somewhat offset lower fuel surcharges and the drag from a change in product mix. As a result, revenue per package was up about 1%. E-commerce customers are helping drive higher daily shipments across our entire portfolio of services,  from high single-digit growth in air products to a 20% jump in our most economical product, SurePost. 
Even with the accelerated growth of e-commerce, our investments in ORION continue to allow UPS to bend the cost curve lower and create positive return. ORION added efficiency again this quarter, delivery stops and volume were both up 5.7%, yet ORION have package miles to only 1.4% increase. Direct labor hours also grew slower than the average daily volume growth. 
As we guided, operating profit growth comparisons with 2015 were restrained by 1 less operating day in 2016 and higher casualty credits realized last year. Excluding these profit headwinds, operating margins expanded as we took advantage of the benefits of our investments.
Now for some details on the International segment, where we had another record, with double-digit operating profit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. Profit jumped 14%, as shipments climbed 7.5%. Revenue was up more than 3% on a currency-neutral basis and fuel surcharge did decline, lowering the growth rate by about 70 basis points.
U.S. export packages per day rose over 7%, growth was well-balanced on solid shipment out of Asia and across Europe. The non-U.S. domestic product increased 7.8% as we transitioned to pricing actions we took in 2015. This quarter, it shows it's about getting the right volume in our network. Our International segment is delivering balanced results, with great growth and superior returns.
Let's turn and look at the Supply Chain & Freight segment now. The segment produced top line growth of 8.1%, primarily driven by the Coyote acquisition. Economic conditions in the U.S. truckload and LTL market, as well as the International Air Freight business, continued to place downward pressure on demand. 
The Forwarding unit remained disciplined on revenue management and cost controls, gains from the small and medium-sized customers reduced the year-over-year shortfall in total tonnage. UPS Freight has been adversely impacted by industry conditions seeing total tonnage drop. However, they are executing a disciplined middle-market strategy which has resulted in revenue per hundredweight pricing improvement of 3.7% this quarter.
Turning to our Distribution group, revenue growth was broad-based, with contributions from almost all sectors. The business unit maintained its industry-leading margins in the mid-to upper single digits. 
Now to update you on our cash position. UPS again generated healthy free cash flow. Through the first 9 months, we produced $3.6 billion after investing over $1.8 billion in capital expenditures. Please note that we accelerated our planned discretionary pension contribution to September, this allows us to capture additional financial benefits in 2016. UPS also repurchased 19.5 million shares for $2 billion, and paid out another $2 billion in dividends, up 7% per share over the last year. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate total operating profit growth to be slightly higher than our full year guidance of 6% to 8%. Supply Chain & Freight is continuing through manage industry challenges, and is expected to produce modest low single-digit revenue expansion while holding operating margins flat with last year.
For the full year, the macro environment is suppressing revenue growth. Therefore, Supply Chain & Freight operating profit is anticipated to be slightly below 2015 levels. We are projecting an effective tax rate for UPS of 35% in the fourth quarter. Due to the unknown, related to the mark-to-market at year-end, we are not able to provide guidance on our GAAP earnings per share. However, we are affirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5.70 to $5.90. 
In summary, on a year-to-date basis, our business is adapting to the opportunities and challenges presented by the high-growth digital economy. We continue to produce the industry's best margins and create great free cash flow. As we look at the fourth quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver another outstanding peak season for both our customers and our investors. 
Before we take your questions, I want to take a moment to announce our plans to hold an investor conference in early 2017. On February 21, in New York, we'll have a half day conference. David, along with the senior leaders and myself, will be on hand to lay out our recent progress and update you on our strategy. We'll plan to allow ample time for your questions. Later today, the IR team will send out invitations with further details.

So does this imply that you would think that the strong growth in air volumes would continue and then -- if you look out the next 5 years? Is that kind of a reasonable implication? And also in terms of your largest customer who has been adding aircraft, is there an implication you're not particularly like concerned about -- share with the customer?

When you look at it on balance, since 2008, the international export volume has grown over 40%; U.S. domestic has had 20% growth; and our block hours are actually down over 3%. It actually speaks to our abilities to optimize our networks around world, and accommodate the tremendous growth that we've seen. So going with a larger aircraft, which is the -8, really was a smart choice for us. Obviously, given the ability to put a larger plane on the lanes that have greater needs, allows us to reduce the number of frequencies for those routes. In addition to that, the -8 will give us an ability to cascade capacity throughout our entire network. We plan to deploy these first aircraft into our International segments, and it will allow us to bring back our current 747-400s to the U.S. that will give us capacity throughout the entire system. In addition to that, it's a much smarter choice because it allows us to take the current -4 pilots who will require a very minimum amount of additional training who can then fly the -8. So we believe it was a very smart choice for us. And I'll hand it off to Alan who can talk about growth."

And when you think of it, this aircraft, the -8, gives you 70,000 pounds more capacity than the 777. It also gives you 16% more capacity than our current aircraft type, which is the -4. It allows you to have 34 containers on the main deck as well as 14 in the lower compartments, plus space for bulk cargo. So we believe again, as I alluded to earlier, that this is the smart choice for UPS."

And this is from Helane Becker. And she's talking about questions about Amazon. And when you think about e-commerce going forward, how do you think about competing in a market where Amazon may, at some point, start to convince shippers to use its Fulfillment by Amazon services?
So I'll start with this answer, and then I'll turn it over to Alan Gershenhorn. And of course, I'll begin that Amazon is a good customer of ours, and we do have -- believe we have a strong mutually beneficial relationship. And that our integrated network creates efficiencies and really gives them and our other customers a value proposition that we believe is unmatched. So going back to an earlier question about the aircraft and tying in to Amazon, I don't think that we've wrapped [ph] up at that point. Amazon and all of our other shippers will get the benefit of this cascading capacity that we're adding with this aircraft. So we think it's very good news for all of our customers.

And so you remove all that, we actually saw operating margin improvement year-over-year. And we actually expect the whole year to continue to see that. 2016 really is part of a deliberate strategy. We're seeing the benefits from the investments. We are reinvesting, so we're not getting all of the benefits. But we're getting the benefits that we actually have been talking about, and we said it would be a multiyear process. But we're delivering on those targets.

But the International operating margin was pushed a little higher because of the multiyear hedge strategy that we employed -- we have been employing for many years. We've been talking about that all year. And one of the challenge, of course, is the volatility. The euro and the sterling is at historical rates, and it's brought it down. So we expect 2017 to have a transition, where we'll see just over $300 million impact to the growth in the profit. That being said, when you step back for a moment, we continue to see the operating margin expand. Even adjusting for the hedge, we're talking about operating margins between 16% and 17%, which is industry-leading for international business. It's broad-based. It's because of the revenue growth, getting the right volume in our network and managing our cost efficiently.

Asia Pacific, and specifically China and Hong Kong for us right now, are growing at rates we've never seen before. But more importantly, it's coming from our middle markets there. Historically, we've had big enterprise growth as supply chains expanded across the world. But we're really becoming more local in a lot of these markets. So our -- some of those markets, like China, we're seeing middle market growth rates at 20% and 30% year-over-year. So that's great for us. Europe continues to speed itself up. Again, in some of the opening comments, we've taken a look at the network and continue to speed it up. And obviously, we have. We're up to about 80% of the cities in Europe we can reach by 2 days in the ground network, then we'll continue to invest there. So all in all, we think the fourth quarter will be great.

This is Myron, I'll start with automation first. We are continuing to make good progress with our long-term initiatives to add more capacity, offer greater efficiency in our integrated network by introducing automation throughout our top tier 30 hubs across the U.S, where we process as much as 60% through those locations. I mentioned earlier that we've announced 12 automated facilities this year including 4 this quarter. We're on pace, and we're making great progress. Those include retrofitting, expansion and, in some cases, new facilities. And again, we're getting as much as 25% production improvements in those locations. This, of course, allows us to have additional flexibilities and reduce handles in the network. When it comes to the use of drones as well as vehicles that allow us to have autonomous trucks on the road, we have experimented with drone with a number of vendors. You should have seen an announcement when we launched at first try in the Northeast earlier this year, it was very successful, as well as our use in delivering medications in Africa. So we'll continue to experiment until we get the ability to use it. As it pertains to vehicles, we're continuing to work with a number of vendors to explore what works best for us. We have what we term as a roaming laboratory. We have over 6,500 vehicles in the U.S. right now that are considered CNG, LNG and the sort. Of course, all of these will require the approval from the national highway and traffic association. So when it becomes available to us, we certainly expect to be ready."

As Rich just stated, when we redirect, we've already got a package going to that particular consumer, so it's very, very accretive to us to reroute that package back through the UPS network and avoid having to pay any postal fees at that particular point. And we're up around 30%. We're continuing to investigate new and better ways to improve that. And then we've also got other methodologies, like UPS Access Point that Kate mentioned, to build density as well as our synchronized delivery solutions. So it's really about bending the cost curve and increasing the density on our B2C shipments."

So it's the growth in that particular market tracks very closely to the growth in e-commerce on that 1:5, 1:6 ratio. Those packages are highly profitable. First of all, many of those packages get dropped off and don't have to be picked off because the consumer find it more convenient to drop them off at UPS stores or UPS Access Points or hand them to a UPS driver. So there's very little cost when it comes to pick up. And then obviously, the deliveries are going back to businesses and we could be delivering tens or hundreds of packages back to these businesses. So it's a highly profitable B2B delivery, with very little pick-up costs."

And the way the rules work is you have to have a certain information you need to convey around the GAAP side. It really is too early, and that's why there wasn't anything in the report about what we thought the mark-to-market would be. Because there's so many things that aren't even finished yet for us to know where we would be. For example, return on assets and discount rates. And if you go back last year, this time, and where we are today and where we ended the year, the discount rates changed a lot. And of course, last year, the market changed the other direction unfortunately. So there are so many unknowns right now that's really impossible to sit here and say, ""This is what we think it's going to be."" That all being said, what we were doing with -- and what we put in the press release, was if you look at the underlying core business, we're confirming that our adjusted earnings per share guidance is right in where we expected it to be, and that's because the investments that we've put in the last few years are creating the returns, and that's why we're going to see the margin expansion and that's why we've guided the way we have."

These results demonstrate increased demand for our products and disciplined execution of our initiatives. I'll provide an update of our Q3 highlights, and then Kate will give you an update on peak season. 
During Q3, the International segment increased operating profit by 14% on more than 7% package volume growth. Our International strategy is achieving outstanding results. This was the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit expansion. Yes, I said seven consecutive quarters of International operating profit growth. 
The U.S. Domestic business produced higher-than-anticipated package volume, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of e-commerce solutions. We continue to see increased demand for our air products, and this quarter was no exception. Shippers are choosing UPS air products because our value is a differentiator. 
The Supply Chain & Freight segment is navigating prolonged weak market conditions. They are making progress in adapting their business model and focusing on capturing the right revenue opportunities. We're confident in our long-term strategies, and as a result of our performance this quarter, we remain on plan with this year's guidance.
Turning now to the economy, where global growth has continued to be modest. In the U.S., consumer fundamentals remain healthy and accounted for most of the economic expansion, while the outlook for industrial production remains weak. Overall, global GDP forecasts are slightly down. For the balance of 2016, we continue to see mixed economic signals across some industrial markets. Under these conditions, our diversified business model and our winning strategies still enable UPS to take advantage of high-growth markets, such as cross-border trade and e-commerce.
To facilitate growth, we are adding capacity and increasing efficiency in our globally integrated network. Trade lane and product portfolio enhancements are important components of our plans. We have significantly improved time-in-transit from several cities in the U.S. to Canada based on increased export opportunities. We have also dramatically improved service times for cross-border shipments between several major European cities. 
During the quarter, we strengthened our portfolio of urgent delivery options by expanding our Worldwide Express Plus product. We've doubled the number of countries served, and are now reaching 90% of the world's GDP by the next day. We've also expanded solutions for specialized shippers by strengthening our clinical trial service used by pharmaceutical companies. We see excellent opportunities for growth in this part of the health care segment. Our actions are providing more delivery options, faster transit times and earlier guaranteed deliveries, helping UPS customers achieve their growth objectives.
In addition, we're following a disciplined capital approach to invest in our business. In 2016, we announced 12 highly-automated facility upgrades as part of our multiyear strategy, and we plan to announce several significant new projects before the end of the year. These projects will help us to increase operating efficiency, while simultaneously better serving our customers.
Expectations in the e-commerce sector and specialized markets, like health care logistics, have continued to shift to faster delivery options. As a result, demand for both domestic and international air products has been strong. Since we took delivery of our last new plane in 2013, UPS air products have increased more than 15%. Clearly, over the last several years, UPS has expanded market share in the air segment, and we expect these trends to continue. 
In response, we're announcing the purchase of 14 Boeing 747-8 jumbo freighters, along with options to buy 14 more in the future. We will take delivery of the first 2 at the end of 2017. This is a net add to our fleet. These new 747s will enable UPS to begin a cascade of aircraft route assignments that will add significant capacity in our busiest lanes. This will optimize global air network capacity, these [ph] new cargo jets. All of these investments are in line to meet expanding customer needs and produce positive financial returns.
Looking now at the upcoming holiday season, we have created extensive peak season plans and built the foundation for another successful holiday for our customers and shareowners. Our strategy is to follow the same framework outlined last year. It's the 4 Cs: collaboration, capacity, control and commitment.
To conclude, I want to recognize the hard-working and dedicated UPSers around the world for the progress we've made year-to-date, and to thank them in advance for their commitment to another successful peak season.
And now Kate will update you on our peak plans."
238570,403459825,1063581,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to review our 2016 peak season plans with you. The dramatic growth of online shopping and subsequent returns is expected to lift UPS package levels to a record high during this upcoming holiday",659,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to review our 2016 peak season plans with you. 
The dramatic growth of online shopping and subsequent returns is expected to lift UPS package levels to a record high during this upcoming holiday period. Between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve 2016, there are 2 additional operating days, and we expect to complete over 700 million deliveries worldwide, about 100 million more than last year. In the overall U.S. market, the National Retail Federation expects total holiday retail sales to increase 3.6%. They are also estimating nonstore retail sales growth between 7% and 10%. 
At UPS, our peak strategies are focused on executing the 4 Cs that David mentioned earlier. To begin with, we've deepened the level of collaboration with even more customers. We started earlier and are communicating more frequently. This better aligns UPS solutions and capacity with their seasonal promotion plans and fulfillment strategies, helping customers ship demand, sell inventory earlier and optimize their operations.
Customer experience continues to gain importance in the marketplace, making collaboration a shared objective for both shippers and UPS. Whether you're in health care, retail or any industry, our work together is creating consumer loyalty and a preference for the UPS delivery experience.
Looking at our second area of focus, capacity, UPS customers will benefit from several key automation and expansion projects. We've opened new automated facilities and updated existing hubs in the U.S. and Europe, in cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Paris and London. In the U.S., we are supplementing our capacity with the addition of temporary facilities. These investments in technology and capacity make our integrated network more flexible and efficient.
This peak, our partners at Coyote Logistics will be supporting our entire Domestic operation, helping UPS solve customer needs during this high demand period. In addition, our driver dispatch will be even more effective. I'm pleased to announce that we've completed Phase 1 of the ORION implementation in the U.S. ahead of schedule. 100% of eligible U.S. drivers will be utilizing this dispatch technology during peak, up from 70% last year. 
The third focus area is control, both control of deliveries for UPS customers and control of the UPS network. UPS My Choice will provide greater control to 30 million global members, an increase of 10 million from last year. My Choice enables members to exert preferences with their inbound UPS shipment and take action on their packages when desired. They can choose to redirect deliveries to alternate delivery locations, including a UPS Access Point location. In fact, this year, we've expanded our reach, and we'll have over 27,000 convenient Access Point locations open around the world, with approximately 8,000 in the U.S.
Looking at the UPS network, we are exercising real-time control to ensure our customers can properly respond to peak demand, and one important tool we use is the UPS control tower. This decision-making body enables us to say yes to more customer requests, leveraging the flexibility of our operations to accept volume surges when possible. It also assures that our capacity, value, cost to serve and price are appropriately aligned throughout peak season. 
The final area of focus for UPS is commitment. The 450,000 UPS employees, together with 95,000 temporary hires, will be working diligently to provide world-class value and service during this upcoming holiday season. Each year, the needs of peak season create special memories for all UPSers. Last year, I had a chance to visit the building I started in 27 years ago. The same energy, determination and customer focus that I was drawn to, Day 1, was clear in everyone I met.  Spending time making deliveries really reinforced to me how the peak planning and collaboration with customers resonates throughout the entire organization. 
Thank you for your time today. And I want to assure you that the UPS team is ready to deliver another successful peak season. Now I'll turn it over to Richard."
238570,403459825,1063581,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kate. UPS performed as we projected this quarter, with total reported revenue up about 5% and daily shipments up almost 6%. The International segment produced another quarter of double-digit profit expansion, and the U.S. Domestic delivered result",985,"Thanks, Kate. UPS performed as we projected this quarter, with total reported revenue up about 5% and daily shipments up almost 6%. The International segment produced another quarter of double-digit profit expansion, and the U.S. Domestic delivered results as we had anticipated, while Supply Chain & Freight results were somewhat below expectations.
UPS third quarter earnings per share were up about 4%. In 2016, the EPS change across the enterprise was lowered by headwinds in the U.S. Domestic business and approximately $0.02 due to discrete tax credits taken in 2015. This was a good quarter. UPS generated strong top line revenue, great momentum in our International business and solid results from the other segments. 
Now for a closer look at how the segments performed. U.S. Domestic revenue increased 4.8%, driven by daily package gains of 5.7%. All products contributed to volume growth, with Deferred Air up more than 10%, Next Day Air up almost 6% and Ground up 5.2%. Growth was balanced from enterprise and middle market customers. 
High demand for online retailers was evident as B2C deliveries were up 11%. Despite negative industrial production, B2B deliveries were up 2%, with the majority of the increase driven by our e-commerce return portfolio.
Base rate improvements were able to somewhat offset lower fuel surcharges and the drag from a changing product mix. As a result, revenue per package was up about 1%. E-commerce customers are helping drive higher daily shipments across our entire portfolio of services, from high single-digit growth in air products to a 20% jump in our most economical product, SurePost. 
Even with the accelerated growth of e-commerce, our investments in ORION continue to allow UPS to bend the cost curve lower and create positive return. ORION added efficiency again this quarter. Delivery stops and volume were both up 5.7%, yet ORION held package miles to only a 1.4% increase. Direct labor hours also grew slower than the average daily volume growth. 
As we guided, operating profit growth comparisons with 2015 were restrained by 1 less operating day in 2016 and higher casualty credits realized last year. Excluding these profit headwinds, operating margins expanded as we took advantage of the benefits of our investments.
Now for some details on the International segment, where we had another record, with double-digit operating profit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. Profit jumped 14%, as shipments climbed 7.5%. Revenue was up more than 3% on a currency-neutral basis and fuel surcharge did decline, lowering the growth rate by about 70 basis points.
U.S. export packages per day rose over 7%, growth was well-balanced on solid shipment out of Asia and across Europe. The non-U.S. Domestic product increased 7.8% as we transitioned through pricing actions we took in 2015. This quarter, it shows it's about getting the right volume in our network. Our International segment is delivering balanced results, with great growth and superior returns.
Let's turn and look at the Supply Chain & Freight segment now. The segment produced top line growth of 8.1%, primarily driven by the Coyote acquisition. Economic conditions in the U.S. truckload and LTL market, as well as the International Air Freight business, continued to place downward pressure on demand. 
The Forwarding unit remained disciplined on revenue management and cost controls. Gains from the small and medium-sized customers reduced the year-over-year shortfall in total tonnage. UPS Freight has been adversely impacted by industry conditions, seeing total tonnage drop. However, they are executing a disciplined middle-market strategy which has resulted in revenue per hundredweight pricing improvements of 3.7% this quarter.
Turning to our Distribution group, revenue growth was broad-based, with contributions from almost all sectors. The business unit maintained its industry-leading margins in the mid-to upper single digits. 
Now to update you on our cash position. UPS again generated healthy free cash flow. Through the first 9 months, we produced $3.6 billion after investing over $1.8 billion in capital expenditures. Please note that we accelerated our planned discretionary pension contribution to September, this allows us to capture additional financial benefits in 2016. UPS also repurchased 19.5 million shares for $2 billion, and paid out another $2 billion in dividends, up 7% per share over the last year. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate total operating profit growth to be slightly higher than our full year guidance of 6% to 8%. Supply Chain & Freight is continuing to manage through industry challenges, and is expected to produce modest low single-digit revenue expansion while holding operating margins flat with last year.
For the full year, the macro environment is suppressing revenue growth. Therefore, Supply Chain & Freight operating profit is anticipated to be slightly below 2015 levels. We are projecting an effective tax rate for UPS of 35% in the fourth quarter. Due to the unknowns related to the mark-to-market at year-end, we are not able to provide guidance on our GAAP earnings per share. However, we are affirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5.70 to $5.90. 
In summary, on a year-to-date basis, our business is adapting to the opportunities and challenges presented by the high-growth digital economy. We continue to produce the industry's best margins and create great free cash flow. As we look at the fourth quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver another outstanding peak season for both our customers and our investors. 
Before we take your questions, I want to take a moment to announce our plans to hold an investor conference in early 2017. On February 21, in New York, we'll have a half-day conference. David, along with the senior leaders and myself, will be on hand to lay out our recent progress and update you on our strategy. We'll plan to allow ample time for your questions.

It's an interesting topic, given you haven't ordered planes for quite a while. I wanted to get your thoughts on maybe the implications of that and some of the assumptions you make when you order long-lasting, long-lived assets like that. So does this imply that you would think that the strong growth in air volumes would continue and then -- if you look out the next 5 years? Is that kind of a reasonable implication? And also in terms of your largest customer who has been adding aircraft, is there an implication that you're not particularly concerned about share with that customer? So just wondered if you could talk about the kind of assumptions underlying that sizeable plane order that you announced this morning."

When you look at it on balance, since 2008, the International export volume has grown over 40%, U.S. Domestic has had 20% growth, and our block hours are actually down over 3%. It actually speaks to our abilities to optimize our networks around the world and accommodate the tremendous growth that we've seen. So going with a larger aircraft, which is the -8, really was a smart choice for us. Obviously, given the ability to put a larger plane on the lanes that have greater needs allows us to reduce the number of frequencies for those routes. In addition to that, the -8 will give us an ability to cascade capacity throughout our entire network. We plan to deploy these first aircraft into our International segments, and it will allow us to bring back our current 747-400s to the U.S. that will give us capacity throughout the entire system. In addition to that, it's a much smarter choice because it allows us to take the current -4 pilots, who will require a very minimum amount of additional training, who can then fly the -8. So we believe it was a very smart choice for us. And I'll hand it off to Alan who can talk about growth."

However, we're not guiding any different for 2016. It's in the $2.8 billion we've been talking about, because a portion of it is paid this year. And the most important thing to remember here is we're great stewards of capital. We had not bought a plane in 2013 until today. But since 1989, that was the very first time, since we've been an airline, that we were able to continue to create efficiencies within our network. So when you take what David had mentioned, the 15% increase in demand, it was time to look at what is the next thing we needed to do. And at the same time, we continue to have above-market growth in these products, and we'll have positive returns.

But we did have another great quarter. Seventh quarter in a row. But the International operating margin was pushed a little higher because of the multiyear hedge strategy that we employed -- we have been employing for many years. We've been talking about that all year. And one of the challenges, of course, is the volatility. The euro and the sterling is at historical rates, and it's brought it down. So we expect 2017 to have a transition where we'll see just over $300 million impact to the growth in the profit. That being said, when you step back for a moment, we continue to see the operating margin expand. Even adjusting for the hedge, we're talking about operating margins between 16% and 17%, which is industry-leading for international business. It's broad-based. It's because of the revenue growth, getting the right volume in our network and managing our cost efficiently. And so when we think about the fourth quarter, we expect that they'll continue to stay at the high end of their range. And I'm going to ask Jim to talk a little about specifically the business."

We mentioned, David did in the beginning, that a couple of pockets across the world from Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific, and specifically China and Hong Kong for us right now, are growing at rates we've never seen before. But more importantly, it's coming from our middle markets there. Historically, we've had big enterprise growth as supply chains expanded across the world. But we're really becoming more local in a lot of these markets. So our -- some of those bigger markets, like China, we're seeing middle market growth rates at 20% and 30% year-over-year. So that's great for us. Europe continues to speed itself up. Again, in some of the opening comments, we've taken a look at the network and continue to speed it up. And obviously, we have. We're up to about 80% of the cities in Europe we can reach by 2 days in the ground network there, and we'll continue to invest there. So all in all, we think the fourth quarter will be great. And we'll continue on, absent the currency headwinds that Richard has mentioned, to continue the growth in the International segment."

This is Myron, I'll start with automation first. We are continuing to make good progress with our long-term initiatives to add more capacity, offer greater efficiency in our integrated network by introducing automation throughout our top tier 30 hubs across the U.S., where we process as much as 60% through those locations. I mentioned earlier that we've announced 12 automated facilities this year, including 4 this quarter. We're on pace, and we're making great progress. Those include retrofitting, expansion and, in some cases, new facilities. And again, we're getting as much as 25% production improvements in those locations. This, of course, allows us to have additional flexibilities and reduce handles in the network. When it comes to the use of drones as well as vehicles that allow us to have autonomous trucks on the road, we have experimented with drones with a number of vendors. You should have seen an announcement when we launched a first try in the Northeast earlier this year, it was very successful, as well as our use in delivering medications in Africa. So we'll continue to experiment until we get the ability to use it. As it pertains to vehicles, we're continuing to work with a number of vendors to explore what works best for us. We have what we term as a roaming laboratory. We have over 6,500 vehicles in the U.S. right now that are considered CNG, LNG and the sort. Of course, all of these will require the approval from the national highway and traffic association. So when it becomes available to us, we certainly expect to be ready."

We talked about, in our investor conference a few years ago and throughout each year, that we're investing; and year-over-year, we're having to reinvest to get to the endpoint. And all of that together, along with things like SurePost Redirect and the ability to take almost 1/3 of the volume that's destined to be delivered by the Post Office, and we put it in our system because we're already going to those stops, those are all key components of how we're going to continue to improve the margin. And really, it's a long-term story that we're talking about. Earlier, I actually mentioned, and perhaps I said the wrong year, that we do expect margin expansion for the entire year of 2016.

This aircraft addition and the -- our longer-term initiative, but also the -- what we're doing internationally in Europe with the $2 billion worth of CapEx that we're spending, we're getting a lot of returns on that and we're going to continue to focus on those growth markets.
And then, of course, we're committed to our shareholders, our customers and our employees. So we've had a good year so far. We have had good momentum going into the fourth quarter, and we look forward to having a very successful fourth quarter. Thank you very much for your time."

I'm pleased with our performance and happy to report another quarter of solid UPS earnings. These results demonstrate increased demand for our products and disciplined execution of our initiatives.

These results demonstrate increased demand for our products and disciplined execution of our initiatives. I'll provide an update of our Q3 highlights, and then Kate will give you an update on peak season. 
During Q3, the International segment increased operating profit by 14% on more than 7% package volume growth. Our International strategy is achieving outstanding results. This was the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit expansion. Yes, I said seven consecutive quarters of International operating profit growth. 
The U.S. Domestic business produced higher-than-anticipated package volume, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of e-commerce solutions. We continue to see increased demand for our air products, and this quarter was no exception. Shippers are choosing UPS air products because our value is a differentiator. 
The Supply Chain & Freight segment is navigating prolonged weak market conditions. They are making progress in adapting their business model and focusing on capturing the right revenue opportunities. We're confident in our long-term strategies, and as a result of our performance this quarter, we remain on plan with this year's guidance.
Turning now to the economy, where global growth has continued to be modest. In the U.S., consumer fundamentals remain healthy and accounted for most of the economic expansion, while the outlook for industrial production remains weak. Overall, global GDP forecasts are slightly down. For the balance of 2016, we continue to see mixed economic signals across some industrial markets. Under these conditions, our diversified business model and our winning strategies still enable UPS to take advantage of high-growth markets, such as cross-border trade and e-commerce.
To facilitate growth, we are adding capacity and increasing efficiency in our globally integrated network. Trade lane and product portfolio enhancements are important components of our plans. We have significantly improved time-in-transit from several cities in the U.S. to Canada based on increased export opportunities. We have also dramatically improved service times for cross-border shipments between several major European cities. 
During the quarter, we strengthened our portfolio of urgent delivery options by expanding our Worldwide Express Plus product. We've doubled the number of countries served, and are now reaching 90% of the world's GDP by the next day. We've also expanded solutions for specialized shippers by strengthening our clinical trial service used by pharmaceutical companies. We see excellent opportunities for growth in this part of the health care segment. Our actions are providing more delivery options, faster transit times and earlier guaranteed deliveries, helping UPS customers achieve their growth objectives.
In addition, we're following a disciplined capital approach to invest in our business. In 2016, we announced 12 highly-automated facility upgrades as part of our multiyear strategy, and we plan to announce several significant new projects before the end of the year. These projects will help us to increase operating efficiency, while simultaneously better serving our customers.
Expectations in the e-commerce sector and specialized markets, like health care logistics, have continued to shift to faster delivery options. As a result, demand for both domestic and international air products has been strong. Since we took delivery of our last new plane in 2013, UPS air products have increased more than 15%. Clearly, over the last several years, UPS has expanded market share in the air segment, and we expect these trends to continue. 
In response, we're announcing the purchase of 14 Boeing 747-8 jumbo freighters, along with options to buy 14 more in the future. We will take delivery of the first 2 at the end of 2017. This is a net add to our fleet. These new 747s will enable UPS to begin a cascade of aircraft route assignments that will add significant capacity in our busiest lanes. This will optimize global air network capacity, these [ph] new cargo jets. All of these investments are in line to meet expanding customer needs and produce positive financial returns.
Looking now at the upcoming holiday season, we have created extensive peak season plans and built the foundation for another successful holiday for our customers and shareowners. Our strategy is to follow the same framework outlined last year. It's the 4 Cs: collaboration, capacity, control and commitment.
To conclude, I want to recognize the hard-working and dedicated UPSers around the world for the progress we've made year-to-date, and to thank them in advance for their commitment to another successful peak season.
And now Kate will update you on our peak plans."
238570,403459825,1064454,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to review our 2016 peak season plans with you. The dramatic growth of online shopping and subsequent returns is expected to lift UPS package levels to a record high during this upcoming holiday",659,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to review our 2016 peak season plans with you. 
The dramatic growth of online shopping and subsequent returns is expected to lift UPS package levels to a record high during this upcoming holiday period. Between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve 2016, there are 2 additional operating days, and we expect to complete over 700 million deliveries worldwide, about 100 million more than last year. In the overall U.S. market, the National Retail Federation expects total holiday retail sales to increase 3.6%. They are also estimating nonstore retail sales growth between 7% and 10%. 
At UPS, our peak strategies are focused on executing the 4 Cs that David mentioned earlier. To begin with, we've deepened the level of collaboration with even more customers. We started earlier and are communicating more frequently. This better aligns UPS solutions and capacity with their seasonal promotion plans and fulfillment strategies, helping customers ship demand, sell inventory earlier and optimize their operations.
Customer experience continues to gain importance in the marketplace, making collaboration a shared objective for both shippers and UPS. Whether you're in health care, retail or any industry, our work together is creating consumer loyalty and a preference for the UPS delivery experience.
Looking at our second area of focus, capacity, UPS customers will benefit from several key automation and expansion projects. We've opened new automated facilities and updated existing hubs in the U.S. and Europe, in cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Paris and London. In the U.S., we are supplementing our capacity with the addition of temporary facilities. These investments in technology and capacity make our integrated network more flexible and efficient.
This peak, our partners at Coyote Logistics will be supporting our entire Domestic operation, helping UPS solve customer needs during this high demand period. In addition, our driver dispatch will be even more effective. I'm pleased to announce that we've completed Phase 1 of the ORION implementation in the U.S. ahead of schedule. 100% of eligible U.S. drivers will be utilizing this dispatch technology during peak, up from 70% last year. 
The third focus area is control, both control of deliveries for UPS customers and control of the UPS network. UPS My Choice will provide greater control to 30 million global members, an increase of 10 million from last year. My Choice enables members to exert preferences with their inbound UPS shipment and take action on their packages when desired. They can choose to redirect deliveries to alternate delivery locations, including a UPS Access Point location. In fact, this year, we've expanded our reach, and we'll have over 27,000 convenient Access Point locations open around the world, with approximately 8,000 in the U.S.
Looking at the UPS network, we are exercising real-time control to ensure our customers can properly respond to peak demand, and one important tool we use is the UPS control tower. This decision-making body enables us to say yes to more customer requests, leveraging the flexibility of our operations to accept volume surges when possible. It also assures that our capacity, value, cost to serve and price are appropriately aligned throughout peak season. 
The final area of focus for UPS is commitment. The 450,000 UPS employees, together with 95,000 temporary hires, will be working diligently to provide world-class value and service during this upcoming holiday season. Each year, the needs of peak season create special memories for all UPSers. Last year, I had a chance to visit the building I started in 27 years ago. The same energy, determination and customer focus that I was drawn to, Day 1, was clear in everyone I met.  Spending time making deliveries really reinforced to me how the peak planning and collaboration with customers resonates throughout the entire organization. 
Thank you for your time today. And I want to assure you that the UPS team is ready to deliver another successful peak season. Now I'll turn it over to Richard."
238570,403459825,1064454,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kate. UPS performed as we projected this quarter, with total reported revenue up about 5% and daily shipments up almost 6%. The International segment produced another quarter of double-digit profit expansion, and the U.S. Domestic delivered result",985,"Thanks, Kate. UPS performed as we projected this quarter, with total reported revenue up about 5% and daily shipments up almost 6%. The International segment produced another quarter of double-digit profit expansion, and the U.S. Domestic delivered results as we had anticipated, while Supply Chain & Freight results were somewhat below expectations.
UPS third quarter earnings per share were up about 4%. In 2016, the EPS change across the enterprise was lowered by headwinds in the U.S. Domestic business and approximately $0.02 due to discrete tax credits taken in 2015. This was a good quarter. UPS generated strong top line revenue, great momentum in our International business and solid results from the other segments. 
Now for a closer look at how the segments performed. U.S. Domestic revenue increased 4.8%, driven by daily package gains of 5.7%. All products contributed to volume growth, with Deferred Air up more than 10%, Next Day Air up almost 6% and Ground up 5.2%. Growth was balanced from enterprise and middle market customers. 
High demand for online retailers was evident as B2C deliveries were up 11%. Despite negative industrial production, B2B deliveries were up 2%, with the majority of the increase driven by our e-commerce return portfolio.
Base rate improvements were able to somewhat offset lower fuel surcharges and the drag from a changing product mix. As a result, revenue per package was up about 1%. E-commerce customers are helping drive higher daily shipments across our entire portfolio of services, from high single-digit growth in air products to a 20% jump in our most economical product, SurePost. 
Even with the accelerated growth of e-commerce, our investments in ORION continue to allow UPS to bend the cost curve lower and create positive return. ORION added efficiency again this quarter. Delivery stops and volume were both up 5.7%, yet ORION held package miles to only a 1.4% increase. Direct labor hours also grew slower than the average daily volume growth. 
As we guided, operating profit growth comparisons with 2015 were restrained by 1 less operating day in 2016 and higher casualty credits realized last year. Excluding these profit headwinds, operating margins expanded as we took advantage of the benefits of our investments.
Now for some details on the International segment, where we had another record, with double-digit operating profit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. Profit jumped 14%, as shipments climbed 7.5%. Revenue was up more than 3% on a currency-neutral basis and fuel surcharge did decline, lowering the growth rate by about 70 basis points.
U.S. export packages per day rose over 7%, growth was well-balanced on solid shipment out of Asia and across Europe. The non-U.S. Domestic product increased 7.8% as we transitioned through pricing actions we took in 2015. This quarter, it shows it's about getting the right volume in our network. Our International segment is delivering balanced results, with great growth and superior returns.
Let's turn and look at the Supply Chain & Freight segment now. The segment produced top line growth of 8.1%, primarily driven by the Coyote acquisition. Economic conditions in the U.S. truckload and LTL market, as well as the International Air Freight business, continued to place downward pressure on demand. 
The Forwarding unit remained disciplined on revenue management and cost controls. Gains from the small and medium-sized customers reduced the year-over-year shortfall in total tonnage. UPS Freight has been adversely impacted by industry conditions, seeing total tonnage drop. However, they are executing a disciplined middle-market strategy which has resulted in revenue per hundredweight pricing improvements of 3.7% this quarter.
Turning to our Distribution group, revenue growth was broad-based, with contributions from almost all sectors. The business unit maintained its industry-leading margins in the mid-to upper single digits. 
Now to update you on our cash position. UPS again generated healthy free cash flow. Through the first 9 months, we produced $3.6 billion after investing over $1.8 billion in capital expenditures. Please note that we accelerated our planned discretionary pension contribution to September, this allows us to capture additional financial benefits in 2016. UPS also repurchased 19.5 million shares for $2 billion, and paid out another $2 billion in dividends, up 7% per share over the last year. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate total operating profit growth to be slightly higher than our full year guidance of 6% to 8%. Supply Chain & Freight is continuing to manage through industry challenges, and is expected to produce modest low single-digit revenue expansion while holding operating margins flat with last year.
For the full year, the macro environment is suppressing revenue growth. Therefore, Supply Chain & Freight operating profit is anticipated to be slightly below 2015 levels. We are projecting an effective tax rate for UPS of 35% in the fourth quarter. Due to the unknowns related to the mark-to-market at year-end, we are not able to provide guidance on our GAAP earnings per share. However, we are affirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5.70 to $5.90. 
In summary, on a year-to-date basis, our business is adapting to the opportunities and challenges presented by the high-growth digital economy. We continue to produce the industry's best margins and create great free cash flow. As we look at the fourth quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver another outstanding peak season for both our customers and our investors. 
Before we take your questions, I want to take a moment to announce our plans to hold an investor conference in early 2017. On February 21, in New York, we'll have a half-day conference. David, along with the senior leaders and myself, will be on hand to lay out our recent progress and update you on our strategy. We'll plan to allow ample time for your questions. Later today, the IR team will send out invitations with further details.

It's an interesting topic, given you haven't ordered planes for quite a while. I wanted to get your thoughts on maybe the implications of that and some of the assumptions you make when you order long-lasting, long-lived assets like that. So does this imply that you would think that the strong growth in air volumes would continue and then -- if you look out the next 5 years? Is that kind of a reasonable implication? And also in terms of your largest customer who has been adding aircraft, is there an implication that you're not particularly concerned about share with that customer? So just wondered if you could talk about the kind of assumptions underlying that sizeable plane order that you announced this morning."

When you look at it on balance, since 2008, the International export volume has grown over 40%, U.S. Domestic has had 20% growth, and our block hours are actually down over 3%. It actually speaks to our abilities to optimize our networks around the world and accommodate the tremendous growth that we've seen. So going with a larger aircraft, which is the -8, really was a smart choice for us. Obviously, given the ability to put a larger plane on the lanes that have greater needs allows us to reduce the number of frequencies for those routes. In addition to that, the -8 will give us an ability to cascade capacity throughout our entire network. We plan to deploy these first aircraft into our International segments, and it will allow us to bring back our current 747-400s to the U.S. that will give us capacity throughout the entire system. In addition to that, it's a much smarter choice because it allows us to take the current -4 pilots, who will require a very minimum amount of additional training, who can then fly the -8. So we believe it was a very smart choice for us. And I'll hand it off to Alan who can talk about growth."

And the most important thing to remember here is we're great stewards of capital. We had not bought a plane in 2013 until today. But since 1989, that was the very first time, since we've been an airline, that we were able to continue to create efficiencies within our network. So when you take what David had mentioned, the 15% increase in demand, it was time to look at what is the next thing we needed to do. And at the same time, we continue to have above-market growth in these products, and we'll have positive returns. But we will update you further as we bring the entire enterprise story together in the next few months."

We also use a lot of belly space in different pieces of our enterprise, in Supply Chain & Freight, where we use a combination of brown tails and commercial lift. But the really important thing here is we tend to look at all the scenarios and determine what's the best economic return, and it goes right back to the return on invested capital, when is the right time to put new assets in, how are we going to fill them, are we already filling them because of our growth rate. And when you have all of that put together, that's why in 2013 we paused, and it made sense, and we could adjust and cascade around our own network because there was many changing dynamics within the market for over the last 3 years.

So I'll start with this answer, and then I'll turn it over to Alan Gershenhorn. And of course, I'll begin that Amazon is a good customer of ours, and we do have -- believe we have a strong mutually beneficial relationship, and that our integrated network creates efficiencies and really gives them and our other customers a value proposition that we believe is unmatched. So going back to an earlier question about the aircraft and tying in to Amazon, I don't think that we've wrapped [ph] up at that point.

We've been talking about that all year. And one of the challenges, of course, is the volatility. The euro and the sterling is at historical rates, and it's brought it down. So we expect 2017 to have a transition where we'll see just over $300 million impact to the growth in the profit. That being said, when you step back for a moment, we continue to see the operating margin expand. Even adjusting for the hedge, we're talking about operating margins between 16% and 17%, which is industry-leading for international business. It's broad-based. It's because of the revenue growth, getting the right volume in our network and managing our cost efficiently.

Asia Pacific, and specifically China and Hong Kong for us right now, are growing at rates we've never seen before. But more importantly, it's coming from our middle markets there. Historically, we've had big enterprise growth as supply chains expanded across the world. But we're really becoming more local in a lot of these markets. So our -- some of those bigger markets, like China, we're seeing middle market growth rates at 20% and 30% year-over-year. So that's great for us. Europe continues to speed itself up. Again, in some of the opening comments, we've taken a look at the network and continue to speed it up. And obviously, we have. We're up to about 80% of the cities in Europe we can reach by 2 days in the ground network there, and we'll continue to invest there. So all in all, we think the fourth quarter will be great.

This is Myron, I'll start with automation first. We are continuing to make good progress with our long-term initiatives to add more capacity, offer greater efficiency in our integrated network by introducing automation throughout our top tier 30 hubs across the U.S., where we process as much as 60% through those locations. I mentioned earlier that we've announced 12 automated facilities this year, including 4 this quarter. We're on pace, and we're making great progress. Those include retrofitting, expansion and, in some cases, new facilities. And again, we're getting as much as 25% production improvements in those locations. This, of course, allows us to have additional flexibilities and reduce handles in the network. When it comes to the use of drones as well as vehicles that allow us to have autonomous trucks on the road, we have experimented with drones with a number of vendors. You should have seen an announcement when we launched a first try in the Northeast earlier this year, it was very successful, as well as our use in delivering medications in Africa. So we'll continue to experiment until we get the ability to use it. As it pertains to vehicles, we're continuing to work with a number of vendors to explore what works best for us. We have what we term as a roaming laboratory. We have over 6,500 vehicles in the U.S. right now that are considered CNG, LNG and the sort.

Is there a change in that dynamic where we can actually start to get stop density? Or has competitive factors, like the Post Office and maybe even Amazon doing more on their own, just impacted the ability for you guys to take higher margins?"

When you think about what's happening with density, Kate talked about the Access Points and taking what was a B2C to B2R, and that's helping on density, and we are seeing an improvement on B2C density that we haven't seen in many, many years. On top of that, we continue invest in the automation both at the hubs, ORION that Myron talked about, and all of that really is about improving the margin. We talked about, in our investor conference a few years ago and throughout each year, that we're investing; and year-over-year, we're having to reinvest to get to the endpoint. And all of that together, along with things like SurePost Redirect and the ability to take almost 1/3 of the volume that's destined to be delivered by the Post Office, and we put it in our system because we're already going to those stops, those are all key components of how we're going to continue to improve the margin. And really, it's a long-term story that we're talking about. Earlier, I actually mentioned, and perhaps I said the wrong year, that we do expect margin expansion for the entire year of 2016. And that's why we guided the way we did for the fourth quarter, expect a little bit better performance in the fourth quarter, and we'll have 3 of the 4 quarters in 2016 with margin expansion that all adds to margin expansion for the year."

Yes, so the SurePost Redirect program continues to work. As Rich just stated, when we redirect, we've already got a package going to that particular consumer, so it's very, very accretive to us to reroute that package back through the UPS network and avoid having to pay any postal fees at that particular point. And we're up around 30%. We're continuing to investigate new and better ways to improve that. And then we've also got other methodologies, like UPS Access Point that Kate mentioned, to build density as well as our synchronized delivery solutions. So it's really about bending the cost curve and increasing the density on our B2C shipments."

So it's -- the growth in that particular market tracks very closely to the growth in e-commerce on that 1:5, 1:6 ratio. Those packages are highly profitable. First of all, many of those packages get dropped off and don't have to be picked up because the consumer find it more convenient to drop them off at UPS stores or UPS Access Points or hand them to a UPS driver. So there's very little cost when it comes to pick up. And then obviously, the deliveries are going back to businesses and we could be delivering tens or hundreds of packages back to these businesses.

And the way the rules work is you have to have certain information you need to convey around the GAAP side. It really is too early, and that's why there wasn't anything in the report about what we thought the mark-to-market would be. Because there's so many things that aren't even finished yet for us to know where we would be. For example, return on assets and discount rates. And if you go back last year, this time, and where we are today and where we ended the year, the discount rates changed a lot. And of course, last year, the market changed the other direction, unfortunately. So there are so many unknowns right now, it's really impossible to sit here and say, ""This is what we think it's going to be."" That all being said, what we were doing with -- and what we put in the press release, was if you look at the underlying core business, we're confirming that our adjusted earnings per share guidance is right in where we expected it to be, and that's because the investments that we've put in the last few years are creating the returns, and that's why we're going to see the margin expansion and that's why we've guided the way we have."
