This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison,",1670,"Good morning, everyone and welcome to our First Quarter 2015 [ph] Earnings Conference Call. This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. 
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, who will be phoning in from Italy; as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, who heads up our Investor Relations, here in Miami. 
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. 
Our company is off to a strong start this year, with first quarter adjusted earnings nearly doubled the prior year and well above the high end of our December guidance range. The first quarter result combined with our strong book position has enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our full year earnings expectations. 
I'm proud to acknowledge all of our employees globally for the industry-leading guest experience [indiscernible] that are central to our sustained earnings improvement. I especially thank our travel agent partners for the critical role they play in connecting guests with our great brand experience. 
It was reinforcing to see revenue yield growth of 5.7% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit yield improvement. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements in our core Caribbean itinerary which represents 47% of our first quarter [ph] deployment. We drove revenue yield growth at Costa by creating relative scarcity through our brand team success in increasing demand via our ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with new impactful creative featuring Shakira. While at the same time, we reduced supply in the more challenging trading environment in Southern Europe by transferring Costa capacity to China. 
As you recall, our Costa brand was the first global cruise line to home port in China back in 2006. Today, we are the largest in China and the first global cruise company with 6 ships based there across 2 our brands, Costa and Princess, representing nearly half of the Chinese cruise industry. 
While it represents less than 5% of our global capacity, for us, China continues to be a promising unit growth opportunity. China has quickly become the world's largest outbound travel market at an estimated 135 million strong, yet just over 1 million cruise today. We expect to continue our growth over time and have further plans for AIDA and Carnival Cruise Lines to enter China in the near future. 
China contributed to our strong quarterly results. We have [indiscernible] over 60% more capacity there and enjoyed strong profit improvement and return on invested capital accretion. At the same time, the capacity shift to China help create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. 
Beyond China during the quarter, we made further progress globally in creating demand for all of our brands at excess of measured capacity growth. Part of that demand creation is the excitement around the much anticipated delivery of AIDAprima. And I can tell you, she is well worth the wait. The ship is absolutely fantastic. The first of the next generation platform for AIDA that combines leading-edge environmental attributes and well-designed features that foster an exceptional guest experience. 
All of our features, whether raising water flies, [indiscernible] multiple, climbing walls, an expensive German spa, an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling and even a traditional Christmas market, together, create an experience that truly resonates with [indiscernible] that is nearly exclusively German guests. 
And we have additional opportunity for demand creation just for few short days with the delivery of Holland America's new flagship, Koningsdam. Koningsdam was designed as Holland American guest in mind and reintroduce Holland America to those who have yet to experience our award winning service, our 5-star dining, our extensive enrichment program and compelling worldwide itineraries. 
Our new flagship will offer fine dining in several alternative restaurants, including a new French seafood [indiscernible] and a new immersive far in the table dinner experience in the Culinary Arts Center. 
Part of enhancing an already great Holland America experience includes taking onboard entertainment to a whole new level. We have carefully engineered a new [indiscernible] which showcases different genres offering chamber music in Lincoln Center Stage, rocking the crowd with [indiscernible] and instant billboard on board and bringing the best of Memphis music to see in our popular B.B. King's Blues Club. 
Responding to our guest, our new flagship will future Holland America Lines first ever purpose-built [indiscernible] for families as well as single stay bedrooms. 
Newbuilds will also provide additional demand creation opportunities later this year as well, with the delivery of Carnival Vista followed by Seabourn Encore. When it comes to shift, newbuild are not the only way to simulate demand creation. We continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences including the recently recreation of Holland America's [indiscernible] incorporating many of the same experiences on board as Koningsdam. In addition, we are ongoing an extensive remastering of Q North, Queen Mary 2 later this year. 
Destination is also been a powerful tool for demand creation as well especially when combined with the attractive public relations. Last week, we made history when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 50 years to receive cumulative approval to bring U.S. cruise guests directly from the U.S. to Cuba. 
We made worldwide news, showcasing cruise on a very positive light, with nearly 5 billion media impressions [indiscernible]. We very much look forward to launching our historic Cuba inaugural seasonal [indiscernible] initially with itineraries including Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. We believe there is no better way to experience so much of Cuba in 7 days than with the enriching guest experience in our premium fathom brand. 
As the Adonia just carries 700 guests per sailing, if you have any interest in seeing Cuba through an extraordinary family experience, I sincerely recommend you book now. 
Concerning the future of cruises in Cuba, we have already begun the process for approval for other brands for sail for Cuba in the months and years ahead. 
Now beyond ships and destinations, our ongoing marketing and promotional efforts are also part of demand creation. As part of our effort to keep cruise in the forefront of vacationers minds, [indiscernible] is airing a new reality-based show on prime time U.K. television entitled The Cruise. The documentary falls [indiscernible] with our early to guest on board Regal Princess through a 6 week series. In fact, we've already seen a 40% [ph] increase in web traffic for Princess in the U.K. since the show began airing. 
Also airing in the U.K., P&O Cruises Battleships, a new cookery concept [indiscernible] on board with [indiscernible], featuring 5 celebrities testing their culinary skills and judged by celebrity chef, Marco Pierre White. 
In Italy, Casa Fortunate will set up a major motion picture for [indiscernible], holidays in the Caribbean, launched early in the quarter, partially cast with Costa crew members. More recently, an episode on Italian reality TV, [indiscernible], the Colors of Love, was based on the love story between 2 young Costa crew members who met on board. 
In North America, just last week, Carnival Cruise Lines featured nightly on the [indiscernible] television show, [indiscernible] Fortune. While early in the quarter, Carnival announced an exceptional partnership with Grammy award-winning country music superstar, Carrie Underwood, and operation home front, supporting our U.S. Military personnel. Media coverage from that announcement alone generated more than 1 billion media impressions and our Carnival brand continues to outperform. 
Also in North America, we partnered with AT&T and Samsung to create a virtual reality experience that showcase in nearly 1,200 AT&T stores, promoting consideration for cruise by allowing new-to-cruise to virtually experience a cruise vacation. We estimate nearly 400,000 people have already have the virtually reality experience, showcasing our portfolio of leading brands. All of these efforts heighten global awareness and consideration for our [indiscernible] cruise line as we continue to capture a greater share of the vacation suitcase. 
During the quarter, we continue to make progress on cross brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues. And in summer of 2016, will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory. The prototype will [indiscernible] yield uplift as well as aspiring [indiscernible] for final system development. Since most of the shifts will [indiscernible] will be behind us by the summer, we look forward to a greater contribution on this effort in 2017. 
And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We have negotiations underway on 16 separate purchasing categories, with 22 more RFPs outstanding. All of which will contribute to our outstated [ph] $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. 
Our ongoing operational improvement is a testament of the success of our combined efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth and to leverage our scale. The strong first quarter we have enjoyed affirms our conviction to deliver this year's earnings forecast and accelerates progress toward double-digit return on invested capital. We remain well on track for the delivery of over 8.5% return on invested capital this year and crossing the double-digit threshold in the next 2 to 3 years. At the same time, we have accelerated our return of capital to shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we have completed our first $1 million share repurchase authorization and are well into our second billion, bringing the cumulative total of purchase to date to $1.3 billion and approximately 27 million shares. We plan to continue to return free cash flow to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our target range. 
And now, I will turn the call over to David."

Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide som",973,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends. And finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. 
Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.39. This was $0.09 above the midpoint of our December guidance despite a $0.01 drag from foreign [ph] currency. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: $0.07 from net ticket revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic; and $0.03 from lower net cruise costs excluding fuel as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. Our total net revenue yields were up 5.7%. 
Let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up almost 7%. As Arnold indicated, we enjoyed ticket price improvements on both sides of the Atlantic. The increase was driven by the strength in pricing in the Caribbean, which represented 47% of our capacity in the quarter. In addition, our European, Australian and Asian brands also known as our EAA brands, saw solid price improvements on their year-round European program. 
Onboard and other yields increased almost 3%, in line with December guidance. The increase was mainly related to bar, casino and communications as our efforts in these areas continued to pay dividends. Net cruise costs per ALBD excluding fuel, were up about 1.5%, which was less than planned in our December guidance, again due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. 
In summary, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.19 higher than the prior year, driven by operational improvements worth $0.15 and favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.03. 
Now let's turn to booking trends for 2016. Bookings during this year's wait season was strong, volumes are ahead of last year's historically high level at higher prices. At this point in time, for the remaining 3 quarters of 2016, cumulative fleet wide bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we're well ahead on the book position, with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year bodes well for pricing over the next few months. 
Now let's drill down into the cumulative fleet wide book position. First, for our North American brand. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year, also at nicely higher prices. 2015 was a great Alaskan season and I'm happy to say 2016 is shaping up to be even better. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is nicely ahead of the prior year at lower prices, driven by the geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands, for Europe, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our prior guidance. While we are behind on pricing, and not surprisingly behind on percentage occupancy, given our over 60% increase in China capacity and our significant increase in Australia capacity, remember, Asia and particularly China, is a unit growth opportunity and we are achieving strong unit profits and returns that exceed our corporate average. 
Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our first quarter results, combined with strong book position, enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raised the floor on our earnings expectations for the year. Our 2016 March guidance is now $3.20 to $3.40. The $0.05 improvement was driven by improved [indiscernible] revenue yields worth $0.04 and the accretive impact from the additional shares we repurchased [indiscernible] our December call worth $0.05. These improvements were partially offset by a $0.04 drag from fuel and currency. 
Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are still expected to be up approximately 2%, no change from our December guidance. While we were favorable to the guidance for the first quarter, as I previously indicated, the favorability was due to the timing of expenses between the quarter. 
Remember that while the year is expected to be up approximately 2%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5% while the guidance for the second quarter is expected to be up only 0.5% to 1.5%. However, for the first quarter, we expect net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD to be up 5% to 6%, driven by the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock and higher advertising expense. Offsetting that, however is the expectation that cost will be down slightly in the fourth quarter. 
So far this fiscal year, we have repurchased over 21 million of our shares and we still have almost $700 million left under the second $1 billion share repurchase authorization that was approved by the Board of Directors just 2 months ago. Our March guidance EPS calculation assumes approximately 760 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis. 
On a final note, for your planning purposes, I wanted to let you know that we expect our June conference call to be a little later in June than usual to allow some extra time for quarter end reconciliation and analysis, given that we are currently in the process of implementing a significant upgrade to our Oracle Enterprise Recording Platform, which includes moving to a single instance of the general ledger as we further leverage our scale. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Arnold."

Are you saying that pricing is still higher in China than the rest of the world? You are adding capacity in China and that this is a unit growth story. I wanted to understand those 2 things. So to me, it sounds like almost you're simply adding more capacity at a higher price relative to the rest of the fleet but that the pricing maybe is not as high as it was maybe last year, is that what you're saying? And then one other thing on this China opportunity, which I think is outside the [indiscernible] because it's really is a huge opportunity and is a big pricing opportunity too is how were the travel agents doing in that market? Is there anything we can read from them and their reaction to the capacity that is coming on?"

You probably noticed that overall, we -- for the year, we were $2 -- our guidance is $2 per metric ton better. At the moment in time, that we did the December call versus our March guidance, I mean, Brent was within $1. The crack spread was virtually the same. So the numbers move very little on the fuel side. Of course, you have -- we have a little benefit there. We had -- offsetting that was some additional derivative losses. So the overall fuel number was negligible in terms of a change from our December guidance. Currency did move against us. And remember, we have a basket of currencies. So it depends on the movement. The one currency from December through March that moved the most was the British pound. And if you look back, we were guiding -- we were using 1 51 as the rate for the British pound back in December. The rate now, I think, in our press release in the second quarter was like 1 43. So there was like a 5% movement it. So depending on what you're looking at, because of the different basket of currencies and the movements, the British pound is the biggest impact. And that was a negative impact on our bottle line.

And so the real impact, we won't see until '17. But I had to tell you, we are enjoying some benefits now just from the brands collaborating, working on the tool together, showing lots of information. There's improved decision-making going on on revenue management all along the way and is definitely contributing to some of the yield improvement that we have enjoyed the past few quarters and including this past quarter. So over time, when we go to the next phase of the tool, which will be implemented next year, pretty much all the brands will be using the tool. We have some brands that have already more sophisticated tool than others. And at this tool baseloaded will be 1 sophistication, we'll put the next layer on top.

Because once they go on the ships and experience the brand, the difference is dramatic and you very much get a very different feel from 1 brand to the next in terms of what type of cruise experience it is. And because those brands resonate around the world across different, what we call, psychographic segments, with 1.3 billion people, China is very capable of absorbing lots of different brands. And so we see it, at this stage, as we just have a toe in the water. There's 135 million estimated outbound Chinese tourists today already. And less than 1 million of them or roughly 1 million today are cruising today. So we haven't even touched, begun to touch the surface, hardly. So there's plenty of room and capacity. Our belief is that at the consuming level, at the guest level, that in the price ranges we are in, the guests today are relatively pricing elastic. Whether, I'm in Australia, or Cuba last week, the Mainland Chinese, filled the [indiscernible] that was in a private restaurant in Havana that I was then. And so they have money, they able to travel. They're not exactly shopping for price. They fill out the retail outlets and spend several levels higher than the typical tourist from other places in the world. So we don't see any major barriers at this point except, as you just referred, good communication, execution, training the distribution system, giving them the exposure they need so they can represent the various brands well. We think there's plenty of room for everybody, for several of our brands. We're going to bring AIDA in in '17 and the Carnival brands is scheduled to go on in '18."

And this year, we're seeing again an increase on top of that. But not necessarily at the same level as last year, but a nice increase. And so, the correlation to the economy and all that tend not to -- we have difficulty tracking that and correlating in any specific way, even the degree of increase and onboard revenue isn't always correlated to particular economic conditions in a given destination market or given source market. And so there's just so many variables that come into that. Not the least of which is just constantly giving guests more of what they want. And if you do that, the guests onboard will spend more. And it's really -- the issue for us is always tweaking that and figuring out exactly what the guests want. So we give it to them in the way they want it, what they want, the way they want it and then we continue to grow. So to be honest with you, we haven't seen -- we tried it every which way and we just haven't seen a high correlation to general economic trends."

And as far as the overall cruise revenue yields are concerned, we had talked in December, between our North American brands and our EAA brands, we were expecting increases in both segments of our business. The increases were slightly better in the North American brands than the EAA brands once you net out the accounting reclassification, which I had mentioned affected the EAA brands in December."

And so the idea is just to keep it out there and realize all the various forms. There's no question. We have created incremental demand. We also know there's no question that an incremental demand has been in part, created by the fantastic work of our team members across our 10 brands who literally exceed guest expectations everyday when they come on board and that word-of-mouth and that personal experience with having your expectations exceeded is the most powerful marketing tool we have by far. And that's by the work of our people in engineering. Experiences on board and then delivering the guests to it. And so to your question, yes, we've increased advertising overall.

But again, the really important thing about cruise is this, we've had [indiscernible], we paid to lecture on Seabourn. But he pays to go on Carnival, okay? Because it's not a demographic choice per se. We had taxi drivers who will stay for 5 years going on Seabourn cruise and have billionaires who want to sail on Carnival.

So we have ultra luxury brands, luxury brands, premium brands, [indiscernible] with their own experience and that's what drives this us.

This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, via",1671,"Good morning, everyone and welcome to our First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. 
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, via phone from Italy; as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, who heads up our Investor Relations, here with me in Miami. 
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking, therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. 
Our company is off to a strong start this year, with first quarter adjusted earnings nearly doubled the prior year and well above the high end of our December guidance range. The first quarter result, combined with our strong book position, has enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raised the floor on our full year earnings expectations. 
I'm proud to acknowledge all of our employees globally for the industry-leading guest experience efforts that are central to our sustained earnings improvement. I especially thank our travel agent partners for the critical role they play in connecting guests with our great brand experience. 
It was reinforcing to see revenue yield growth of 5.7% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit yield improvement. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements in our core Caribbean itinerary, which represents 47% of our first quarter deployment. We drove revenue yield growth at Costa by creating relative scarcity through our brand team success and increasing demand via our ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with new impactful creative featuring Shakira. While at the same time, we reduced supply in the more challenging trading environment in Southern Europe by transferring Costa capacity to China. 
As you recall, our Costa brand was the first global cruise line to home port in China back in 2006. Today, we are the largest in China and the first global cruise company with 6 ships based there across 2 of our brands, Costa and Princess, representing nearly half of the Chinese cruise industry. 
While it represents less than 5% of our global capacity, for us, China continues to be a promising unit growth opportunity. China has quickly become the world's largest outbound travel market at an estimated 135 million strong, yet just over 1 million cruise today. We expect to continue to grow over time and have further plans for AIDA and Carnival Cruise Lines to enter China in the near future. 
China contributed to our strong quarterly results. We absorbed over 60% more capacity there and enjoyed strong profit improvement and return on invested capital accretion. At the same time, the capacity shift to China helped create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. 
Beyond China during the quarter, we made further progress globally in creating demand for all of our brands in excess of measured capacity growth. Part of that demand creation is the excitement around the much anticipated delivery of AIDAprima. And I can tell you, she is well worth the wait. The ship is absolutely fantastic. The first of the next-generation platform for AIDA that combines leading-edge environmental attributes and well-designed features that foster an exceptional guest experience. 
All of our features, whether racing water slides, lazy river obstacle, climbing walls, an expansive German spa, an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling and even a traditional Christmas market, together, create an experience that truly resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests. 
And we have additional opportunity for demand creation in just a few short days with the delivery of Holland America's new flagship, Koningsdam. Koningsdam was designed with our Holland America guest in mind and to reintroduce Holland America to those who have yet to experience our award-winning service, our 5-star dining, our extensive enrichment program and compelling worldwide itineraries. 
Our new flagship will offer fine dining in several alternative restaurants, including a new French seafood brasserie and a new immersive farm-to-table dinner experience in the Culinary Arts Center. 
Part of enhancing an already great Holland America guest experience includes taking onboard entertainment to a whole new level. We have carefully engineered a Music Walk area which showcases different genres offering chamber music in Lincoln Center Stage, rocking the crowd with chart-topping hits and Billboard Onboard and bringing the best of Memphis music to sea in our popular B.B. King's Blues Club. 
Responding to our guest, our new flagship will future Holland America Lines first ever purpose-built staterooms for families as well as single staterooms. 
Newbuilds will also provide additional demand creation opportunities later this year as well, with the delivery of Carnival Vista followed by Seabourn Encore. When it comes to shift, newbuilds are not the only way to simulate demand creation. We continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent recreation of Holland America's Eurodam, incorporating many of the same experiences on board as Koningsdam. In addition, we are undergoing an extensive remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 later this year. 
Destinations are often a powerful tool for demand creation as well especially when combined with the effective public relations. Last week, we made history when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 50 years to receive Cuban approval to bring U.S. cruise guests directly from the U.S. to Cuba. 
We made worldwide news, showcasing cruise on a very positive light, with nearly 5 billion media impressions and still counting. We very much look forward to launching our historic Cuba inaugural season in May with fathom initially with itineraries including Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. We believe there is no better way to experience so much of Cuba in 7 days than with the enriching guest experience on our premium fathom brand. 
As the Adonia carries just 700 guests per sailing, if you have any interest in seeing Cuba through an extraordinary fathom experience, I sincerely recommend you book now. 
Concerning the future of cruises in Cuba, we have already begun the process for approval for other brands for sail for Cuba in the months and years ahead. 
Now beyond ships and destinations, our ongoing marketing and promotional efforts are also part of demand creation. As part of our effort to keep cruise in the forefront of vacationers' minds, Princess is airing a new reality-based show on prime-time U.K. television entitled The Cruise. The documentary follows the lives of our amazing crew and guests on board Regal Princess through a 6-week series. In fact, we've already seen a 40% [ph] increase in web traffic for Princess in the U.K. since the show began airing. 
Also airing in the U.K., P&O Cruises' Battlechefs, a new cookery concept set at sea on board Britannia, featuring 5 celebrities testing their culinary skills and judged by celebrity chef, Marco Pierre White. 
In Italy, Costa Fortuna was the set of a major motion picture for [indiscernible], holidays in the Caribbean, launched early in the quarter, partially cast with Costa crew members. More recently, an episode on Italian reality TV, I Colori Dell'amore [ph], The Colors of Love, was based on the love story between 2 young Costa crew members who met on board. 
In North America, just last week, Carnival Cruise Lines was featured nightly on the ever-popular television show, Wheel of Fortune. While early in the quarter, Carnival announced an exceptional partnership with Grammy award-winning country music superstar, Carrie Underwood, and Operation Homefront, supporting our U.S. military personnel. Media coverage from that announcement alone generated more than 1 billion media impressions, and our Carnival brand continues to outperform. 
Also in North America, we partnered with AT&T and Samsung to create a virtual reality experience that showcase in nearly 1,200 AT&T stores, promoting consideration for cruise by allowing new-to-cruise to virtually experience a cruise vacation. We estimate nearly 400,000 people have already have the virtually reality experience, showcasing our portfolio of leading brands. All of these efforts heighten global awareness and consideration for our award-winning cruise lines as we continue to capture a greater share of the vacation suitcase. 
During the quarter, we continue to make progress on cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues, and in summer of 2016, will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory. The prototype will foster yield uplift as well as inspire improvements for final system development. Since most of this year's booking's will be behind us by the summer, we look forward to a greater contribution on this effort in 2017. 
And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We have negotiations underway on 16 separate purchasing categories, with 22 more RFPs outstanding. All of which will contribute to our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. 
Our ongoing operational improvement is a testament of the success of our combined efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth and to leverage our scale. The strong first quarter we have enjoyed affirms our conviction to deliver this year's earnings forecast and accelerates progress toward double-digit return on invested capital. We remain well on track for the delivery of over 8.5% return on invested capital this year and crossing the double-digit threshold in the next 2 to 3 years. At the same time, we have accelerated our return of capital to shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we have completed our first $1 million share repurchase authorization and are well into our second billion, bringing the cumulative total of purchase to date to $1.3 billion and approximately 27 million shares. We plan to continue to return free cash flow to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our target range. 
And now, I will turn the call over to David."

Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide som",970,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends. And finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. 
Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.39. This was $0.09 above the midpoint of our December guidance despite a $0.01 drag from fuel and currency. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: $0.07 from net ticket revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic; and $0.03 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters. 
Now let's turn to the first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. Our total net revenue yields were up 5.7%. 
Let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up almost 7%. As Arnold indicated, we enjoyed ticket price improvements on both sides of the Atlantic. The increase was driven by the strength in pricing in the Caribbean, which represented 47% of our capacity in the quarter. In addition, our European, Australian and Asian brands also known as our EAA brands, saw solid price improvements on their year-round European programs. 
Onboard and other yields increased almost 3%, in line with December guidance. The increase was mainly related to bar, casino and communications as our efforts in these areas continued to pay dividends. Net cruise costs per ALBD, excluding fuel, were up about 1.5%, which was less than planned in our December guidance, again due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. 
In summary, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.19 higher than the prior year, driven by operational improvements worth $0.15 and favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.03. 
Now let's turn to booking trends for 2016. Bookings during this year's wait season was strong, volumes are ahead of last year's historically high level at higher prices. At this point in time, for the remaining 3 quarters of 2016, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we're well ahead on the book position, with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, bodes well for pricing over the next few months. 
Now let's drill down into the cumulative fleet-wide book position. First, for our North American brand. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year, also at nicely higher prices. 2015 was a great Alaskan season and I'm happy to say 2016 is shaping up to be even better. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is nicely ahead of the prior year at lower prices, driven by the geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands, for Europe, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our prior guidance. While we are behind on pricing, and not surprisingly behind on percentage occupancy, given our over 60% increase in China capacity and our significant increase in Australia capacity. Remember, Asia and particularly China, is a unit growth opportunity and we are achieving strong unit profits and returns that exceed our corporate average. 
Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our first quarter results, combined with strong book position, enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raised the floor on our earnings expectations for the year. Our 2016 March guidance is now $3.20 to $3.40. The $0.05 improvement was driven by improved net revenue yields worth $0.04 and the accretive impact from the additional shares we repurchased, since our December call, worth $0.05. These improvements were partially offset by a $0.04 drag from fuel and currency. 
Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are still expected to be up approximately 2%, no change from our December guidance. While we were favorable to the guidance in the first quarter, as I previously indicated, the favorability was due to the timing of expenses between the quarter. 
Remember that while the year is expected to be up approximately 2%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5% while the guidance for the second quarter is expected to be up only 0.5% to 1.5%. However, for the first quarter, we expect net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD to be up 5% to 6%, driven by the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock and higher advertising expense. Offsetting that, however, is the expectation that cost will be down slightly in the fourth quarter. 
So far this fiscal year, we have repurchased over 21 million of our shares and we still have almost $700 million left under the second $1 billion share repurchase authorization that was approved by the Board of Directors just 2 months ago. Our March guidance EPS calculation assumed approximately 760 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis. 
On a final note, for your planning purposes, I wanted to let you know that we expect our June conference call to be a little later in June than usual to allow some extra time for quarter-end reconciliation and analysis, given that we are currently in the process of implementing a significant upgrade to our Oracle enterprise reporting platform, which includes moving to a single instance of the general ledger as we further leverage our scale. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Arnold."

Are you saying that pricing is still higher in China than the rest of the world? You are adding capacity in China and that this is a unit growth story. I wanted to understand those 2 things. So to me, it sounds like almost like you're simply adding more capacity at a higher price relative to the rest of the fleet, but that the pricing maybe is not as high as it was maybe last year, is that what you're saying? And then one other thing on this China opportunity, which I think is outsize attention because it really is a huge opportunity and is a big pricing opportunity too, is how were the travel agents doing in that market? Is there anything we can read from them and their reaction to the capacity that is coming?"

Now this might just be a rounding thing and these are all approximate estimates or maybe it's a function of the repositioning of ships. But, normally, sort of things get better for yields and worse for costs or vice versa. It seems like they got a little bit better with respect to FX and then with fuel, certainly, the crude oil prices that we look at have gotten a little bit worse although your guidance for the year seems to have gotten a tad better.

You probably noticed that overall, we -- for the year, we were $2 -- our guidance is $2 per metric ton better. At the moment in time, that we did the December call versus our March guidance, I mean, Brent was within $1. The crack spread was virtually the same. So the numbers move very little on the fuel side. Of course, you had -- we have a little benefit there. We had -- offsetting that was some additional derivative losses. So the overall fuel number was negligible in terms of a change from our December guidance. Currency did move against us. And remember, we have a basket of currencies. So it depends on the movement. The one currency from December through March that moved the most was the British pound. And if you look back, we were using $1.51 as the rate for the British pound back in December. The rate now, I think, in our press release in the second quarter was like $1.43. So there was like a 5% movement. So depending on what you're looking at, because of the different basket of currencies and the movements, the British pound is the biggest impact. And that was a negative impact on our bottom line. And that's what drove the majority of the currency drag."

And so the real impact, we won't see until '17. But I have to tell you, we are enjoying some benefits now just from the brands collaborating, working on the tool together, sharing lots of information. There's improved decision-making going on revenue management all along the way and is definitely contributing to some of the yield improvement that we have enjoyed the past few quarters and including this past quarter. So over time, when we go to the next phase of the tool, which will be implemented next year, pretty much all the brands will be using the tool. We have some brands that have already more sophisticated tool than others. And this tool, the baseloaded will be at one level sophistication we put the next layer on top, it will be at a whole another level of sophistication.

Because once they go on the ships and experience the brand, the difference is dramatic and you very much get a very different feel from 1 brand to the next in terms of what type of cruise experience it is. And because those brands resonate around the world across different, what we call, psychographic segments, with 1.3 billion people, China is very capable of absorbing lots of different brands. And so we see it, at this stage, as we just have a toe in the water. There's 135 million estimated outbound Chinese tourists today already. And less than 1 million of them or roughly 1 million today are cruising today. So we haven't even touched, begun to touch the surface, hardly. So there's plenty of room and capacity. Our belief is that at the consuming level, at the guest level, that in the price ranges we're in, the guests today are relatively pricing elastic. Whether, I'm in Australia, I was in Cuba last week, the Mainland Chinese, filled the palador that was in the private restaurant in Havana I was in. And so they have money, they're able to travel. They're not exactly shopping for price. They fill up the retail outlets and spend several levels higher than the typical tourist would from other places in the world. So we don't see any major barriers at this point except, as you just referred, good communication, execution, training the distribution system, giving them the exposure they need so they can represent the various brands well. We think there's plenty of room for everybody, for several of our brands and we're going to bring AIDA in, in '17 and the Carnival brands is scheduled to go on in '18."

As you know, the industry, believe it or not, is capacity constraint because of the limited number of shipyards to build ships. And obviously, we've got partnerships with [ph] Fincantieri and with Meyer in Germany in terms of securing slots to enhance our fleets. Having said that, in China, we can't grow too fast because [ph] to the availability of ships. So we'll probably be by 2020 in somewhere in the 8% to 9% range of our fleet, which means most of the growth in capacity we have will actually be going to China. And that means that we'll be growing at a much lower rate in the rest of the world markets, 1% to 2% there while a big percentage increases in China. But in terms of absolute number of ships, still relatively small compared to the latent demand that exists in the country. So to answer your question, by 2020, depending on how things go and that's the beauty of this we have flexibility, depending on how things go, we could be 8%, 9% of our capacity in China. And that means therefore that we didn't grow a lot than the rest of the world. But that fits with our measured capacity growth overall plan to help create relative scarcity, and we continue to drive demand to create excess demand relative to that measured capacity which obviously, allows us to capture more of the value gap that currently exists between land-based vacations and cruise, we're still a much better value than land-based vacations. So we have lots of room to move. David?"

And it's whether is mass media advertising, product placement advertising, digital, all the various forms of it. And PR, public relations efforts. So our belief is that we have to keep crews out in the public space, in a positive way on a constant basis. So that when people are considering vacation, there's been enough noise about cruise that they say, ""Well, I have an idea. Hey, let's look at our cruise."" And so the idea is to just keep it out there and [ph] realize on all the various forms. There's no question. We have created incremental demand. We also know there's no question that an incremental demand has been in part, created by the fantastic work of our team members across our 10 brands who literally exceed guest expectations everyday when they come on board and that word-of-mouth and that personal experience of having your expectations exceeded is the most powerful marketing tool we have by far. And that's by the work of our people in engineering. Their experiences on board and then delivering against it. So to your question, yes, we've increased advertising overall. We'll continue to look at it. We don't do a willy-nilly. We do a lot of measuring and tracking to see what kind of impact we get, both in attitude and in bookings and so on. And then we're constantly monitoring that and tweaking it. But the third quarter rationale is a peak communication time to prepare for the coming year.

But obviously our long-established premium brand is Princess and Holland America and AIDA. And we have mass contemporary brands like [indiscernible] and Carnival. So we look at that. But again, the really important thing about cruise is this, we've had Steve Wozniak, who we pay to lecture on Seabourn. But he pays to go on Carnival, okay? Because it's not a demographic choice per se. We have taxi drivers who will safe for 5 years to go on a Seabourn cruise and we have billionaires who want to sail on Carnival. And the reality is the experience that you're looking for. And each brand is a different experience, caters to a different psychographic market. So we have ultra luxury brands, luxury brands, premium brands, et cetera, each with their own experience and that's what drives this for us. But for us, we're definitely looking at penetrating more land-based vacations because all the cabins in the world added up together represents less than, in the industry, represent less than 2% of hotel rooms in the world.

This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, via",1672,"Good morning, everyone and welcome to our First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. 
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, via phone from Italy; as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, who heads up our Investor Relations, here with me in Miami. 
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking, therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. 
Our company is off to a strong start this year, with first quarter adjusted earnings nearly double the prior year and well above the high end of our December guidance range. The first quarter result, combined with our strong book position, has enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our full year earnings expectations. 
I'm proud to acknowledge all of our employees globally for the industry-leading guest experience efforts that are central to our sustained earnings improvement. I especially thank our travel agent partners for the critical role they play in connecting guests with our great brand experience. 
It was reinforcing to see revenue yield growth of 5.7% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit yield improvement. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements in our core Caribbean itinerary, which represents 47% of our first quarter deployment. We drove revenue yield growth at Costa by creating relative scarcity through our brand team success and increasing demand via our ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with new impactful creative featuring Shakira. While at the same time, we reduced supply in the more challenging trading environment in Southern Europe by transferring Costa capacity to China. 
As you recall, our Costa brand was the first global cruise line to home port in China back in 2006. Today, we are the largest in China and the first global cruise company with 6 ships based there across 2 of our brands, Costa and Princess, representing nearly half of the Chinese cruise industry. 
While it represents less than 5% of our global capacity, for us, China continues to be a promising unit growth opportunity. China has quickly become the world's largest outbound travel market at an estimated 135 million strong, yet just over 1 million cruise today. We expect to continue to grow over time and have further plans for AIDA and Carnival Cruise Lines to enter China in the near future. 
China contributed to our strong quarterly results. We absorb over 60% more capacity there and enjoy strong profit improvement and return on invested capital accretion. At the same time, the capacity shift to China helped create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. 
Beyond China during the quarter, we made further progress globally in creating demand for all of our brands in excess of measured capacity growth. Part of that demand creation is the excitement around the much anticipated delivery of AIDAprima. And I can tell you, she is well worth the wait. The ship is absolutely fantastic. The first of the next-generation platform for AIDA that combines leading-edge environmental attributes and well-designed features that foster an exceptional guest experience. 
All of our features, whether racing water slides, a lazy river, multiple climbing walls, an expansive German spa, an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling and even a traditional Christmas market, together, create an experience that truly resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests. 
And we have additional opportunity for demand creation in just a few short days with the delivery of Holland America's new flagship, Koningsdam. Koningsdam was designed with our Holland America guest in mind and to reintroduce Holland America to those who have yet to experience our award-winning service, our 5-star dining, our extensive enrichment program and compelling worldwide itineraries. 
Our new flagship will offer fine dining in several alternative restaurants, including a new French seafood brasserie and a new immersive farm-to-table dinner experience in the Culinary Arts Center. 
Part of enhancing an already great Holland America guest experience includes taking onboard entertainment to a whole new level. We have carefully engineered a Music Walk area which showcases different genres, offering chamber music in Lincoln Center Stage, rocking the crowd with chart-topping hits in Billboard Onboard and bringing the best of Memphis music to sea in our popular B.B. King's Blues Club. 
Responding to our guests, our new flagship will feature Holland America Lines first ever purpose-built staterooms for families as well as single staterooms. 
Newbuilds will also provide additional demand creation opportunities later this year as well, with the delivery of Carnival Vista followed by Seabourn Encore. When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to stimulate demand creation. We continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent recreation of Holland America's Eurodam, incorporating many of the same experiences on board as Koningsdam. In addition, we are undergoing an extensive remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 later this year. 
Destinations are often a powerful tool for demand creation as well, especially when combined with the effect of public relations. Last week, we made history when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 50 years to receive Cuban approval to bring U.S. cruise guests directly from the U.S. to Cuba. 
We made worldwide news, showcasing cruise in a very positive light, with nearly 5 billion media impressions and still counting. We very much look forward to launching our historic Cuba inaugural season in May with fathom, initially with itineraries including Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. We believe there is no better way to experience so much of Cuba in 7 days than with the enriching guest experience on our premium fathom brand. 
As the Adonia carries just 700 guests per sailing, if you have any interest in seeing Cuba through an extraordinary fathom experience, I sincerely recommend you book now. 
Concerning the future of cruises in Cuba, we have already begun the process for approval for other brands to sail for Cuba in the months and years ahead. 
Now beyond ships and destinations, our ongoing marketing and promotional efforts are also part of demand creation. As part of our effort to keep cruise in the forefront of vacationers' minds, Princess is airing a new reality-based show on prime-time U.K. television entitled The Cruise. The documentary follows the lives of our amazing crew and guests on board Regal Princess through a 6-week series. In fact, we've already seen a 40% increase in web traffic for Princess in the U.K. since the show began airing. 
Also airing in the U.K., P&O Cruises' Battlechefs, a new cookery concept set at sea on board Britannia, featuring 5 celebrities testing their culinary skills and judged by celebrity chef Marco Pierre White. 
In Italy, Costa Fortuna was the set of a major motion picture, [Foreign Language], Holidays in the Caribbean, launched early in the quarter, partially cast with Costa crew members. More recently, an episode on Italian reality TV, I Colori Dell'amore [ph], The Colors of Love, was based on the love story between 2 young Costa crew members who met on board. 
In North America, just last week, Carnival Cruise Lines was featured nightly on the ever-popular television show, Wheel of Fortune. While early in the quarter, Carnival announced an exceptional partnership with Grammy award-winning country music superstar Carrie Underwood, and Operation Homefront, supporting our U.S. military personnel. Media coverage from that announcement alone generated more than 1 billion media impressions, and our Carnival brand continues to outperform. 
Also in North America, we partnered with AT&T and Samsung to create a virtual reality experience that showcased in nearly 1,200 AT&T stores, promoting consideration for cruise by allowing new-to-cruise to virtually experience a cruise vacation. We estimate nearly 400,000 people have already have the virtually reality experience, showcasing our portfolio of leading brands. All of these efforts heighten global awareness and consideration for our world-leading cruise lines as we continue to capture a greater share of the vacation suitcase. 
During the quarter, we continued to make progress on cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues, and in summer of 2016, will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory. The prototype will foster yield uplift as well as inspire improvements for final system development. Since most of this year's bookings will be behind us by the summer, we look forward to a greater contribution on this effort in 2017. 
And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We have negotiations underway on 16 separate purchasing categories, with 22 more RFPs outstanding, all of which will contribute to our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. 
Our ongoing operational improvement is a testament of the success of our combined efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth and to leverage our scale. The strong first quarter we have enjoyed affirms our conviction to deliver this year's earnings forecast and accelerates progress toward double-digit return on invested capital. We remain well on track for the delivery of over 8.5% return on invested capital this year and crossing the double-digit threshold in the next 2 to 3 years. At the same time, we have accelerated our return of capital to shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we have completed our first $1 million share repurchase authorization and are well into our second billion, bringing the cumulative total of purchase to date to $1.3 billion and approximately 27 million shares. We plan to continue to return free cash flow to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our target range. 
And now, I will turn the call over to David."

Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide som",970,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends. And finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. 
Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.39. This was $0.09 above the midpoint of our December guidance despite a $0.01 drag from fuel and currency. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: $0.07 from net ticket revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic; and $0.03 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters. 
Now let's turn to the first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. Our total net revenue yields were up 5.7%. 
Let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up almost 7%. As Arnold indicated, we enjoyed ticket price improvements on both sides of the Atlantic. The increase was driven by the strength of pricing in the Caribbean, which represented 47% of our capacity in the quarter. In addition, our European, Australian and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, saw solid price improvements on their year-round European programs. 
Onboard and other yields increased almost 3%, in line with December guidance. The increase was mainly related to bar, casino and communications as our efforts in these areas continued to pay dividends. Net cruise costs per ALBD, excluding fuel, were up about 1.5%, which was less than planned in our December guidance, again due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. 
In summary, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.19 higher than the prior year, driven by operational improvements worth $0.15 and favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.03. 
Now let's turn to booking trends for 2016. Bookings during this year's wave season was strong. Volumes are ahead of last year's historically high level at higher prices. At this point in time, for the remaining 3 quarters of 2016, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we're well ahead on the book position, with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, bodes well for pricing over the next few months. 
Now let's drill down into the cumulative fleet-wide book position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year, also at nicely higher prices. 2015 was a great Alaskan season and I'm happy to say 2016 is shaping up to be even better. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is nicely ahead of the prior year at lower prices, driven by the geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands, for Europe, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our prior guidance. While we are behind on pricing, and not surprisingly behind on percentage occupancy given our over 60% increase in China capacity and our significant increase in Australia capacity, remember, Asia and particularly China, is a unit growth opportunity and we are achieving strong unit profits and returns that exceed our corporate average. 
Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our first quarter results, combined with strong book position, enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our earnings expectations for the year. Our 2016 March guidance is now $3.20 to $3.40. The $0.05 improvement was driven by improved net revenue yields worth $0.04 and the accretive impact from the additional shares we repurchased since our December call, worth $0.05. These improvements were partially offset by a $0.04 drag from fuel and currency. 
Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are still expected to be up approximately 2%, no change from our December guidance. While we were favorable to the guidance in the first quarter, as I previously indicated, the favorability was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. 
Remember that while the year is expected to be up approximately 2%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5% while the guidance for the second quarter is expected to be up only 0.5% to 1.5%. However, for the third quarter, we expect net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD to be up 5% to 6%, driven by the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock and higher advertising expense. Offsetting that, however, is the expectation that cost will be down slightly in the fourth quarter. 
So far this fiscal year, we have repurchased over 21 million of our shares and we still have almost $700 million left under the second $1 billion share repurchase authorization that was approved by the Board of Directors just 2 months ago. Our March guidance EPS calculation assume approximately 760 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis. 
On a final note, for your planning purposes, I wanted to let you know that we expect our June conference call to be a little later in June than usual to allow some extra time for quarter-end reconciliation and analysis, given that we are currently in the process of implementing a significant upgrade to our Oracle enterprise reporting platform, which includes moving to a single instance of the general ledger as we further leverage our scale. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Arnold."

Are you saying that pricing is still higher in China than the rest of the world? You are adding capacity in China and that -- this is a unit growth story. I wanted to understand those 2 things. So to me, it sounds like almost like you're simply adding more capacity at a higher price relative to the rest of the fleet, but that the pricing maybe is not as high as it was maybe last year, is that what you're saying? And then one other thing on this China opportunity, which I think gets outsize attention because it really is a huge opportunity and is a big pricing opportunity too, is how were the travel agents doing in that market? Is there anything we can read from them and their reaction to the capacity that is coming?"

So the overall fuel number was negligible in terms of a change from our December guidance. Currency did move against us. And remember, we have a basket of currencies. So it depends on the movement. The one currency from December through March that moved the most was the British pound. And if you look back, we were using $1.51 as the rate for the British pound back in December. The rate now, I think, in our press release in the second quarter was like $1.43. So there was like a 5% movement.

And so the real impact, we won't see until '17. But I have to tell you, we are enjoying some benefits now just from the brands collaborating, working on the tool together, sharing lots of information. There's improved decision-making going on, on revenue management all along the way and is definitely contributing to some of the yield improvement that we have enjoyed the past few quarters and including this past quarter. So over time, when we go to the next phase of the tool, which will be implemented next year, pretty much all the brands will be using the tool. We have some brands that have already more sophisticated tools than others. And this tool, the baseload, it will be at one level of sophistication.

Because once they go on the ships and experience the brand, the difference is dramatic and you very much get a very different feel from 1 brand to the next in terms of what type of cruise experience it is. And because those brands resonate around the world across different, what we call, psychographic segments, with 1.3 billion people, China is very capable of absorbing lots of different brands. And so we see it, at this stage, as we just have a toe in the water. There's 135 million estimated outbound Chinese tourists today already. And less than 1 million of them or roughly 1 million today are cruising today. So we haven't even touched, begun to touch the surface, hardly. So there's plenty of room and capacity. Our belief is that at the consuming level, at the guest level, that in the price ranges we're in, the guests today are relatively pricing elastic. Whether, I'm in Australia, I was in Cuba last week, the Mainland Chinese filled the paladar that I was in, the private restaurant in Havana I was in. And so they have money, they're able to travel. They're not exactly shopping for price. They fill up the retail outlets and spend several levels higher than the typical tourist would from other places in the world. So we don't see any major barriers at this point except, as you just referred, good communication, execution, training the distribution system, giving them the exposure they need so they can represent the various brands well. We think there's plenty of room for everybody, for several of our brands and we're going to bring AIDA in, in '17 and the Carnival brand right now is scheduled to go in, in '18."

So we'll probably be, by 2020, somewhere in the 8% to 9% range of our fleet, which means most of the growth in capacity we have will actually be going to China. And that means that we'll be growing at a much slower rate in the rest of the world markets, 1% to 2% there.

But that fits with our measured capacity growth overall plan to help create relative scarcity, and we continue to drive demand to create excess demand relative to that measured capacity, which obviously allows us to capture more of the value gap that currently exists between land-based vacations and cruise. We're still a much better value than land-based vacations, so we have lots of room to move. David?"

And they all have their independent marketing plans. We do look at it collectively. We are leveraging our scale in terms of looking at common media buy and those types of things to be even more efficient. That's paying dividends for us. But the reality is, we are expecting a return on any investment we make, and that includes advertising. And it's -- whether it's mass media advertising, product placement advertising, digital, all the various forms of it. And PR, public relations efforts. So our belief is that we have to keep cruise out in the public space, in a positive way, on a constant basis. So that when people are considering vacation, there's been enough noise about cruise that they say, ""Well, I have an idea. Hey, let's look at a cruise."" And so the idea is to just keep it out there and that's utilizing all the various forms. There's no question, we have created incremental demand. We also know there's no question that incremental demand has been, in part, created by the fantastic work of our team members across our 10 brands who literally exceed guest expectations every day when they come on board. And that word-of-mouth and that personal experience of having your expectations exceeded is the most powerful marketing tool we have, by far. And that's by the work of our people in engineering, their experiences on board and then delivering against it. So to your question, yes, we've increased advertising overall. We'll continue to look at it. We don't do it willy-nilly. We do a lot of measuring and tracking to see what kind of impact we get, both in attitude and in bookings and so on. And then we're constantly monitoring that and tweaking it. But the third quarter rationale is a peak communication time to prepare for the coming year. And that's why you often see an increase in that period."

We have premium brands in fathom, our newest premium brand. But obviously our long-established premium brands are Princess and Holland America and AIDA. And we have mass contemporary brands like Costa and Carnival. So we look at that. But again, the really important thing about cruise is this: We've had Steve Wozniak, who we pay to lecture on Seabourn. But he pays to go on Carnival, okay? Because it's not a demographic choice per se. We have taxi drivers who will save for 5 years to go on a Seabourn cruise and we have billionaires who want to sail on Carnival. And the reality is the experience that you're looking for. And each brand is a different experience, caters to a different psychographic market. So we have ultra-luxury brands, luxury brands, premium brands, et cetera, each with their own experience and that's what drives this for us. But for us, we're definitely looking at penetrating more land-based vacations because all the cabins in the world added up together represent less than -- in the industry, represent less than 2% of hotel rooms in the world. So that means there's 98% of the market to chase as opposed to 1% because -- of that 2%, 1% is ours already. So that's kind of our approach.

This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, via",1672,"Good morning, everyone and welcome to our First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. 
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, via phone from Italy; as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, who heads up our Investor Relations, here with me in Miami. 
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking, therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. 
Our company is off to a strong start this year, with first quarter adjusted earnings nearly double the prior year and well above the high end of our December guidance range. The first quarter result, combined with our strong book position, has enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our full year earnings expectations. 
I'm proud to acknowledge all of our employees globally for the industry-leading guest experience efforts that are central to our sustained earnings improvement. I especially thank our travel agent partners for the critical role they play in connecting guests with our great brand experience. 
It was reinforcing to see revenue yield growth of 5.7% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit yield improvement. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements in our core Caribbean itinerary, which represents 47% of our first quarter deployment. We drove revenue yield growth at Costa by creating relative scarcity through our brand team success and increasing demand via our ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with new impactful creative featuring Shakira. While at the same time, we reduced supply in the more challenging trading environment in Southern Europe by transferring Costa capacity to China. 
As you recall, our Costa brand was the first global cruise line to home port in China back in 2006. Today, we are the largest in China and the first global cruise company with 6 ships based there across 2 of our brands, Costa and Princess, representing nearly half of the Chinese cruise industry. 
While it represents less than 5% of our global capacity, for us, China continues to be a promising unit growth opportunity. China has quickly become the world's largest outbound travel market at an estimated 135 million strong, yet just over 1 million cruise today. We expect to continue to grow over time and have further plans for AIDA and Carnival Cruise Lines to enter China in the near future. 
China contributed to our strong quarterly results. We absorb over 60% more capacity there and enjoy strong profit improvement and return on invested capital accretion. At the same time, the capacity shift to China helped create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. 
Beyond China during the quarter, we made further progress globally in creating demand for all of our brands in excess of measured capacity growth. Part of that demand creation is the excitement around the much anticipated delivery of AIDAprima. And I can tell you, she is well worth the wait. The ship is absolutely fantastic. The first of the next-generation platform for AIDA that combines leading-edge environmental attributes and well-designed features that foster an exceptional guest experience. 
All of our features, whether racing water slides, a lazy river, multiple climbing walls, an expansive German spa, an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling and even a traditional Christmas market, together, create an experience that truly resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests. 
And we have additional opportunity for demand creation in just a few short days with the delivery of Holland America's new flagship, Koningsdam. Koningsdam was designed with our Holland America guest in mind and to reintroduce Holland America to those who have yet to experience our award-winning service, our 5-star dining, our extensive enrichment program and compelling worldwide itineraries. 
Our new flagship will offer fine dining in several alternative restaurants, including a new French seafood brasserie and a new immersive farm-to-table dinner experience in the Culinary Arts Center. 
Part of enhancing an already great Holland America guest experience includes taking onboard entertainment to a whole new level. We have carefully engineered a Music Walk area which showcases different genres, offering chamber music in Lincoln Center Stage, rocking the crowd with chart-topping hits in Billboard Onboard and bringing the best of Memphis music to sea in our popular B.B. King's Blues Club. 
Responding to our guests, our new flagship will feature Holland America Lines first ever purpose-built staterooms for families as well as single staterooms. 
Newbuilds will also provide additional demand creation opportunities later this year as well, with the delivery of Carnival Vista followed by Seabourn Encore. When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to stimulate demand creation. We continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent recreation of Holland America's Eurodam, incorporating many of the same experiences on board as Koningsdam. In addition, we are undergoing an extensive remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 later this year. 
Destinations are often a powerful tool for demand creation as well, especially when combined with the effect of public relations. Last week, we made history when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 50 years to receive Cuban approval to bring U.S. cruise guests directly from the U.S. to Cuba. 
We made worldwide news, showcasing cruise in a very positive light, with nearly 5 billion media impressions and still counting. We very much look forward to launching our historic Cuba inaugural season in May with fathom, initially with itineraries including Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. We believe there is no better way to experience so much of Cuba in 7 days than with the enriching guest experience on our premium fathom brand. 
As the Adonia carries just 700 guests per sailing, if you have any interest in seeing Cuba through an extraordinary fathom experience, I sincerely recommend you book now. 
Concerning the future of cruises in Cuba, we have already begun the process for approval for other brands to sail for Cuba in the months and years ahead. 
Now beyond ships and destinations, our ongoing marketing and promotional efforts are also part of demand creation. As part of our effort to keep cruise in the forefront of vacationers' minds, Princess is airing a new reality-based show on prime-time U.K. television entitled The Cruise. The documentary follows the lives of our amazing crew and guests on board Regal Princess through a 6-week series. In fact, we've already seen a 40% increase in web traffic for Princess in the U.K. since the show began airing. 
Also airing in the U.K., P&O Cruises' Battlechefs, a new cookery concept set at sea on board Britannia, featuring 5 celebrities testing their culinary skills and judged by celebrity chef Marco Pierre White. 
In Italy, Costa Fortuna was the set of a major motion picture, [Foreign Language], Holidays in the Caribbean, launched early in the quarter, partially cast with Costa crew members. More recently, an episode on Italian reality TV, I Colori Dell'amore [ph], The Colors of Love, was based on the love story between 2 young Costa crew members who met on board. 
In North America, just last week, Carnival Cruise Lines was featured nightly on the ever-popular television show, Wheel of Fortune. While early in the quarter, Carnival announced an exceptional partnership with Grammy award-winning country music superstar Carrie Underwood, and Operation Homefront, supporting our U.S. military personnel. Media coverage from that announcement alone generated more than 1 billion media impressions, and our Carnival brand continues to outperform. 
Also in North America, we partnered with AT&T and Samsung to create a virtual reality experience that showcased in nearly 1,200 AT&T stores, promoting consideration for cruise by allowing new-to-cruise to virtually experience a cruise vacation. We estimate nearly 400,000 people have already have the virtually reality experience, showcasing our portfolio of leading brands. All of these efforts heighten global awareness and consideration for our world-leading cruise lines as we continue to capture a greater share of the vacation suitcase. 
During the quarter, we continued to make progress on cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues, and in summer of 2016, will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory. The prototype will foster yield uplift as well as inspire improvements for final system development. Since most of this year's bookings will be behind us by the summer, we look forward to a greater contribution on this effort in 2017. 
And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We have negotiations underway on 16 separate purchasing categories, with 22 more RFPs outstanding, all of which will contribute to our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. 
Our ongoing operational improvement is a testament of the success of our combined efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth and to leverage our scale. The strong first quarter we have enjoyed affirms our conviction to deliver this year's earnings forecast and accelerates progress toward double-digit return on invested capital. We remain well on track for the delivery of over 8.5% return on invested capital this year and crossing the double-digit threshold in the next 2 to 3 years. At the same time, we have accelerated our return of capital to shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we have completed our first $1 million share repurchase authorization and are well into our second billion, bringing the cumulative total of purchase to date to $1.3 billion and approximately 27 million shares. We plan to continue to return free cash flow to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our target range. 
And now, I will turn the call over to David."

Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide som",970,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends. And finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. 
Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.39. This was $0.09 above the midpoint of our December guidance despite a $0.01 drag from fuel and currency. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: $0.07 from net ticket revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic; and $0.03 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters. 
Now let's turn to the first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. Our total net revenue yields were up 5.7%. 
Let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up almost 7%. As Arnold indicated, we enjoyed ticket price improvements on both sides of the Atlantic. The increase was driven by the strength of pricing in the Caribbean, which represented 47% of our capacity in the quarter. In addition, our European, Australian and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, saw solid price improvements on their year-round European programs. 
Onboard and other yields increased almost 3%, in line with December guidance. The increase was mainly related to bar, casino and communications as our efforts in these areas continued to pay dividends. Net cruise costs per ALBD, excluding fuel, were up about 1.5%, which was less than planned in our December guidance, again due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. 
In summary, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.19 higher than the prior year, driven by operational improvements worth $0.15 and favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.03. 
Now let's turn to booking trends for 2016. Bookings during this year's wave season was strong. Volumes are ahead of last year's historically high level at higher prices. At this point in time, for the remaining 3 quarters of 2016, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we're well ahead on the book position, with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, bodes well for pricing over the next few months. 
Now let's drill down into the cumulative fleet-wide book position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year, also at nicely higher prices. 2015 was a great Alaskan season and I'm happy to say 2016 is shaping up to be even better. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is nicely ahead of the prior year at lower prices, driven by the geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands, for Europe, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our prior guidance. While we are behind on pricing, and not surprisingly behind on percentage occupancy given our over 60% increase in China capacity and our significant increase in Australia capacity, remember, Asia and particularly China, is a unit growth opportunity and we are achieving strong unit profits and returns that exceed our corporate average. 
Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our first quarter results, combined with strong book position, enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our earnings expectations for the year. Our 2016 March guidance is now $3.20 to $3.40. The $0.05 improvement was driven by improved net revenue yields worth $0.04 and the accretive impact from the additional shares we repurchased since our December call, worth $0.05. These improvements were partially offset by a $0.04 drag from fuel and currency. 
Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are still expected to be up approximately 2%, no change from our December guidance. While we were favorable to the guidance in the first quarter, as I previously indicated, the favorability was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. 
Remember that while the year is expected to be up approximately 2%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5% while the guidance for the second quarter is expected to be up only 0.5% to 1.5%. However, for the third quarter, we expect net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD to be up 5% to 6%, driven by the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock and higher advertising expense. Offsetting that, however, is the expectation that cost will be down slightly in the fourth quarter. 
So far this fiscal year, we have repurchased over 21 million of our shares and we still have almost $700 million left under the second $1 billion share repurchase authorization that was approved by the Board of Directors just 2 months ago. Our March guidance EPS calculation assume approximately 760 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis. 
On a final note, for your planning purposes, I wanted to let you know that we expect our June conference call to be a little later in June than usual to allow some extra time for quarter-end reconciliation and analysis, given that we are currently in the process of implementing a significant upgrade to our Oracle enterprise reporting platform, which includes moving to a single instance of the general ledger as we further leverage our scale. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Arnold."

Are you saying that pricing is still higher in China than the rest of the world? You are adding capacity in China and that -- this is a unit growth story. I wanted to understand those 2 things. So to me, it sounds like almost like you're simply adding more capacity at a higher price relative to the rest of the fleet, but that the pricing maybe is not as high as it was maybe last year, is that what you're saying? And then one other thing on this China opportunity, which I think gets outsize attention because it really is a huge opportunity and is a big pricing opportunity too, is how were the travel agents doing in that market? Is there anything we can read from them and their reaction to the capacity that is coming?"

So the overall fuel number was negligible in terms of a change from our December guidance. Currency did move against us. And remember, we have a basket of currencies. So it depends on the movement.

Obviously, that will ramp up over time and we'll have more inventory that goes through it. By the time it's up and running, '16 will be pretty much booked. And so the real impact, we won't see until '17. But I have to tell you, we are enjoying some benefits now just from the brands collaborating, working on the tool together, sharing lots of information. There's improved decision-making going on, on revenue management all along the way and is definitely contributing to some of the yield improvement that we have enjoyed the past few quarters and including this past quarter. So over time, when we go to the next phase of the tool, which will be implemented next year, pretty much all the brands will be using the tool. We have some brands that have already more sophisticated tools than others. And this tool, the baseload, it will be at one level of sophistication. When we put the next layer on top, it will be at a whole another level of sophistication.

Because once they go on the ships and experience the brand, the difference is dramatic and you very much get a very different feel from 1 brand to the next in terms of what type of cruise experience it is. And because those brands resonate around the world across different, what we call, psychographic segments, with 1.3 billion people, China is very capable of absorbing lots of different brands. And so we see it, at this stage, as we just have a toe in the water. There's 135 million estimated outbound Chinese tourists today already. And less than 1 million of them or roughly 1 million today are cruising today. So we haven't even touched, begun to touch the surface, hardly. So there's plenty of room and capacity. Our belief is that at the consuming level, at the guest level, that in the price ranges we're in, the guests today are relatively pricing elastic. Whether, I'm in Australia, I was in Cuba last week, the Mainland Chinese filled the paladar that I was in, the private restaurant in Havana I was in. And so they have money, they're able to travel. They're not exactly shopping for price. They fill up the retail outlets and spend several levels higher than the typical tourist would from other places in the world. So we don't see any major barriers at this point except, as you just referred, good communication, execution, training the distribution system, giving them the exposure they need so they can represent the various brands well. We think there's plenty of room for everybody, for several of our brands and we're going to bring AIDA in, in '17 and the Carnival brand right now is scheduled to go in, in '18."

And obviously, we've got partnerships with both Fincantieri and with Meyer in Germany in terms of securing slots to enhance our fleets. Having said that, in China, we can't grow too fast because we're just limited to the availability of ships. So we'll probably be, by 2020, somewhere in the 8% to 9% range of our fleet, which means most of the growth in capacity we have will actually be going to China. And that means that we'll be growing at a much slower rate in the rest of the world markets, 1% to 2% there. While a big percentage increase is in China, but in terms of absolute number of ships, still relatively small compared to the latent demand that exists in the country. So to answer your question, by 2020, depending on how things go -- and that's the beauty of this, we have flexibility. Depending on how things go, we could be 8%, 9% of our capacity in China. And that means therefore that we didn't grow a lot in the rest of the world. But that fits with our measured capacity growth overall plan to help create relative scarcity, and we continue to drive demand to create excess demand relative to that measured capacity, which obviously allows us to capture more of the value gap that currently exists between land-based vacations and cruise.

So it has a tougher comparison in the prior year as well as the fact that in the first quarter this year, we had indicated we were 47% in the Caribbean versus 30% in the second quarter.

We are leveraging our scale in terms of looking at common media buy and those types of things to be even more efficient. That's paying dividends for us. But the reality is, we are expecting a return on any investment we make, and that includes advertising. And it's -- whether it's mass media advertising, product placement advertising, digital, all the various forms of it. And PR, public relations efforts. So our belief is that we have to keep cruise out in the public space, in a positive way, on a constant basis. So that when people are considering vacation, there's been enough noise about cruise that they say, ""Well, I have an idea. Hey, let's look at a cruise."" And so the idea is to just keep it out there and that's utilizing all the various forms. There's no question, we have created incremental demand. We also know there's no question that incremental demand has been, in part, created by the fantastic work of our team members across our 10 brands who literally exceed guest expectations every day when they come on board. And that word-of-mouth and that personal experience of having your expectations exceeded is the most powerful marketing tool we have, by far. And that's by the work of our people in engineering, their experiences on board and then delivering against it. So to your question, yes, we've increased advertising overall. We'll continue to look at it. We don't do it willy-nilly. We do a lot of measuring and tracking to see what kind of impact we get, both in attitude and in bookings and so on. And then we're constantly monitoring that and tweaking it. But the third quarter rationale is a peak communication time to prepare for the coming year. And that's why you often see an increase in that period."

We have premium brands in fathom, our newest premium brand. But obviously our long-established premium brands are Princess and Holland America and AIDA. And we have mass contemporary brands like Costa and Carnival. So we look at that. But again, the really important thing about cruise is this: We've had Steve Wozniak, who we pay to lecture on Seabourn. But he pays to go on Carnival, okay? Because it's not a demographic choice per se. We have taxi drivers who will save for 5 years to go on a Seabourn cruise and we have billionaires who want to sail on Carnival. And the reality is the experience that you're looking for. And each brand is a different experience, caters to a different psychographic market. So we have ultra-luxury brands, luxury brands, premium brands, et cetera, each with their own experience and that's what drives this for us. But for us, we're definitely looking at penetrating more land-based vacations because all the cabins in the world added up together represent less than -- in the industry, represent less than 2% of hotel rooms in the world. So that means there's 98% of the market to chase as opposed to 1% because -- of that 2%, 1% is ours already. So that's kind of our approach.

I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc.

I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Before I begin, as always, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
We delivered the strongest second quarter in the history of our company, with record adjusted earnings per share nearly double the prior year and well above the high end of our March guidance range. The second quarter result, combined with our strong book position, has enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our full year guidance range despite a $0.17 drag from fuel and currency. 
Essentially, the strength and underlying demand for our products fostered greater ticket price in both the quarter and in the remainder of the year, offsetting the rise of fuel prices since the time of our last guidance as well as the very recent significant movements in currency exchange rates following the Brexit vote.
Our record results reflect our passionate 120,000-plus employees who, in their efforts, go above and beyond every day, and who together with our hundreds of thousands of travel partners, are the foundation of our sustained earnings improvement. 
This was among the most remarkable quarters in the history of the company not only because of our record-breaking financial results but because of a significant number of milestones, which will contribute meaningfully to our future success. 
We introduced 3 new flagships, including Carnival Vista, purposely designed for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guests with an onboard experience, entertaining IMAX theater and exhilarating skyride experience. Carnival Vista has already generated over 1 billion media impressions. 
Holand America Lines [indiscernible] and Rotterdam by Her Majesty Queen Maxima The Netherlands delivers a new premium experience where our guests can blend their own wine, enjoy high-end flight [indiscernible] in our engineered music walk. And last but not least, the AIDAprima made its debut with a spectacular live show, fireworks and memorable ceremony witnessed by over 1 million people gathered in Hamburg. 
These well-publicized introductions are certain to continue increased consideration for cruising within our portfolio of the world's leading cruise lines. Moreover, we welcomed our 10th brand in April with inaugural impact to the Dominican Republic [indiscernible] followed by a historic first sailing for Cuba in May. 
Barring none, one of the most publicized events in the history of the cruise industry was on our to Cuba with over 20 billion media impressions, bringing the cumulative total media impressions for Carnival and Cuba to nearly 55 billion to date. We could not have been more proud than when General Counsel [indiscernible] and his wife Carmen, both Cuban-born, were first to disembark when we made history as the first U.S. cruise line in more than 40 years to sail to Cuba. 
Having sailed there myself, I can assure you, there is no better way to experience Cuba today than on our brand. We are working hard to enable more of our brands to bring guests to Cuba in the near future, a promising long-term driver of continued demand for our Caribbean itineraries. Indeed, we have had an eventful quarter.
Returning to the financials. China, which is definitely the world's largest cruise market, continues to deliver accretive returns on invested capital. We again achieved significant earnings growth this quarter and continue to fully expect earnings growth for the full year directionally proportionate with our over 60% capacity increase. 
In China, our occupancy levels remain comparable to the high levels we have consistently achieved as we introduced hundreds of thousands of new recruits to our brands. the penetration level for the sizable and rapidly expanding addressable market is well below 1%, just a fraction of the more developed cruise markets. While these guests stay within Asia today, over time, we have an opportunity to take them to all the great destinations our ship [indiscernible] they have not yet been like the unique beauty of Venice and the amazing glaciers in Alaska.
We remain confident in the long-term development of the cruise industry in China, with our capacity growth expected to be up over 30% in 2017. Now that's following over 60% increase [indiscernible] in 2016. These large year-over-year percentage increases are on a very small base, so these growth rates are already equivalent to adding about one 4,000-berth [ph] vessel each year. 
As a result, China represents less than 5% of our global capacity this year and will grow to just 6% next year after the entry of Majestic Princess, the first purpose-built ship for Chinese guests and AIDAbella, the first ship in China for our AIDA brand. Of course, the capacity shift to China helps create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. We remain confident in the outlook for [indiscernible] supply growth in 2017, our global supply growth is just 2.7%. 
Within that, we are rebalancing our portfolio to optimize the current demand environment. We expect a 5% capacity reduction in Europe, stemming from a capacity reduction in the Mediterranean region, which is down over 10%. We expect a modest 5% and 3% growth in capacity in the more robust Caribbean and Alaska deployments, respectively. On the margin, these deployment changes should contribute to yield next year. 
During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our cross brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizer system continues. And as previously noted, we'll be rolled out on 30% of our inventory across 6 of our brands this summer. We are on track to begin prototype testing in July. Even their early stage of implementation will [indiscernible] uplift as we refine our techniques to contribute to enhanced demand forecast. [indiscernible] this year's bookings will be behind us by the summer, we continue to expect a greater contribution from this effort in 2017.
And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We remain on track for our updated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. Most recently, we announced a strategic coordination of our global media planning and buying for our 7 brands in North America and the U.K., generating significant double-digit savings on our $100 million annual media spend. 
Our record quarterly results and our strong book position are a testament to the success of our ongoing strategy to drive demand well in excess of our measured capacity growth. All things considered, bookings for our ships sailing the Europe has held up well. And bookings in the Caribbean and Alaska for the remainder of the year are very strong for our brands, enabling us to raise our revenue yield expectation and affirming our conviction to deliver over 20% earnings growth this year.
We are on track for the delivery of nearly 9% return on invested capital this year and remain well on track in accelerating progress towards a double-digit threshold, again given our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of supply, coupled with our revenue management enhancement and opportunity to further leverage our scale. 
Despite the geopolitical events in Europe, including the Brexit vote, we remain confident in our long-term outlook, given the attractive value proposition our strong and diversified brand portfolio offers the, particularly in the U.K. where our local brands, PO Cruises and Cunard, sold in British pound have an increasingly competitive advantage to land-based vacation alternatives to Europe and abroad.
Our increasingly strong cash flow enables us to accelerate distribution to our shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we're nearing completion on our second $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the cumulative total of repurchases to date to approximately $1.9 billion and 38 million shares. 
In addition, recently, we announced our second dividend increase inside of a year, bringing our annual dividend distribution to over $1 billion. We plan to continue to return free cash flow and more to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our targeted range. 
Our sustained earnings improvement, coupled with our strong balance sheet, has resulted in Moody's upgrading our credit rating from Baa1 to A3 [ph]. And just yesterday, our Board of Directors authorizing our third $1 billion share repurchase program, all of which demonstrate continued confidence and realization of sustained double-digit return on invested capital, which our company is inherently capable of delivering. And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."
258823,367121095,1002805,"Carnival Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2016",2016-06-28,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results. Then I'll provide som",1131,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends and finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. 
Our record adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $0.49. This was $0.13 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: $0.05 from net revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings at our North American brands; and $0.06 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters.
Now let's look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 2%. The North American brands were flat, while the European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 5%. Our total net revenue yields were up 3.6%.
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yield. Net ticket yields were up 3.5%. The increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska. Net onboard and other yield increased almost 4%, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic mainly related to bar and casino. Net cruise costs per ALBD, excluding fuel, were down almost 2%, which is about a 3-point improvement versus what was planned in our March guidance, but again, this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.
In summary, a record second quarter adjusted EPS was almost double the prior year or $0.24 higher, driven by operational improvements worth $0.18, a favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04 and share buyback accretion worth $0.02.
Now let's turn to booking trends. Since March, bookings for the remainder of the year are at higher prices, with less inventory remaining for sale and at the same time last year. At this point in time, for the remaining 2 quarters of 2016, cumulative bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we are well ahead on the book position with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, even with our capacity increase, bodes well for pricing over the next few months.
Now let's drill down into the cumulative book position. First for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year, also at nicely higher prices. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at lower prices driven by geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands. For Europe, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at a higher price. Australia and Asia are consistent with our previous guidance. As expected, we are behind on pricing given our 60% increase in China capacity and our 15% increase in Australia capacity. For 2017, we continue to move out the booking curve. At this point in time, for the first 3 quarters of 2017, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at prices that are in line with 2016. And recent trends have been very positive with robust booking activity at slightly higher prices. These are early indications for 2017 and I do caution you not to read too much into these trends.
Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our second quarter results, combined with a strong book position, enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our previous guidance range. This is actually a $0.17 improvement offset by a $0.17 drag from fuel prices and currency. 
Our 2016 June guidance is $3.25 to $3.35. The $0.17 improvement compared to our March guidance was essentially driven by 3 things: one, improved net revenue yields worth $0.10, $0.05 of which was achieved in the second quarter and an additional $0.05 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the remainder of the year; second, lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were $0.03; and third, the accretive impact of the additional shares we purchased since our March guidance call worth $0.03.
Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are now expected to be up approximately 1.5% for 2016, 0.5 points better than our March guidance. Remember that while the yield expected to be up approximately 1.5%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5 points while the second quarter was down almost 2%. 
However, as I mentioned during the last earnings call and taking into account the reseasonalization of our planned second quarter costs into the second half of the year, we expect third quarter net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD to be up 6% to 7%, driven by the timing of advertising expense and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock. The expectation for the fourth quarter is that costs will be flat.
At the midpoint of our June guidance, net cash provided by operating activities is approaching $5 billion. As Arnold indicated, with such strong cash flows since late last year, we repurchased approximately 38 million of our shares, and our Board of Directors authorized a third $1 billion stock buyback program yesterday. 
In addition, we still have about $100 million remaining on our second $1 billion stock buyback authorization. Our June guidance EPS calculation assumes shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculations assume approximately 715 [ph] million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis while for the third quarter, the calculations assume 743 million shares outstanding.
On a final note, given the volatility of FX rates since the Brexit vote, we want to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2016 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.18 for the remainder of the year and $0.09 for the third quarter. 
For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current spot price represents a $0.07 impact for the remainder of the year and $0.04 for the third quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is about $920 million for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.03 change in realized losses on fuel derivative for the remainder of the year and $0.02 for the third quarter.
And now I'll turn it back over to Arnold."

So while there may be some bumps and temporary discontinuities as distributors ramp up with their own personnel to move the volume of cruises all those other type of travel products obviously and there might be some bumps along those lines, overall, China remains a robust opportunity, and we're still at the very, very beginning of it. So I don't see that. You're going to have some negotiations going on. Everybody wants a better price. It is a B2B business almost now, and of course, will be negotiations trying to get lower prices better returns or what-have-you. But overall things are very good. The cruise product that we offer is well received and excellent. We're going to have our first purpose-built ship, the Majestic Princess, going in next year. She's being met with very, very positive response by the distributors already. And we have our first ship, AIDA as I mentioned, going in next year. And then we have our base for Costa and the rest of the Princess. But on balance, it's the equivalent of adding one ship. And so we'll be going from 5% of our capacity to 6% of our capacity, which is large at all even with the industry moving in a few additional ships it's that can be managed may be a bumpy are in the road here or there.

I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Before I begin, as always, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
We delivered the strongest second quarter in the history of our company with record adjusted earnings per share nearly double the prior year and well above the high end of our March guidance range. The second quarter results, combined with our strong book position, has enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our full year guidance range despite a $0.17 drag from fuel and currency. Essentially, the strength in underlying demand for our products fostered greater ticket prices in both the quarter and in the remainder of the year, offsetting the rise in fuel prices since the time of our last guidance as well as the very recent significant movements in currency exchange rates following the Brexit vote.
Our record results reflect our passionate 120,000-plus employees, who in their efforts go above and beyond every day and who together with our hundreds of thousands of travel partners are the foundation of our sustained earnings improvement.
This was among the most remarkable quarters in the history of the company not only because of our record-breaking financial results but because of a significant number of milestones which will contribute meaningfully to our future success.
We introduced 3 new flagships, including Carnival Vista, purposely designed for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guest with an onboard brewery experience, entertaining IMAX theater and exhilarating SkyRide experience. Carnival Vista has already generated over 1 billion media impressions. Holland America Line's Koningsdam, christened in Rotterdam by Her Majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands delivers a new premium experience where our guests can blend their own wine, enjoy high-end slice [ph] of scotch or dance the night away in our carefully engineered Music Walk. And last but not least, the AIDAprima made its debut with a spectacular live show, fireworks and memorable naming ceremony witnessed by over 1 million people gathered in Hamburg. These well-publicized introductions are certain to continue to stimulate increased consideration for cruising within our portfolio of the world's leading cruise lines.
Moreover, we welcomed our 10th brand, Fathom, in April, with the inaugural impact sailing to the Dominican Republic to do good [ph], followed by a historic first sailing for Cuba in May. Bar none, one of the most publicized events in the history of the cruise industry was our inaugural voyage to Cuba, with over 20 billion media impressions, bringing the cumulative total media impressions for Carnival and Cuba to nearly 55 billion to date. We could not have been more proud than when our General Counsel Arnie Perez and his wife Carmen, both Cuban born, were first to disembark when we made history as the first U.S. cruise line in more than 40 years to sail for Cuba. Having sailed there myself, I can assure you there is no better way to experience Cuba today than on our Fathom brand. We are working hard to enable more of our brands to bring guests to Cuba in the near future, a promising long-term driver of continued demand for our Caribbean itineraries.
Indeed, we have had an eventful quarter.
Returning to the financials.
China, which is definitely the world's largest cruise market, continues to deliver accretive returns on invested capital. We again achieved significant earnings growth this quarter and continue to fully expect earnings growth for the full year directionally proportionate with our over 60% capacity increase. In China, our occupancy levels remain comparable to the high levels we have consistently achieved as we introduced hundreds of thousands of new-to-cruise to our brands. Yes, the penetration level for this sizable and rapidly expanding addressable market is well below 1%, just a fraction of the more developed cruise markets. While these guests sail mostly within Asia today, over time, we have an opportunity to take them to all the great destinations our ships sailed and they have not yet been, like the unique beauty of Venice and the amazing glaciers in Glacier Bay, Alaska.
We remain confident in the long-term development of the cruise industry in China, with our capacity growth expected to be up over 30% in 2017. Now that's following the over 60% increase we observed in 2016. These large year-over-year percentage increases are on a very small base, so these growth rates are already equivalent to adding about one 4,000-berth vessel each year. As a result, China represents less than 5% of our global capacity this year and will grow to just 6% next year after the entry of Majestic Princess, the first purpose-built ship for Chinese guests; and AIDAbella, the first ship in China for our AIDA brand. Of course, the capacity shift to China helps create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. We remain confident in the outlook for measured supply growth. In 2017, our global supply growth is just 2.7%.
Within that, we are rebalancing our portfolio to optimize the current demand environment. We expect a 5% capacity reduction in Europe, stemming from a capacity reduction in the Mediterranean region which is down over 10%. We expect a modest 5% and 3% growth in capacity in the more robust Caribbean and Alaska deployments, respectively. On the margin, these deployment changes should contribute to yield next year.
During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues; and as previously noted, will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory across 6 of our brands this summer. We are on track to begin prototype testing in July. Even their early stage of implementation will [indiscernible] the yield uplift as we refine our modeling techniques to contribute to enhanced demand forecasting. So as most of this year's bookings will be behind us by the summer, we continue to expect a greater contribution from this effort in 2017.
And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We remain on track to our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. Most recently, we announced a strategic coordination of our global media planning and buying for our 7 brands in North America and the U.K., generating significant double-digit savings on our $100 million annual media spend.
Our record quarterly results and our strong book position are a testament to the success of our ongoing strategy to drive demand well in excess of our measured capacity growth. All things considered, bookings for our ships sailing to Europe has held up well. And bookings in the Caribbean and Alaska for the remainder of the year are very strong for our brands, enabling us to raise our revenue yield expectations and affirming our conviction to deliver over 20% earnings growth this year.
We are on track for the delivery of nearly 9% return on invested capital this year and remain well on track in accelerating progress towards a double-digit threshold, again given our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of supply, coupled with our revenue management enhancements and opportunity to further leverage our scale. Despite the geopolitical events in Europe, including the Brexit vote, we remain confident in our long-term outlook given the attractive value proposition our strong and diversified brand portfolio offers, particularly in the U.K. where our local brands P&O Cruises and Cunard, sold in British pounds, have an increasingly competitive advantage to land-based vacation alternatives in Europe and abroad.
Our increasingly strong cash flow enables us to accelerate distributions to our shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we're nearing completion on our second $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the cumulative total of repurchases to date to approximately $1.9 billion and 38 million shares. In addition, recently, we announced our second dividend increase inside of a year, bringing our annual dividend distribution to over $1 billion. We plan to continue to return free cash flow and more to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our targeted range. Our sustained earnings improvement, coupled with our strong balance sheet, has resulted in Moody's upgrading our credit rating from Baa1 to A3; and just yesterday, our Board of Directors authorizing our third $1 billion share repurchase program, all of which demonstrate continued confidence in the realization of sustained double-digit return on invested capital, which our company is inherently capable of delivering.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."
258823,367121095,1002915,"Carnival Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2016",2016-06-28,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold.Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results. Then I'll provide som",1130,"Thank you, Arnold.
Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends and finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance.
Our record adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $0.49. This was $0.13 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: $0.05 from net revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings at our North American brands; and $0.06 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters.
Now let's look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 2%. The North American brands were flat, while the European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 5%. Our total net revenue yields were up 3.6%. Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.5%. The increase was driven by our North American brands' deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska. Net onboard and other yields increased almost 4%, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic, mainly related to bar and casino. Net cruise costs per ALBD, excluding fuel, were down almost 2%, which is about a 3-point improvement versus what was planned in our March guidance, but again this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.
In summary, our record second quarter adjusted EPS was almost double the prior year or $0.24 higher, driven by operational improvements worth $0.18, a favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04 and share buyback accretion worth $0.02.
Now let's turn to booking trends. Since March, bookings for the remainder of the year are at higher prices, with less inventory remaining for sale than at the same time last year. At this points in time, for the remaining 2 quarters of 2016, cumulative bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we are well ahead on the book position with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, even with our capacity increase, bodes well for pricing over the next few months.
Now let's drill down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brands, Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year also at nicely higher prices. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at lower prices driven by geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance. Secondly, for our EAA brands: For Europe, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our previous guidance. As expected, we are behind on pricing given our 60% increase in China capacity and our 15% increase in Australia capacity.
For 2017, we continue to move out the booking curve. At this point in time, for the first 3 quarters of 2017, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at prices that are in line with 2016. And recent trends have been very positive with robust booking activity at slightly higher prices. These are early indications for 2017, and I do caution you not to read too much into these trends.
Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our second quarter results, combined with a strong book position, enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our previous guidance range. This is actually a $0.17 improvement offset by a $0.17 drag from fuel prices and currency.
Our 2016 June guidance is $3.25 to $3.35. The $0.17 improvement compared to our March guidance was essentially driven by 3 things: one, improved net revenue yields worth $0.10, $0.05 of which was achieved in the second quarter and an additional $0.05 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the remainder of the year; second, lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, worth $0.03; and third, the accretive impact from the additional shares we purchased since our March guidance call worth $0.03.
Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are now expected to be up approximately 1.5% for 2016, 0.5 points better than our March guidance. Remember that while the yield is expected to be up approximately 1.5%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5 points, while the second quarter was down almost 2%. However, as I mentioned during the last earnings call and taking into account the reseasonalization of our planned second quarter costs into the second half of the year, we expect third quarter net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD to be up 6% to 7%, driven by the timing of advertising expense and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock. The expectation for the fourth quarter is that costs will be flat.
At the midpoint of our June guidance, net cash provided by operating activities is approaching $5 billion. As Arnold indicated, with such strong cash flows since late last year, we repurchased approximately 38 million of our shares, and our Board of Directors authorized a third $1 billion stock buyback program yesterday. In addition, we still have about $100 million remaining on our second $1 billion stock buyback authorization.
Our June guidance EPS calculation assumes shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculations assume approximately 750 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while for the third quarter, the calculations assume 743 million shares outstanding.
On a final note, given the volatility of FX rates since the Brexit vote, we want to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2016 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.18 for the remainder of the year and $0.09 for the third quarter. For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current spot price represents a $0.07 impact for the remainder of the year and $0.04 for the third quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is about $920 million for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.03 change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the remainder of the year and $0.02 for the third quarter.

While the percentages sound so large, it's the equivalent of moving one additional ship down to a market that in time is going to be far larger than the North American market and could be as large proportionally as the entire global cruise market is right now. So while there may be some bumps and temporary discontinuities as distributors ramp up with their own personnel to move the volume of cruises, all those trips. They sell other type of travel products, obviously. And there might be some bumps along those lines. Overall, China remains a robust opportunity, and we're still at the very, very beginning of it. So I don't see that. You're going to have some negotiations going on. Everybody wants a better price. It is a B2B business almost now. And of course, they'll be in negotiations, trying to get lower prices then get better returns or what-have-you, but overall things are very good. The cruise product that we offer is well received and excellent. We're going to have our first purpose-built ship, the Majestic Princess, going in next year. She is being met with very, very positive response by the distributors already. And we have our first ship for AIDA, as I mentioned, going in next year. And then we have our base for Costa and the rest of the Princess, but on balance, it's the equivalent of adding one ship. And so we'll be going from 5% of our capacity to 6% of our capacity, which is not very [ph] large at all even with the industry moving in a few additional ships and stuff that can be managed. There may be a bump here in the road -- here or there, but over time, it's going to be great. And we do expect to see continued earnings improvement directionally with the class in expansion."

I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you, all, for joining us this morning.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Before I begin, as always, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
We delivered the strongest second quarter in the history of our company with record adjusted earnings per share nearly double the prior year and well above the high end of our March guidance range. The second quarter results combined with our strong book position has enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our full year guidance range despite a $0.17 drag from fuel and currency. Essentially, the strength and underlying demand for our products fostered greater ticket prices in both the quarter and in the remainder of the year, offsetting the rise in fuel prices since the time of our last guidance as well as the very recent significant movements in currency exchange rates following the Brexit vote.
Our record results reflect our passionate 120,000-plus employees, who in their efforts go above and beyond every day and who together with our hundreds of thousands of travel partners are the foundation of our sustained earnings improvement.
This was among the most remarkable quarters in the history of the company not only because of our record-breaking financial results but because of a significant number of milestones which will contribute meaningfully to our future success.
We introduced 3 new flagships, including Carnival Vista, purposely designed for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guest with an onboard brewery experience, entertaining IMAX theater and exhilarating SkyRide experience. Carnival Vista has already generated over 1 billion media impressions. Holland America Line's Koningsdam, christened in Rotterdam by Her Majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands delivers a new premium experience where our guests can blend their own wine, enjoy high-end slice [ph] of scotch or dance the night away in our carefully engineered Music Walk. And last but not least, the AIDAprima made its debut with a spectacular light show, fireworks and memorable naming ceremony witnessed by over 1 million people gathered in Hamburg. These well-publicized introductions are certain to continue to stimulate increased consideration for cruising within our portfolio of the world's leading cruise lines.
Moreover, we welcomed our 10th brand, Fathom, in April, with the inaugural impact sailing to the Dominican Republic to do good [ph], followed by a historic first sailing for Cuba in May. Bar none, one of the most publicized events in the history of the cruise industry was our inaugural voyage to Cuba, with over 20 billion media impressions, bringing the cumulative total media impressions for Carnival and Cuba to nearly 55 billion to date. We could not have been more proud than when our General Counsel Arnie Perez and his wife Carmen, both Cuban born, were first to disembark when we made history as the first U.S. cruise line in more than 40 years to sail for Cuba. Having sailed there myself, I can assure you there is no better way to experience Cuba today than on our Fathom brand. We are working hard to enable more of our brands to bring guests to Cuba in the near future, a promising long-term driver of continued demand for our Caribbean itineraries.
Indeed, we have had an eventful quarter.
Returning to the financials.
China, which is definitely the world's largest cruise market, continues to deliver accretive returns on invested capital. We again achieved significant earnings growth this quarter and continue to fully expect earnings growth for the full year directionally proportionate with our over 60% capacity increase. In China, our occupancy levels remain comparable to the high levels we have consistently achieved as we introduced hundreds of thousands of new-to-cruise to our brands. Yes, the penetration level for this sizable and rapidly expanding addressable market is well below 1%, just a fraction of the more developed cruise markets. While these guests sail mostly within Asia today, over time, we have an opportunity to take them to all the great destinations our ships sailed and they have not yet been, like the unique beauty of Venice and the amazing glaciers in Glacier Bay, Alaska.
We remain confident in the long-term development of the cruise industry in China, with our capacity growth expected to be up over 30% in 2017. Now that's following the over 60% increase observed in 2016. These large year-over-year percentage increases are on a very small base, so these growth rates are an equivalent to adding about one 4,000-berth vessel each year. As a result, China represents less than 5% of our global capacity this year and will grow to just 6% next year after the entry of Majestic Princess, the first purpose-built ship for Chinese guests; and AIDAbella, the first ship in China for our AIDA brand. Of course, the capacity shift to China helps create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. We remain confident in the outlook for measured supply growth. In 2017, our global supply growth is just 2.7%.
Within that, we are rebalancing our portfolio to optimize the current demand environment. We expect a 5% capacity reduction in Europe, stemming from a capacity reduction in the Mediterranean region which is down over 10%. We expect a modest 5% and 3% growth in capacity in the more robust Caribbean and Alaska deployments, respectively. On the margin, these deployment changes should contribute to yield next year.
During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues; and as previously noted, will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory across 6 of our brands this summer. We are on track to begin prototype testing in July. Even the early stage of implementation will foster yield uplift as we refine our modeling techniques to contribute to enhanced demand forecasting. So as most of this year's bookings will be behind us by the summer, we continue to expect a greater contribution from this effort in 2017.
And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We remain on track for our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. Most recently, we announced a strategic coordination of our global media planning and buying for our 7 brands in North America and the U.K., generating a significant double-digit savings on our $100 million annual media spend.
Our record quarterly results and our strong book position are a testament to the success of our ongoing strategy to drive demand well in excess of our measured capacity growth. All things considered, bookings for our ships sailing to Europe has held up well. And bookings in the Caribbean and Alaska for the remainder of the year are very strong for our brands, enabling us to raise our revenue yield expectations and affirming our conviction to deliver over 20% earnings growth this year.
We are on track for the delivery of nearly 9% return on invested capital this year and remain well on track in accelerating progress towards a double-digit threshold, again given our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of supply, coupled with our revenue management enhancements and opportunity to further leverage our scale. Despite the geopolitical events in Europe, including the Brexit vote, we remain confident in our long-term outlook given the attractive value proposition our strong and diversified brand portfolio offers, particularly in the U.K. where our local brands P&O Cruises and Cunard, sold in British pounds, have an increasingly competitive advantage to land-based vacation alternatives in Europe and abroad.
Our increasingly strong cash flow enables us to accelerate distributions to our shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we're nearing completion on our second $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the cumulative total of repurchases to date to approximately $1.9 billion and 38 million shares. In addition, recently, we announced our second dividend increase inside of a year, bringing our annual dividend distribution to over $1 billion. We plan to continue to return free cash flow and more to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our targeted range. Our sustained earnings improvement, coupled with our strong balance sheet, has resulted in Moody's upgrading our credit rating from Baa1 to A3; and just yesterday, our Board of Directors authorizing our third $1 billion share repurchase program, all of which demonstrate continued confidence in the realization of sustained double-digit return on invested capital, which our company is inherently capable of delivering.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."
258823,367121095,1003037,"Carnival Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2016",2016-06-28,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold.Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results. Then I'll provide som",1130,"Thank you, Arnold.
Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends and finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance.
Our record adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $0.49. This was $0.13 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: $0.05 from net revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings at our North American brands; and $0.06 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters.
Now let's look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 2%. The North American brands were flat, while the European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 5%. Our total net revenue yields were up 3.6%. Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.5%. The increase was driven by our North American brands' deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska. Net onboard and other yields increased almost 4%, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic, mainly related to bar and casino. Net cruise costs per ALBD, excluding fuel, were down almost 2%, which is about a 3-point improvement versus what was planned in our March guidance, but again this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.
In summary, our record second quarter adjusted EPS was almost double the prior year or $0.24 higher, driven by operational improvements worth $0.18, a favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04 and share buyback accretion worth $0.02.
Now let's turn to booking trends. Since March, bookings for the remainder of the year are at higher prices, with less inventory remaining for sale than at the same time last year. At this point in time, for the remaining 2 quarters of 2016, cumulative bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we are well ahead on the book position with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, even with our capacity increase, bodes well for pricing over the next few months.
Now let's drill down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brands, Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year also at nicely higher prices. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at lower prices driven by geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance. Secondly, for our EAA brands: For Europe, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our previous guidance. As expected, we are behind on pricing given our 60% increase in China capacity and our 15% increase in Australia capacity.
For 2017, we continue to move out the booking curve. At this point in time, for the first 3 quarters of 2017, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at prices that are in line with 2016. And recent trends have been very positive with robust booking activity at slightly higher prices. These are early indications for 2017, and I do caution you not to read too much into these trends.
Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our second quarter results, combined with a strong book position, enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our previous guidance range. This is actually a $0.17 improvement offset by a $0.17 drag from fuel prices and currency.
Our 2016 June guidance is $3.25 to $3.35. The $0.17 improvement compared to our March guidance was essentially driven by 3 things: one, improved net revenue yields worth $0.10, $0.05 of which was achieved in the second quarter and an additional $0.05 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the remainder of the year; second, lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, worth $0.03; and third, the accretive impact from the additional shares we purchased since our March guidance call worth $0.03.
Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are now expected to be up approximately 1.5% for 2016, 0.5 points better than our March guidance. Remember that while the yield is expected to be up approximately 1.5%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5 points, while the second quarter was down almost 2%. However, as I mentioned during the last earnings call and taking into account the reseasonalization of our planned second quarter costs into the second half of the year, we expect third quarter net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD to be up 6% to 7%, driven by the timing of advertising expense and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock. The expectation for the fourth quarter is that costs will be flat.
At the midpoint of our June guidance, net cash provided by operating activities is approaching $5 billion. As Arnold indicated, with such strong cash flows since late last year, we repurchased approximately 38 million of our shares, and our Board of Directors authorized a third $1 billion stock buyback program yesterday. In addition, we still have about $100 million remaining on our second $1 billion stock buyback authorization.
Our June guidance EPS calculations assumes shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculations assume approximately 750 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while for the third quarter, the calculations assume 743 million shares outstanding.
On a final note, given the volatility of FX rates since the Brexit vote, we want to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2016 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.18 for the remainder of the year and $0.09 for the third quarter. For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current spot price represents a $0.07 impact for the remainder of the year and $0.04 for the third quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is about $920 million for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio.

While the percentages sound so large, it's the equivalent of moving one additional ship down to a market that in time is going to be far larger than the North American market and could be as large proportionally as the entire global cruise market is right now. So while there may be some bumps and temporary discontinuities as distributors ramp up with their own personnel to move the volume of cruise, because a lot of those distributors sell all the type of travel products, obviously. And there might be some bumps along those lines. Overall, China remains a robust opportunity, and we're still at the very, very beginning of it. So I don't see that. You're going to have some negotiations going on. Everybody wants a better price. It is a B2B business almost now. And of course, there'll be negotiations, trying to get lower price so they can get better returns or what-have-you, but overall things are very good. The cruise product that we offer is well received and excellent. We're going to have our first purpose-built ship, the Majestic Princess, going in next year. She is being met with very, very positive response by the distributors already. And we have our first ship for AIDA, as I mentioned, going in next year. And then we have our base for Costa and the rest of the Princess, but on balance, it's the equivalent of adding one ship. And so we'll be going from 5% of our capacity to 6% of our capacity, which is not very large at all even with the industry moving in a few additional ships and stuff that can be managed. There may be a bump here in the road, here or there, but over time, it's going to be great. And we do expect to see continued earnings improvement, a direction with the capacity expansion."

I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Before I begin, as always, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
We delivered the strongest second quarter in the history of our company with record adjusted earnings per share nearly double the prior year and well above the high end of our March guidance range. The second quarter results combined with our strong book position has enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our full year guidance range despite a $0.17 drag from fuel and currency. Essentially, the strength and underlying demand for our products fostered greater ticket prices in both the quarter and in the remainder of the year, offsetting the rise in fuel prices since the time of our last guidance as well as the very recent significant movements in currency exchange rates following the Brexit vote.
Our record results reflect our passionate 120,000-plus employees, who in their efforts go above and beyond every day and who together with our hundreds of thousands of travel partners are the foundation of our sustained earnings improvement.
This was among the most remarkable quarters in the history of the company not only because of our record-breaking financial results but because of a significant number of milestones which will contribute meaningfully to our future success.
We introduced 3 new flagships, including Carnival Vista, purposely designed for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guest with an onboard brewery experience, entertaining IMAX theater and exhilarating SkyRide experience. Carnival Vista has already generated over 1 billion media impressions. Holland America Line's Koningsdam, christened in Rotterdam by Her Majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands delivers a new premium experience where our guests can blend their own wine, enjoy high-end slice [ph] of scotch or dance the night away in our carefully engineered Music Walk. And last but not least, the AIDAprima made its debut with a spectacular light show, fireworks and memorable naming ceremony witnessed by over 1 million people gathered in Hamburg. These well-publicized introductions are certain to continue to stimulate increased consideration for cruising within our portfolio of the world's leading cruise lines.
Moreover, we welcomed our 10th brand, Fathom, in April, with the inaugural impact sailing to the Dominican Republic to do good [ph], followed by a historic first sailing for Cuba in May. Bar none, one of the most publicized events in the history of the cruise industry was our inaugural voyage to Cuba, with over 20 billion media impressions, bringing the cumulative total media impressions for Carnival and Cuba to nearly 55 billion to date. We could not have been more proud than when our General Counsel Arnie Perez and his wife Carmen, both Cuban born, were first to disembark when we made history as the first U.S. cruise line in more than 40 years to sail for Cuba. Having sailed there myself, I can assure you there is no better way to experience Cuba today than on our Fathom brand. We are working hard to enable more of our brands to bring guests to Cuba in the near future, a promising long-term driver of continued demand for our Caribbean itineraries.
Indeed, we have had an eventful quarter.
Returning to the financials.
China, which is definitely the world's largest cruise market, continues to deliver accretive returns on invested capital. We again achieved significant earnings growth this quarter and continue to fully expect earnings growth for the full year directionally proportionate with our over 60% capacity increase. In China, our occupancy levels remain comparable to the high levels we have consistently achieved as we introduced hundreds of thousands of new-to-cruise to our brands. Yes, the penetration level for this sizable and rapidly expanding addressable market is well below 1%, just a fraction of the more developed cruise markets. While these guests sail mostly within Asia today, over time, we have an opportunity to take them to all the great destinations our ships sailed and they have not yet been, like the unique beauty of Venice and the amazing glaciers in Glacier Bay, Alaska.
We remain confident in the long-term development of the cruise industry in China, with our capacity growth expected to be up over 30% in 2017. Now that's following the over 60% increase observed in 2016. These large year-over-year percentage increases are on a very small base, so these growth rates are an equivalent to adding about one 4,000-berth vessel each year. As a result, China represents less than 5% of our global capacity this year and will grow to just 6% next year after the entry of Majestic Princess, the first purpose-built ship for Chinese guests; and AIDAbella, the first ship in China for our AIDA brand. Of course, the capacity shift to China helps create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. We remain confident in the outlook for measured supply growth. In 2017, our global supply growth is just 2.7%.
Within that, we are rebalancing our portfolio to optimize the current demand environment. We expect a 5% capacity reduction in Europe, stemming from a capacity reduction in the Mediterranean region which is down over 10%. We expect a modest 5% and 3% growth in capacity in the more robust Caribbean and Alaska deployments, respectively. On the margin, these deployment changes should contribute to yield next year.
During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues; and as previously noted, will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory across 6 of our brands this summer. We are on track to begin prototype testing in July. Even the early stage of implementation will foster yield uplift as we refine our modeling techniques to contribute to enhanced demand forecasting. So as most of this year's bookings will be behind us by the summer, we continue to expect a greater contribution from this effort in 2017.
And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We remain on track for our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. Most recently, we announced a strategic coordination of our global media planning and buying for our 7 brands in North America and the U.K., generating a significant double-digit savings on our $100 million annual media spend.
Our record quarterly results and our strong book position are a testament to the success of our ongoing strategy to drive demand well in excess of our measured capacity growth. All things considered, bookings for our ships sailing to Europe has held up well. And bookings in the Caribbean and Alaska for the remainder of the year are very strong for our brands, enabling us to raise our revenue yield expectations and affirming our conviction to deliver over 20% earnings growth this year.
We are on track for the delivery of nearly 9% return on invested capital this year and remain well on track in accelerating progress towards a double-digit threshold, again given our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of supply, coupled with our revenue management enhancements and opportunity to further leverage our scale. Despite the geopolitical events in Europe, including the Brexit vote, we remain confident in our long-term outlook given the attractive value proposition our strong and diversified brand portfolio offers, particularly in the U.K. where our local brands P&O Cruises and Cunard, sold in British pounds, have an increasingly competitive advantage to land-based vacation alternatives in Europe and abroad.
Our increasingly strong cash flow enables us to accelerate distributions to our shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we're nearing completion on our second $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the cumulative total of repurchases to date to approximately $1.9 billion and 38 million shares. In addition, recently, we announced our second dividend increase inside of a year, bringing our annual dividend distribution to over $1 billion. We plan to continue to return free cash flow and more to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our targeted range. Our sustained earnings improvement, coupled with our strong balance sheet, has resulted in Moody's upgrading our credit rating from Baa1 to A3; and just yesterday, our Board of Directors authorizing our third $1 billion share repurchase program, all of which demonstrate continued confidence in the realization of sustained double-digit return on invested capital, which our company is inherently capable of delivering.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."
258823,367121095,1003421,"Carnival Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2016",2016-06-28,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold.Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results. Then I'll provide som",1130,"Thank you, Arnold.
Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends and finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance.
Our record adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $0.49. This was $0.13 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: $0.05 from net revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings at our North American brands; and $0.06 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters.
Now let's look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 2%. The North American brands were flat, while the European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 5%. Our total net revenue yields were up 3.6%. Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.5%. The increase was driven by our North American brands' deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska. Net onboard and other yields increased almost 4%, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic, mainly related to bar and casino. Net cruise costs per ALBD, excluding fuel, were down almost 2%, which is about a 3-point improvement versus what was planned in our March guidance, but again this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.
In summary, our record second quarter adjusted EPS was almost double the prior year or $0.24 higher, driven by operational improvements worth $0.18, a favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04 and share buyback accretion worth $0.02.
Now let's turn to booking trends. Since March, bookings for the remainder of the year are at higher prices, with less inventory remaining for sale than at the same time last year. At this point in time, for the remaining 2 quarters of 2016, cumulative bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we are well ahead on the book position with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, even with our capacity increase, bodes well for pricing over the next few months.
Now let's drill down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brands, Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year also at nicely higher prices. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at lower prices driven by geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance. Secondly, for our EAA brands: For Europe, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our previous guidance. As expected, we are behind on pricing given our 60% increase in China capacity and our 15% increase in Australia capacity.
For 2017, we continue to move out the booking curve. At this point in time, for the first 3 quarters of 2017, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at prices that are in line with 2016. And recent trends have been very positive with robust booking activity at slightly higher prices. These are early indications for 2017, and I do caution you not to read too much into these trends.
Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our second quarter results, combined with a strong book position, enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our previous guidance range. This is actually a $0.17 improvement offset by a $0.17 drag from fuel prices and currency.
Our 2016 June guidance is $3.25 to $3.35. The $0.17 improvement compared to our March guidance was essentially driven by 3 things: one, improved net revenue yields worth $0.10, $0.05 of which was achieved in the second quarter and an additional $0.05 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the remainder of the year; second, lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, worth $0.03; and third, the accretive impact from the additional shares we purchased since our March guidance call worth $0.03.
Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are now expected to be up approximately 1.5% for 2016, 0.5 points better than our March guidance. Remember that while the yield is expected to be up approximately 1.5%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5 points, while the second quarter was down almost 2%. However, as I mentioned during the last earnings call and taking into account the reseasonalization of our planned second quarter costs into the second half of the year, we expect third quarter net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD to be up 6% to 7%, driven by the timing of advertising expense and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock. The expectation for the fourth quarter is that costs will be flat.
At the midpoint of our June guidance, net cash provided by operating activities is approaching $5 billion. As Arnold indicated, with such strong cash flows since late last year, we repurchased approximately 38 million of our shares, and our Board of Directors authorized a third $1 billion stock buyback program yesterday. In addition, we still have about $100 million remaining on our second $1 billion stock buyback authorization.
Our June guidance EPS calculations assumes shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculations assume approximately 750 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while for the third quarter, the calculations assume 743 million shares outstanding.
On a final note, given the volatility of FX rates since the Brexit vote, we want to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2016 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.18 for the remainder of the year and $0.09 for the third quarter. For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current spot price represents a $0.07 impact for the remainder of the year and $0.04 for the third quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is about $920 million for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.03 change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the remainder of the year and $0.02 for the third quarter.
And now I'll turn it back over to Arnold."

While the percentages sound so large, it's the equivalent of moving one additional ship down to a market that in time is going to be far larger than the North American market and could be as large proportionally as the entire global cruise market is right now. So while there may be some bumps and temporary discontinuities as distributors ramp up with their own personnel to move the volume of cruise, because a lot of those distributors sell other type of travel products, obviously. And there might be some bumps along those lines. Overall, China remains a robust opportunity, and we're still at the very, very beginning of it. So I don't see that. You're going to have some negotiations going on. Everybody wants a better price. It is a B2B business almost now. And of course, there'll be negotiations, trying to get lower price so they can get better returns or what-have-you, but overall things are very good. The cruise product that we offer is well received and excellent. We're going to have our first purpose-built ship, the Majestic Princess, going in next year. She is being met with very, very positive response by the distributors already. And we have our first ship for AIDA, as I mentioned, going in next year. And then we have our base for Costa and the rest of the Princess, but on balance, it's the equivalent of adding one ship. And so we'll be going from 5% of our capacity to 6% of our capacity, which is not very large at all even with the industry moving in a few additional ships and stuff that can be managed. There may be a bump here in the road, here or there, but over time, it's going to be great. And we do expect to see continued earnings improvement directionally to capacity expansion."

I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by Dav",1487,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. 
Despite a series of geopolitical events that unfolded as the year progressed, including Turkey, Paris and Brussels, despite heightened concerns around [indiscernible], around Brexit and around China, despite fuel and currency both working against us, resulting in an $0.18 drag from our initial 2016 guidance, we had exceeded the high end of our quarterly guidance and we are raising our expectations for the year. 
This quarter, we delivered the highest quarterly earnings in Carnival Corporation's history, with record net income of over $1.4 billion, $0.17 per share higher than the prior year, exceeding the high-end of our guidance and $0.07 above the midpoint. Despite the numerous headwinds, we are well on track to achieve our new guidance midpoint for full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.35, more than doubling our 2013 earnings of $1.55 per share. More importantly, our return on invested capital will also nearly double from 4.6% to 8.8% over that same time period. 
These strong results could not happen without the hard work of our 120,000 passionate employees and without the strong support of our travel agent partners. Looking forward, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, with higher occupancy levels and higher prices, building momentum for continued earnings growth. 
Our record results and favorable booking trends reflect our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth together with the benefits of leveraging our scale. Our [indiscernible] cruise lines continue to outperform, particularly in the Caribbean with continued strength in [indiscernible] and pricing. Moreover, all of our major brands in North America and Europe experienced net revenue yield improvement despite the geopolitical environment in Europe. 
Europe is our single largest deployment in the third quarter at 45% of our total capacity. Now there's certainly have been a lot of noise around China. So I'm going to spend a little extra time on China on my comments now. First, China is a profitable market for us. Our ships operating in China optimize our overall brand performances. As we have previously indicated, China is a unit growth opportunity and we expect the yield to be down as the distribution system improve its ability to service the growing market there. 
To demonstrate our commitment to grow the industry in China, we have factored into our results and into our guidance potential adjustments to our contracted prices in support of our distribution partners. The distributors are gaining experience translating pent-up consumer demand for cruising into sustainable market pricing and we certainly want to help them as they adapt to a rapidly growing market. 
Again, even with those adjustments, we are raising our guidance for the year, affirming that we can manage ups and downs in the symbiotic market. As we've previously pointed out, China represents just 5% of our capacity. And even with capacity growth well above our global average, it will remain a relatively small percentage of our total business. We continue to expect China to be a growth market, especially since the growth in the cruise industry is backed by the Chinese government as is evidenced by its inclusion in the current five-year plan. We will participate in this growth. We have 16 [ph] market officers in China in 2016, that's up from just 8 in 2015. We plan to open 4 more offices and to significantly expand our distribution network in 2017. Also in 2017, the brand-new Majestic Princess will enter as a first purpose-built ship for the Chinese market. Our capacity growth in China is expected to be 26% next year, compared to 66% this year. Industrywide growth in China is expected to be 31% in 2017, compared to 100% this year. Those numbers sound big. But keep in mind that these large year-over-year percentage increases [indiscernible] a very small base. So these growth rates are directionally equivalent to adding less than one 3,000 berth vessels to our China fleet and roughly two 4,000 berth vessel to the industry fleet overall in 2017 in China. 
Regardless of the rate of growth in China, we are firmly committed to overall measured capacity growth and fully capable of managing to sustainable double-digit return on invested capital. 
Concerning newbuild, our most recent announcement included 3 new ship orders for 2021 and 2022, our first orders for those years. Before 2020, there's been no change in capacity for previous announcements. To optimize the deployment however, we have allocated the newbuild long our brand. 
Over the next 4 years, 3 ships are planned to be purpose-built for Asia, our fastest-growing region which is still in its early stage of development. And an average of roughly 3 ships per year will be spread across all our established markets. In fact, we have a very measured capacity environment during this time at the brand level, with 2 ships each for our North American land Carnival Cruise Line, our global brand, Princess, our luxury brand, Seabourn, and our German brand, AIDA. Effectively, one ship every other year for those brands. In addition, over the same 4-year period, we will deliver just 1 ship each for Holland America Line, [indiscernible] in Southern Europe, P&O in the U.K. and P&O in Australia. And during this time, we will continually moving ships from our fleet. In fact, the number of berths that are eligible for removal will more than double by 2020 and more than double again by 2024. 
Yet in this potential replacement cycle increase, we expect that a greater portion of our newbuild capacity will actually replace older, less efficient ships. As in the past, we will sell ships into secondary markets that do not compete directly with our brands. Within those secondary markets, there are older ships operating today that will soon reach retirement age and need to be replaced. We expect our net capacity growth through 2020 to be 3% to 4% compounded annually, consisting of double-digit growth in Asia and obviously, 3% or less growth in our established markets in North America, Europe and Australia. 
Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We have stepped up our aggressive relations effort with 3 innovative 30-minute programs airing weekly on ABC, NBC and CW, every Saturday meaning, beginning on October. Each program showcases our brands, creating amazing vacation experiences that are designed to expand the audience for cruising by providing increased consideration and, at the same time, changing perceptions by the [indiscernible] of cruising with compelling original content. We are excited by the prospects of connecting people, places and cultures across the world to create unforgettable experiences. Collectively, these programs provide an 1.5 hours of content per week with over 150 scheduled airings and an annual expected viewership well in excess of 150 million people. And we have further innovations on the horizon that will be unveiled in January of 2017 designed to further enhance our already great guest experiences. 
Additionally, we launched the initial phase of our yield management system this quarter, helping us drive incremental revenue yields over time. We are currently market testing across 6 brands for a portion of the inventory to refine algorithms. The full rollout will be completed by late next year. Although we have already benefited from the sharing of best practices, we expect this new yield management technology to contribute in 2017 and even more so in 2018. 
We also continue to make progress on our cost containment efforts and remain on track for more than $75 million of cost savings this year. 
In summary, we are committed to measured capacity growth, currently planned at less than 3% in the established markets. Our brands are differentiating themselves in the market and delivering fantastic vacations for our guests as evidenced by our strong yield performance. We continue to build demand for cruise and continue to aggressively contain cost while still investing in enhanced guest experience and demand creation. We are improving our capability to extract yield in any environment through enhanced revenue management tools. Moreover, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased another $700 million of [indiscernible] stock through our ongoing buyback program. In the last year, we have invested nearly $2.5 billion to buy back over 50 million shares of our company stock, demonstrating conviction in our ability to execute and achieve sustainable double-digit returns on invested capital. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."

Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I'll provide an",1141,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I'll provide an update on our full year 2016 guidance. And then I'll finish up with some insights on 2017 booking trends and a few other items to note for 2017. 
Our record adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.92. This was $0.07 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The improvement was driven by a number of factors: First, $0.02 cents from net revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on closing bookings on our North American brands; second, $0.02 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters; third, $0.01 from the favorable net impact of fuel prices and currency versus our June guidance rates; and fourth, $0.01 from the accretive impact of the shares we've repurchased since the last earnings call. 
Now let's turn to the third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost [ph] 4%. The North American brands were up over 2%, while our European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 2.7%. 
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.1%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean, Alaska and Europe, as well as our EAA brands deployments in Europe. These net ticket yields increases were partially offset by yield reductions in Australia, driven by large industry capacity increases in a highly penetrated market, as well as yield reductions in Asia where distributors are gaining experience growing the market. The majority of these yield reductions were anticipated in our initial 2016 yield guidance, provided during our December earnings call. 
After 8 straight quarters of mid-to high single digit yield increases, our net onboard and other yields increased 1.3% over much tougher comparables from the third quarter 2015 as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends while our brands develop new initiatives for 2017 and beyond. 
Net cruise costs per ALBD excluding fuel were up over 5%, driven by the timing of advertising expenses and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock as discussed on our last earnings call. This was about 1 point improvement versus what was planned in our June guidance. But again, this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. 
In summary, our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by 3 things: One, operational improvements worth $0.05 despite a high net cruise cost seasonalization in the third quarter; two, the favorable net impact of fuel prices and currency were $0.02; and three, share buyback accretion were $0.10. 
As Arnold indicated, since the beginning of the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares for a total, since late last year, of over 50 million shares and nearly $2.5 billion of buybacks. At this point in time, we have approximately $500 million remaining on the $3 billion stock buyback authorization. Our September guidance EPS calculations assumes shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculation assumes 748 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while the fourth quarter calculation assumes 730 million shares outstanding. 
Next, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, we are well on track for achieving adjusted EPS of $3.35, which is the midpoint of our 2016 September guidance range of $3.33 to $3.37. The $0.05 improvement compared to the midpoint of our June guidance was essentially driven by 2 things: Improved net revenue yields were $0.03, $0.02 of which we achieved in the third quarter and an additional $0.01 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the fourth quarter; and $0.02 from the accretive impact of additional shares repurchased since our June conference call. 
Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since June, bookings for the first half of 2017 have been at significantly higher prices, with booking volumes lower than the prior year as there is less inventory remaining for sale. At this point in time, for the first half of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are ahead at considerably higher prices. 
Drilling down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of our prior year at nicely higher prices. For all other deployments, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at higher prices. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands.  For Europe deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. For the Caribbean deployment for our EAA brands, occupancy is in line with the prior year at slightly lower prices. However, prices on these bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend. For Asia, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. And for Australia, occupancy is also well ahead of the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on the bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, also clearly an improving trend. 
And finally, a few other items to note for 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.5%. We are planning for an increase in dry dock days for approximately 380 days in 2016 to 470 days in 2017. Remember, we did benefit in 2016 from lower dry dock days compared to the 563 days we had in 2015. 
As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry dock days will vary each year. But probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. As we indicated last year, given the amount of CapEx reinvestments in the existing vessels and other areas of our business to drive yield improvement, we do expect depreciation expense to increase percentagewise, more than capacity and currently expect depreciation expense to be around $1.9 billion for 2017. 
Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the last year, we wanted to share with you the year-over-year impact that these items would have on our 2017 results if we use current fuel prices and FX rates. The 2017 year-over-year impact would be an unfavorable $0.28: $0.24 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivatives; and $0.04 for currency. 
Although it's early, 2017 appears to be shaping up to be another good year. We are well-positioned for continued earnings growth, given the current strength of our bookings and pricing trends for next year. 
And now, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

So that was the relative strength of the market in Germany for AIDA. So all of those things factor in as well as the dynamics in China itself. Similarly with the Carnival, as I mentioned on previous call on that one, it was a combination of things, how well Carnival was doing in the Caribbean, the timing of capacity coming in with the Vista coming in and other things and the fact that we had distributed ports, home ports here the U.S. and getting the right ship in the right homeport. All of those things factor in ultimately for an optimized deployment decision. And that's the beauty of our inventory is that it's mobile.

So that means the government is committed to developing the cruise industry. The reason for that is pretty self-evident. We'll employ overall with port development and infrastructure and supply chain and training as well as shipbuilding that will employ millions and millions and millions of Chinese. And so the government is very interested and they see cruise as an economic engine going forward. So you've got the support of the central government and the various provincial municipal government, so that's very important. The second thing is the growth market. The third thing is that growth is constrained. I know the percentages sound large and everything. But as I tried to point out in the opening comments, we're talking onesies, twosies and ships. And the reason the growth is constrained is because we have large addressable markets that are underpenetrated everywhere in the world. And so we have lots of places to put ships on these days. And so we're not just going to take all the ships and existing markets and move [indiscernible] in China. And there is constraint on the number of ships that can be built in China -- for China -- up for China market in the near term here. So all of those things put additional constraints. Beyond that, clearly, as we anticipated, as you guys have identified through your assessment, the yields decline. We see China as a unit volume -- a unit growth story, as ultimately accretive to earnings, which has been for us and overall helping us optimize yields across the global fleet and it's working really well. Having said that, there is a gap with distribution. It's an embryonic market. Distributors are finding their way for the first time in cruise. It is a charter market, a B2B market. So that introduces possibilities of discontinuities that you might not see if you have a direct-to-consumer kind of a market. So all of those things are things we already knew going over. Those were firm. But the other thing I wasn't firm was the enthusiasm for the government for the cruise industry, the fact that the guest satisfaction levels are high, that our ships are definitely occupied, comparable to prior years despite the significant percentage increases in capacity and we see it as a future market. Now having said all of that, with all the increases we're talking about, it's 5% of our capacity next year, with the additional increases, including the majestic Princess, will be the first purpose-built ship for China entering late next year, even with that, it's going to be 6% of our capacity. So we can only grow so fast. And because of the relatively small percentage of our total fleet it is, it's very manageable for us with any fits and styles or bumps on the road we might encounter. But we are committed to work with the distributor partners, our distributor partners in building a sustainable business in China."

So that has to be a win-win-win. So that begins the constraint about how much we will negotiate because we're not going to negotiate to a point where it's not economical for us. And that just won't happen. And so having said that, the other comment is if you take the impact this quarter, given the additional consideration we've reflected in the guidance going forward, the impact for the full year on [indiscernible] losses across our fleet is a rounding error. So we believe that we can effect [ph] a sustainable business in China over time. We're going to make practical economic decisions, our assets are mobile. And because of such a small percentage, even in the future we start looking at adding additional ships of our overall capacity, we can move a few ships around and manage [indiscernible] through smart deployment. Having said that, for next year, right now, we see good relationships with our distributor partners and an ability to extract value. Hopefully, it will be proportioned to the capacity increase are greater. But at this point, we haven't finalized those conversations. It's too early to give real guidance."

Could you maybe walk us through what happened during and following that time? It doesn't seem to have really hurt your numbers for the quarter or in terms of the outlook. Was it that you didn't see any impact on demand? Was it that you're maybe a little bit more isolated because you don't have a lot of exposure to U.S. customers going to Europe? Or does it in fact impact your business and your yields would have been all the better for the third quarter in terms of the outlook if it hadn't been for those two geopolitical events?"

So it is important to us. So the impact was this. In the cases when things got a little dicey in Istanbul and in Turkey, we obviously had to make deployment itinerary changes. So again, generally speaking, we go where our guests want to go and we go obviously where all the information we have says it's okay to go, it's safe to go because safety is number 1, obviously. And so we -- how it affects us is we make itinerary deployment changes, either because guests don't want to go or because we've gotten intelligence in the world community that it's wise not to go, it affects us that way. Additionally, we can see booking impacts right after the incident. Those tend to fade away. As you know, if you go back over years, this is not a year where this is the only time that it has happened, it happens to some extent almost in recent times, almost every year for the last several years, as does Zika, our [indiscernible], our [indiscernible], whatever these things Ebola  even. And so every year, there's geopolitical tensions, there's some kind of disease [indiscernible] nation, there's macro economic malaise, there is isolated or concentrated overcapacity in the cruise industry every year and in some markets around the world, all those things happen. And as part of our business. So we manage that, we anticipated. We change deployments. We do good revenue management practices, manage around it and that's basically it. So to us, it's normal business. I wish it wasn't that way. Every now and then, hopefully we'll get lucky and hopefully [indiscernible] those incidents because we think we will do better. Some of those itineraries we had to redirect are high-yielding short excursion. Items which could have added additional revenue and earnings to the bottom-line. We used to be in the Black Sea. We haven't been there for quite a lot. The Black Sea was one of the highest yielding, both from a ticket standpoint and mobile revenue standpoint, itineraries we could've had. And so hopefully, sometimes, those things are working in our favor and will do even better. But right now, we expect that stuff to happen to us every year and we had to manage it and we have to deliver double-digit return to invested capital in those environments."

But on the other hand, as I try to point out earlier in the call and in some of the questions, China's going to be limited in how many ships are going to be available for it to take because people are building ships while the markets as well. I think what you had to think about is the capacity growth. So we're always going to build new ships and so will others. And the reason is because the ships are more efficient, okay? And they give you the opportunity for enhanced revenue opportunity versus the existing ships. And so new ships are always going to be coming. The question is how many ships leave? How many ships go to secondary markets and so on? And in the opening comments, I referenced the fact that the number of berths that are getting to retirement, the amount of capacity that's going to go into retirement age is going to double in 2020 and they're going to double again in 2024. And so there will be a need for some of that capacity just to replace. And then the rest will get regulated by the marketplace. If there's scarce supply relative to demand, some of the less efficient ships will continue to sell. If there's not, there's relative scarcity, then some of those ships will exit. They will either go to secondary markets or they leave the fleet and be scrapped. And so that's the real dynamic. We know what we're going to do. We are committed to measured capacity growth and we know how to manage it within our brands and across the various destinations. And so based on that, we have great confidence that we'll be able to manage to the sustained double-digit return on invested capital that we have promised within the next 2 years."

So we are, overall, managing some measured capacity growth in total. But we're also doing it by brand. And that allows us to more effectively manage against a committed base of loyal cruisers to that brand and reduce the number of new to cruise at any point in time we have to generate for any given brand"

I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by D",1486,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.
Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
Despite a series of geopolitical events that unfolded as the year progressed, including Turkey, Paris and Brussels, despite heightened concerns around Zika, around Brexit and around China, despite fuel and currency both working against us, resulting in an $0.18 drag from our initial 2016 guidance, we have exceeded the high end of our quarterly guidance and we are raising our expectations for the year.
This quarter, we delivered the highest quarterly earnings in Carnival Corporation's history, with record net income of over $1.4 billion, $0.17 per share higher than the prior year, exceeding the high-end of our guidance and $0.07 above the midpoint. Despite the numerous headwinds, we are well on track to achieve our new guidance midpoint for full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.35, more than doubling our 2013 earnings of $1.55 per share. More importantly, our return on invested capital will also nearly double from 4.6% to 8.8% over that same time period.
These strong results could not happen without the hard work of our 120,000 passionate employees and without the strong support of our travel agent partners. Looking forward, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, with higher occupancy levels and higher prices, building momentum for continued earnings growth.
Our record results and favorable booking trends reflect our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth, together with the benefits of leveraging our scale. Our world-leading cruise lines continue to outperform, particularly in the Caribbean with continued strength in cost and pricing. Moreover, all of our major brands in North America and Europe experienced net revenue yield improvement despite the geopolitical environment in Europe.
Europe is our single largest deployment in the third quarter at 45% of our total capacity. Now there's certainly has been a lot of noise around China. So I'm going to spend a little extra time on China in my comments now. First, China is a profitable market for us. Our ships operating in China optimize our overall brand performances. As we have previously indicated, China is a unit growth opportunity and we expect the yield to be down as the distribution system improves its ability to service the growing market there.
To demonstrate our commitment to grow the industry in China, we have factored into our results and into our guidance potential adjustments to our contracted prices in support of our distribution partners. The distributors are gaining experience translating pent-up consumer demand for cruising into sustainable market pricing and we certainly want to help them as they adapt to a rapidly growing market.
Again, even with those adjustments, we are raising our guidance for the year, affirming that we can manage ups and downs in this embryonic market. As we've previously pointed out, China represents just 5% of our capacity. And even with capacity growth well above our global average, it will remain a relatively small percentage of our total business. We continue to expect China to be a growth market, especially since the growth in the cruise industry is backed by the Chinese government as is evidenced by its inclusion in the current five-year plan. We will participate in this growth. We have 16 marketing officers in China in 2016, that's up from just 8 in 2015. We plan to open 4 more offices and to significantly expand our distribution network in 2017. Also in 2017, the brand-new Majestic Princess will enter as a first purpose-built ship for the Chinese market. Our capacity growth in China is expected to be 26% next year compared to 66% this year. Industrywide growth in China is expected to be 31% in 2017 compared to 100% this year. Those numbers sound big. But keep in mind that these large year-over-year percentage increases over a very small base. So these growth rates are directionally equivalent to adding less than one 3,000 berth vessel to our China fleet and roughly two 4,000 berth vessels to the industry fleet overall in 2017 in China. 
Regardless of the rate of growth in China, we are firmly committed to overall measured capacity growth and fully capable of managing to sustainable double-digit return on invested capital.
Concerning newbuild, our most recent announcement included 3 new ship orders for 2021 and 2022, our first orders for those years. Before 2020, there's been no change in capacity from previous announcements. To optimize deployment however, we have reallocated the newbuilds along our brands. 
Over the next 4 years, 3 ships are planned to be purpose-built for Asia, our fastest-growing region, which is still in its earlier stage of development. And an average of roughly 3 ships per year will be spread across all our established markets. In fact, we have a very measured capacity environment during this time at the brand level, with 2 ships each for our North American brand Carnival Cruise Lines; our global brand, Princess; our luxury brand, Seabourn; and our German brand, AIDA. Effectively, one ship every other year for those brands.
In addition, over the same 4-year period, we will deliver just 1 ship each for Holland America Line, Costa in Southern Europe, P&O in the U.K. and P&O in Australia. And during this time, we will continually moving ships from our fleet. In fact, the number of berths that are eligible for removal will more than double by 2020 and more than double again by 2024.
Given this potential replacement cycle increase, we expect that a greater portion of our newbuild capacity will actually replace older, less efficient ships. As in the past, we will sell ships into secondary markets that do not compete directly with our brands. Within those secondary markets, there are older ships operating today that will soon reach retirement age and need to be replaced. We expect our net capacity growth through 2020 to be 3% to 4% compounded annually, consisting of double-digit growth in Asia and obviously, 3% or less growth in our established markets in North America, Europe and Australia.
Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We have stepped up our aggressive public relations effort with 3 innovative 30-minute programs airing weekly on ABC, NBC and CW, every Saturday morning, beginning in October. Each program showcases our brands, creating amazing vacation experiences that are designed to expand the audience for cruising by providing increased consideration and, at the same time, changing perceptions by dispelling the myth of cruising with compelling original content. We are excited by the prospects of connecting people, places and cultures across the world to create unforgettable experiences. Collectively, these programs provide an 1.5 hours of content per week with over 150 scheduled airings and an annual expected viewership well in excess of 150 million people. And we have further innovations on horizon that will be unveiled in January of 2017 designed to further enhance our already great guest experiences.
Additionally, we launched the initial phase of our yield management system this quarter, helping us drive incremental revenue yields over time. We are currently market testing across 6 brands for a portion of the inventory to refine algorithms. The full rollout will be completed by late next year. Although we have already benefited from the sharing of best practices, we expect this new yield management technology to contribute in 2017 and even more so in 2018.
We also continue to make progress on our cost containment efforts and remain on track for more than $75 million of cost savings this year.
In summary, we are committed to measured capacity growth, currently plan at less than 3% in the established markets. Our brands are differentiating themselves in the market and delivering fantastic vacations for our guests as evidenced by our strong yield performance. We continue to build demand for cruise and continue to aggressively contain costs while still investing in enhanced guest experience and demand creation. We are improving our capability to extract yield in any environment through enhanced revenue management tools. Moreover, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased another $700 million of Carnival stock through our ongoing buyback program.

258823,401982999,1050361,"Carnival Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 26, 2016",2016-09-26,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold. Before I can get, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I'll provide a",1139,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I can get, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I'll provide an update on our full year 2016 guidance. And then I'll finish up with some insights on 2017 booking trends and a few other items to note for 2017.
Our record adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.92. This was $0.07 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The improvement was driven by a number of factors: First, $0.02 cents from net revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on closing bookings on our North American brands; second, $0.02 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters; third, $0.01 from the favorable net impact of fuel prices and currency versus our June guidance rates; and fourth, $0.01 from the accretive impact of the shares we repurchased since the last earnings call.
Now let's turn to the third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. The North American brands were up over 2% while our European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 2.7%.
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.1%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean, Alaska and Europe as well as our EAA brands deployments in Europe. These net ticket yield increases were partially offset by yield reductions in Australia, driven by large industry capacity increases in a highly penetrated market as well as yield reductions in Asia, where distributors are gaining experience growing the market. The majority of these yield reductions were anticipated in our initial 2016 yield guidance, provided during our December earnings call.
After 8 straight quarters of mid-to high single digit yield increases, our net onboard and other yields increased 1.3% over much tougher comparables from the third quarter 2015 as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends while our brands develop new initiatives for 2017 and beyond.
Net cruise costs per ALBD excluding fuel were up over 5%, driven by the timing of advertising expenses and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock as discussed on our last earnings call. This was about 1 point improvement versus what was planned in our June guidance. But again, this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.
In summary, our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by 3 things: One, operational improvements worth $0.05 despite a high net cruise cost seasonalization in the third quarter; two, the favorable net impact of fuel prices and currency were $0.02; and three, share buyback accretion were $0.10.
As Arnold indicated, since the beginning of the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares for a total, since late last year, of over 50 million shares and nearly $2.5 billion of buybacks. At this point in time, we have approximately $500 million remaining on the $3 billion stock buyback authorization. Our September guidance EPS calculations assume shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculations assume 748 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while the fourth quarter calculations assume 730 million shares outstanding.
Next, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, we are well on track for achieving adjusted EPS of $3.35, which is the midpoint of our 2016 September guidance range of $3.33 to $3.37. The $0.05 improvement compared to the midpoint of our June guidance was essentially driven by 2 things: Improved net revenue yields were $0.03, $0.02 of which we achieved in the third quarter and an additional $0.01 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the fourth quarter; and $0.02 from the accretive impact of additional shares repurchased since our June conference call.
Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since June, bookings for the first half of 2017 have been at significantly higher prices with booking volumes lower than the prior year as there is less inventory remaining for sale. At this point in time, for the first half of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are ahead at considerably higher prices.
Drilling down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For all other deployments, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at higher prices.
Secondly, for our EAA brands.  For Europe deployments, occupancy is well ahead in the prior year at slightly higher prices. For the Caribbean deployment for our EAA brands, occupancy is in line with the prior year at slightly lower prices. However, prices on these bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend. For Asia, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. And for Australia, occupancy is also well ahead of the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on the bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, also clearly an improving trend.
And finally, a few other items to note for 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.5%. We are planning for an increase in dry-dock days from approximately 380 days in 2016 to 470 days in 2017. Remember, we did benefit in 2016 from lower dry-dock days compared to the 563 days we had in 2015.
As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry-dock days will vary each year. But probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. As we indicated last year, given the amount of CapEx reinvestment in the existing vessels and other areas of our business, to drive yield improvement, we do expect depreciation expense to increase percentagewise, more than capacity and currently expect depreciation expense to be around $1.9 billion for 2017.
Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the last year, we wanted to share with you the year-over-year impact that these items would have on our 2017 results if we use current fuel prices and FX rates. The 2017 year-over-year impact would be an unfavorable $0.28: $0.24 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivatives; and $0.04 for currency.
Although it's early, 2017 appears to be shaping up to be another good year. We are well positioned for continued earnings growth, given the current strength of our bookings and pricing trends for next year. 
And now, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

But also, in the case of AIDA, the AIDAprima, our new ship, we've gotten confirmation of when she's going to come in. So we now know the capacity situation we'll have. So that was the relative strength of the market in Germany for AIDA. So all of those things factor in as well as the dynamics in China itself. Similarly with the Carnival, as I mentioned on previous call on that one, it was a combination of things for how well that the Carnival is doing in the Caribbean, the timing of capacity coming in with the Vista coming in and other things and the fact that we have distributed ports, home ports here in the U.S. and getting the right ship in the right homeport. All of those things factor in ultimately for an optimized deployment decision. And that's the beauty of our inventory is that it's mobile.

So that means the government is committed to developing the cruise industry. The reason for that is pretty self-evident. We'll employ that overall with port development and infrastructure and supply chain and training as well as shipbuilding that will employ millions and millions and millions of Chinese. And so the government is very interested and they see cruise as an economic engine going forward. So you've got the support of the central government and the various provincial municipal governance so that's very important. And the second thing is just the growth market. The third thing is that growth is constrained. I know the percentages sound large and everything. But as I have tried to point out in the opening comments, we're talking onesie, twosies and ships. And the reason the growth is constrained is because we have large addressable markets that are underpenetrated everywhere in the world. And so we have lots of places to put ships on these days. And so we are not just going to take all the ships in the existing markets and move on the unity of the China. And then there is constraint on the number of ships that can be built in China -- up for China -- the China market in the near term here. So all of those things put additional constraints. Beyond that, clearly, as we anticipated, as you guys have identified through your assessments and self, that yields decline. We see China as a unit volume -- a unit growth story, as ultimately accretive to earnings, which has been for us and overall helping us optimize yields across the global fleeting and it's working really well. Having said that, there is a gap with distribution. It's embryonic market. Distributors are finding their way for the first time in cruise. It is a charter market, a B2B market. So that introduces possibilities of discontinuities that you might not see if you had a direct-to-consumer kind of a market. So all of those things are things we already knew going over. Those were firm. But the other thing I wasn't firm was the enthusiasm for the government, for the cruise industry, the fact that the guest satisfaction levels are high, that our ships are definitely occupied, comparable to prior years despite the significant percentage increases in capacity and we see it as a future market. Now having said all of that, with all the increases we're talking about, it's 5% of our capacity next year with the additional increases, including the Majestic Princess, will be the first purpose-built ship for China entering late next year, even with that, it's going to be 6% of our capacity. So we can only grow so fast. And because of the relatively small percentage of our total fleet it is, it's very manageable for us with any fits and styles or bumps on the road we might encounter. But we're committed to work with distributor partners, our distributor partners in building a sustainable business in China."

Number 2, in the case of the Carnival brand, in particular, again, we have a very large base of previous cruise goers that are loyal to the brand. And that, obviously, helps us because those people have experienced the brand and love it and want to do it again and again. And then thirdly, we're better in our revenue management skills. And so we have shared best practices across the brands and revenue management. And our people are getting increasingly sophisticated and doing very, very well. Also, we've anticipated a bit of an election slowdown, historically. There's always been a little falloff in booking volumes around election time. And so there could be some of that. But in our case, again, right now, we're doing so well, and we are so far ahead and the pricing is strong, we've got great close in pricing right now. And so it's been very good.

Sustainable for our distributor partners, sustainable in terms of the government's desire to have the cruise industry be established there and, obviously, sustainable for us from a profit standpoint.

And that just won't happen. And so having said that, the other comment is if you take the impact this quarter, given even the additional consideration we've reflected in the guidance going forward, the impact for the full year on yields and losses across our fleet is a rounding error. So we believe that we can effect a sustainable business in China over time. We're going to make practical economic decisions, our assets are mobile. And because of such a small percentage, even in the future when we start looking at adding additional ships above our overall capacity, we can move a few ships around and manage any defect with a true [ph] smart deployment. Having said that, for next year, right now, we see good relationships with our distributor partners and an ability to extract value. Hopefully, it will be proportionate for the capacity increase or greater. But at this point, we haven't finalized those conversations. It's too early to give real guidance."

So it is important to us. So the impact was this, in the cases when things got a little dicey in Istanbul and in Turkey, we, obviously, had to make deployment itinerary changes. So again, generally speaking, we go where guests want to go and we go, obviously where, all the information we have says, it's okay to go, it's safe to go, because safety is number 1, obviously. And so we -- how it affects us is we make itinerary deployment changes, either because guests don't want to go or because we've gotten intelligence in the world community that it's wiser not to go, it affects us that way. Initially, we can see booking impacts right after the incident those tend to fade away. As you know, if you go back over years, this is not a year where this is the only time this has happened, and it happened to some extent almost in recent times, almost every year for the last several years, as does Zika or a MRSA or Asian flu, whatever it is these things, Ebola even. And so every year, there's geopolitical tensions, there's some kind of disease consternation, there's macroeconomic malaise, there's isolated or concentrated overcapacity in the cruise industry every year and in some markets around the world, those things happen. And it's part of our business. So we manage that, we anticipate it. We change deployments. We do good revenue management practices, manage around it and that's basically it. So to us, it's normal business. I wish it wasn't that way. Every now and then, hopefully, we'll get lucky and there won't be those incidents, because we think we would do better. Some of those itineraries we had to redirect are high-yielding short excursion, items which could have added additional revenue and earnings to the bottom line. We used to be in the Black Sea, we haven't been there quite a while, the Black Sea was one of the highest yielding, both from a ticket standpoint and onboard revenue standpoint, the itineraries we could've had. And so hopefully, sometimes, those things will work in our favor and will do even better. But right now, we expect that stuff to happen every year, and we have to manage it, and we have to deliver double-digit return to invested capital in those environments."

The brands are differentiated, that helps as well.

We charter with some Asia distributors. They've been sell through their network. But they will often, in turn, expand their network through subagents or subdistributors. And that's a negotiation between them and those subdistributors on pricing and so on. So how we control the pricing, which we don't really per se, control, we control what price we're getting. And then it's up to them to manage to see how much profit they're going to take and so on and so forth. But where all the control we have is, in the end, if they come back and say, hey, I didn't do as well as I thought, why don't you help me out, et cetera, that's a negotiation, that's a foot, it happens every year. But that's the level of control we have by our degree of willingness to negotiate. In some cases, they may have legitimate challenges. In some cases, they're just negotiating, they get a better deal. And you've got to do your best to sort all that out when you don't have total transparency to the ultimate price that the Chinese guest that was on the ship paid. We tried to get at that various ways, but, of course, others tried to make certain we can't get to that information. And that's on -- it's just a business, normal in business. You can think of other constructs in other places where a manufacturer sells to a distributor and may not know exactly what the distributor priced that and so on in any other market, in any other industry. So that's the nature of the business today. Overtime, that'll probably evolve to a different model, but that's what it is today."

But on the other hand, as I tried to point out earlier in the call in some of the questions, China is going to be limited in how many ships are going to be available for it to take, because people are building ships for other markets as well. I think what you have to think about is in that capacity growth. So we're always going to build new ships and so will others. And the reason is because the ships are more efficient, okay? And they give you the opportunity for enhanced revenue opportunity versus the existing ships. And so new ships are always going to be coming. The question is, how many ships leave? How many ships go to secondary markets and so on? And in the opening comments, I referenced the fact that the number of berths that are getting to retirement, the amount of capacity that's getting to retirement age is going to double in 2020 and it's going to double again in 2024. And so there will be a need for some of that capacity just to replace. And then the rest will get regulated by the marketplace. If there's scarce supply relative to demand, some of the less efficient ships will continue to sell. If there's not that relative scarcity, then some of those ships will exit. They'll either go into secondary markets or they'll leave the fleet and be scrapped. And so that's the real dynamic. We know what we're going to do. We are committed to measure capacity growth, and we know how to manage within our brands and across the various destinations. And so based on that, we have great confidence that we'll be able to manage to the sustained double-digit return on invested capital that we have promised within the next 2 years."

And, then that is for us, because we have 10 brands, 3% to 4% is not the same as 3% to 4% for a single brand type of cruise company. So we're spreading out these new builds across a number of brands, which gives that brand base an opportunity to absorb the capacity while they're creating the excess demand required to get the relative scarcity that we're chasing. So we are, overall, managing to measure capacity growth in total, but we're also doing it by brand. And that allows us to more effectively manage against a committed base of loyal cruisers to that brand and reduce the number of new to cruise at any point in time we have to generate for any given brand."

This quarter, we delivered the highest quarterly earnings in Carnival Corporation's history, with record net income of over $1.4 billion, $0.17 per share higher than the prior year, exceeding the high-end of our guidance and $0.07 above the midpoint. Despite the numerous headwinds, we are well on track to achieve our new guidance midpoint for full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.35, more than doubling our 2013 earnings of $1.55 per share. More importantly, our return on invested capital will also nearly double from 4.6% to 8.8% over that same time period.
These strong results could not happen without the hard work of our 120,000 passionate employees and without the strong support of our travel agent partners. Looking forward, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, with higher occupancy levels and higher prices, building momentum for continued earnings growth.
Our record results and favorable booking trends reflect our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth, together with the benefits of leveraging our scale. Our world-leading cruise lines continue to outperform, particularly in the Caribbean with continued strength in cost and pricing. Moreover, all of our major brands in North America and Europe experienced net revenue yield improvement despite the geopolitical environment in Europe.
Europe is our single largest deployment in the third quarter at 45% of our total capacity. Now there certainly has been a lot of noise around China. So I'm going to spend a little extra time on China in my comments now. First, China is a profitable market for us. Our ships operating in China optimize our overall brand performances. As we have previously indicated, China is a unit growth opportunity and we expect the yield to be down as the distribution system improves its ability to service the growing market there.
To demonstrate our commitment to grow the industry in China, we have factored into our results and into our guidance potential adjustments to our contracted prices in support of our distribution partners. The distributors are gaining experience translating pent-up consumer demand for cruising into sustainable market pricing and we certainly want to help them as they adapt to a rapidly growing market.
Again, even with those adjustments, we are raising our guidance for the year, affirming that we can manage ups and downs in this embryonic market. As we've previously pointed out, China represents just 5% of our capacity. And even with capacity growth well above our global average, it will remain a relatively small percentage of our total business. We continue to expect China to be a growth market, especially since the growth in the cruise industry is backed by the Chinese government as is evidenced by its inclusion in the current five-year plan. We will participate in this growth. We have 16 marketing officers in China in 2016, that's up from just 8 in 2015. We plan to open 4 more offices and to significantly expand our distribution network in 2017. Also in 2017, the brand-new Majestic Princess will enter as the first purpose-built ship for the Chinese market. Our capacity growth in China is expected to be 26% next year compared to 66% this year. Industrywide growth in China is expected to be 31% in 2017 compared to 100% this year. Those numbers sound big. But keep in mind that these large year-over-year percentage increase is over a very small base. So these growth rates are directionally equivalent to adding less than one 3,000 berth vessel to our China fleet and roughly two 4,000 berth vessels to the industry fleet overall in 2017 in China. 
Regardless of the rate of growth in China, we are firmly committed to overall measured capacity growth and fully capable of managing to sustainable double-digit return on invested capital.
Concerning newbuild, our most recent announcement included 3 new ship orders for 2021 and 2022, our first orders for those years. Before 2020, there's been no change in capacity from previous announcements. To optimize deployment however, we have reallocated the newbuilds along our brands. 
Over the next 4 years, 3 ships are planned to be purpose-built for Asia, our fastest-growing region, which is still in its earliest stage of development. And an average of roughly 3 ships per year will be spread across all our established markets. In fact, we have a very measured capacity environment during this time at the brand level, with 2 ships each for our North American brand Carnival Cruise Lines; our global brand, Princess; our luxury brand, Seabourn; and our German brand, AIDA. Effectively, one ship every other year for those brands.
In addition, over the same 4-year period, we will deliver just 1 ship each for Holland America Line, Costa in Southern Europe, P&O in the U.K. and P&O in Australia. And during this time, we will continue removing ships from our fleet. In fact, the number of berths that are eligible for removal will more than double by 2020 and more than double again by 2024.
Given this potential replacement cycle increase, we expect that a greater portion of our newbuild capacity will actually replace older, less efficient ships. As in the past, we will sell ships into secondary markets that do not compete directly with our brands. Within those secondary markets, there are older ships operating today that will soon reach retirement age and need to be replaced. We expect our net capacity growth through 2020 to be 3% to 4% compounded annually, consisting of double-digit growth in Asia and obviously, 3% or less growth in our established markets in North America, Europe and Australia.
Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We have stepped up our aggressive public relations effort with 3 innovative 30-minute programs airing weekly on ABC, NBC and CW, every Saturday morning, beginning in October. Each program showcases our brands, creating amazing vacation experiences that are designed to expand the audience for cruising by providing increased consideration and, at the same time, changing perceptions by dispelling the myth of cruising with compelling original content. We are excited by the prospects of connecting people, places and cultures across the world to create unforgettable experiences. Collectively, these programs provide 1.5 hours of content per week with over 150 scheduled airings and an annual expected viewership well in excess of 150 million people. And we have further innovations on horizon that will be unveiled in January of 2017 designed to further enhance our already great guest experiences.
Additionally, we launched the initial phase of our yield management system this quarter, helping us drive incremental revenue yields over time. We are currently market testing across 6 brands for a portion of the inventory to refine algorithms. The full rollout will be completed by late next year. Although we have already benefited from the sharing of best practices, we expect this new yield management technology to contribute in 2017 and even more so in 2018.
We also continue to make progress on our cost containment efforts and remain on track for more than $75 million of cost savings this year.
In summary, we are committed to measured capacity growth, currently planned at less than 3% in the established markets. Our brands are differentiating themselves in the market and delivering fantastic vacations for our guests as evidenced by our strong yield performance. We continue to build demand for cruise and continue to aggressively contain costs while still investing in enhanced guest experience and demand creation. We are improving our capability to extract yield in any environment through enhanced revenue management tools. Moreover, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased another $700 million of Carnival stock through our ongoing buyback program. In the last year, we have invested nearly $2.5 billion to buy back over 50 million shares of our company stock, demonstrating conviction in our ability to execute and achieve sustainable double-digit returns on invested capital.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."
258823,401982999,1050396,"Carnival Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 26, 2016",2016-09-26,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I'll provide an",1137,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I'll provide an update on our full year 2016 guidance. And then I'll finish up with some insights on 2017 booking trends and a few other items to note for 2017.
Our record adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.92. This was $0.07 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The improvement was driven by a number of factors: First, $0.02 from net revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings at our North American brands; second, $0.02 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters; third, $0.01 from the favorable net impact of fuel prices and currency versus our June guidance rates; and fourth, $0.01 from the accretive impact of the shares we repurchased since the last earnings call.
Now let's turn to the third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. The North American brands were up over 2% while our European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 2.7%.
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.1%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean, Alaska and Europe as well as our EAA brands deployments in Europe. These net ticket yield increases were partially offset by yield reductions in Australia, driven by large industry capacity increases in a highly penetrated market as well as yield reductions in Asia, where distributors are gaining experience growing the market. The majority of these yield reductions were anticipated in our initial 2016 yield guidance, provided during our December earnings call.
After 8 straight quarters of mid-to high single digit yield increases, our net onboard and other yields increased 1.3% over much tougher comparables from the third quarter 2015 as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends while our brands develop new initiatives for 2017 and beyond.
Net cruise costs per ALBD excluding fuel were up over 5%, driven by the timing of advertising expenses and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock as discussed on our last earnings call. This was about 1 point improvement versus what was planned in our June guidance. But again, this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.
In summary, our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by 3 things: One, operational improvements worth $0.05 despite a high net cruise cost seasonalization in the third quarter; two, the favorable net impact of fuel prices and currency were $0.02; and three, share buyback accretion worth $0.10.
As Arnold indicated, since the beginning of the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares for a total, since late last year, of over 50 million shares and nearly $2.5 billion of buybacks. At this point in time, we have approximately $500 million remaining on the $3 billion stock buyback authorization. Our September guidance EPS calculations assume shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculations assume 748 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while the fourth quarter calculations assume 730 million shares outstanding.
Next, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, we are well on track for achieving adjusted EPS of $3.35, which is the midpoint of our 2016 September guidance range of $3.33 to $3.37. The $0.05 improvement compared to the midpoint of our June guidance was essentially driven by 2 things: Improved net revenue yields were $0.03, $0.02 of which we achieved in the third quarter and an additional $0.01 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the fourth quarter; and $0.02 from the accretive impact of additional shares repurchased since our June conference call.
Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since June, bookings for the first half of 2017 have been at significantly higher prices with booking volumes lower than the prior year as there is less inventory remaining for sale. At this point in time, for the first half of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are ahead at considerably higher prices.
Drilling down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For all other deployments, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at higher prices.
Secondly, for our EAA brands.  For Europe deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. For the Caribbean deployment for our EAA brands, occupancy is in line with the prior year at slightly lower prices. However, prices on these bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend. For Asia, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. And for Australia, occupancy is also well ahead of the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on the bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, also clearly an improving trend.
And finally, a few other items to note for 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.5%. We are planning for an increase in dry-dock days from approximately 380 days in 2016 to 470 days in 2017. Remember, we did benefit in 2016 from lower dry-dock days compared to the 563 days we had in 2015.
As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry-dock days will vary each year. But probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. As we indicated last year, given the amount of CapEx reinvestment in the existing vessels and other areas of our business, to drive yield improvement, we do expect depreciation expense to increase percentagewise, more than capacity and currently expect depreciation expense to be around $1.9 billion for 2017.
Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the last year, we wanted to share with you the year-over-year impact that these items would have on our 2017 results if we use current fuel prices and FX rates. The 2017 year-over-year impact would be an unfavorable $0.28: $0.24 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivatives; and $0.04 for currency.
Although it's early, 2017 appears to be shaping up to be another good year. We are well positioned for continued earnings growth, given the current strength of our bookings and pricing trends for next year. 
And now, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

So that was the relative strength of the market in Germany for AIDA. So all of those things factor in as well as the dynamics in China itself. Similarly with the Carnival, as I mentioned on a previous call on that one, it was a combination of things for how well that the Carnival is doing in the Caribbean, the timing of the capacity coming in with the Vista coming in and other things and the fact that we have distributed ports, home ports here in the U.S. and getting the right ship in the right homeport.

So that means the government is committed to developing the cruise industry. The reason for that is pretty self-evident. We'll employ that overall with port development and infrastructure and supply chain and training as well as shipbuilding that will employ millions and millions and millions of Chinese. And so the government is very interested and they see cruise as an economic engine going forward. So you've got the support of the central government and the various provincial municipal governance so that's very important. And the second thing is just the growth market. The third thing is that growth is constrained. I know the percentages sound large and everything. But as I have tried to point out in the opening comments, we're talking onesie, twosies and ships. And the reason the growth is constrained is because we have large addressable markets that are underpenetrated everywhere in the world. And so we have lots of places to put ships these days. And so we are not just going to take all the ships in the existing markets and move on the unity of the China. And then there is constraint on the number of ships that can be built in China -- up for China -- the China market in the near term here. So all of those things put additional constraints. Beyond that, clearly, as we anticipated, as you guys have identified through your assessments and stuff, that yields decline. We see China as a unit volume -- a unit growth story, as ultimately accretive to earnings, which it has been for us and overall helping us optimize yields across the global fleet and it's working really well. Having said that, there is a gap with distribution. It's an embryonic market. Distributors are finding their way for the first time in cruise. It is a charter market, a B2B market. So that introduces possibilities of discontinuities that you might not see if you had a direct-to-consumer kind of a market. So all of those things are things we already knew going over. Those were firm. But the other thing that wasn't firm was the enthusiasm for the government, for the cruise industry, the fact that the guest satisfaction levels are high, that our ships are definitely occupied, comparable to prior years despite the significant percentage increases in capacity and we see it as a future market. Now having said all of that, with all the increases we're talking about, it's 5% of our capacity next year with the additional increases, including the Majestic Princess, will be the first purpose-built ship for China entering late next year. Even with that, it's going to be 6% of our capacity. So we can only grow so fast. And because of the relatively small percentage of our total fleet it is, it's very manageable for us with any fits and styles or bumps on the road we might encounter.

Number 2, in the case of the Carnival brand, in particular, again, we have a very large base of previous cruisegoers that are loyal to the brand. And that, obviously, helps us because those people have experienced the brand and love it and want to do it again and again. And then thirdly, we're better in our revenue management skills. And so we have shared best practices across the brands and revenue management. And our people are getting increasingly sophisticated and doing very, very well. Also, we've anticipated a bit of an election slowdown, historically. There's always been a little falloff in booking volumes around election time. And so there could be some of that. But in our case, again, right now, we're doing so well, and we are so far ahead and the pricing is strong, we've got great close-in pricing right now. And so it's been very good.

And that just won't happen. And so having said that, the other comment is if you take the impact this quarter, given even the additional consideration we've reflected in the guidance going forward, the impact for the full year on yields losses across our fleet is a rounding error. So we believe that we can effect a sustainable business in China over time. We're going to make practical economic decisions, our assets are mobile. And because it's such a small percentage, even in the future when we start looking at adding additional ships above our overall capacity, we can move a few ships around and manage things effectively through smart deployment. Having said that, for next year, right now, we see good relationships with our distributor partners and an ability to extract value. Hopefully, it will be proportionate to the capacity increase or greater. But at this point, we haven't finalized those conversations. It's too early to give real guidance."

So it is important to us. So the impact was this, in the cases when things got a little dicey in Istanbul and in Turkey, we, obviously, had to make deployment itinerary changes. So again, generally speaking, we go where guests want to go and we go, obviously where, all the information we have says, it's okay to go, it's safe to go, because safety is number 1, obviously. And so we -- how it affects us is we make itinerary deployment changes, either because guests don't want to go or because we've gotten intelligence in the world community that it's wiser not to go, it affects us that way. Initially, we can see booking impacts right after the incident. Those tend to fade away. As you know, if you go back over years, this is not a year where this is the only time this has happened, and it happens to some extent almost -- in recent times -- almost every year for the last several years, as does a Zika or a MERS or Asian flu, whatever it is these things, Ebola even. And so every year, there's geopolitical tensions, there's some kind of disease consternation, there's macroeconomic malaise, there's isolated or concentrated overcapacity in the cruise industry every year and in some markets around the world, those things happen. And it's part of our business. So we manage that, we anticipate it. We change deployments. We do good revenue management practices, manage around it and that's basically it. So to us, it's normal business. I wish it wasn't that way. Every now and then, hopefully, we'll get lucky and there won't be those incidents, because we think we would do better. Some of those itineraries we had to redirect are high-yielding, short excursion items which could have added additional revenue and earnings to the bottom line. We used to be in the Black Sea, we haven't been there quite a while. The Black Sea was one of the highest yielding, both from a ticket standpoint and onboard revenue standpoint, the itineraries we could've had. And so hopefully, sometimes, those things will work in our favor and we'll do even better. But right now, we expect that stuff to happen every year, and we have to manage it, and we have to deliver double-digit return invested capital in those environments."

Beyond that, it's again, as I mentioned, it's a combination of creating demand, of clever deployment and of exceeding guest expectations once onboard so that when they leave, they help us create demand themselves, only for them to come back for others that they share with. The brands are differentiated, that helps as well.

But that's the level of control we have by our degree of willingness to negotiate. In some cases, they may have legitimate challenges. In some cases, they're just negotiating, they get a better deal. And you've got to do your best to sort all that out when you don't have total transparency to the ultimate price that the Chinese guest that was on the ship paid. We tried to get at that various ways, but, of course, others tried to make certain we can't get to that information. And that's on -- it's just a business, normal in business. You can think of other constructs in other places where a manufacturer sells to a distributor and may not know exactly what the distributor priced that and so on in any other market, in any other industry. So that's the nature of the business today. Over time, that'll probably evolve to a different model, but that's what it is today."

But on the other hand, as I tried to point out earlier in the call in some of the questions, China is going to be limited in how many ships are going to be available for it to take, because people are building ships for other markets as well. I think what you have to think about is in that capacity growth. So we're always going to build new ships and so will others. And the reason is because the ships are more efficient, okay? And they give you the opportunity for enhanced revenue opportunity versus the existing ships. And so new ships are always going to be coming. The question is, how many ships leave? How many ships go to secondary markets and so on? And in the opening comments, I referenced the fact that the number of berths that are getting to retirement, the amount of capacity that's getting to retirement age is going to double in 2020 and it's going to double again in 2024. And so there will be a need for some of that capacity just to replace. And then the rest will get regulated by the marketplace. If there's scarce supply relative to demand, some of the less efficient ships will continue to sell. If there's not that relative scarcity, then some of those ships will exit. They'll either go into secondary markets or they'll leave the fleet and be scrapped. And so that's the real dynamic. We know what we're going to do. We are committed to measure capacity growth, and we know how to manage within our brands and across the various destinations. And so based on that, we have great confidence that we'll be able to manage to the sustained double-digit return on invested capital that we have promised within the next 2 years."

So we are, overall, managing to measure capacity growth in total, but we're also doing it by brand.

I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by D",1486,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.
Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
Despite a series of geopolitical events that unfolded as the year progressed, including Turkey, Paris and Brussels; despite heightened concerns around Zika; around Brexit and around China; despite fuel and currency both working against us, resulting in an $0.18 drag from our initial 2016 guidance, we have exceeded the high end of our quarterly guidance and we are raising our expectations for the year.
This quarter, we delivered the highest quarterly earnings in Carnival Corporation's history, with record net income of over $1.4 billion, $0.17 per share higher than the prior year, exceeding the high-end of our guidance and $0.07 above the midpoint. Despite the numerous headwinds, we are well on track to achieve our new guidance midpoint for full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.35, more than doubling our 2013 earnings of $1.55 per share. More importantly, our return on invested capital will also nearly double from 4.6% to 8.8% over that same time period.
These strong results could not happen without the hard work of our 120,000 passionate employees and without the strong support of our travel agent partners. Looking forward, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, with higher occupancy levels and higher prices, building momentum for continued earnings growth.
Our record results and favorable booking trends reflect our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth, together with the benefits of leveraging our scale. Our world-leading cruise lines continue to outperform, particularly in the Caribbean with continued strength in cost and pricing. Moreover, all of our major brands in North America and Europe experienced net revenue yield improvement despite the geopolitical environment in Europe.
Europe is our single largest deployment in the third quarter at 45% of our total capacity. Now there certainly has been a lot of noise around China. So I'm going to spend a little extra time on China in my comments now. First, China is a profitable market for us. Our ships operating in China optimize our overall brand performances. As we have previously indicated, China is a unit growth opportunity and we expect the yield to be down as the distribution system improves its ability to service the growing market there.
To demonstrate our commitment to grow the industry in China, we have factored into our results and into our guidance potential adjustments to our contracted prices in support of our distribution partners. The distributors are gaining experience translating pent-up consumer demand for cruising into sustainable market pricing and we certainly want to help them as they adapt to a rapidly growing market.
Again, even with those adjustments, we are raising our guidance for the year, affirming that we can manage ups and downs in this embryonic market. As we've previously pointed out, China represents just 5% of our capacity. And even with capacity growth well above our global average, it will remain a relatively small percentage of our total business. We continue to expect China to be a growth market, especially since the growth in the cruise industry is backed by the Chinese government as is evidenced by its inclusion in the current five-year plan. We will participate in this growth. We have 16 marketing officers in China in 2016, that's up from just 8 in 2015. We plan to open 4 more offices and to significantly expand our distribution network in 2017. Also in 2017, the brand-new Majestic Princess will enter as the first purpose-built ship for the Chinese market. Our capacity growth in China is expected to be 26% next year compared to 66% this year. Industrywide growth in China is expected to be 31% in 2017 compared to 100% this year. Those numbers sound big. But keep in mind that these large year-over-year percentage increase is over a very small base. So these growth rates are directionally equivalent to adding less than one 3,000 berth vessel to our China fleet and roughly two 4,000 berth vessels to the industry fleet overall in 2017 in China. 
Regardless of the rate of growth in China, we are firmly committed to overall measured capacity growth and fully capable of managing to sustainable double-digit return on invested capital.
Concerning newbuild, our most recent announcement included 3 new ship orders for 2021 and 2022, our first orders for those years. Before 2020, there's been no change in capacity from previous announcements. To optimize deployment however, we have reallocated the newbuilds along our brands. 
Over the next 4 years, 3 ships are planned to be purpose-built for Asia, our fastest-growing region, which is still in its earliest stage of development. And an average of roughly 3 ships per year will be spread across all our established markets. In fact, we have a very measured capacity environment during this time at the brand level, with 2 ships each for our North American brand Carnival Cruise Lines; our global brand, Princess; our luxury brand, Seabourn; and our German brand, AIDA. Effectively, one ship every other year for those brands.
In addition, over the same 4-year period, we will deliver just 1 ship each for Holland America Line, Costa in Southern Europe, P&O in the U.K. and P&O in Australia. And during this time, we will continue removing ships from our fleet. In fact, the number of berths that are eligible for removal will more than double by 2020 and more than double again by 2024.
Given this potential replacement cycle increase, we expect that a greater portion of our newbuild capacity will actually replace older, less efficient ships. As in the past, we will sell ships into secondary markets that do not compete directly with our brands. Within those secondary markets, there are older ships operating today that will soon reach retirement age and need to be replaced. We expect our net capacity growth through 2020 to be 3% to 4% compounded annually, consisting of double-digit growth in Asia and obviously, 3% or less growth in our established markets in North America, Europe and Australia.
Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We have stepped up our aggressive public relations effort with 3 innovative 30-minute programs airing weekly on ABC, NBC and CW, every Saturday morning, beginning in October. Each program showcases our brands, creating amazing vacation experiences that are designed to expand the audience for cruising by providing increased consideration and, at the same time, changing perceptions by dispelling the myth of cruising with compelling original content. We are excited by the prospects of connecting people, places and cultures across the world to create unforgettable experiences. Collectively, these programs provide 1.5 hours of content per week with over 150 scheduled airings and an annual expected viewership well in excess of 150 million people. And we have further innovations on horizon that will be unveiled in January of 2017 designed to further enhance our already great guest experiences.
Additionally, we launched the initial phase of our yield management system this quarter, helping us drive incremental revenue yields over time. We are currently market testing across 6 brands for a portion of the inventory to refine algorithms. The full rollout will be completed by late next year. Although we have already benefited from the sharing of best practices, we expect this new yield management technology to contribute in 2017 and even more so in 2018.
We also continue to make progress on our cost containment efforts and remain on track for more than $75 million of cost savings this year.
In summary, we are committed to measured capacity growth, currently planned at less than 3% in the established markets. Our brands are differentiating themselves in the market and delivering fantastic vacations for our guests as evidenced by our strong yield performance. We continue to build demand for cruise and continue to aggressively contain costs while still investing in enhanced guest experience and demand creation. We are improving our capability to extract yield in any environment through enhanced revenue management tools. Moreover, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased another $700 million of Carnival stock through our ongoing buyback program. In the last year, we have invested nearly $2.5 billion to buy back over 50 million shares of our company stock, demonstrating conviction in our ability to execute and achieve sustainable double-digit returns on invested capital.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."

Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I'll provide an",1137,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I'll provide an update on our full year 2016 guidance. And then I'll finish up with some insights on 2017 booking trends and a few other items to note for 2017.
Our record adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.92. This was $0.07 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The improvement was driven by a number of factors: First, $0.02 from net revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings at our North American brands; second, $0.02 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters; third, $0.01 from the favorable net impact of fuel prices and currency versus our June guidance rates; and fourth, $0.01 from the accretive impact of the shares we repurchased since the last earnings call.
Now let's turn to the third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. The North American brands were up over 2% while our European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 2.7%.
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.1%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean, Alaska and Europe as well as our EAA brands deployments in Europe. These net ticket yield increases were partially offset by yield reductions in Australia, driven by large industry capacity increases in a highly penetrated market as well as yield reductions in Asia, where distributors are gaining experience growing the market. The majority of these yield reductions were anticipated in our initial 2016 yield guidance, provided during our December earnings call.
After 8 straight quarters of mid-to high single digit yield increases, our net onboard and other yields increased 1.3% over much tougher comparables from the third quarter 2015 as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends while our brands develop new initiatives for 2017 and beyond.
Net cruise costs per ALBD excluding fuel were up over 5%, driven by the timing of advertising expenses and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock as discussed on our last earnings call. This was about 1 point improvement versus what was planned in our June guidance. But again, this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.
In summary, our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by 3 things: One, operational improvements worth $0.05 despite a high net cruise cost seasonalization in the third quarter; two, the favorable net impact of fuel prices and currency were $0.02; and three, share buyback accretion worth $0.10.
As Arnold indicated, since the beginning of the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares for a total, since late last year, of over 50 million shares and nearly $2.5 billion of buybacks. At this point in time, we have approximately $500 million remaining on the $3 billion stock buyback authorization. Our September guidance EPS calculations assume shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculations assume 748 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while the fourth quarter calculations assume 730 million shares outstanding.
Next, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, we are well on track for achieving adjusted EPS of $3.35, which is the midpoint of our 2016 September guidance range of $3.33 to $3.37. The $0.05 improvement compared to the midpoint of our June guidance was essentially driven by 2 things: Improved net revenue yields were $0.03, $0.02 of which we achieved in the third quarter and an additional $0.01 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the fourth quarter; and $0.02 from the accretive impact of additional shares repurchased since our June conference call.
Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since June, bookings for the first half of 2017 have been at significantly higher prices with booking volumes lower than the prior year as there is less inventory remaining for sale. At this point in time, for the first half of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are ahead at considerably higher prices.
Drilling down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For all other deployments, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at higher prices.
Secondly, for our EAA brands.  For Europe deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. For the Caribbean deployment for our EAA brands, occupancy is in line with the prior year at slightly lower prices. However, prices on these bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend. For Asia, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. And for Australia, occupancy is also well ahead of the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on the bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, also clearly an improving trend.
And finally, a few other items to note for 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.5%. We are planning for an increase in dry-dock days from approximately 380 days in 2016 to 470 days in 2017. Remember, we did benefit in 2016 from lower dry-dock days compared to the 563 days we had in 2015.
As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry-dock days will vary each year. But probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. As we indicated last year, given the amount of CapEx reinvestment in the existing vessels and other areas of our business, to drive yield improvement, we do expect depreciation expense to increase percentagewise, more than capacity and currently expect depreciation expense to be around $1.9 billion for 2017.
Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the last year, we wanted to share with you the year-over-year impact that these items would have on our 2017 results if we use current fuel prices and FX rates. The 2017 year-over-year impact would be an unfavorable $0.28: $0.24 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivatives; and $0.04 for currency.
Although it's early, 2017 appears to be shaping up to be another good year. We are well positioned for continued earnings growth, given the current strength of our bookings and pricing trends for next year. 
And now, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

So a lot of things go into consideration. Obviously, the market you are considering deploying it in. But also, in the case of AIDA, the AIDAperla, our new ship, we've gotten confirmation of when she's going to come in. So we now know the capacity situation we'll have. So that was the relative strength of the market in Germany for AIDA. So all of those things factor in as well as the dynamics in China itself. Similarly with the Carnival, as I mentioned on a previous call on that one, it was a combination of things for how well that the Carnival is doing in the Caribbean, the timing of the capacity coming in with the Vista coming in and other things and the fact that we have distributed ports, home ports here in the U.S. and getting the right ship in the right homeport. All of those things factor in ultimately for an optimized deployment decision. And that's the beauty of our inventory is that it's mobile. We can adjust and adapt and we're constantly seeking to optimize."

So that means the government is committed to developing the cruise industry. The reason for that is pretty self-evident. We'll employ that overall with port development and infrastructure and supply chain and training as well as shipbuilding that will employ millions and millions and millions of Chinese. And so the government is very interested and they see cruise as an economic engine going forward. So you've got the support of the central government and the various provincial municipal governance so that's very important. And the second thing is just the growth market. The third thing is that growth is constrained. I know the percentages sound large and everything. But as I have tried to point out in the opening comments, we're talking onesie, twosies and ships. And the reason the growth is constrained is because we have large addressable markets that are underpenetrated everywhere in the world. And so we have lots of places to put ships these days. And so we are not just going to take all the ships in the existing markets and move on the unity of the China. And then there is constraint on the number of ships that can be built in China -- up for China -- the China market in the near term here. So all of those things put additional constraints. Beyond that, clearly, as we anticipated, as you guys have identified through your assessments and stuff, that yields decline. We see China as a unit volume -- a unit growth story, as ultimately accretive to earnings, which it has been for us and overall helping us optimize yields across the global fleet and it's working really well. Having said that, there is a gap with distribution. It's an embryonic market. Distributors are finding their way for the first time in cruise. It is a charter market, a B2B market. So that introduces possibilities of discontinuities that you might not see if you had a direct-to-consumer kind of a market. So all of those things are things we already knew going over. Those were firm. But the other thing that wasn't firm was the enthusiasm for the government, for the cruise industry, the fact that the guest satisfaction levels are high, that our ships are definitely occupied, comparable to prior years despite the significant percentage increases in capacity and we see it as a future market. Now having said all of that, with all the increases we're talking about, it's 5% of our capacity next year with the additional increases, including the Majestic Princess, will be the first purpose-built ship for China entering late next year. Even with that, it's going to be 6% of our capacity. So we can only grow so fast. And because of the relatively small percentage of our total fleet it is, it's very manageable for us with any fits and styles or bumps on the road we might encounter. But we're committed to work with distributor partners, our distributor partners in building a sustainable business in China."

And the guests are having just tremendous experiences, and we are exceeding their expectations across the brands as they go into the Caribbean, and especially with the Carnival brand, so that's number 1. Number 2, in the case of the Carnival brand, in particular, again, we have a very large base of previous cruisegoers that are loyal to the brand. And that, obviously, helps us because those people have experienced the brand and love it and want to do it again and again. And then thirdly, we're better in our revenue management skills. And so we have shared best practices across the brands and revenue management. And our people are getting increasingly sophisticated and doing very, very well. Also, we've anticipated a bit of an election slowdown, historically. There's always been a little falloff in booking volumes around election time. And so there could be some of that. But in our case, again, right now, we're doing so well, and we are so far ahead and the pricing is strong, we've got great close-in pricing right now. And so it's been very good.

Sustainable for our distributor partners, sustainable in terms of the government's desire to have the cruise industry be established there and, obviously, sustainable for us from a profit standpoint.

And that just won't happen. And so having said that, the other comment is if you take the impact this quarter, given even the additional consideration we've reflected in the guidance going forward, the impact for the full year on yields losses across our fleet is a rounding error. So we believe that we can effect a sustainable business in China over time. We're going to make practical economic decisions, our assets are mobile. And because it's such a small percentage, even in the future when we start looking at adding additional ships above our overall capacity, we can move a few ships around and manage things effectively through smart deployment. Having said that, for next year, right now, we see good relationships with our distributor partners and an ability to extract value. Hopefully, it will be proportionate to the capacity increase or greater. But at this point, we haven't finalized those conversations. It's too early to give real guidance."

So it is important to us. So the impact was this, in the cases when things got a little dicey in Istanbul and in Turkey, we, obviously, had to make deployment itinerary changes. So again, generally speaking, we go where guests want to go and we go, obviously where, all the information we have says, it's okay to go, it's safe to go, because safety is number 1, obviously. And so we -- how it affects us is we make itinerary deployment changes, either because guests don't want to go or because we've gotten intelligence in the world community that it's wiser not to go, it affects us that way. Initially, we can see booking impacts right after the incident. Those tend to fade away. As you know, if you go back over years, this is not a year where this is the only time this has happened, and it happens to some extent almost -- in recent times -- almost every year for the last several years, as does a Zika or a MERS or Asian flu, whatever it is these things, Ebola even. And so every year, there's geopolitical tensions, there's some kind of disease consternation, there's macroeconomic malaise, there's isolated or concentrated overcapacity in the cruise industry every year and in some markets around the world, those things happen. And it's part of our business. So we manage that, we anticipate it. We change deployments. We do good revenue management practices, manage around it and that's basically it. So to us, it's normal business. I wish it wasn't that way. Every now and then, hopefully, we'll get lucky and there won't be those incidents, because we think we would do better. Some of those itineraries we had to redirect are high-yielding, short excursion items which could have added additional revenue and earnings to the bottom line. We used to be in the Black Sea, we haven't been there quite a while. The Black Sea was one of the highest yielding, both from a ticket standpoint and onboard revenue standpoint, the itineraries we could've had. And so hopefully, sometimes, those things will work in our favor and we'll do even better. But right now, we expect that stuff to happen every year, and we have to manage it, and we have to deliver double-digit return invested capital in those environments."

What you are seeing, though, is the fact, just the fact by working on it, we're sharing best practices across our 10 world-leading cruise line brands and that sharing and then working together on the tool and so on, clearly has been advantageous and has boosted our yields. Beyond that, it's again, as I mentioned, it's a combination of creating demand, of clever deployment and of exceeding guest expectations once onboard so that when they leave, they help us create demand themselves, only for them to come back for others that they share with. The brands are differentiated, that helps as well. And we've done some smart things in terms of -- within the brands, about various home porting decisions and distributing the home ports to access various destination markets. So it's a combination of things. We have good momentum that has to be maintained.

We tried to get at that various ways, but, of course, others tried to make certain we can't get to that information. And that's on -- it's just a business, normal in business. You can think of other constructs in other places where a manufacturer sells to a distributor and may not know exactly what the distributor priced that and so on in any other market, in any other industry.

But on the other hand, as I tried to point out earlier in the call in some of the questions, China is going to be limited in how many ships are going to be available for it to take, because people are building ships for other markets as well. I think what you have to think about is in that capacity growth. So we're always going to build new ships and so will others. And the reason is because the ships are more efficient, okay? And they give you the opportunity for enhanced revenue opportunity versus the existing ships. And so new ships are always going to be coming. The question is, how many ships leave? How many ships go to secondary markets and so on? And in the opening comments, I referenced the fact that the number of berths that are getting to retirement, the amount of capacity that's getting to retirement age is going to double in 2020 and it's going to double again in 2024. And so there will be a need for some of that capacity just to replace. And then the rest will get regulated by the marketplace. If there's scarce supply relative to demand, some of the less efficient ships will continue to sell. If there's not that relative scarcity, then some of those ships will exit. They'll either go into secondary markets or they'll leave the fleet and be scrapped. And so that's the real dynamic. We know what we're going to do. We are committed to measure capacity growth, and we know how to manage within our brands and across the various destinations. And so based on that, we have great confidence that we'll be able to manage to the sustained double-digit return on invested capital that we have promised within the next 2 years."

And I'd say at this point in time, while that's a possibility, we might know something before this year is out about additional brands going next year into Cuba. Again, we are hopeful. I wouldn't say we expect it. But we're working on it and, hopefully, as you know, to date, we are the only ones that have received approval by Cuba to sail to and from Cuba from the U.S. So we're the only one so far. I'm sure that will change. Exactly when it will change and how many other brands, we can get in there beyond our Fathom brand that we have now remains to be seen, but we're in constant conversation with the various authorities in Cuba. It's been an exciting year in that regard for us. It has helped us across our fleet in a number of ways with the positive media and so on and so forth. But beyond all of that, it hasn't been fine, with our single ship of 700 guests, obviously, financially, it's not hugely material. But it has been important in establishing the relationships and the dialogue and the partnerships to prepare the foundation for what will be a destination that will help refresh the Caribbean and, ultimately, contribute to that relative scarcity that I like to talk about, excess demand relative to supply, and be a source of strength for yields and returns in the years to come."

I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation and plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning and a heartfelt happy holidays to [ph] everyone.Toda",1908,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation and plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning and a heartfelt happy holidays to [ph] everyone.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; and by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking, therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
We finish the year with another record quarter of adjusted earnings, which were $0.17 per share or 34% higher than the prior year, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 per share and leading to the highest full-year earnings in our company's history. 
We achieved full year 2016 adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion, or $3.45 per share. That's $500 million or 28% per share higher than last year, and more than double 2013 earnings of $1.55.  More importantly, we achieved return on invested capital of 9% and doubled our 2013 return on invested capital of 4.5%. We are pleased to have delivered for our shareholders doubled earnings and doubled return-on-invested capital in just 3 short years.
Strong operational improvement contributed $0.55 per share to the bottom line year-over-year, which when combined with $0.14 of accretion from our share repurchase program, enabled us to exceed the high end of our original December guidance range of $3.10 to $3.40 per share. And that's despite an $0.18 drag from fuel and currency both [ph] adjustments. 
These strong results are a credit to the commitment and to the passion of our 120,000 team members, which when coupled with the support from our value [ph] travel agent partners, enable us to overcome the significant obstacles encountered this past year, including the rare occurrence of a simultaneous negative from fuel and currency, a series of global geopolitical events in Turkey, Paris and Brussels, as well as concerns around Zika and Brexit.  It is through their collective efforts that we delivered record earnings in 2016 and are gaining momentum as we embark on 2017 with booking volumes and pricing both well ahead of the prior year. 
It was reinforcing to see constant currency revenue yield growth this year of roughly 4% inclusive of the previously disclosed 1% accounting change on top of the over 4% improvement achieved last year. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements again in our core Caribbean deployment. 
We drove revenue yield growth by creating relative scarcity through our brand team [ph] success and increasing demand in excess of our measured capacity growth via our ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with our continuing public relations efforts.  In fact, we recently created 3 original TV programs that are airing on major U.S. networks having already reached more than 40 million viewers through [ph] large family-oriented programming block. They are designed to entertain, to educate and to engage viewers by showcasing exciting adventures, exotic cultures, beautiful ships and popular global destinations.  With almost 80 original episodes, the new experience will series [ph] compelling and authentic storytelling to share the powerful way travel by sea connects people, places and cultures around the world, while prominently featuring each of our brands. 
Not only are we experiencing very high approval [ph] ratings at #1 or #2 in our respective time slot, but we're also achieving even more favorable consumer perception of our brands. 
This successful programming comes on a yield [ph] of many impactful shows earlier this year.  In the U.K., a reality-based TV series onboard Regal Princess [ph] the cruise, and P&O cruises, Battlechefs onboard [ph] Britannia. In Italy, Rob Lowe Scheff, onboard our Costa Ship [ph] and our Costa Fortuna, a major motion picture. [ph], Holidays in the Caribbean. [ph] In North America, Carnival Cruise Lines was featured on Wheel of Fortune for a full week and featured on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. We have many more opportunities already in the pipeline for next year to keep cruising in the forefront of vacationers' mind, including the new Celebrity Apprentice, [ph] airing on NBC in February during wave [ph] season, our peak booking period. 
All of these efforts promote consideration around the globe by prominently featuring amazing cruise experiences in our world leading cruise lines. In fact, our brands accounted for over 70% of the industry's positive media coverage. This includes our historic voyage to Cuba, when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 40 years to bring U.S. cruise guests directly from the U.S. to Cuba, with over 55 billion very positive media impressions [ph] and paving the way for others in our industry to follow. 
At this time, we are proud to have more sailing scheduled to Cuba than any other major U.S. operator. Moreover, our phenomenal guest experience just gets better and better each year as we continue to deliver on consumer expectations, achieving further improvement on our Net Promoter Scores. 
We also introduced 3 new flagships in 2016, including Carnival Vista, which celebrated its U.S. arrival in November with an onboard concert by country music superstar, Carrie Underwood, supporting Operation Homefront, and with Miss USA herself military as the godmother, [ph] and including 700 military families invited as guests of honor.  Carnival Vista was designed specifically for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guests with an onboard brewery [ph] experience, entertaining IMAX theater and exhilarating SkyRide experience. 
Holland America's  [ph] Rotterdam by her Majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, [ph] delivers a new premium experience, where our guests can blend their own wine or dance the night away in our [ph], showcasing Lincoln Center Stage, Billboard Onboard and B.B. King's Blues Club. 
AIDAprima, the first of a next-generation platform, resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests, combining leading-edge of our [ph] attributes [ph] with exceptional guest experiences, including racing water slides, the lazy river, climbing wall, [ph] and expansive German spa and an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling [ph] and even a traditional Christmas market. 
Newbuilds will provide additional demand creation opportunities in 2017 as well, beginning with the recent delivery of encore [ph] for our ultra-luxury [ph] brand, Seabourn, designed by Adam Honey [ph] with the feel of a luxury yacht, Seabourn Encore sets a new standard in ultra-luxury cruising, featuring 300 elegant suites, the grille, [ph] a new restaurant by 3 star Michelin [ph] chef, Thomas Keller, and the debut of a new mindful living [ph] program with Dr. Andrew Weil. [ph] Later next year, we will welcome AIDAperla in Germany and, of course, Majestic Princess, the first ship purpose-built for Chinese cruisers, demonstrating our commitment to grow the cruise industry in China which remains an embryonic market with vast untapped potential.  We expect to continue to profitably grow our presence in China and throughout Asia for many years to come. 
When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to simulate demand creation though, [ph] we continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 and the continued roll out of Carnival Cruise Lines' Fun Ship 2.0 to now over 60% of the Carnival Cruise Line fleet. 
On January 5, we will kick off the year by unveiling our latest guest experience innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show [ph] in Las Vegas. We are privileged to be the first travel company ever to be invited to provide the opening keynote address at CES where [ph] we will showcase, using our leading-edge technology, offering a new option for our guests for a true breakthrough in unobtrusive, high-touch and personalized travel at scale. [ph] 
Furthermore, we launched our new [indiscernible] arc revenue management system this past year, positioning us well to drive incremental revenue and yield growth over time. The rollout of the system across 6 of our brands is expected to be completed by early 2018. We've already benefited from the sharing of best practices, and we expect this new yield management too to begin to facilitate yield uplift in 2017 and even more so in 2018.
We continue to accelerate progress on our cost containment efforts, delivering $95 million of cost savings in 2016. That's $20 million more than the $75 million included in our original 2016 guidance and bringing the cumulative savings to date to over $190 million. Work continues on our cost-containment efforts that we believe present a multiyear opportunity to further leverage our scale, including another over $75 million of savings planned in 2017.
In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress on our 2020 sustainability goals, focusing on our environmental, safety, labor and social performance. Having already reduced our unit fuel consumption by 28% since initiating the effort, we remain committed to ongoing reduction [ph] initiatives. And just this year, AIDAprima became the first cruise ship in the world be powered by environmentally friendly, liquefied natural gas. We are committed to continuous improvement in health, environmental, safety and security, which is not only so critical to our to premium [ph] to operate, but also to our future success. 
This year, we introduced industry-leading shoreside technology to monitor real-time navigational performance and energy use across our fleet, and we opened our significantly expanded [ph] Maritime Center in The Netherlands, delivering state-of-the-art Maritime training through cutting-edge bridge and engine room simulators and curriculum. 
In 2016, we delivered over $5 billion of cash from operations and returned more than half to shareholders, having distributed $1 billion through our annual dividend and investing over $2 billion in our ongoing share repurchase program. 
As a testament to the strength of our operating performance, we were able to accomplish this while also gaining back our A- and A3 credit ratings from S&P and Moody's. And we plan to continue to return excess cash and more to shareholders in 2017 with our credit metrics at the better end of our targeted range.
Now looking forward. There are large addressable markets with low penetration all over the world, including North America. And new markets in Asia where economic growth has raised discretionary income levels, fueling increased demand for vacations.  We are focused on growing our top line and have numerous innovations underway to foster cruise demand in the years ahead. Our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields. In 2017, we are projecting revenue yields up another 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons with our prior year success, based on our proven demand creation and yield management efforts. 
At the same time, we will continue to contain cost. In 2017, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver an improvement in earnings of $0.43 per share, however, at current rates, that is offset by $0.43 per share impact from fuel [ph] incursion. 
We remain committed to achieving increased consideration for cruise vacations and continued investment in the guest experience to create additional consumer demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We remain committed to responsibly containing cost. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders. And despite the unusual occurrence of both fuel and currency working against us at the same time, we remain committed to achieving sustained double-digit return on invested capital within 2 years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."
258823,412859372,1103845,"Carnival Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results, then I'll provide s",920,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results, then I'll provide some insights on current booking trends and finish up with some color on our 2017 December guidance. 
Our adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.67. This was $0.10 above the midpoint of our September guidance. The improvement was almost all operational, driven by a number of factors. $0.04 came from net ticket yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic. While the remaining $0.06 was an accumulation of a variety of items, such as improved fuel consumption and lower depreciation expense. 
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased over 4%. The North American brands were up almost 3%, while the European, Australia and Asian brands also known as our EAA brands were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 4.1%. 
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yield. Net ticket yields were up 5.2%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in Caribbean and Alaska as well as our EAA brands deployment in Europe. Then onboard and other yields increased 1.3%, in line with our guidance as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends, while our brands develop new initiatives for 2017 and beyond. 
Net cruise costs per ALBD, excluding fuel, were up 1%, which was in line with our September guidance. In summary, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by higher net revenue yields worth $0.17 and the accretive impact of the stock repurchase program worth $0.04, both of which were partially offset by the unfavorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04. 
Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since September, both booking volumes and prices for the first 3 quarters of 2017 have been running well ahead of the prior year. At this point in time, for the first 3 quarters of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are well ahead at considerably higher prices. 
Now let's drill down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brand. Caribbean occupancy is ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, both occupancy and prices are well ahead in the prior year. If you want to go to Alaska next summer, I suggest you book early as the remaining inventory is going fast. 
For the seasonal European program, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands. For European deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For the Caribbean deployments for our EAA brands, occupancy is lower than the prior year at prices that are in line, however, prices on bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend.
Finally, I want to provide you with some color on 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.6%. As Arnold indicated, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields. 
For 2017, we are projecting net revenue yields up approximately 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons from our prior year's success. For the full year, we're expecting to see yield improvement in almost itineraries. 
Now turning to cost. Net cruise costs without fuel for ALBD are expected to be up approximately 1% for 2017. Broadly speaking, there are 3 major drivers of the cost change. First, our forecast is for 1.5 points of inflation across all of our categories globally. Second, we are planning for an increase in drydock days from 366 days in 2016 to nearly 450 in 2017, impacting our cost metrics by half a point. 
As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the drydock days will vary each year, but probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. Partially offsetting these 2 items, we are forecasting about 1 point of crossing benefits as we further leverage our scale.
Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the past year, the 2017 year-over-year impact is an unfavorable $0.43 with both fuel and currency moving against us. $0.27 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivatives and $0.16 for currency. Putting all these factors together, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 is $3.30 to $3.60 versus the $3.45 we did in 2016. 
I'll finish up by sharing with your our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2017 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.34 for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. 
The fuel price changes, a [ph] 10% change in the current spot price represents $0.17 impact for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is $1.2 billion for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio, a 10% change in Brent would result in a 6% change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the full year and $0.01 cent for the first quarter.

She's going to command premium yields, premium booking position and has demonstrated that already. So we have every confidence. The other good news for us is we have such a large base in the Carnival brand of previous cruise stores that will introduce a new ship because we don't tend to do it every year. We have a large base of previous cruisers set the book with us. So our dependence on new-to-cruise, while we still need new-to-cruise. It' is overrated.

But we have multiple paths all along, when we declare double-digit, fuel prices were much higher than they were the last few years. And we are now looking at next year at basically being on balance, net of fuel and currency where we were when we declared double-digit returns less capital. So we have no reason to back off from that goal. We have multiple pathways, including, obviously, increase yields. But also in terms of managing more efficiently. Then all the tools we have in place, we have new revenue management tool in place that will begin to kick in and we'll see the full effect on about half of our brands by 2018. We've done a lot of work in the brands have been creating additional demand. We have a lot more cruise force in our base of previous school scores. We have much more collaboration and coordination competition across our brand to not only contain costs to help us manage costs and you see reflected in the cost guidance. But also, frankly, to share best practices and drive yields further. So we have a number of things in place, we have a lot of momentum and we are committed and we will deliver."

I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation and plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning and a heartfelt happy holidays, everyone.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; and by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking, therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
We finish the year with another record quarter of adjusted earnings, which were $0.17 per share or 34% higher than the prior year, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 per share and leading to the highest full-year earnings in our company's history. 
We achieved full year 2016 adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion, or $3.45 per share. That's $500 million or 28% per share higher than last year, and more than double 2013 earnings of $1.55.  More importantly, we achieved return on invested capital of 9% and doubled our 2013 return on invested capital of 4.5%. We are pleased to have delivered for our shareholders doubled earnings and doubled return-on-invested capital in just 3 short years.
Strong operational improvement contributed $0.55 per share to the bottom line year-over-year, which when combined with $0.14 of accretion from our share repurchase program, enabled us to exceed the high end of our original December guidance range of $3.10 to $3.40 per share. And that's despite an $0.18 drag from fuel and currency both working against us.
These strong results are a credit to the commitment and to the passion of our 120,000 team members, which when coupled with the support from our valued travel agent partners, enable us to overcome the significant obstacles encountered this past year, including the rare occurrence of a simultaneous negative from fuel and currency, a series of global geopolitical events in Turkey, Paris and Brussels, as well as concerns around Zika and Brexit.  It is through their collective efforts that we delivered record earnings in 2016 and are gaining momentum as we embark on 2017 with booking volumes and pricing both well ahead of the prior year. 
It was reinforcing to see constant currency revenue yield growth this year of roughly 4% inclusive of the previously disclosed 1% accounting change on top of the over 4% improvement achieved last year. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements again in our core Caribbean deployment. 
We drove revenue yield growth by creating relative scarcity through our brand team's success and increasing demand in excess of our measured capacity growth via our ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with our continuing public relations efforts.  In fact, we recently created 3 original TV programs that are airing on major U.S. networks having already reached more than 40 million viewers during a large family-oriented programming block. They are designed to entertain, to educate and to engage viewers by showcasing exciting adventures, exotic cultures, beautiful ships and popular global destinations. With almost 80 original episodes, the new experience will [indiscernible] compelling and authentic storytelling to share the powerful way travel by sea connects people, places and cultures around the world, while prominently featuring each of our brands. 
Not only are we experiencing very high appeal ratings at #1 or #2 in our respective time slot, but we're also achieving even more favorable consumer perception of our brands. 
This successful programming comes on the heels of many impactful shows earlier this year.  In the U.K., a reality-based TV series onboard Regal Princess, The Cruise; and P&O Cruises' Battlechefs onboard Britannia. In Italy, Bravo Chef onboard our Costa Ship and our Costa Fortuna, a major motion picture, Holidays in the Caribbean. [ph] In North America, Carnival Cruise Lines was featured on Wheel of Fortune for a full week and featured on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. We have many more opportunities already in the pipeline for next year to keep cruising in the forefront of vacationers' mind, including the new Celebrity Apprentice, airing on NBC in February during wave season, our peak booking period. 
All of these efforts promote consideration around the globe by prominently featuring amazing cruise experiences in our world leading cruise lines. In fact, our brands accounted for over 70% of the industry's positive media coverage. This includes our historic voyage to Cuba, when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 40 years to bring U.S. cruise guests directly from the U.S. to Cuba, with over 55 billion very positive media impressions and paving the way for others in our industry to follow. 
At this time, we are proud to have more sailing scheduled to Cuba than any other major U.S. operator. Moreover, our phenomenal guest experience just gets better and better each year as we continue to deliver on consumer expectations, achieving further improvement on our Net Promoter Scores. 
We also introduced 3 new flagships in 2016, including Carnival Vista, which celebrated its U.S. arrival in November with an onboard concert by country music superstar, Carrie Underwood, supporting Operation Homefront, and with Miss USA, herself military, as the godmother, and including 700 military families invited as guests of honor.  Carnival Vista was designed specifically for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guests with an onboard brewery experience, entertaining IMAX theater and exhilarating SkyRide experience. 
Holland America's Koningsdam presented in Rotterdam by her majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, delivers a new premium experience, where our guests can blend their own wine or dance the night away in our carefully engineered Music Walk showcasing Lincoln Center Stage, Billboard Onboard and B.B. King's Blues Club. 
AIDAprima, the first of a next-generation platform, resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests, combining leading edge of our general attributes with exceptional guest experiences, including racing water slides, the lazy river, climbing wall, an expansive German spa and an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling and even a traditional Christmas market. 
Newbuilds will provide additional demand creation opportunities in 2017 as well, beginning with the recent delivery of Encore for our ultra-luxury brand, Seabourn, designed by Adam Tihany in keeping with the feel of a luxury yacht, Seabourn Encore sets a new standard in ultra-luxury cruising, featuring 300 elegant suites, The Grill, a new restaurant by 3-star Michelin chef, Thomas Keller, and the debut of a new mindful living program with Dr. Andrew Weil. Later next year, we will welcome AIDAperla in Germany and, of course, Majestic Princess, the first ship purpose-built for Chinese cruisers, demonstrating our commitment to grow the cruise industry in China which remains an embryonic market with vast untapped potential.  We expect to continue to profitably grow our presence in China and throughout Asia for many years to come. 
When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to simulate demand creation though. We continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 and the continued roll out of Carnival Cruise Lines' Fun Ship 2.0 to now over 60% of the Carnival Cruise Line fleet. 
On January 5, we will kick off the year by unveiling our latest guest experience innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. We are privileged to be the first travel company ever to be invited to provide the opening keynote address at CES where we will showcase, using our leading-edge technology, offering a new option for our guests for a true breakthrough in unobtrusive, high-touch and personalized travel at scale. 
Furthermore, we launched our new state of the art revenue management system this past year, positioning us well to drive incremental revenue and yield growth over time. The rollout of the system across 6 of our brands is expected to be completed by early 2018. We've already benefited from the sharing of best practices, and we expect this new yield management too to begin to facilitate yield uplift in 2017 and even more so in 2018.
We continue to accelerate progress on our cost containment efforts, delivering $95 million of cost savings in 2016. That's $20 million more than the $75 million included in our original 2016 guidance and bringing the cumulative savings to date to over $190 million. Work continues on our cost-containment efforts that we believe present a multiyear opportunity to further leverage our scale, including another over $75 million of savings planned in 2017.
In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress on our 2020 sustainability goals, focusing on our environmental, safety, labor and social performance. Having already reduced our unit fuel consumption by 28% since initiating the effort, we remain committed to ongoing reduction in air emissions. And just this year, AIDAprima became the first cruise ship in the world be powered by environmentally friendly, liquefied natural gas. We are committed to continuous improvement in health, environmental, safety and security, which is not only so critical to our to premium to operate, but also to our future success. 
This year, we introduced industry-leading shoreside technology to monitor real-time navigational performance and energy use across our fleet, and we opened our significantly expanded Arison Maritime Center in The Netherlands, delivering state-of-the-art Maritime training through cutting-edge bridge and engine room simulators and curriculum. 
In 2016, we delivered over $5 billion of cash from operations and returned more than half to shareholders, having distributed $1 billion through our annual dividend and investing over $2 billion in our ongoing share repurchase program. 
As a testament to the strength of our operating performance, we were able to accomplish this while also gaining back our A- and A3 credit ratings from S&P and Moody's. And we plan to continue to return excess cash and more to shareholders in 2017 with our credit metrics at the better end of our targeted range.
Now looking forward. There are large addressable markets with low penetration all over the world, including North America. And new markets in Asia where economic growth has raised discretionary income levels, fueling increased demand for vacations.  We are focused on growing our top line and have numerous innovations underway to foster cruise demand in the years ahead. Our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields. In 2017, we are projecting revenue yields up another 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons with our prior year success, based on our proven demand creation and yield management efforts. 
At the same time, we will continue to contain cost. In 2017, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver an improvement in earnings of $0.43 per share, however, at current rates, that is offset by $0.43 per share impact from fuel incursion. 
We remain committed to achieving increased consideration for cruise vacations and continued investment in the guest experience to create additional consumer demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We remain committed to responsibly containing cost. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders. And despite the unusual occurrence of both fuel and currency working against us at the same time, we remain committed to achieving sustained double-digit return on invested capital within 2 years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."
258823,412859372,1103969,"Carnival Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results, then I'll provide s",924,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results, then I'll provide some insights on current booking trends and finish up with some color on our 2017 December guidance. 
Our adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.67. This was $0.10 above the midpoint of our September guidance. The improvement was almost all operational, driven by a number of factors. $0.04 came from net ticket revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic. While the remaining $0.06 was an accumulation of a variety of items such as improved fuel consumption and lower depreciation expense. 
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased over 4%. The North American brands were up almost 3%, while the European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 4.1%. 
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yield. Net ticket yields were up 5.2%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska, as well as our EAA brands deployment in Europe. The onboard and other yields increased 1.3%, in line with our guidance as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends, while our brands developed new initiatives for 2017 and beyond.  Net cruise cost per ALBD excluding fuel were up 1%, which was in line with our September guidance. 
In summary, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by higher net revenue yields worth $0.17 and the accretive impact of the stock repurchase program worth $0.04, both of which were partially offset by the unfavorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04. 
Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since September, both booking volumes and prices for the first 3 quarters of 2017 have been running well ahead of the prior year. At this point in time, for the first 3 quarters of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are well ahead at considerably higher prices. 
Now let's drill down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, both occupancy and prices are well ahead in the prior year. If you want to go to Alaska next summer, I suggest you book early as the remaining inventory is going fast. 
For the seasonal European program, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands. For European deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For the Caribbean deployments for our EAA brands, occupancy is lower than the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend.
Finally, I want to provide you with some color on 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.6%. As Arnold indicated, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields. 
For 2017, we are projecting net revenue yields up approximately 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons from our prior year's success. For the full year, we're expecting to see yield improvement in almost all itineraries. 
Now turning to cost. Net cruise cost without fuel for ALBD are expected to be up approximately 1% for 2017. Broadly speaking, there are 3 major drivers of the cost change. First, our forecast is for 1.5 points of inflation across all of our categories globally. Second, we are planning for an increase in dry dock  days from 366 days in 2016 to nearly 450 in 2017, impacting our cost metrics by half a point. 
As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry dock days will vary each year, but probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. Partially offsetting these 2 items, we are forecasting about 1 point of cost-saving benefit as we further leverage our scale.
Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the past year, the 2017 year-over-year impact is an unfavorable $0.43 with both fuel and currency moving against us. $0.27 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivatives and $0.16 for currency. Putting all these factors together, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 is $3.30 to $3.60 versus the $3.45 we did in 2016. 
I'll finish up by sharing with your our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2017 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.34 for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. 
For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current spot price represents a $0.17 impact for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is $1.2 billion for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio, a 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.06 change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the full year and $0.01 for the first quarter. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Arnold."

But things are looking very positive. And all of our indicators are -- our brands have done a great job of creating demand, especially our Carnival brand has continued to outperform in the Caribbean and did again this year. For us, we have added some new capacity, primarily in the form of the Carnival Vista. The ship is spectacular, and she's going to command premium yields, premium booking position and has demonstrated that already. So we have every confidence. The other good news for us is we have such a large base, especially in the Carnival brand, of previous cruise scores, that when we introduce a new ship, because we don't tend to do it every year, we have a large base of previous cruisers set to book with us. So our dependence on new-to-cruise, while we still need new-to-cruise, is not overweighted. So we feel very confident at this point, based on what we see in the Caribbean."

Having said that, we also have a lot of momentum on a number of fronts, not just on cost and payments, but in driving yield and then with some small capacity addition that helps us as well. But we have multiple paths all along, when we declare double-digit, fuel prices were much higher than they were the last few years. And we are now looking at next year at basically being on balance net of fuel and currency where we were when we declared double-digit return on invested capital. So we have no reason to back off from that goal. We have multiple pathways, including, obviously, increased yields. But also in terms of managing more efficiently. Then all the tools we have in place. We have new management tool in place that will begin to kick in and we'll see the full effect on about half of our brands by 2018. We've done a lot of work in the brands have in creating additional demand. We have a lot more cruise scores in our base of previous cruise scores. We have much more collaboration and coordination communication across our brands to not only contain cost to help us manage cost, as you see reflected in the cost guidance, but also, frankly, to share best practices and drive yield further. So we have a number of things in place. We have a lot of momentum. And we are committed and we will deliver."

And certain places can take certain chips, and certain places can only take certain-sized ships and so on. And balancing all that out makes a difference.

So financially, to be candid with you, it's important in the margin and, certainly, important to the brands. But the most important thing is positioning for the longer haul.

Yes, we expect returns overall to be better in '17 than they were in '16, and returns have grown reasonably consistently in China. The most important thing for us is the way we do deployment, we know that the returns are better than what the alternative deployments would've have generated for us. And that's the key for us in operating. So overall, we're lifting our overall performance. But it is -- it does represent 5% of our capacity. So it did in '16 and a little bit less than 6% in '17. So as we move forward, we're looking at building that market, but we're doing it in a way where as we grow it, we're seeing higher returns than we would have seen otherwise. And there's a natural constraint on the pace of growth because we have large addressable markets everywhere in the world that are under-penetrated everywhere in the world, including North America. And so we can't send all the ships to China. And we need new additional capacity in the other places in the world to optimize the ultimate yield and bottom line return."

You mean from consumers in general or from potential guests? I would say that 2 or 3 months ago, that's a good question. I would say this, our brands continue to do an outstanding job of exceeding guest expectations when the guests are on board, and they continue to do an outstanding job of creating more demand for their particular target of segments. And our public relations, more broadly, has done a good job of providing an umbrella effect of getting people consider a cruise when they're thinking about vacation holidays. The last 2 to 3 months were a global business. Every year, there's a recession somewhere or this or that or whatever. And if you are talking globally for our business, I could not say that in the last 2 or 3 months, I see the change in global consumer attitudes or anything like that consistently. What I can say is we definitely see strength and we've seen strength for a while and we're building on that and taking advantage of it."

I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation and plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning and a heartfelt happy holidays, everyone.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking, therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
We finished the year with another record quarter of adjusted earnings, which were $0.17 per share or 34% higher than the prior year, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 per share and leading to the highest full-year earnings in our company's history. 
We achieved full year 2016 adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion, or $3.45 per share. That's $500 million or 28% per share higher than last year, and more than double 2013 earnings of $1.55. More importantly, we achieved return on invested capital of 9% and doubled our 2013 return on invested capital of 4.5%. We are pleased to have delivered for our shareholders doubled earnings and doubled return-on-invested capital in just 3 short years.
Strong operational improvement contributed $0.55 per share to the bottom line year-over-year, which when combined with $0.14 of accretion from our share repurchase program, enabled us to exceed the high end of our original December guidance range of $3.10 to $3.40 per share. And that's despite an $0.18 drag from fuel and currency both moving against us.
These strong results are a credit to the commitment and to the passion of our 120,000 team members, which when coupled with the support from our valued travel agent partners, enabled us to overcome the significant obstacles encountered this past year, including the rare occurrence of a simultaneous negative from fuel and currency, a series of global geopolitical events in Turkey, Paris and Brussels, as well as concerns around Zika and Brexit. It is through their collective efforts that we delivered record earnings in 2016 and are gaining momentum as we embark on 2017 with booking volumes and pricing both well ahead of the prior year. 
It was reinforcing to see constant currency revenue yield growth this year of roughly 4% inclusive of the previously disclosed 1% accounting change on top of the over 4% improvement achieved last year. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements again in our core Caribbean deployment. 
We drove revenue yield growth by creating relative scarcity through our brand team's success and increasing demand in excess of our measured capacity growth via our ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with our continuing public relations efforts. In fact, we recently created 3 original TV programs that are airing on major U.S. networks having already reached more than 40 million viewers during the large family-oriented programming blocks. They are designed to entertain, to educate and to engage viewers by showcasing exciting adventures, exotic cultures, beautiful ships and popular global destinations. With almost 80 original episodes, the new experiential series use compelling and authentic storytelling to share the powerful way travel by sea connects people, places and cultures around the world, while prominently featuring each of our brands. 
Not only are we experiencing very high appeal ratings at #1 or #2 in our respective time slot, but we're also achieving even more favorable consumer perception of our brands. 
This successful programming comes on the heels of many impactful shows earlier this year. In the U.K., a reality-based TV series onboard Regal Princess, The Cruise; and P&O Cruises' Battlechefs onboard Britannia. In Italy, Bravo Chef onboard our Costa Ship and our Costa Fortuna, a major motion picture, Holidays in the Caribbean. [ph] In North America, Carnival Cruise Lines was featured on Wheel of Fortune for a full week and featured on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. We have many more opportunities already in the pipeline for next year to keep cruising in the forefront of vacationers' mind, including the new Celebrity Apprentice, airing on NBC in February during wave season, our peak booking period. 
All of these efforts promote consideration around the globe by prominently featuring amazing cruise experiences in our world leading cruise lines. In fact, our brands accounted for over 70% of the industry's positive media coverage. This includes our historic voyage to Cuba, when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 40 years to bring U.S. cruise guests directly from the U.S. to Cuba, with over 55 billion very positive media impressions and paving the way for others in our industry to follow. 
At this time, we are proud to have more sailing scheduled to Cuba than any other major U.S. operator. Moreover, our phenomenal guest experience just gets better and better each year as we continue to deliver on consumer expectations, achieving further improvement on our Net Promoter Scores. 
We also introduced 3 new flagships in 2016, including Carnival Vista, which celebrated its U.S. arrival in November with an onboard concert by country music superstar Carrie Underwood supporting Operation Homefront, and with Miss USA, herself military, as the godmother, and including 700 military families invited as guests of honor.  Carnival Vista was designed specifically for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guests with an onboard brewery experience, entertaining IMAX theater and exhilarating SkyRide experience. 
Holland America's Koningsdam presented in Rotterdam by her majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, delivers a new premium experience, where our guests can blend their own wine or dance the night away in our carefully engineered Music Walk showcasing Lincoln Center Stage, Billboard Onboard and B.B. King's Blues Club. 
AIDAprima, the first of a next-generation platform, resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests, combining leading edge of our general attributes with exceptional guest experiences, including racing water slides, a lazy river, climbing wall, an expansive German spa and an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling and even a traditional Christmas market. 
Newbuilds will provide additional demand creation opportunities in 2017 as well, beginning with the recent delivery of Encore for our ultra-luxury brand, Seabourn. Designed by Adam Tihany in keeping with the feel of a luxury yacht, Seabourn Encore sets a new standard in ultra-luxury cruising, featuring 300 elegant suites, The Grill, a new restaurant by 3-star Michelin chef, Thomas Keller, and the debut of a new mindful living program with Dr. Andrew Weil. Later next year, we will welcome AIDAperla in Germany and, of course, Majestic Princess, the first ship purpose-built for Chinese cruisers, demonstrating our commitment to grow the cruise industry in China which remains an embryonic market with vast untapped potential. We expect to continue to profitably grow our presence in China and throughout Asia for many years to come. 
When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to simulate demand creation though. We continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 and the continued roll-out of Carnival Cruise Lines' Fun Ship 2.0 to now over 60% of the Carnival Cruise Line fleet. 
On January 5, we will kick off the year by unveiling our latest guest experience innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. We are privileged to be the first travel company ever to be invited to provide the opening keynote address at CES where we will showcase, using our leading-edge technology, offering a new option for our guests for a true breakthrough in unobtrusive, high-touch and personalized travel at scale. 
Furthermore, we launched our new state of the art revenue management system this past year, positioning us well to drive incremental revenue and yield growth over time. The rollout of the system across 6 of our brands is expected to be completed by early 2018. We've already benefited from the sharing of best practices, and we expect this new yield management too to begin to facilitate yield uplift in 2017 and even more so in 2018.
We continue to accelerate progress on our cost containment efforts, delivering $95 million of cost savings in 2016. That's $20 million more than the $75 million included in our original 2016 guidance and bringing the cumulative savings to date to over $190 million. Work continues on our cost-containment efforts that we believe present a multiyear opportunity to further leverage our scale, including another over $75 million of savings planned in 2017.
In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress on our 2020 sustainability goals, focusing on our environmental, safety, labor and social performance. Having already reduced our unit fuel consumption by 28% since initiating the effort, we remain committed to ongoing reduction in air emissions. And just this year, AIDAprima became the first cruise ship in the world to be powered by environmentally friendly, liquefied natural gas. We are committed to continuous improvement in health, environmental, safety and security, which is not only so critical to our premium [ph] to operate, but also to our future success. 
This year, we introduced industry-leading shoreside technology to monitor real-time navigational performance and energy use across our fleet, and we opened our significantly expanded Arison Maritime Center in The Netherlands, delivering state-of-the-art Maritime training through cutting-edge bridge and engine room simulators and curriculum. 
In 2016, we delivered over $5 billion of cash from operations and returned more than half to shareholders, having distributed $1 billion through our annual dividend and investing over $2 billion in our ongoing share repurchase program. 
As a testament to the strength of our operating performance, we were able to accomplish this while also gaining back our A- and A3 credit ratings from S&P and Moody's. And we plan to continue to return excess cash and more to shareholders in 2017 with our credit metrics at the better end of our targeted range.
Now looking forward. There are large addressable markets with low penetration all over the world, including North America. And new markets in Asia where economic growth has raised discretionary income levels, fueling increased demand for vacations.  We are focused on growing our top line and have numerous innovations underway to foster cruise demand in the years ahead. Our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields. In 2017, we are projecting revenue yields up another 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons with our prior year success, based on our proven demand creation and yield management efforts. 
At the same time, we will continue to contain cost. In 2017, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver an improvement in earnings of $0.43 per share, however, at current rates, that is offset by $0.43 per share impact from fuel incursion. 
We remain committed to achieving increased consideration for cruise vacations and continued investment in the guest experience to create additional consumer demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We remain committed to responsibly containing cost. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders. And despite the unusual occurrence of both fuel and currency working against us at the same time, we remain committed to achieving sustained double-digit return on invested capital within 2 years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."
258823,412859372,1104047,"Carnival Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results, then I'll provide s",925,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results, then I'll provide some insights on current booking trends and finish up with some color on our 2017 December guidance. 
Our adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.67. This was $0.10 above the midpoint of our September guidance. The improvement was almost all operational, driven by a number of factors. $0.04 came from net ticket revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic, while the remaining $0.06 was an accumulation of a variety of items such as improved fuel consumption and lower depreciation expense. 
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased over 4%. The North American brands were up almost 3%, while the European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 4.1%. 
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yield. Net ticket yields were up 5.2%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska, as well as our EAA brands deployment in Europe. Then onboard and other yields increased 1.3%, in line with our guidance as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends, while our brands developed new initiatives for 2017 and beyond. Net cruise cost per ALBD excluding fuel were up 1%, which was in line with our September guidance. 
In summary, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by higher net revenue yields worth $0.17 and the accretive impact of the stock repurchase program worth $0.04, both of which were partially offset by the unfavorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04. 
Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since September, both booking volumes and prices for the first 3 quarters of 2017 have been running well ahead of the prior year. At this point in time, for the first 3 quarters of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are well ahead at considerably higher prices. 
Now let's drill down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, both occupancy and prices are well ahead in the prior year. If you want to go to Alaska next summer, I suggest you book early as the remaining inventory is going fast. 
For the seasonal European program, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands. For European deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For the Caribbean deployments for our EAA brands, occupancy is lower than the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend.
Finally, I want to provide you with some color on 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.6%. As Arnold indicated, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields. 
For 2017, we are projecting net revenue yields up approximately 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons from our prior year's success. For the full year, we're expecting to see yield improvement in almost all itineraries. 
Now turning to cost. Net cruise cost without fuel for ALBD are expected to be up approximately 1% for 2017. Broadly speaking, there are 3 major drivers of the cost change. First, our forecast is for 1.5 points of inflation across all of our categories globally. Second, we are planning for an increase in dry dock days from 366 days in 2016 to nearly 450 in 2017, impacting our cost metrics by a half a point. 
As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry dock days will vary each year, but probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. Partially offsetting these 2 items, we are forecasting about 1 point of cost-saving benefit as we further leverage our scale.
Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the past year, the 2017 year-over-year impact is an unfavorable $0.43 with both fuel and currency moving against us. $0.27 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivatives and $0.16 for currency. Putting all these factors together, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 is $3.30 to $3.60 versus the $3.45 we did in 2016. 
I'll finish up by sharing with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2017 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.34 for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. 
For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current spot price represents a $0.17 impact for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is $1.2 billion for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.06 change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the full year and $0.01 for the first quarter. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Arnold."

Yes, I guess the industry capacity of all is going to be up 6% next year in the Caribbean and we're going to be up 5%, roughly. But again, we actually have less inventory to book now than we did at this point in time last year. So we feel very strong at this point. We still have to get through wave season. It's still early. But things are looking very positive. And all of our indicators are -- our brands have done a great job of creating demand, especially our Carnival brand has continued to outperform in the Caribbean and did again this year. For us, we have added some new capacity, primarily in the form of the Carnival Vista. The ship is spectacular, and she's going to command premium yields and premium booking position and has demonstrated that already. So we have every confidence. The other good news for us is we have such a large base, especially in the Carnival brand, of previous cruise scores, that when we introduce a new ship, because we don't tend to do it every year, we have a large base of previous cruisers set to book with us. So our dependence on new-to-cruise, while we still need new-to-cruise, is not overweighted. So we feel very confident at this point, based on what we see in the Caribbean."

I think first of all, it is a headwind to have, obviously, currency and fuel both move against you at the same time, which has rarely if ever happened before and is happening with a pretty significant impact, obviously. Having said that, we also have a lot of momentum on a number of fronts, not just on cost and payments, but in driving yield and then with some small capacity addition that helps us as well. But we have multiple paths all along, when we declare double-digit, fuel prices were much higher than they were the last few years. And we are now looking at next year at basically being on balance net of fuel and currency where we were when we declared double-digit return on invested capital. So we have no reason to back off from that goal. We have multiple pathways, including, obviously, increased yields. But also in terms of managing more efficiently. Then all the tools we have in place. We have new management tool in place that will begin to kick in and we'll see the full effect on about half of our brands by 2018. We've done a lot of work in -- the brands have in creating additional demand. We have a lot more cruise scores in our base of previous cruise scores. We have much more collaboration and coordination communication across our brands to not only contain cost to help us manage cost, as you see reflected in the cost guidance, but also, frankly, to share best practices and drive yield further. So we have a number of things in place. We have a lot of momentum. And we are committed and we will deliver."

But we're going to have tougher comparisons in the first half of the year in China with yields. And so based on what happened in the last half of the year, you might expect yields to be down in the first half of the year on a comparison basis. But then, expectations are that it will be up in the second half of the year. So on balance, we'll see where it lands. But China, for us, is a volume growth story. It's a return story. The yields that we have experienced this past year are certainly still generating good returns. We see possibility for increasing yields, but our focus, again, is continuing that high level of occupancy that we have, continue delivering great experience to Chinese guests to be in position to expand the market."

And certain places can take certain ships, and certain places can only take certain-sized ships and so on. And balancing all that out makes a difference. And similarly, too, in Australia, certain-sized ships can fit if you look at the destinations.

So financially, to be candid with you, it's important in the margin and, certainly, important to the brands. But the most important thing is positioning for the longer haul.

So the Tianjin market is different than the Shanghai market, so on and so forth. So there's lots of things that move in that. But here's the real answer, fundamental underlying answer to your questions. Yes, we expect returns overall to be better in '17 than they were in '16, and returns have grown reasonably consistently in China. The most important thing for us is the way we do deployment, we know that the returns are better than what the alternative deployments would have generated for us. And that's the key for us in operating. So overall, we're lifting our overall performance. But it is -- it does represent 5% of our capacity. So it did in '16 and a little bit less than 6% in '17. So as we move forward, we're looking at building that market, but we're doing it in a way where as we grow it, we're seeing higher returns than we would have seen otherwise. And there's a natural constraint on the pace of growth because we have large addressable markets everywhere in the world that are under-penetrated everywhere in the world, including in North America. And so we can't send all the ships to China. And we need new additional capacity in the other places in the world to optimize the ultimate yield and bottom line return."

I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation and plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning and a heartfelt happy holidays, everyone.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking, therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
We finished the year with another record quarter of adjusted earnings, which were $0.17 per share or 34% higher than the prior year, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 per share and leading to the highest full-year earnings in our company's history. 
We achieved full year 2016 adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion, or $3.45 per share. That's $500 million or 28% per share higher than last year, and more than double 2013 earnings of $1.55. More importantly, we achieved return on invested capital of 9% and doubled our 2013 return on invested capital of 4.5%. We are pleased to have delivered for our shareholders doubled earnings and doubled return-on-invested capital in just 3 short years.
Strong operational improvement contributed $0.55 per share to the bottom line year-over-year, which when combined with $0.14 of accretion from our share repurchase program, enabled us to exceed the high end of our original December guidance range of $3.10 to $3.40 per share. And that's despite an $0.18 drag from fuel and currency both moving against us.
These strong results are a credit to the commitment and to the passion of our 120,000 team members, which when coupled with the support from our valued travel agent partners, enabled us to overcome the significant obstacles encountered this past year, including the rare occurrence of a simultaneous negative from fuel and currency, a series of global geopolitical events in Turkey, Paris and Brussels, as well as concerns around Zika and Brexit. It is through their collective efforts that we delivered record earnings in 2016 and are gaining momentum as we embark on 2017 with booking volumes and pricing both well ahead of the prior year. 
It was reinforcing to see constant currency revenue yield growth this year of roughly 4% inclusive of the previously disclosed 1% accounting change on top of the over 4% improvement achieved last year. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements again in our core Caribbean deployment. 
We drove revenue yield growth by creating relative scarcity through our brand team's success and increasing demand in excess of our measured capacity growth via our ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with our continuing public relations efforts. In fact, we recently created 3 original TV programs that are airing on major U.S. networks having already reached more than 40 million viewers during the large family-oriented programming blocks. They are designed to entertain, to educate and to engage viewers by showcasing exciting adventures, exotic cultures, beautiful ships and popular global destinations. With almost 80 original episodes, the new experiential series use compelling and authentic storytelling to share the powerful way travel by sea connects people, places and cultures around the world, while prominently featuring each of our brands. 
Not only are we experiencing very high appeal ratings at #1 or #2 in our respective time slot, but we're also achieving even more favorable consumer perception of our brands. 
This successful programming comes on the heels of many impactful shows earlier this year. In the U.K., a reality-based TV series onboard Regal Princess, The Cruise; and P&O Cruises' Battlechefs onboard Britannia. In Italy, Bravo Chef onboard our Costa Ship and our Costa Fortuna, a major motion picture, Holidays in the Caribbean. [ph] In North America, Carnival Cruise Lines was featured on Wheel of Fortune for a full week and featured on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. We have many more opportunities already in the pipeline for next year to keep cruising in the forefront of vacationers' mind, including the new Celebrity Apprentice, airing on NBC in February during wave season, our peak booking period. 
All of these efforts promote consideration around the globe by prominently featuring amazing cruise experiences in our world leading cruise lines. In fact, our brands accounted for over 70% of the industry's positive media coverage. This includes our historic voyage to Cuba, when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 40 years to bring U.S. cruise guests directly from the U.S. to Cuba, with over 55 billion very positive media impressions and paving the way for others in our industry to follow. 
At this time, we are proud to have more sailing scheduled to Cuba than any other major U.S. operator. Moreover, our phenomenal guest experience just gets better and better each year as we continue to deliver on consumer expectations, achieving further improvement on our Net Promoter Scores. 
We also introduced 3 new flagships in 2016, including Carnival Vista, which celebrated its U.S. arrival in November with an onboard concert by country music superstar Carrie Underwood supporting Operation Homefront, and with Miss USA, herself military, as the godmother, and including 700 military families invited as guests of honor.  Carnival Vista was designed specifically for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guests with an onboard brewery experience, entertaining IMAX theater and exhilarating SkyRide experience. 
Holland America's Koningsdam presented in Rotterdam by her majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, delivers a new premium experience, where our guests can blend their own wine or dance the night away in our carefully engineered Music Walk showcasing Lincoln Center Stage, Billboard Onboard and B.B. King's Blues Club. 
AIDAprima, the first of a next-generation platform, resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests, combining leading edge of our general attributes with exceptional guest experiences, including racing water slides, a lazy river, climbing wall, an expansive German spa and an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling and even a traditional Christmas market. 
Newbuilds will provide additional demand creation opportunities in 2017 as well, beginning with the recent delivery of Encore for our ultra-luxury brand, Seabourn. Designed by Adam Tihany in keeping with the feel of a luxury yacht, Seabourn Encore sets a new standard in ultra-luxury cruising, featuring 300 elegant suites, The Grill, a new restaurant by 3-star Michelin chef, Thomas Keller, and the debut of a new mindful living program with Dr. Andrew Weil. Later next year, we will welcome AIDAperla in Germany and, of course, Majestic Princess, the first ship purpose-built for Chinese cruisers, demonstrating our commitment to grow the cruise industry in China which remains an embryonic market with vast untapped potential. We expect to continue to profitably grow our presence in China and throughout Asia for many years to come. 
When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to simulate demand creation though. We continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 and the continued roll-out of Carnival Cruise Lines' Fun Ship 2.0 to now over 60% of the Carnival Cruise Line fleet. 
On January 5, we will kick off the year by unveiling our latest guest experience innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. We are privileged to be the first travel company ever to be invited to provide the opening keynote address at CES where we will showcase, using our leading-edge technology, offering a new option for our guests for a true breakthrough in unobtrusive, high-touch and personalized travel at scale. 
Furthermore, we launched our new state of the art revenue management system this past year, positioning us well to drive incremental revenue and yield growth over time. The rollout of the system across 6 of our brands is expected to be completed by early 2018. We've already benefited from the sharing of best practices, and we expect this new yield management too to begin to facilitate yield uplift in 2017 and even more so in 2018.
We continue to accelerate progress on our cost containment efforts, delivering $95 million of cost savings in 2016. That's $20 million more than the $75 million included in our original 2016 guidance and bringing the cumulative savings to date to over $190 million. Work continues on our cost-containment efforts that we believe present a multiyear opportunity to further leverage our scale, including another over $75 million of savings planned in 2017.
In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress on our 2020 sustainability goals, focusing on our environmental, safety, labor and social performance. Having already reduced our unit fuel consumption by 28% since initiating the effort, we remain committed to ongoing reduction in air emissions. And just this year, AIDAprima became the first cruise ship in the world to be powered by environmentally friendly, liquefied natural gas. We are committed to continuous improvement in health, environmental, safety and security, which is not only so critical to our premium [ph] to operate, but also to our future success. 
This year, we introduced industry-leading shoreside technology to monitor real-time navigational performance and energy use across our fleet, and we opened our significantly expanded Arison Maritime Center in The Netherlands, delivering state-of-the-art Maritime training through cutting-edge bridge and engine room simulators and curriculum. 
In 2016, we delivered over $5 billion of cash from operations and returned more than half to shareholders, having distributed $1 billion through our annual dividend and investing over $2 billion in our ongoing share repurchase program. 
As a testament to the strength of our operating performance, we were able to accomplish this while also gaining back our A- and A3 credit ratings from S&P and Moody's. And we plan to continue to return excess cash and more to shareholders in 2017 with our credit metrics at the better end of our targeted range.
Now looking forward. There are large addressable markets with low penetration all over the world, including North America. And new markets in Asia where economic growth has raised discretionary income levels, fueling increased demand for vacations.  We are focused on growing our top line and have numerous innovations underway to foster cruise demand in the years ahead. Our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields. In 2017, we are projecting revenue yields up another 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons with our prior year success, based on our proven demand creation and yield management efforts. 
At the same time, we will continue to contain cost. In 2017, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver an improvement in earnings of $0.43 per share, however, at current rates, that is offset by $0.43 per share impact from fuel incursion. 
We remain committed to achieving increased consideration for cruise vacations and continued investment in the guest experience to create additional consumer demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We remain committed to responsibly containing cost. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders. And despite the unusual occurrence of both fuel and currency working against us at the same time, we remain committed to achieving sustained double-digit return on invested capital within 2 years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results, then I'll provide s",925,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results, then I'll provide some insights on current booking trends and finish up with some color on our 2017 December guidance. 
Our adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.67. This was $0.10 above the midpoint of our September guidance. The improvement was almost all operational, driven by a number of factors. $0.04 came from net ticket revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic, while the remaining $0.06 was an accumulation of a variety of items such as improved fuel consumption and lower depreciation expense. 
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased over 4%. The North American brands were up almost 3%, while the European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 4.1%. 
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yield. Net ticket yields were up 5.2%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska, as well as our EAA brands deployment in Europe. Then onboard and other yields increased 1.3%, in line with our guidance as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends, while our brands developed new initiatives for 2017 and beyond. Net cruise cost per ALBD excluding fuel were up 1%, which was in line with our September guidance. 
In summary, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by higher net revenue yields worth $0.17 and the accretive impact of the stock repurchase program worth $0.04, both of which were partially offset by the unfavorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04. 
Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since September, both booking volumes and prices for the first 3 quarters of 2017 have been running well ahead of the prior year. At this point in time, for the first 3 quarters of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are well ahead at considerably higher prices. 
Now let's drill down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, both occupancy and prices are well ahead in the prior year. If you want to go to Alaska next summer, I suggest you book early as the remaining inventory is going fast. 
For the seasonal European program, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands. For European deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For the Caribbean deployments for our EAA brands, occupancy is lower than the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend.
Finally, I want to provide you with some color on 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.6%. As Arnold indicated, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields. 
For 2017, we are projecting net revenue yields up approximately 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons from our prior year's success. For the full year, we're expecting to see yield improvement in almost all itineraries. 
Now turning to cost. Net cruise cost without fuel for ALBD are expected to be up approximately 1% for 2017. Broadly speaking, there are 3 major drivers of the cost change. First, our forecast is for 1.5 points of inflation across all of our categories globally. Second, we are planning for an increase in dry dock days from 366 days in 2016 to nearly 450 in 2017, impacting our cost metrics by a half a point. 
As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry dock days will vary each year, but probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. Partially offsetting these 2 items, we are forecasting about 1 point of cost-saving benefit as we further leverage our scale.
Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the past year, the 2017 year-over-year impact is an unfavorable $0.43 with both fuel and currency moving against us. $0.27 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivatives and $0.16 for currency. Putting all these factors together, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 is $3.30 to $3.60 versus the $3.45 we did in 2016. 
I'll finish up by sharing with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2017 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.34 for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. 
For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current spot price represents a $0.17 impact for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is $1.2 billion for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.06 change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the full year and $0.01 for the first quarter. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Arnold."

But things are looking very positive. And all of our indicators are -- our brands have done a great job of creating demand, especially our Carnival brand has continued to outperform in the Caribbean and did again this year. For us, we have added some new capacity, primarily in the form of the Carnival Vista. The ship is spectacular, and she's going to command premium yields and premium booking position and has demonstrated that already. So we have every confidence. The other good news for us is we have such a large base, especially in the Carnival brand, of previous cruise scores, that when we introduce a new ship, because we don't tend to do it every year, we have a large base of previous cruisers set to book with us. So our dependence on new-to-cruise, while we still need new-to-cruise, is not overweighted. So we feel very confident at this point, based on what we see in the Caribbean."

I think first of all, it is a headwind to have, obviously, currency and fuel both move against you at the same time, which has rarely if ever happened before and is happening with a pretty significant impact, obviously. Having said that, we also have a lot of momentum on a number of fronts, not just on cost and payments, but in driving yield and then with some small capacity addition that helps us as well. But we have multiple paths all along, when we declare double-digit, fuel prices were much higher than they were the last few years. And we are now looking at next year at basically being on balance net of fuel and currency where we were when we declared double-digit return on invested capital. So we have no reason to back off from that goal. We have multiple pathways, including, obviously, increased yields. But also in terms of managing more efficiently. Then all the tools we have in place. We have new management tool in place that will begin to kick in and we'll see the full effect on about half of our brands by 2018. We've done a lot of work in -- the brands have in creating additional demand. We have a lot more cruise scores in our base of previous cruise scores. We have much more collaboration and coordination communication across our brands to not only contain cost to help us manage cost, as you see reflected in the cost guidance, but also, frankly, to share best practices and drive yield further. So we have a number of things in place. We have a lot of momentum. And we are committed and we will deliver."

When we make decisions like that, you just have to keep in mind, it's very holistic. There are a gazillion variables that go into play. One, obviously, the Carnival brand is doing very, very, very well here in the states. But also, we have multiple home ports in the U.S. We distribute a fleet around the U.S. for Carnival. And certain places can take certain ships, and certain places can only take certain-sized ships and so on. And balancing all that out makes a difference. And similarly, too, in Australia, certain-sized ships can fit if you look at the destinations. But we've had so much success with Vista, the Carnival Vista, we're looking at expanding the opportunity for Carnival brand, while at the same time, still giving really guest-ready and guest-preferred Hartwell in Australian market. So there's only so many shipyards, we can only build so many ships a year. And we have to allocate things and we're always trying to optimize.

So financially, to be candid with you, it's important in the margin and, certainly, important to the brands. But the most important thing is positioning for the longer haul. And positioning to lift overall demand and interest in the Caribbean. And then ultimately, because of that, create additional opportunity for catching more of the value through increase on yields.

So the Tianjin market is different than the Shanghai market, so on and so forth. So there's lots of things that move in that. But here's the real answer, fundamental underlying answer to your questions. Yes, we expect returns overall to be better in '17 than they were in '16, and returns have grown reasonably consistently in China. The most important thing for us is the way we do deployment, we know that the returns are better than what the alternative deployments would have generated for us. And that's the key for us in operating. So overall, we're lifting our overall performance. But it is -- it does represent 5% of our capacity. So it did in '16 and a little bit less than 6% in '17. So as we move forward, we're looking at building that market, but we're doing it in a way where as we grow it, we're seeing higher returns than we would have seen otherwise. And there's a natural constraint on the pace of growth because we have large addressable markets everywhere in the world that are under-penetrated everywhere in the world, including in North America. And so we can't send all the ships to China. And we need new additional capacity in the other places in the world to optimize the ultimate yield and bottom line return."

Now, we're ahead of bookings with higher prices at this time. And so you'll see us give us a little stronger yield guidance. Now keep in mind also, you're coming off a higher base.

We finished the year with another record quarter of adjusted earnings, which were $0.17 per share or 34% higher than the prior year, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 per share and leading to the highest full-year earnings in our company's history. 
We achieved full year 2016 adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion, or $3.45 per share. That's $500 million or 28% per share higher than last year, and more than double 2013 earnings of $1.55. More importantly, we achieved return on invested capital of 9% and doubled our 2013 return on invested capital of 4.5%. We are pleased to have delivered for our shareholders doubled earnings and doubled return-on-invested capital in just 3 short years.
Strong operational improvement contributed $0.55 per share to the bottom line year-over-year, which when combined with $0.14 of accretion from our share repurchase program, enabled us to exceed the high end of our original December guidance range of $3.10 to $3.40 per share. And that's despite an $0.18 drag from fuel and currency both moving against us.
These strong results are a credit to the commitment and to the passion of our 120,000 team members, which when coupled with the support from our valued travel agent partners, enabled us to overcome the significant obstacles encountered this past year, including the rare occurrence of a simultaneous negative from fuel and currency, a series of global geopolitical events in Turkey, Paris and Brussels, as well as concerns around Zika and Brexit. It is through their collective efforts that we delivered record earnings in 2016 and are gaining momentum as we embark on 2017 with booking volumes and pricing both well ahead of the prior year. 
It was reinforcing to see constant currency revenue yield growth this year of roughly 4% inclusive of the previously disclosed 1% accounting change on top of the over 4% improvement achieved last year. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements again in our core Caribbean deployment. 
We drove revenue yield growth by creating relative scarcity through our brand team's success and increasing demand in excess of our measured capacity growth via our ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with our continuing public relations efforts. In fact, we recently created 3 original TV programs that are airing on major U.S. networks having already reached more than 40 million viewers during the large family-oriented programming blocks. They are designed to entertain, to educate and to engage viewers by showcasing exciting adventures, exotic cultures, beautiful ships and popular global destinations. With almost 80 original episodes, the new experiential series use compelling and authentic storytelling to share the powerful way travel by sea connects people, places and cultures around the world, while prominently featuring each of our brands. 
Not only are we experiencing very high appeal ratings at #1 or #2 in our respective time slot, but we're also achieving even more favorable consumer perception of our brands. 
This successful programming comes on the heels of many impactful shows earlier this year. In the U.K., a reality-based TV series onboard Regal Princess, The Cruise; and P&O Cruises' Battlechefs onboard Britannia. In Italy, Bravo Chef onboard our Costa Ship and our Costa Fortuna, a major motion picture, Holidays in the Caribbean. [ph] In North America, Carnival Cruise Lines was featured on Wheel of Fortune for a full week and featured on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. We have many more opportunities already in the pipeline for next year to keep cruising in the forefront of vacationers' mind, including the new Celebrity Apprentice, airing on NBC in February during wave season, our peak booking period. 
All of these efforts promote consideration around the globe by prominently featuring amazing cruise experiences in our world leading cruise lines. In fact, our brands accounted for over 70% of the industry's positive media coverage. This includes our historic voyage to Cuba, when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 40 years to bring U.S. cruise guests directly from the U.S. to Cuba, with over 55 billion very positive media impressions and paving the way for others in our industry to follow. 
At this time, we are proud to have more sailing scheduled to Cuba than any other major U.S. operator. Moreover, our phenomenal guest experience just gets better and better each year as we continue to deliver on consumer expectations, achieving further improvement on our Net Promoter Scores. 
We also introduced 3 new flagships in 2016, including Carnival Vista, which celebrated its U.S. arrival in November with an onboard concert by country music superstar Carrie Underwood supporting Operation Homefront, and with Miss USA, herself military, as the godmother, and including 700 military families invited as guests of honor.  Carnival Vista was designed specifically for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guests with an onboard brewery experience, entertaining IMAX theater and exhilarating SkyRide experience. 
Holland America's Koningsdam presented in Rotterdam by her majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, delivers a new premium experience, where our guests can blend their own wine or dance the night away in our carefully engineered Music Walk showcasing Lincoln Center Stage, Billboard Onboard and B.B. King's Blues Club. 
AIDAprima, the first of a next-generation platform, resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests, combining leading edge of our general attributes with exceptional guest experiences, including racing water slides, a lazy river, climbing wall, an expansive German spa and an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling and even a traditional Christmas market. 
Newbuilds will provide additional demand creation opportunities in 2017 as well, beginning with the recent delivery of Encore for our ultra-luxury brand, Seabourn. Designed by Adam Tihany in keeping with the feel of a luxury yacht, Seabourn Encore sets a new standard in ultra-luxury cruising, featuring 300 elegant suites, The Grill, a new restaurant by 3-star Michelin chef, Thomas Keller, and the debut of a new mindful living program with Dr. Andrew Weil. Later next year, we will welcome AIDAperla in Germany and, of course, Majestic Princess, the first ship purpose-built for Chinese cruisers, demonstrating our commitment to grow the cruise industry in China which remains an embryonic market with vast untapped potential. We expect to continue to profitably grow our presence in China and throughout Asia for many years to come. 
When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to simulate demand creation though. We continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 and the continued roll-out of Carnival Cruise Lines' Fun Ship 2.0 to now over 60% of the Carnival Cruise Line fleet. 
On January 5, we will kick off the year by unveiling our latest guest experience innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. We are privileged to be the first travel company ever to be invited to provide the opening keynote address at CES where we will showcase, using our leading-edge technology, offering a new option for our guests for a true breakthrough in unobtrusive, high-touch and personalized travel at scale. 
Furthermore, we launched our new state of the art revenue management system this past year, positioning us well to drive incremental revenue and yield growth over time. The rollout of the system across 6 of our brands is expected to be completed by early 2018. We've already benefited from the sharing of best practices, and we expect this new yield management too to begin to facilitate yield uplift in 2017 and even more so in 2018.
We continue to accelerate progress on our cost containment efforts, delivering $95 million of cost savings in 2016. That's $20 million more than the $75 million included in our original 2016 guidance and bringing the cumulative savings to date to over $190 million. Work continues on our cost-containment efforts that we believe present a multiyear opportunity to further leverage our scale, including another over $75 million of savings planned in 2017.
In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress on our 2020 sustainability goals, focusing on our environmental, safety, labor and social performance. Having already reduced our unit fuel consumption by 28% since initiating the effort, we remain committed to ongoing reduction in air emissions. And just this year, AIDAprima became the first cruise ship in the world to be powered by environmentally friendly, liquefied natural gas. We are committed to continuous improvement in health, environmental, safety and security, which is not only so critical to our premium [ph] to operate, but also to our future success. 
This year, we introduced industry-leading shoreside technology to monitor real-time navigational performance and energy use across our fleet, and we opened our significantly expanded Arison Maritime Center in The Netherlands, delivering state-of-the-art Maritime training through cutting-edge bridge and engine room simulators and curriculum. 
In 2016, we delivered over $5 billion of cash from operations and returned more than half to shareholders, having distributed $1 billion through our annual dividend and investing over $2 billion in our ongoing share repurchase program. 
As a testament to the strength of our operating performance, we were able to accomplish this while also gaining back our A- and A3 credit ratings from S&P and Moody's. And we plan to continue to return excess cash and more to shareholders in 2017 with our credit metrics at the better end of our targeted range.
Now looking forward. There are large addressable markets with low penetration all over the world, including North America. And new markets in Asia where economic growth has raised discretionary income levels, fueling increased demand for vacations.  We are focused on growing our top line and have numerous innovations underway to foster cruise demand in the years ahead. Our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields. In 2017, we are projecting revenue yields up another 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons with our prior year success, based on our proven demand creation and yield management efforts. 
At the same time, we will continue to contain cost. In 2017, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver an improvement in earnings of $0.43 per share, however, at current rates, that is offset by $0.43 per share impact from fuel incursion. 
We remain committed to achieving increased consideration for cruise vacations and continued investment in the guest experience to create additional consumer demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We remain committed to responsibly containing cost. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders. And despite the unusual occurrence of both fuel and currency working against us at the same time, we remain committed to achieving sustained double-digit return on invested capital within 2 years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."
258823,412859372,2059815,"Carnival Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results, then I'll provide s",925,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results, then I'll provide some insights on current booking trends and finish up with some color on our 2017 December guidance. 
Our adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.67. This was $0.10 above the midpoint of our September guidance. The improvement was almost all operational, driven by a number of factors. $0.04 came from net ticket revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic, while the remaining $0.06 was an accumulation of a variety of items such as improved fuel consumption and lower depreciation expense. 
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased over 4%. The North American brands were up almost 3%, while the European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 4.1%. 
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yield. Net ticket yields were up 5.2%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska, as well as our EAA brands deployment in Europe. Then onboard and other yields increased 1.3%, in line with our guidance as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends, while our brands developed new initiatives for 2017 and beyond. Net cruise cost per ALBD excluding fuel were up 1%, which was in line with our September guidance. 
In summary, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by higher net revenue yields worth $0.17 and the accretive impact of the stock repurchase program worth $0.04, both of which were partially offset by the unfavorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04. 
Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since September, both booking volumes and prices for the first 3 quarters of 2017 have been running well ahead of the prior year. At this point in time, for the first 3 quarters of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are well ahead at considerably higher prices. 
Now let's drill down into the cumulative booked position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, both occupancy and prices are well ahead in the prior year. If you want to go to Alaska next summer, I suggest you book early as the remaining inventory is going fast. 
For the seasonal European program, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands. For European deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For the Caribbean deployments for our EAA brands, occupancy is lower than the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend.
Finally, I want to provide you with some color on 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.6%. As Arnold indicated, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields. 
For 2017, we are projecting net revenue yields up approximately 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons from our prior year's success. For the full year, we're expecting to see yield improvement in almost all itineraries. 
Now turning to cost. Net cruise cost without fuel for ALBD are expected to be up approximately 1% for 2017. Broadly speaking, there are 3 major drivers of the cost change. First, our forecast is for 1.5 points of inflation across all of our categories globally. Second, we are planning for an increase in dry dock days from 366 days in 2016 to nearly 450 in 2017, impacting our cost metrics by a half a point. 
As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry dock days will vary each year, but probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. Partially offsetting these 2 items, we are forecasting about 1 point of cost-saving benefit as we further leverage our scale.
Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the past year, the 2017 year-over-year impact is an unfavorable $0.43 with both fuel and currency moving against us. $0.27 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivatives and $0.16 for currency. Putting all these factors together, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 is $3.30 to $3.60 versus the $3.45 we did in 2016. 
I'll finish up by sharing with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2017 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.34 for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. 
For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current spot price represents a $0.17 impact for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is $1.2 billion for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.06 change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the full year and $0.01 for the first quarter. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Arnold."

But things are looking very positive. And all of our indicators are -- our brands have done a great job of creating demand, especially our Carnival brand has continued to outperform in the Caribbean and did again this year. For us, we have added some new capacity, primarily in the form of the Carnival Vista. The ship is spectacular, and she's going to command premium yields and premium booking position and has demonstrated that already. So we have every confidence. The other good news for us is we have such a large base, especially in the Carnival brand, of previous cruise scores, that when we introduce a new ship, because we don't tend to do it every year, we have a large base of previous cruisers set to book with us. So our dependence on new-to-cruise, while we still need new-to-cruise, is not overweighted. So we feel very confident at this point, based on what we see in the Caribbean."

I think first of all, it is a headwind to have, obviously, currency and fuel both move against you at the same time, which has rarely if ever happened before and is happening with a pretty significant impact, obviously. Having said that, we also have a lot of momentum on a number of fronts, not just on cost and payments, but in driving yield and then with some small capacity addition that helps us as well. But we have multiple paths all along, when we declare double-digit, fuel prices were much higher than they were the last few years. And we are now looking at next year at basically being on balance net of fuel and currency where we were when we declared double-digit return on invested capital. So we have no reason to back off from that goal. We have multiple pathways, including, obviously, increased yields. But also in terms of managing more efficiently. Then all the tools we have in place. We have new management tool in place that will begin to kick in and we'll see the full effect on about half of our brands by 2018. We've done a lot of work in -- the brands have in creating additional demand. We have a lot more cruise scores in our base of previous cruise scores. We have much more collaboration and coordination communication across our brands to not only contain cost to help us manage cost, as you see reflected in the cost guidance, but also, frankly, to share best practices and drive yield further. So we have a number of things in place. We have a lot of momentum. And we are committed and we will deliver."

We have every expectation one or more of our brands will be approved from the June time period on and through May, as I mentioned, we have more sailings than anyone else. In terms of the Fathom, Adonia was basically sort of the internal charter, the brand charter that established the concept and also obviously to position us to introduce into Cuba. And we're going to probably -- well, not probably. We are going to go with larger ships and multiple brands in Cuba. With regard to the DR, we're also going with multiple brands for Fathom. So Fathom is being expanded across a number of brands in the DR. The on-the-ground experiences have resonated greatly with the guests and we will take some of the onboard stuff from Adonia and Fathom to the other brands.

So just keep that in mind. We'll see where yields end up, okay?  Again, it's a B2B business. In terms of guidance, of course, we've put it in. We don't give brand by brand and total geography by geography yields, so I won't do it for China either. But we've given you a good description, I think, of what you can expect. The message we like you guys to hear, clearly, is that it's a return on driven business. And with all the concerns people expressed this year on China, as well as concerns expressed in lots of other areas and whatnot, you can see we're able to deliver an ultimate result. We're very, very bullish on China long term. We have great partners in CSSC. We -- our relationship there is growing stronger and stronger. We're moving forward together to help build a long-standing, sustainable cruise industry in China, which has been declared in the 5-year plan by the Chinese government. So we're bullish, but it's a slow walk. We can only send so many ships and so on. And so we feel really confident overall."

But they have constraints in the number of birds and the size of the birds and what size ships you can get in and so on. So financially, to be candid with you, it's important in the margin and, certainly, important to the brands. But the most important thing is positioning for the longer haul. And positioning to lift overall demand and interest in the Caribbean. And then ultimately, because of that, create additional opportunity for catching more of the value through increase on yields. And so, Cuba's a longer-term play, but you have to build it today, and that's what we're doing. But in terms of the financial impact on the corporation, you couldn't find it probably."

So it's fair to assume, right, that, that ship is getting a price premium to your other capacity in China.

So the Tianjin market is different than the Shanghai market, so on and so forth. So there's lots of things that move in that. But here's the real answer, fundamental underlying answer to your questions. Yes, we expect returns overall to be better in '17 than they were in '16, and returns have grown reasonably consistently in China. The most important thing for us is the way we do deployment, we know that the returns are better than what the alternative deployments would have generated for us. And that's the key for us in operating. So overall, we're lifting our overall performance. But it is -- it does represent 5% of our capacity. So it did in '16 and a little bit less than 6% in '17. So as we move forward, we're looking at building that market, but we're doing it in a way where as we grow it, we're seeing higher returns than we would have seen otherwise. And there's a natural constraint on the pace of growth because we have large addressable markets everywhere in the world that are under-penetrated everywhere in the world, including in North America. And so we can't send all the ships to China. And we need new additional capacity in the other places in the world to optimize the ultimate yield and bottom line return."

I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation and plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning and a heartfelt happy holidays, everyone.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking, therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
We finished the year with another record quarter of adjusted earnings, which were $0.17 per share or 34% higher than the prior year, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 per share and leading to the highest full-year earnings in our company's history. 
We achieved full year 2016 adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion, or $3.45 per share. That's $500 million or 28% per share higher than last year, and more than double 2013 earnings of $1.55. More importantly, we achieved return on invested capital of 9% and doubled our 2013 return on invested capital of 4.5%. We are pleased to have delivered for our shareholders doubled earnings and doubled return-on-invested capital in just 3 short years.
Strong operational improvement contributed $0.55 per share to the bottom line year-over-year, which when combined with $0.14 of accretion from our share repurchase program, enabled us to exceed the high end of our original December guidance range of $3.10 to $3.40 per share. And that's despite an $0.18 drag from fuel and currency both moving against us.
These strong results are a credit to the commitment and to the passion of our 120,000 team members, which when coupled with the support from our valued travel agent partners, enabled us to overcome the significant obstacles encountered this past year, including the rare occurrence of a simultaneous negative from fuel and currency, a series of global geopolitical events in Turkey, Paris and Brussels, as well as concerns around Zika and Brexit. It is through their collective efforts that we delivered record earnings in 2016 and are gaining momentum as we embark on 2017 with booking volumes and pricing both well ahead of the prior year. 
It was reinforcing to see constant currency revenue yield growth this year of roughly 4% inclusive of the previously disclosed 1% accounting change on top of the over 4% improvement achieved last year. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements again in our core Caribbean deployment. 
We drove revenue yield growth by creating relative scarcity through our brand team's success and increasing demand in excess of our measured capacity growth via our ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with our continuing public relations efforts. In fact, we recently created 3 original TV programs that are airing on major U.S. networks having already reached more than 40 million viewers during the large family-oriented programming blocks. They are designed to entertain, to educate and to engage viewers by showcasing exciting adventures, exotic cultures, beautiful ships and popular global destinations. With almost 80 original episodes, the new experiential series use compelling and authentic storytelling to share the powerful way travel by sea connects people, places and cultures around the world, while prominently featuring each of our brands. 
Not only are we experiencing very high appeal ratings at #1 or #2 in our respective time slot, but we're also achieving even more favorable consumer perception of our brands. 
This successful programming comes on the heels of many impactful shows earlier this year. In the U.K., a reality-based TV series onboard Regal Princess, The Cruise; and P&O Cruises' Battlechefs onboard Britannia. In Italy, Bravo Chef onboard our Costa Ship and our Costa Fortuna, a major motion picture, Holidays in the Caribbean. [ph] In North America, Carnival Cruise Lines was featured on Wheel of Fortune for a full week and featured on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. We have many more opportunities already in the pipeline for next year to keep cruising in the forefront of vacationers' mind, including the new Celebrity Apprentice, airing on NBC in February during wave season, our peak booking period. 
All of these efforts promote consideration around the globe by prominently featuring amazing cruise experiences in our world leading cruise lines. In fact, our brands accounted for over 70% of the industry's positive media coverage. This includes our historic voyage to Cuba, when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 40 years to bring U.S. cruise guests directly from the U.S. to Cuba, with over 55 billion very positive media impressions and paving the way for others in our industry to follow. 
At this time, we are proud to have more sailing scheduled to Cuba than any other major U.S. operator. Moreover, our phenomenal guest experience just gets better and better each year as we continue to deliver on consumer expectations, achieving further improvement on our Net Promoter Scores. 
We also introduced 3 new flagships in 2016, including Carnival Vista, which celebrated its U.S. arrival in November with an onboard concert by country music superstar Carrie Underwood supporting Operation Homefront, and with Miss USA, herself military, as the godmother, and including 700 military families invited as guests of honor.  Carnival Vista was designed specifically for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guests with an onboard brewery experience, entertaining IMAX theater and exhilarating SkyRide experience. 
Holland America's Koningsdam presented in Rotterdam by her majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, delivers a new premium experience, where our guests can blend their own wine or dance the night away in our carefully engineered Music Walk showcasing Lincoln Center Stage, Billboard Onboard and B.B. King's Blues Club. 
AIDAprima, the first of a next-generation platform, resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests, combining leading edge of our general attributes with exceptional guest experiences, including racing water slides, a lazy river, climbing wall, an expansive German spa and an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling and even a traditional Christmas market. 
Newbuilds will provide additional demand creation opportunities in 2017 as well, beginning with the recent delivery of Encore for our ultra-luxury brand, Seabourn. Designed by Adam Tihany in keeping with the feel of a luxury yacht, Seabourn Encore sets a new standard in ultra-luxury cruising, featuring 300 elegant suites, The Grill, a new restaurant by 3-star Michelin chef, Thomas Keller, and the debut of a new mindful living program with Dr. Andrew Weil. Later next year, we will welcome AIDAperla in Germany and, of course, Majestic Princess, the first ship purpose-built for Chinese cruisers, demonstrating our commitment to grow the cruise industry in China which remains an embryonic market with vast untapped potential. We expect to continue to profitably grow our presence in China and throughout Asia for many years to come. 
When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to simulate demand creation though. We continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 and the continued roll-out of Carnival Cruise Lines' Fun Ship 2.0 to now over 60% of the Carnival Cruise Line fleet. 
On January 5, we will kick off the year by unveiling our latest guest experience innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. We are privileged to be the first travel company ever to be invited to provide the opening keynote address at CES where we will showcase, using our leading-edge technology, offering a new option for our guests for a true breakthrough in unobtrusive, high-touch and personalized travel at scale. 
Furthermore, we launched our new state of the art revenue management system this past year, positioning us well to drive incremental revenue and yield growth over time. The rollout of the system across 6 of our brands is expected to be completed by early 2018. We've already benefited from the sharing of best practices, and we expect this new yield management too to begin to facilitate yield uplift in 2017 and even more so in 2018.
We continue to accelerate progress on our cost containment efforts, delivering $95 million of cost savings in 2016. That's $20 million more than the $75 million included in our original 2016 guidance and bringing the cumulative savings to date to over $190 million. Work continues on our cost-containment efforts that we believe present a multiyear opportunity to further leverage our scale, including another over $75 million of savings planned in 2017.
In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress on our 2020 sustainability goals, focusing on our environmental, safety, labor and social performance. Having already reduced our unit fuel consumption by 28% since initiating the effort, we remain committed to ongoing reduction in air emissions. And just this year, AIDAprima became the first cruise ship in the world to be powered by environmentally friendly, liquefied natural gas. We are committed to continuous improvement in health, environmental, safety and security, which is not only so critical to our premium [ph] to operate, but also to our future success. 
This year, we introduced industry-leading shoreside technology to monitor real-time navigational performance and energy use across our fleet, and we opened our significantly expanded Arison Maritime Center in The Netherlands, delivering state-of-the-art Maritime training through cutting-edge bridge and engine room simulators and curriculum. 
In 2016, we delivered over $5 billion of cash from operations and returned more than half to shareholders, having distributed $1 billion through our annual dividend and investing over $2 billion in our ongoing share repurchase program. 
As a testament to the strength of our operating performance, we were able to accomplish this while also gaining back our A- and A3 credit ratings from S&P and Moody's. And we plan to continue to return excess cash and more to shareholders in 2017 with our credit metrics at the better end of our targeted range.
Now looking forward. There are large addressable markets with low penetration all over the world, including North America. And new markets in Asia where economic growth has raised discretionary income levels, fueling increased demand for vacations.  We are focused on growing our top line and have numerous innovations underway to foster cruise demand in the years ahead. Our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields. In 2017, we are projecting revenue yields up another 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons with our prior year success, based on our proven demand creation and yield management efforts. 
At the same time, we will continue to contain cost. In 2017, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver an improvement in earnings of $0.43 per share, however, at current rates, that is offset by $0.43 per share impact from fuel incursion. 
We remain committed to achieving increased consideration for cruise vacations and continued investment in the guest experience to create additional consumer demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We remain committed to responsibly containing cost. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders. And despite the unusual occurrence of both fuel and currency working against us at the same time, we remain committed to achieving sustained double-digit return on invested capital within 2 years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."
258823,412859372,2059817,"Carnival Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results, then I'll provide s",925,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results, then I'll provide some insights on current booking trends and finish up with some color on our 2017 December guidance. 
Our adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.67. This was $0.10 above the midpoint of our September guidance. The improvement was almost all operational, driven by a number of factors. $0.04 came from net ticket revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic, while the remaining $0.06 was an accumulation of a variety of items such as improved fuel consumption and lower depreciation expense. 
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased over 4%. The North American brands were up almost 3%, while the European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 4.1%. 
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yield. Net ticket yields were up 5.2%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska, as well as our EAA brands deployment in Europe. Then onboard and other yields increased 1.3%, in line with our guidance as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends, while our brands developed new initiatives for 2017 and beyond. Net cruise cost per ALBD excluding fuel were up 1%, which was in line with our September guidance. 
In summary, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by higher net revenue yields worth $0.17 and the accretive impact of the stock repurchase program worth $0.04, both of which were partially offset by the unfavorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04. 
Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since September, both booking volumes and prices for the first 3 quarters of 2017 have been running well ahead of the prior year. At this point in time, for the first 3 quarters of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are well ahead at considerably higher prices. 
Now let's drill down into the cumulative booked position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, both occupancy and prices are well ahead in the prior year. If you want to go to Alaska next summer, I suggest you book early as the remaining inventory is going fast. 
For the seasonal European program, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands. For European deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For the Caribbean deployments for our EAA brands, occupancy is lower than the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend.
Finally, I want to provide you with some color on 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.6%. As Arnold indicated, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields. 
For 2017, we are projecting net revenue yields up approximately 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons from our prior year's success. For the full year, we're expecting to see yield improvement in almost all itineraries. 
Now turning to cost. Net cruise cost without fuel for ALBD are expected to be up approximately 1% for 2017. Broadly speaking, there are 3 major drivers of the cost change. First, our forecast is for 1.5 points of inflation across all of our categories globally. Second, we are planning for an increase in dry dock days from 366 days in 2016 to nearly 450 in 2017, impacting our cost metrics by a half a point. 
As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry dock days will vary each year, but probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. Partially offsetting these 2 items, we are forecasting about 1 point of cost-saving benefit as we further leverage our scale.
Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the past year, the 2017 year-over-year impact is an unfavorable $0.43 with both fuel and currency moving against us. $0.27 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivatives and $0.16 for currency. Putting all these factors together, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 is $3.30 to $3.60 versus the $3.45 we did in 2016. 
I'll finish up by sharing with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2017 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.34 for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. 
For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current spot price represents a $0.17 impact for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is $1.2 billion for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.06 change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the full year and $0.01 for the first quarter. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Arnold."

But things are looking very positive. And all of our indicators are -- our brands have done a great job of creating demand, especially our Carnival brand has continued to outperform in the Caribbean and did again this year. For us, we have added some new capacity, primarily in the form of the Carnival Vista. The ship is spectacular, and she's going to command premium yields and premium booking position and has demonstrated that already. So we have every confidence. The other good news for us is we have such a large base, especially in the Carnival brand, of previous cruise scores, that when we introduce a new ship, because we don't tend to do it every year, we have a large base of previous cruisers set to book with us. So our dependence on new-to-cruise, while we still need new-to-cruise, is not overweighted. So we feel very confident at this point, based on what we see in the Caribbean."

Having said that, we also have a lot of momentum on a number of fronts, not just on cost and payments, but in driving yield and then with some small capacity addition that helps us as well. But we have multiple paths all along, when we declare double-digit, fuel prices were much higher than they were the last few years. And we are now looking at next year at basically being on balance net of fuel and currency where we were when we declared double-digit return on invested capital. So we have no reason to back off from that goal. We have multiple pathways, including, obviously, increased yields. But also in terms of managing more efficiently. Then all the tools we have in place. We have new management tool in place that will begin to kick in and we'll see the full effect on about half of our brands by 2018. We've done a lot of work in -- the brands have in creating additional demand. We have a lot more cruise scores in our base of previous cruise scores. We have much more collaboration and coordination communication across our brands to not only contain cost to help us manage cost, as you see reflected in the cost guidance, but also, frankly, to share best practices and drive yield further. So we have a number of things in place. We have a lot of momentum. And we are committed and we will deliver."

In terms of the Fathom, Adonia was basically sort of the internal charter, the brand charter that established the concept and also obviously to position us to introduce into Cuba.

So Fathom is being expanded across a number of brands in the DR. The on-the-ground experiences have resonated greatly with the guests and we will take some of the onboard stuff from Adonia and Fathom to the other brands.

And positioning to lift overall demand and interest in the Caribbean. And then ultimately, because of that, create additional opportunity for catching more of the value through increase on yields.

So it's fair to assume, right, that, that ship is getting a price premium to your other capacity in China.

So the Tianjin market is different than the Shanghai market, so on and so forth. So there's lots of things that move in that. But here's the real answer, fundamental underlying answer to your questions. Yes, we expect returns overall to be better in '17 than they were in '16, and returns have grown reasonably consistently in China. The most important thing for us is the way we do deployment, we know that the returns are better than what the alternative deployments would have generated for us. And that's the key for us in operating. So overall, we're lifting our overall performance. But it is -- it does represent 5% of our capacity. So it did in '16 and a little bit less than 6% in '17. So as we move forward, we're looking at building that market, but we're doing it in a way where as we grow it, we're seeing higher returns than we would have seen otherwise. And there's a natural constraint on the pace of growth because we have large addressable markets everywhere in the world that are under-penetrated everywhere in the world, including in North America. And so we can't send all the ships to China. And we need new additional capacity in the other places in the world to optimize the ultimate yield and bottom line return."

Thank you all for joining us this morning.Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by D",1486,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.
Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
Despite a series of geopolitical events that unfolded as the year progressed, including Turkey, Paris and Brussels; despite heightened concerns around Zika; around Brexit and around China; despite fuel and currency both working against us, resulting in an $0.18 drag from our initial 2016 guidance, we have exceeded the high end of our quarterly guidance and we are raising our expectations for the year.
This quarter, we delivered the highest quarterly earnings in Carnival Corporation's history, with record net income of over $1.4 billion, $0.17 per share higher than the prior year, exceeding the high-end of our guidance and $0.07 above the midpoint. Despite the numerous headwinds, we are well on track to achieve our new guidance midpoint for full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.35, more than doubling our 2013 earnings of $1.55 per share. More importantly, our return on invested capital will also nearly double from 4.6% to 8.8% over that same time period.
These strong results could not happen without the hard work of our 120,000 passionate employees and without the strong support of our travel agent partners. Looking forward, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, with higher occupancy levels and higher prices, building momentum for continued earnings growth.
Our record results and favorable booking trends reflect our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth, together with the benefits of leveraging our scale. Our world-leading cruise lines continue to outperform, particularly in the Caribbean with continued strength in cost and pricing. Moreover, all of our major brands in North America and Europe experienced net revenue yield improvement despite the geopolitical environment in Europe.
Europe is our single largest deployment in the third quarter at 45% of our total capacity. Now there certainly has been a lot of noise around China. So I'm going to spend a little extra time on China in my comments now. First, China is a profitable market for us. Our ships operating in China optimize our overall brand performances. As we have previously indicated, China is a unit growth opportunity and we expect the yield to be down as the distribution system improves its ability to service the growing market there.
To demonstrate our commitment to grow the industry in China, we have factored into our results and into our guidance potential adjustments to our contracted prices in support of our distribution partners. The distributors are gaining experience translating pent-up consumer demand for cruising into sustainable market pricing and we certainly want to help them as they adapt to a rapidly growing market.
Again, even with those adjustments, we are raising our guidance for the year, affirming that we can manage ups and downs in this embryonic market. As we've previously pointed out, China represents just 5% of our capacity. And even with capacity growth well above our global average, it will remain a relatively small percentage of our total business. We continue to expect China to be a growth market, especially since the growth in the cruise industry is backed by the Chinese government as is evidenced by its inclusion in the current five-year plan. We will participate in this growth. We have 16 marketing officers in China in 2016, that's up from just 8 in 2015. We plan to open 4 more offices and to significantly expand our distribution network in 2017. Also in 2017, the brand-new Majestic Princess will enter as the first purpose-built ship for the Chinese market. Our capacity growth in China is expected to be 26% next year compared to 66% this year. Industrywide growth in China is expected to be 31% in 2017 compared to 100% this year. Those numbers sound big. But keep in mind that these large year-over-year percentage increase is over a very small base. So these growth rates are directionally equivalent to adding less than one 3,000 berth vessel to our China fleet and roughly two 4,000 berth vessels to the industry fleet overall in 2017 in China. 
Regardless of the rate of growth in China, we are firmly committed to overall measured capacity growth and fully capable of managing to sustainable double-digit return on invested capital.
Concerning newbuild, our most recent announcement included 3 new ship orders for 2021 and 2022, our first orders for those years. Before 2020, there's been no change in capacity from previous announcements. To optimize deployment however, we have reallocated the newbuilds along our brands. 
Over the next 4 years, 3 ships are planned to be purpose-built for Asia, our fastest-growing region, which is still in its earliest stage of development. And an average of roughly 3 ships per year will be spread across all our established markets. In fact, we have a very measured capacity environment during this time at the brand level, with 2 ships each for our North American brand Carnival Cruise Lines; our global brand, Princess; our luxury brand, Seabourn; and our German brand, AIDA. Effectively, one ship every other year for those brands.
In addition, over the same 4-year period, we will deliver just 1 ship each for Holland America Line, Costa in Southern Europe, P&O in the U.K. and P&O in Australia. And during this time, we will continue removing ships from our fleet. In fact, the number of berths that are eligible for removal will more than double by 2020 and more than double again by 2024.
Given this potential replacement cycle increase, we expect that a greater portion of our newbuild capacity will actually replace older, less efficient ships. As in the past, we will sell ships into secondary markets that do not compete directly with our brands. Within those secondary markets, there are older ships operating today that will soon reach retirement age and need to be replaced. We expect our net capacity growth through 2020 to be 3% to 4% compounded annually, consisting of double-digit growth in Asia and obviously, 3% or less growth in our established markets in North America, Europe and Australia.
Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We have stepped up our aggressive public relations effort with 3 innovative 30-minute programs airing weekly on ABC, NBC and CW, every Saturday morning, beginning in October. Each program showcases our brands, creating amazing vacation experiences that are designed to expand the audience for cruising by providing increased consideration and, at the same time, changing perceptions by dispelling the myth of cruising with compelling original content. We are excited by the prospects of connecting people, places and cultures across the world to create unforgettable experiences. Collectively, these programs provide 1.5 hours of content per week with over 150 scheduled airings and an annual expected viewership well in excess of 150 million people. And we have further innovations on horizon that will be unveiled in January of 2017 designed to further enhance our already great guest experiences.
Additionally, we launched the initial phase of our yield management system this quarter, helping us drive incremental revenue yields over time. We are currently market testing across 6 brands for a portion of the inventory to refine algorithms. The full rollout will be completed by late next year. Although we have already benefited from the sharing of best practices, we expect this new yield management technology to contribute in 2017 and even more so in 2018.
We also continue to make progress on our cost containment efforts and remain on track for more than $75 million of cost savings this year.
In summary, we are committed to measured capacity growth, currently planned at less than 3% in the established markets. Our brands are differentiating themselves in the market and delivering fantastic vacations for our guests as evidenced by our strong yield performance. We continue to build demand for cruise and continue to aggressively contain costs while still investing in enhanced guest experience and demand creation. We are improving our capability to extract yield in any environment through enhanced revenue management tools. Moreover, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased another $700 million of Carnival stock through our ongoing buyback program. In the last year, we have invested nearly $2.5 billion to buy back over 50 million shares of our company stock, demonstrating conviction in our ability to execute and achieve sustainable double-digit returns on invested capital.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."
258823,401982999,2059821,"Carnival Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 26, 2016",2016-09-26,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I'll provide an",1137,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I'll provide an update on our full year 2016 guidance. And then I'll finish up with some insights on 2017 booking trends and a few other items to note for 2017.
Our record adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.92. This was $0.07 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The improvement was driven by a number of factors: First, $0.02 from net revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings at our North American brands; second, $0.02 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters; third, $0.01 from the favorable net impact of fuel prices and currency versus our June guidance rates; and fourth, $0.01 from the accretive impact of the shares we repurchased since the last earnings call.
Now let's turn to the third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. The North American brands were up over 2% while our European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 2.7%.
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.1%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean, Alaska and Europe as well as our EAA brands deployments in Europe. These net ticket yield increases were partially offset by yield reductions in Australia, driven by large industry capacity increases in a highly penetrated market as well as yield reductions in Asia, where distributors are gaining experience growing the market. The majority of these yield reductions were anticipated in our initial 2016 yield guidance, provided during our December earnings call.
After 8 straight quarters of mid-to high single digit yield increases, our net onboard and other yields increased 1.3% over much tougher comparables from the third quarter 2015 as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends while our brands develop new initiatives for 2017 and beyond.
Net cruise costs per ALBD excluding fuel were up over 5%, driven by the timing of advertising expenses and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock as discussed on our last earnings call. This was about 1 point improvement versus what was planned in our June guidance. But again, this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.
In summary, our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by 3 things: One, operational improvements worth $0.05 despite a high net cruise cost seasonalization in the third quarter; two, the favorable net impact of fuel prices and currency were $0.02; and three, share buyback accretion worth $0.10.
As Arnold indicated, since the beginning of the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares for a total, since late last year, of over 50 million shares and nearly $2.5 billion of buybacks. At this point in time, we have approximately $500 million remaining on the $3 billion stock buyback authorization. Our September guidance EPS calculations assume shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculations assume 748 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while the fourth quarter calculations assume 730 million shares outstanding.
Next, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, we are well on track for achieving adjusted EPS of $3.35, which is the midpoint of our 2016 September guidance range of $3.33 to $3.37. The $0.05 improvement compared to the midpoint of our June guidance was essentially driven by 2 things: Improved net revenue yields were $0.03, $0.02 of which we achieved in the third quarter and an additional $0.01 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the fourth quarter; and $0.02 from the accretive impact of additional shares repurchased since our June conference call.
Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since June, bookings for the first half of 2017 have been at significantly higher prices with booking volumes lower than the prior year as there is less inventory remaining for sale. At this point in time, for the first half of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are ahead at considerably higher prices.
Drilling down into the cumulative booked position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For all other deployments, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at higher prices.
Secondly, for our EAA brands.  For Europe deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. For the Caribbean deployment for our EAA brands, occupancy is in line with the prior year at slightly lower prices. However, prices on these bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend. For Asia, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. And for Australia, occupancy is also well ahead of the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on the bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, also clearly an improving trend.
And finally, a few other items to note for 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.5%. We are planning for an increase in dry-dock days from approximately 380 days in 2016 to 470 days in 2017. Remember, we did benefit in 2016 from lower dry-dock days compared to the 563 days we had in 2015.
As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry-dock days will vary each year. But probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. As we indicated last year, given the amount of CapEx reinvestment in the existing vessels and other areas of our business, to drive yield improvement, we do expect depreciation expense to increase percentagewise, more than capacity and currently expect depreciation expense to be around $1.9 billion for 2017.
Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the last year, we wanted to share with you the year-over-year impact that these items would have on our 2017 results if we use current fuel prices and FX rates. The 2017 year-over-year impact would be an unfavorable $0.28: $0.24 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivatives; and $0.04 for currency.
Although it's early, 2017 appears to be shaping up to be another good year. We are well positioned for continued earnings growth, given the current strength of our bookings and pricing trends for next year.

So that was the relative strength of the market in Germany for AIDA. So all of those things factor in as well as the dynamics in China itself. Similarly with the Carnival, as I mentioned on a previous call on that one, it was a combination of things for how well that the Carnival is doing in the Caribbean, the timing of the capacity coming in with the Vista coming in and other things and the fact that we have distributed ports, home ports here in the U.S. and getting the right ship in the right homeport.

So that means the government is committed to developing the cruise industry. The reason for that is pretty self-evident. We'll employ that overall with port development and infrastructure and supply chain and training as well as shipbuilding that will employ millions and millions and millions of Chinese. And so the government is very interested and they see cruise as an economic engine going forward. So you've got the support of the central government and the various provincial municipal governance so that's very important. And the second thing is just the growth market. The third thing is that growth is constrained. I know the percentages sound large and everything. But as I have tried to point out in the opening comments, we're talking onesie, twosies and ships. And the reason the growth is constrained is because we have large addressable markets that are underpenetrated everywhere in the world. And so we have lots of places to put ships these days. And so we are not just going to take all the ships in the existing markets and move on the unity of the China. And then there is constraint on the number of ships that can be built in China -- up for China -- the China market in the near term here. So all of those things put additional constraints. Beyond that, clearly, as we anticipated, as you guys have identified through your assessments and stuff, that yields decline. We see China as a unit volume -- a unit growth story, as ultimately accretive to earnings, which it has been for us and overall helping us optimize yields across the global fleet and it's working really well. Having said that, there is a gap with distribution. It's an embryonic market. Distributors are finding their way for the first time in cruise. It is a charter market, a B2B market. So that introduces possibilities of discontinuities that you might not see if you had a direct-to-consumer kind of a market. So all of those things are things we already knew going over. Those were firm. But the other thing that wasn't firm was the enthusiasm for the government, for the cruise industry, the fact that the guest satisfaction levels are high, that our ships are definitely occupied, comparable to prior years despite the significant percentage increases in capacity and we see it as a future market. Now having said all of that, with all the increases we're talking about, it's 5% of our capacity next year with the additional increases, including the Majestic Princess, will be the first purpose-built ship for China entering late next year. Even with that, it's going to be 6% of our capacity. So we can only grow so fast. And because of the relatively small percentage of our total fleet it is, it's very manageable for us with any fits and styles or bumps on the road we might encounter. But we're committed to work with distributor partners, our distributor partners in building a sustainable business in China."

And the guests are having just tremendous experiences, and we are exceeding their expectations across the brands as they go into the Caribbean, and especially with the Carnival brand, so that's number 1. Number 2, in the case of the Carnival brand, in particular, again, we have a very large base of previous cruisegoers that are loyal to the brand. And that, obviously, helps us because those people have experienced the brand and love it and want to do it again and again. And then thirdly, we're better in our revenue management skills. And so we have shared best practices across the brands and revenue management. And our people are getting increasingly sophisticated and doing very, very well. Also, we've anticipated a bit of an election slowdown, historically. There's always been a little falloff in booking volumes around election time. And so there could be some of that. But in our case, again, right now, we're doing so well, and we are so far ahead and the pricing is strong, we've got great close-in pricing right now. And so it's been very good. But relative to what the other companies, other cruise lines, I wouldn't have a comment, but -- other than to say, I'm sure it's a combination of the relative moves they made in deployments and stuff.

Sustainable for our distributor partners, sustainable in terms of the government's desire to have the cruise industry be established there and, obviously, sustainable for us from a profit standpoint.

And that just won't happen. And so having said that, the other comment is if you take the impact this quarter, given even the additional consideration we've reflected in the guidance going forward, the impact for the full year on yields losses across our fleet is a rounding error. So we believe that we can effect a sustainable business in China over time. We're going to make practical economic decisions, our assets are mobile. And because it's such a small percentage, even in the future when we start looking at adding additional ships above our overall capacity, we can move a few ships around and manage things effectively through smart deployment. Having said that, for next year, right now, we see good relationships with our distributor partners and an ability to extract value. Hopefully, it will be proportionate to the capacity increase or greater. But at this point, we haven't finalized those conversations. It's too early to give real guidance."

So it is important to us. So the impact was this, in the cases when things got a little dicey in Istanbul and in Turkey, we, obviously, had to make deployment itinerary changes. So again, generally speaking, we go where guests want to go and we go, obviously where, all the information we have says, it's okay to go, it's safe to go, because safety is number 1, obviously. And so we -- how it affects us is we make itinerary deployment changes, either because guests don't want to go or because we've gotten intelligence in the world community that it's wiser not to go, it affects us that way. Initially, we can see booking impacts right after the incident. Those tend to fade away. As you know, if you go back over years, this is not a year where this is the only time this has happened, and it happens to some extent almost -- in recent times -- almost every year for the last several years, as does a Zika or a MERS or Asian flu, whatever it is these things, Ebola even. And so every year, there's geopolitical tensions, there's some kind of disease consternation, there's macroeconomic malaise, there's isolated or concentrated overcapacity in the cruise industry every year and in some markets around the world, those things happen. And it's part of our business. So we manage that, we anticipate it. We change deployments. We do good revenue management practices, manage around it and that's basically it. So to us, it's normal business. I wish it wasn't that way. Every now and then, hopefully, we'll get lucky and there won't be those incidents, because we think we would do better. Some of those itineraries we had to redirect are high-yielding, short excursion items which could have added additional revenue and earnings to the bottom line. We used to be in the Black Sea, we haven't been there quite a while. The Black Sea was one of the highest yielding, both from a ticket standpoint and onboard revenue standpoint, the itineraries we could've had. And so hopefully, sometimes, those things will work in our favor and we'll do even better. But right now, we expect that stuff to happen every year, and we have to manage it, and we have to deliver double-digit return invested capital in those environments."

Beyond that, it's again, as I mentioned, it's a combination of creating demand, of clever deployment and of exceeding guest expectations once onboard so that when they leave, they help us create demand themselves, only for them to come back for others that they share with. The brands are differentiated, that helps as well.

We charter with some Asia distributors. They then sell through their network. But they will often, in turn, expand their network through subagents or subdistributors. And that's a negotiation between them and those subdistributors on pricing and so on. So how we control the pricing, which we don't really per se, control, we control what price we're getting. And then it's up to them to manage to see how much profit they're going to take and so on and so forth. But where -- all the control we have is, in the end, if they come back and say, hey, I didn't do as well as I thought, why don't you help me out, et cetera, that's a negotiation that's afoot, it happens every year. But that's the level of control we have by our degree of willingness to negotiate. In some cases, they may have legitimate challenges. In some cases, they're just negotiating, they get a better deal. And you've got to do your best to sort all that out when you don't have total transparency to the ultimate price that the Chinese guest that was on the ship paid. We tried to get at that various ways, but, of course, others tried to make certain we can't get to that information. And that's on -- it's just a business, normal in business. You can think of other constructs in other places where a manufacturer sells to a distributor and may not know exactly what the distributor priced that and so on in any other market, in any other industry. So that's the nature of the business today. Over time, that'll probably evolve to a different model, but that's what it is today."

But on the other hand, as I tried to point out earlier in the call in some of the questions, China is going to be limited in how many ships are going to be available for it to take, because people are building ships for other markets as well. I think what you have to think about is in that capacity growth. So we're always going to build new ships and so will others. And the reason is because the ships are more efficient, okay? And they give you the opportunity for enhanced revenue opportunity versus the existing ships. And so new ships are always going to be coming. The question is, how many ships leave? How many ships go to secondary markets and so on? And in the opening comments, I referenced the fact that the number of berths that are getting to retirement, the amount of capacity that's getting to retirement age is going to double in 2020 and it's going to double again in 2024. And so there will be a need for some of that capacity just to replace. And then the rest will get regulated by the marketplace. If there's scarce supply relative to demand, some of the less efficient ships will continue to sell. If there's not that relative scarcity, then some of those ships will exit. They'll either go into secondary markets or they'll leave the fleet and be scrapped. And so that's the real dynamic. We know what we're going to do. We are committed to measure capacity growth, and we know how to manage within our brands and across the various destinations. And so based on that, we have great confidence that we'll be able to manage to the sustained double-digit return on invested capital that we have promised within the next 2 years."

So we're spreading out these newbuilds across a number of brands, which gives that brand base an opportunity to absorb the capacity while they're creating the excess demand required to get the relative scarcity that we're chasing. So we are, overall, managing to measure capacity growth in total, but we're also doing it by brand.

Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
Despite a series of geopolitical events that unfolded as the year progressed, including Turkey, Paris and Brussels; despite heightened concerns around Zika; around Brexit and around China; despite fuel and currency both working against us, resulting in an $0.18 drag from our initial 2016 guidance, we have exceeded the high end of our quarterly guidance and we are raising our expectations for the year.
This quarter, we delivered the highest quarterly earnings in Carnival Corporation's history, with record net income of over $1.4 billion, $0.17 per share higher than the prior year, exceeding the high-end of our guidance and $0.07 above the midpoint. Despite the numerous headwinds, we are well on track to achieve our new guidance midpoint for full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.35, more than doubling our 2013 earnings of $1.55 per share. More importantly, our return on invested capital will also nearly double from 4.6% to 8.8% over that same time period.
These strong results could not happen without the hard work of our 120,000 passionate employees and without the strong support of our travel agent partners. Looking forward, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, with higher occupancy levels and higher prices, building momentum for continued earnings growth.
Our record results and favorable booking trends reflect our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth, together with the benefits of leveraging our scale. Our world-leading cruise lines continue to outperform, particularly in the Caribbean with continued strength in cost and pricing. Moreover, all of our major brands in North America and Europe experienced net revenue yield improvement despite the geopolitical environment in Europe.
Europe is our single largest deployment in the third quarter at 45% of our total capacity. Now there certainly has been a lot of noise around China. So I'm going to spend a little extra time on China in my comments now. First, China is a profitable market for us. Our ships operating in China optimize our overall brand performances. As we have previously indicated, China is a unit growth opportunity and we expect the yield to be down as the distribution system improves its ability to service the growing market there.
To demonstrate our commitment to grow the industry in China, we have factored into our results and into our guidance potential adjustments to our contracted prices in support of our distribution partners. The distributors are gaining experience translating pent-up consumer demand for cruising into sustainable market pricing and we certainly want to help them as they adapt to a rapidly growing market.
Again, even with those adjustments, we are raising our guidance for the year, affirming that we can manage ups and downs in this embryonic market. As we've previously pointed out, China represents just 5% of our capacity. And even with capacity growth well above our global average, it will remain a relatively small percentage of our total business. We continue to expect China to be a growth market, especially since the growth in the cruise industry is backed by the Chinese government as is evidenced by its inclusion in the current five-year plan. We will participate in this growth. We have 16 marketing officers in China in 2016, that's up from just 8 in 2015. We plan to open 4 more offices and to significantly expand our distribution network in 2017. Also in 2017, the brand-new Majestic Princess will enter as the first purpose-built ship for the Chinese market. Our capacity growth in China is expected to be 26% next year compared to 66% this year. Industrywide growth in China is expected to be 31% in 2017 compared to 100% this year. Those numbers sound big. But keep in mind that these large year-over-year percentage increase is over a very small base. So these growth rates are directionally equivalent to adding less than one 3,000 berth vessel to our China fleet and roughly two 4,000 berth vessels to the industry fleet overall in 2017 in China. 
Regardless of the rate of growth in China, we are firmly committed to overall measured capacity growth and fully capable of managing to sustainable double-digit return on invested capital.
Concerning newbuild, our most recent announcement included 3 new ship orders for 2021 and 2022, our first orders for those years. Before 2020, there's been no change in capacity from previous announcements. To optimize deployment however, we have reallocated the newbuilds along our brands. 
Over the next 4 years, 3 ships are planned to be purpose-built for Asia, our fastest-growing region, which is still in its earliest stage of development. And an average of roughly 3 ships per year will be spread across all our established markets. In fact, we have a very measured capacity environment during this time at the brand level, with 2 ships each for our North American brand Carnival Cruise Lines; our global brand, Princess; our luxury brand, Seabourn; and our German brand, AIDA. Effectively, one ship every other year for those brands.
In addition, over the same 4-year period, we will deliver just 1 ship each for Holland America Line, Costa in Southern Europe, P&O in the U.K. and P&O in Australia. And during this time, we will continue removing ships from our fleet. In fact, the number of berths that are eligible for removal will more than double by 2020 and more than double again by 2024.
Given this potential replacement cycle increase, we expect that a greater portion of our newbuild capacity will actually replace older, less efficient ships. As in the past, we will sell ships into secondary markets that do not compete directly with our brands. Within those secondary markets, there are older ships operating today that will soon reach retirement age and need to be replaced. We expect our net capacity growth through 2020 to be 3% to 4% compounded annually, consisting of double-digit growth in Asia and obviously, 3% or less growth in our established markets in North America, Europe and Australia.
Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We have stepped up our aggressive public relations effort with 3 innovative 30-minute programs airing weekly on ABC, NBC and CW, every Saturday morning, beginning in October. Each program showcases our brands, creating amazing vacation experiences that are designed to expand the audience for cruising by providing increased consideration and, at the same time, changing perceptions by dispelling the myth of cruising with compelling original content. We are excited by the prospects of connecting people, places and cultures across the world to create unforgettable experiences. Collectively, these programs provide 1.5 hours of content per week with over 150 scheduled airings and an annual expected viewership well in excess of 150 million people. And we have further innovations on horizon that will be unveiled in January of 2017 designed to further enhance our already great guest experiences.
Additionally, we launched the initial phase of our yield management system this quarter, helping us drive incremental revenue yields over time. We are currently market testing across 6 brands for a portion of the inventory to refine algorithms. The full rollout will be completed by late next year. Although we have already benefited from the sharing of best practices, we expect this new yield management technology to contribute in 2017 and even more so in 2018.
We also continue to make progress on our cost containment efforts and remain on track for more than $75 million of cost savings this year.
In summary, we are committed to measured capacity growth, currently planned at less than 3% in the established markets. Our brands are differentiating themselves in the market and delivering fantastic vacations for our guests as evidenced by our strong yield performance. We continue to build demand for cruise and continue to aggressively contain costs while still investing in enhanced guest experience and demand creation. We are improving our capability to extract yield in any environment through enhanced revenue management tools. Moreover, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased another $700 million of Carnival stock through our ongoing buyback program. In the last year, we have invested nearly $2.5 billion to buy back over 50 million shares of our company stock, demonstrating conviction in our ability to execute and achieve sustainable double-digit returns on invested capital.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."

Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I'll provide an",1137,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I'll provide an update on our full year 2016 guidance. And then I'll finish up with some insights on 2017 booking trends and a few other items to note for 2017.
Our record adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.92. This was $0.07 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The improvement was driven by a number of factors: First, $0.02 from net revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings at our North American brands; second, $0.02 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters; third, $0.01 from the favorable net impact of fuel prices and currency versus our June guidance rates; and fourth, $0.01 from the accretive impact of the shares we repurchased since the last earnings call.
Now let's turn to the third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. The North American brands were up over 2% while our European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 2.7%.
Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.1%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean, Alaska and Europe as well as our EAA brands deployments in Europe. These net ticket yield increases were partially offset by yield reductions in Australia, driven by large industry capacity increases in a highly penetrated market as well as yield reductions in Asia, where distributors are gaining experience growing the market. The majority of these yield reductions were anticipated in our initial 2016 yield guidance, provided during our December earnings call.
After 8 straight quarters of mid-to high single digit yield increases, our net onboard and other yields increased 1.3% over much tougher comparables from the third quarter 2015 as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends while our brands develop new initiatives for 2017 and beyond.
Net cruise costs per ALBD excluding fuel were up over 5%, driven by the timing of advertising expenses and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock as discussed on our last earnings call. This was about 1 point improvement versus what was planned in our June guidance. But again, this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.
In summary, our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by 3 things: One, operational improvements worth $0.05 despite a high net cruise cost seasonalization in the third quarter; two, the favorable net impact of fuel prices and currency were $0.02; and three, share buyback accretion worth $0.10.
As Arnold indicated, since the beginning of the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares for a total, since late last year, of over 50 million shares and nearly $2.5 billion of buybacks. At this point in time, we have approximately $500 million remaining on the $3 billion stock buyback authorization. Our September guidance EPS calculations assume shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculations assume 748 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while the fourth quarter calculations assume 730 million shares outstanding.
Next, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, we are well on track for achieving adjusted EPS of $3.35, which is the midpoint of our 2016 September guidance range of $3.33 to $3.37. The $0.05 improvement compared to the midpoint of our June guidance was essentially driven by 2 things: Improved net revenue yields were $0.03, $0.02 of which we achieved in the third quarter and an additional $0.01 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the fourth quarter; and $0.02 from the accretive impact of additional shares repurchased since our June conference call.
Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since June, bookings for the first half of 2017 have been at significantly higher prices with booking volumes lower than the prior year as there is less inventory remaining for sale. At this point in time, for the first half of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are ahead at considerably higher prices.
Drilling down into the cumulative booked position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For all other deployments, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at higher prices.
Secondly, for our EAA brands.  For Europe deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. For the Caribbean deployment for our EAA brands, occupancy is in line with the prior year at slightly lower prices. However, prices on these bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend. For Asia, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. And for Australia, occupancy is also well ahead of the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on the bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, also clearly an improving trend.
And finally, a few other items to note for 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.5%. We are planning for an increase in dry-dock days from approximately 380 days in 2016 to 470 days in 2017. Remember, we did benefit in 2016 from lower dry-dock days compared to the 563 days we had in 2015.
As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry-dock days will vary each year. But probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. As we indicated last year, given the amount of CapEx reinvestment in the existing vessels and other areas of our business, to drive yield improvement, we do expect depreciation expense to increase percentagewise, more than capacity and currently expect depreciation expense to be around $1.9 billion for 2017.
Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the last year, we wanted to share with you the year-over-year impact that these items would have on our 2017 results if we use current fuel prices and FX rates. The 2017 year-over-year impact would be an unfavorable $0.28: $0.24 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivatives; and $0.04 for currency.
Although it's early, 2017 appears to be shaping up to be another good year. We are well positioned for continued earnings growth, given the current strength of our bookings and pricing trends for next year. 
And now, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

Similarly with the Carnival, as I mentioned on a previous call on that one, it was a combination of things for how well that the Carnival is doing in the Caribbean, the timing of the capacity coming in with the Vista coming in and other things and the fact that we have distributed ports, home ports here in the U.S. and getting the right ship in the right homeport.

So that means the government is committed to developing the cruise industry. The reason for that is pretty self-evident. We'll employ that overall with port development and infrastructure and supply chain and training as well as shipbuilding that will employ millions and millions and millions of Chinese. And so the government is very interested and they see cruise as an economic engine going forward. So you've got the support of the central government and the various provincial municipal governance so that's very important. And the second thing is just the growth market. The third thing is that growth is constrained. I know the percentages sound large and everything. But as I have tried to point out in the opening comments, we're talking onesie, twosies and ships. And the reason the growth is constrained is because we have large addressable markets that are underpenetrated everywhere in the world. And so we have lots of places to put ships these days. And so we are not just going to take all the ships in the existing markets and move on the unity of the China. And then there is constraint on the number of ships that can be built in China -- up for China -- the China market in the near term here. So all of those things put additional constraints. Beyond that, clearly, as we anticipated, as you guys have identified through your assessments and stuff, that yields decline. We see China as a unit volume -- a unit growth story, as ultimately accretive to earnings, which it has been for us and overall helping us optimize yields across the global fleet and it's working really well. Having said that, there is a gap with distribution. It's an embryonic market. Distributors are finding their way for the first time in cruise. It is a charter market, a B2B market. So that introduces possibilities of discontinuities that you might not see if you had a direct-to-consumer kind of a market. So all of those things are things we already knew going over. Those were firm. But the other thing that wasn't firm was the enthusiasm for the government, for the cruise industry, the fact that the guest satisfaction levels are high, that our ships are definitely occupied, comparable to prior years despite the significant percentage increases in capacity and we see it as a future market. Now having said all of that, with all the increases we're talking about, it's 5% of our capacity next year with the additional increases, including the Majestic Princess, will be the first purpose-built ship for China entering late next year.

Number 2, in the case of the Carnival brand, in particular, again, we have a very large base of previous cruisegoers that are loyal to the brand. And that, obviously, helps us because those people have experienced the brand and love it and want to do it again and again. And then thirdly, we're better in our revenue management skills. And so we have shared best practices across the brands and revenue management. And our people are getting increasingly sophisticated and doing very, very well. Also, we've anticipated a bit of an election slowdown, historically. There's always been a little falloff in booking volumes around election time. And so there could be some of that. But in our case, again, right now, we're doing so well, and we are so far ahead and the pricing is strong, we've got great close-in pricing right now. And so it's been very good.

And that just won't happen. And so having said that, the other comment is if you take the impact this quarter, given even the additional consideration we've reflected in the guidance going forward, the impact for the full year on yields losses across our fleet is a rounding error. So we believe that we can effect a sustainable business in China over time. We're going to make practical economic decisions, our assets are mobile. And because it's such a small percentage, even in the future when we start looking at adding additional ships above our overall capacity, we can move a few ships around and manage things effectively through smart deployment. Having said that, for next year, right now, we see good relationships with our distributor partners and an ability to extract value. Hopefully, it will be proportionate to the capacity increase or greater. But at this point, we haven't finalized those conversations. It's too early to give real guidance."

So it is important to us. So the impact was this, in the cases when things got a little dicey in Istanbul and in Turkey, we, obviously, had to make deployment itinerary changes. So again, generally speaking, we go where guests want to go and we go, obviously where, all the information we have says, it's okay to go, it's safe to go, because safety is number 1, obviously. And so we -- how it affects us is we make itinerary deployment changes, either because guests don't want to go or because we've gotten intelligence in the world community that it's wiser not to go, it affects us that way. Initially, we can see booking impacts right after the incident. Those tend to fade away. As you know, if you go back over years, this is not a year where this is the only time this has happened, and it happens to some extent almost -- in recent times -- almost every year for the last several years, as does a Zika or a MERS or Asian flu, whatever it is these things, Ebola even. And so every year, there's geopolitical tensions, there's some kind of disease consternation, there's macroeconomic malaise, there's isolated or concentrated overcapacity in the cruise industry every year and in some markets around the world, those things happen. And it's part of our business. So we manage that, we anticipate it. We change deployments. We do good revenue management practices, manage around it and that's basically it. So to us, it's normal business. I wish it wasn't that way. Every now and then, hopefully, we'll get lucky and there won't be those incidents, because we think we would do better. Some of those itineraries we had to redirect are high-yielding, short excursion items which could have added additional revenue and earnings to the bottom line. We used to be in the Black Sea, we haven't been there quite a while. The Black Sea was one of the highest yielding, both from a ticket standpoint and onboard revenue standpoint, the itineraries we could've had. And so hopefully, sometimes, those things will work in our favor and we'll do even better. But right now, we expect that stuff to happen every year, and we have to manage it, and we have to deliver double-digit return invested capital in those environments."

And you've got to do your best to sort all that out when you don't have total transparency to the ultimate price that the Chinese guest that was on the ship paid. We tried to get at that various ways, but, of course, others tried to make certain we can't get to that information. And that's on -- it's just a business, normal in business. You can think of other constructs in other places where a manufacturer sells to a distributor and may not know exactly what the distributor priced that and so on in any other market, in any other industry. So that's the nature of the business today. Over time, that'll probably evolve to a different model, but that's what it is today."

But on the other hand, as I tried to point out earlier in the call in some of the questions, China is going to be limited in how many ships are going to be available for it to take, because people are building ships for other markets as well. I think what you have to think about is in that capacity growth. So we're always going to build new ships and so will others. And the reason is because the ships are more efficient, okay? And they give you the opportunity for enhanced revenue opportunity versus the existing ships. And so new ships are always going to be coming. The question is, how many ships leave? How many ships go to secondary markets and so on? And in the opening comments, I referenced the fact that the number of berths that are getting to retirement, the amount of capacity that's getting to retirement age is going to double in 2020 and it's going to double again in 2024. And so there will be a need for some of that capacity just to replace. And then the rest will get regulated by the marketplace. If there's scarce supply relative to demand, some of the less efficient ships will continue to sell. If there's not that relative scarcity, then some of those ships will exit. They'll either go into secondary markets or they'll leave the fleet and be scrapped. And so that's the real dynamic. We know what we're going to do. We are committed to measure capacity growth, and we know how to manage within our brands and across the various destinations. And so based on that, we have great confidence that we'll be able to manage to the sustained double-digit return on invested capital that we have promised within the next 2 years."

I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; David",1483,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Before I begin, as always, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
We delivered the strongest second quarter in the history of our company with record adjusted earnings per share nearly double the prior year and well above the high end of our March guidance range. The second quarter results combined with our strong booked position has enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our full year guidance range despite a $0.17 drag from fuel and currency. Essentially, the strength and underlying demand for our products fostered greater ticket prices in both the quarter and in the remainder of the year, offsetting the rise in fuel prices since the time of our last guidance as well as the very recent significant movements in currency exchange rates following the Brexit vote.
Our record results reflect our passionate 120,000-plus employees, who in their efforts go above and beyond every day and who together with our hundreds of thousands of travel partners are the foundation of our sustained earnings improvement.
This was among the most remarkable quarters in the history of the company not only because of our record-breaking financial results but because of a significant number of milestones which will contribute meaningfully to our future success.
We introduced 3 new flagships, including Carnival Vista, purposely designed for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guest with an onboard brewery experience, entertaining IMAX theater and exhilarating SkyRide experience. Carnival Vista has already generated over 1 billion media impressions. Holland America Line's Koningsdam, christened in Rotterdam by Her Majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands delivers a new premium experience where our guests can blend their own wine, enjoy high-end slice [ph] of scotch or dance the night away in our carefully engineered Music Walk. And last but not least, the AIDAprima made its debut with a spectacular light show, fireworks and memorable naming ceremony witnessed by over 1 million people gathered in Hamburg. These well-publicized introductions are certain to continue to stimulate increased consideration for cruising within our portfolio of the world's leading cruise lines.
Moreover, we welcomed our 10th brand, Fathom, in April, with the inaugural impact sailing to the Dominican Republic to do good [ph], followed by a historic first sailing for Cuba in May. Bar none, one of the most publicized events in the history of the cruise industry was our inaugural voyage to Cuba, with over 20 billion media impressions, bringing the cumulative total media impressions for Carnival and Cuba to nearly 55 billion to date. We could not have been more proud than when our General Counsel Arnie Perez and his wife Carmen, both Cuban born, were first to disembark when we made history as the first U.S. cruise line in more than 40 years to sail for Cuba. Having sailed there myself, I can assure you there is no better way to experience Cuba today than on our Fathom brand. We are working hard to enable more of our brands to bring guests to Cuba in the near future, a promising long-term driver of continued demand for our Caribbean itineraries.
Indeed, we have had an eventful quarter.
Returning to the financials.
China, which is definitely the world's largest cruise market, continues to deliver accretive returns on invested capital. We again achieved significant earnings growth this quarter and continue to fully expect earnings growth for the full year directionally proportionate with our over 60% capacity increase. In China, our occupancy levels remain comparable to the high levels we have consistently achieved as we introduced hundreds of thousands of new-to-cruise to our brands. Yes, the penetration level for this sizable and rapidly expanding addressable market is well below 1%, just a fraction of the more developed cruise markets. While these guests sail mostly within Asia today, over time, we have an opportunity to take them to all the great destinations our ships sailed and they have not yet been, like the unique beauty of Venice and the amazing glaciers in Glacier Bay, Alaska.
We remain confident in the long-term development of the cruise industry in China, with our capacity growth expected to be up over 30% in 2017. Now that's following the over 60% increase observed in 2016. These large year-over-year percentage increases are on a very small base, so these growth rates are an equivalent to adding about one 4,000-berth vessel each year. As a result, China represents less than 5% of our global capacity this year and will grow to just 6% next year after the entry of Majestic Princess, the first purpose-built ship for Chinese guests; and AIDAbella, the first ship in China for our AIDA brand. Of course, the capacity shift to China helps create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. We remain confident in the outlook for measured supply growth. In 2017, our global supply growth is just 2.7%.
Within that, we are rebalancing our portfolio to optimize the current demand environment. We expect a 5% capacity reduction in Europe, stemming from a capacity reduction in the Mediterranean region which is down over 10%. We expect a modest 5% and 3% growth in capacity in the more robust Caribbean and Alaska deployments, respectively. On the margin, these deployment changes should contribute to yield next year.
During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues; and as previously noted, will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory across 6 of our brands this summer. We are on track to begin prototype testing in July. Even the early stage of implementation will foster yield uplift as we refine our modeling techniques to contribute to enhanced demand forecasting. So as most of this year's bookings will be behind us by the summer, we continue to expect a greater contribution from this effort in 2017.
And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We remain on track for our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. Most recently, we announced a strategic coordination of our global media planning and buying for our 7 brands in North America and the U.K., generating a significant double-digit savings on our $100 million annual media spend.
Our record quarterly results and our strong booked position are a testament to the success of our ongoing strategy to drive demand well in excess of our measured capacity growth. All things considered, bookings for our ships sailing to Europe has held up well. And bookings in the Caribbean and Alaska for the remainder of the year are very strong for our brands, enabling us to raise our revenue yield expectations and affirming our conviction to deliver over 20% earnings growth this year.
We are on track for the delivery of nearly 9% return on invested capital this year and remain well on track in accelerating progress towards a double-digit threshold, again given our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of supply, coupled with our revenue management enhancements and opportunity to further leverage our scale. Despite the geopolitical events in Europe, including the Brexit vote, we remain confident in our long-term outlook given the attractive value proposition our strong and diversified brand portfolio offers, particularly in the U.K. where our local brands P&O Cruises and Cunard, sold in British pounds, have an increasingly competitive advantage to land-based vacation alternatives in Europe and abroad.
Our increasingly strong cash flow enables us to accelerate distributions to our shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we're nearing completion on our second $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the cumulative total of repurchases to date to approximately $1.9 billion and 38 million shares. In addition, recently, we announced our second dividend increase inside of a year, bringing our annual dividend distribution to over $1 billion. We plan to continue to return free cash flow and more to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our targeted range. Our sustained earnings improvement, coupled with our strong balance sheet, has resulted in Moody's upgrading our credit rating from Baa1 to A3; and just yesterday, our Board of Directors authorizing our third $1 billion share repurchase program, all of which demonstrate continued confidence in the realization of sustained double-digit return on invested capital, which our company is inherently capable of delivering.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."
258823,367121095,2059823,"Carnival Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2016",2016-06-28,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold.Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results. Then I'll provide som",1130,"Thank you, Arnold.
Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends and finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance.
Our record adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $0.49. This was $0.13 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: $0.05 from net revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings at our North American brands; and $0.06 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters.
Now let's look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 2%. The North American brands were flat, while the European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 5%. Our total net revenue yields were up 3.6%. Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.5%. The increase was driven by our North American brands' deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska. Net onboard and other yields increased almost 4%, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic, mainly related to bar and casino. Net cruise costs per ALBD, excluding fuel, were down almost 2%, which is about a 3-point improvement versus what was planned in our March guidance, but again this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.
In summary, our record second quarter adjusted EPS was almost double the prior year or $0.24 higher, driven by operational improvements worth $0.18, a favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04 and share buyback accretion worth $0.02.
Now let's turn to booking trends. Since March, bookings for the remainder of the year are at higher prices, with less inventory remaining for sale than at the same time last year. At this point in time, for the remaining 2 quarters of 2016, cumulative bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we are well ahead on the booked position with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, even with our capacity increase, bodes well for pricing over the next few months.
Now let's drill down into the cumulative booked position. First, for our North American brands, Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year also at nicely higher prices. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at lower prices driven by geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance. Secondly, for our EAA brands: For Europe, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our previous guidance. As expected, we are behind on pricing given our 60% increase in China capacity and our 15% increase in Australia capacity.
For 2017, we continue to move out the booking curve. At this point in time, for the first 3 quarters of 2017, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at prices that are in line with 2016. And recent trends have been very positive with robust booking activity at slightly higher prices. These are early indications for 2017, and I do caution you not to read too much into these trends.
Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our second quarter results, combined with a strong booked position, enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our previous guidance range. This is actually a $0.17 improvement offset by a $0.17 drag from fuel prices and currency.
Our 2016 June guidance is $3.25 to $3.35. The $0.17 improvement compared to our March guidance was essentially driven by 3 things: one, improved net revenue yields worth $0.10, $0.05 of which was achieved in the second quarter and an additional $0.05 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the remainder of the year; second, lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, worth $0.03; and third, the accretive impact from the additional shares we purchased since our March guidance call worth $0.03.
Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are now expected to be up approximately 1.5% for 2016, 0.5 points better than our March guidance. Remember that while the yield is expected to be up approximately 1.5%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5 points, while the second quarter was down almost 2%. However, as I mentioned during the last earnings call and taking into account the reseasonalization of our planned second quarter costs into the second half of the year, we expect third quarter net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD to be up 6% to 7%, driven by the timing of advertising expense and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock. The expectation for the fourth quarter is that costs will be flat.
At the midpoint of our June guidance, net cash provided by operating activities is approaching $5 billion. As Arnold indicated, with such strong cash flows since late last year, we repurchased approximately 38 million of our shares, and our Board of Directors authorized a third $1 billion stock buyback program yesterday. In addition, we still have about $100 million remaining on our second $1 billion stock buyback authorization.
Our June guidance EPS calculations assumes shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculations assume approximately 750 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while for the third quarter, the calculations assume 743 million shares outstanding.
On a final note, given the volatility of FX rates since the Brexit vote, we want to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2016 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.18 for the remainder of the year and $0.09 for the third quarter. For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current spot price represents a $0.07 impact for the remainder of the year and $0.04 for the third quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is about $920 million for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.03 change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the remainder of the year and $0.02 for the third quarter.
And now I'll turn it back over to Arnold."

And as we said, we'll be pretty much booked by the end of the summer, so most of the impact of this initial phase, we'll see next year. And then into next year, we'll add some additional features which will bring in the rest of the brands as well and we'll be able to max out going to 2018 from the tool itself and the better management skills that our people will develop from being able to utilize this tool and being able to see things in a more timely and being able to respond in a more rapid fashion.

While the percentages sound so large, it's the equivalent of moving one additional ship down to a market that in time is going to be far larger than the North American market and could be as large proportionally as the entire global cruise market is right now. So while there may be some bumps and temporary discontinuities as distributors ramp up with their own personnel to move the volume of cruise, because a lot of those distributors sell other type of travel products, obviously. And there might be some bumps along those lines. Overall, China remains a robust opportunity, and we're still at the very, very beginning of it. So I don't see that. You're going to have some negotiations going on. Everybody wants a better price. It is a B2B business almost now. And of course, there'll be negotiations, trying to get lower price so they can get better returns or what-have-you, but overall things are very good. The cruise product that we offer is well received and excellent. We're going to have our first purpose-built ship, the Majestic Princess, going in next year. She is being met with very, very positive response by the distributors already. And we have our first ship for AIDA, as I mentioned, going in next year. And then we have our base for Costa and the rest of the Princess, but on balance, it's the equivalent of adding one ship. And so we'll be going from 5% of our capacity to 6% of our capacity, which is not very large at all even with the industry moving in a few additional ships and stuff that can be managed.

So yes, a lot of the capacity growths you're going to see, as you've already identified, is targeted in China, which means the rest of the market, rest of the world, the other 95% of today's capacity is not seeing very much growth; and that things change for whatever reasons, which we don't anticipate, but if they were to change, we can easily modify and adapt and change our replenishment strategy. We will always want the new ships because they're more efficient, more cost effective. And so you'd always want the new ships, and you would look at the timing of moving out the ships that are less efficient and not generating returns."

Onboard revenues have grown every year in the cruise industry, except -- and for us, our onboard revenues have grown every year, except 1 year in the whole history of the time we've been in the business, and so that we can look back to in time. And that's in all kinds of environments, recessionary environments, crises environments, everything. So underpenetrated, big base of people who already want a cruise, great dynamics. It's hard to say, but I don't anticipate acceleration of retirements of ships. But the point is we have mobile assets.

I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Before I begin, as always, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.
We delivered the strongest second quarter in the history of our company with record adjusted earnings per share nearly double the prior year and well above the high end of our March guidance range. The second quarter results combined with our strong booked position has enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our full year guidance range despite a $0.17 drag from fuel and currency. Essentially, the strength and underlying demand for our products fostered greater ticket prices in both the quarter and in the remainder of the year, offsetting the rise in fuel prices since the time of our last guidance as well as the very recent significant movements in currency exchange rates following the Brexit vote.
Our record results reflect our passionate 120,000-plus employees, who in their efforts go above and beyond every day and who together with our hundreds of thousands of travel partners are the foundation of our sustained earnings improvement.
This was among the most remarkable quarters in the history of the company not only because of our record-breaking financial results but because of a significant number of milestones which will contribute meaningfully to our future success.
We introduced 3 new flagships, including Carnival Vista, purposely designed for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guest with an onboard brewery experience, entertaining IMAX theater and exhilarating SkyRide experience. Carnival Vista has already generated over 1 billion media impressions. Holland America Line's Koningsdam, christened in Rotterdam by Her Majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands delivers a new premium experience where our guests can blend their own wine, enjoy high-end slice [ph] of scotch or dance the night away in our carefully engineered Music Walk. And last but not least, the AIDAprima made its debut with a spectacular light show, fireworks and memorable naming ceremony witnessed by over 1 million people gathered in Hamburg. These well-publicized introductions are certain to continue to stimulate increased consideration for cruising within our portfolio of the world's leading cruise lines.
Moreover, we welcomed our 10th brand, Fathom, in April, with the inaugural impact sailing to the Dominican Republic to do good [ph], followed by a historic first sailing for Cuba in May. Bar none, one of the most publicized events in the history of the cruise industry was our inaugural voyage to Cuba, with over 20 billion media impressions, bringing the cumulative total media impressions for Carnival and Cuba to nearly 55 billion to date. We could not have been more proud than when our General Counsel Arnie Perez and his wife Carmen, both Cuban born, were first to disembark when we made history as the first U.S. cruise line in more than 40 years to sail for Cuba. Having sailed there myself, I can assure you there is no better way to experience Cuba today than on our Fathom brand. We are working hard to enable more of our brands to bring guests to Cuba in the near future, a promising long-term driver of continued demand for our Caribbean itineraries.
Indeed, we have had an eventful quarter.
Returning to the financials.
China, which is definitely the world's largest cruise market, continues to deliver accretive returns on invested capital. We again achieved significant earnings growth this quarter and continue to fully expect earnings growth for the full year directionally proportionate with our over 60% capacity increase. In China, our occupancy levels remain comparable to the high levels we have consistently achieved as we introduced hundreds of thousands of new-to-cruise to our brands. Yes, the penetration level for this sizable and rapidly expanding addressable market is well below 1%, just a fraction of the more developed cruise markets. While these guests sail mostly within Asia today, over time, we have an opportunity to take them to all the great destinations our ships sailed and they have not yet been, like the unique beauty of Venice and the amazing glaciers in Glacier Bay, Alaska.
We remain confident in the long-term development of the cruise industry in China, with our capacity growth expected to be up over 30% in 2017. Now that's following the over 60% increase observed in 2016. These large year-over-year percentage increases are on a very small base, so these growth rates are an equivalent to adding about one 4,000-berth vessel each year. As a result, China represents less than 5% of our global capacity this year and will grow to just 6% next year after the entry of Majestic Princess, the first purpose-built ship for Chinese guests; and AIDAbella, the first ship in China for our AIDA brand. Of course, the capacity shift to China helps create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. We remain confident in the outlook for measured supply growth. In 2017, our global supply growth is just 2.7%.
Within that, we are rebalancing our portfolio to optimize the current demand environment. We expect a 5% capacity reduction in Europe, stemming from a capacity reduction in the Mediterranean region which is down over 10%. We expect a modest 5% and 3% growth in capacity in the more robust Caribbean and Alaska deployments, respectively. On the margin, these deployment changes should contribute to yield next year.
During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues; and as previously noted, will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory across 6 of our brands this summer. We are on track to begin prototype testing in July. Even the early stage of implementation will foster yield uplift as we refine our modeling techniques to contribute to enhanced demand forecasting. So as most of this year's bookings will be behind us by the summer, we continue to expect a greater contribution from this effort in 2017.
And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We remain on track for our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. Most recently, we announced a strategic coordination of our global media planning and buying for our 7 brands in North America and the U.K., generating a significant double-digit savings on our $100 million annual media spend.
Our record quarterly results and our strong booked position are a testament to the success of our ongoing strategy to drive demand well in excess of our measured capacity growth. All things considered, bookings for our ships sailing to Europe has held up well. And bookings in the Caribbean and Alaska for the remainder of the year are very strong for our brands, enabling us to raise our revenue yield expectations and affirming our conviction to deliver over 20% earnings growth this year.
We are on track for the delivery of nearly 9% return on invested capital this year and remain well on track in accelerating progress towards a double-digit threshold, again given our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of supply, coupled with our revenue management enhancements and opportunity to further leverage our scale. Despite the geopolitical events in Europe, including the Brexit vote, we remain confident in our long-term outlook given the attractive value proposition our strong and diversified brand portfolio offers, particularly in the U.K. where our local brands P&O Cruises and Cunard, sold in British pounds, have an increasingly competitive advantage to land-based vacation alternatives in Europe and abroad.
Our increasingly strong cash flow enables us to accelerate distributions to our shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we're nearing completion on our second $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the cumulative total of repurchases to date to approximately $1.9 billion and 38 million shares. In addition, recently, we announced our second dividend increase inside of a year, bringing our annual dividend distribution to over $1 billion. We plan to continue to return free cash flow and more to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our targeted range. Our sustained earnings improvement, coupled with our strong balance sheet, has resulted in Moody's upgrading our credit rating from Baa1 to A3; and just yesterday, our Board of Directors authorizing our third $1 billion share repurchase program, all of which demonstrate continued confidence in the realization of sustained double-digit return on invested capital, which our company is inherently capable of delivering.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."
258823,367121095,2059824,"Carnival Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2016",2016-06-28,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, Arnold.Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results. Then I'll provide som",1130,"Thank you, Arnold.
Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends and finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance.
Our record adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $0.49. This was $0.13 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: $0.05 from net revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings at our North American brands; and $0.06 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters.
Now let's look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 2%. The North American brands were flat, while the European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 5%. Our total net revenue yields were up 3.6%. Now let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.5%. The increase was driven by our North American brands' deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska. Net onboard and other yields increased almost 4%, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic, mainly related to bar and casino. Net cruise costs per ALBD, excluding fuel, were down almost 2%, which is about a 3-point improvement versus what was planned in our March guidance, but again this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.
In summary, our record second quarter adjusted EPS was almost double the prior year or $0.24 higher, driven by operational improvements worth $0.18, a favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04 and share buyback accretion worth $0.02.
Now let's turn to booking trends. Since March, bookings for the remainder of the year are at higher prices, with less inventory remaining for sale than at the same time last year. At this point in time, for the remaining 2 quarters of 2016, cumulative bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we are well ahead on the booked position with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, even with our capacity increase, bodes well for pricing over the next few months.
Now let's drill down into the cumulative booked position. First, for our North American brands, Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year also at nicely higher prices. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at lower prices driven by geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance. Secondly, for our EAA brands: For Europe, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our previous guidance. As expected, we are behind on pricing given our 60% increase in China capacity and our 15% increase in Australia capacity.
For 2017, we continue to move out the booking curve. At this point in time, for the first 3 quarters of 2017, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at prices that are in line with 2016. And recent trends have been very positive with robust booking activity at slightly higher prices. These are early indications for 2017, and I do caution you not to read too much into these trends.
Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our second quarter results, combined with a strong booked position, enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our previous guidance range. This is actually a $0.17 improvement offset by a $0.17 drag from fuel prices and currency.
Our 2016 June guidance is $3.25 to $3.35. The $0.17 improvement compared to our March guidance was essentially driven by 3 things: one, improved net revenue yields worth $0.10, $0.05 of which was achieved in the second quarter and an additional $0.05 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the remainder of the year; second, lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, worth $0.03; and third, the accretive impact from the additional shares we purchased since our March guidance call worth $0.03.
Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are now expected to be up approximately 1.5% for 2016, 0.5 points better than our March guidance. Remember that while the yield is expected to be up approximately 1.5%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5 points, while the second quarter was down almost 2%. However, as I mentioned during the last earnings call and taking into account the reseasonalization of our planned second quarter costs into the second half of the year, we expect third quarter net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD to be up 6% to 7%, driven by the timing of advertising expense and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock. The expectation for the fourth quarter is that costs will be flat.
At the midpoint of our June guidance, net cash provided by operating activities is approaching $5 billion. As Arnold indicated, with such strong cash flows since late last year, we repurchased approximately 38 million of our shares, and our Board of Directors authorized a third $1 billion stock buyback program yesterday. In addition, we still have about $100 million remaining on our second $1 billion stock buyback authorization.
Our June guidance EPS calculations assumes shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculations assume approximately 750 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while for the third quarter, the calculations assume 743 million shares outstanding.
On a final note, given the volatility of FX rates since the Brexit vote, we want to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2016 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.18 for the remainder of the year and $0.09 for the third quarter. For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current spot price represents a $0.07 impact for the remainder of the year and $0.04 for the third quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is about $920 million for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.03 change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the remainder of the year and $0.02 for the third quarter.
And now I'll turn it back over to Arnold."

And then into next year, we'll add some additional features which will bring in the rest of the brands as well and we'll be able to max out going to 2018 from the tool itself and the better management skills that our people will develop from being able to utilize this tool and being able to see things in a more timely and being able to respond in a more rapid fashion.

While the percentages sound so large, it's the equivalent of moving one additional ship down to a market that in time is going to be far larger than the North American market and could be as large proportionally as the entire global cruise market is right now. So while there may be some bumps and temporary discontinuities as distributors ramp up with their own personnel to move the volume of cruise, because a lot of those distributors sell other type of travel products, obviously. And there might be some bumps along those lines. Overall, China remains a robust opportunity, and we're still at the very, very beginning of it. So I don't see that. You're going to have some negotiations going on. Everybody wants a better price. It is a B2B business almost now. And of course, there'll be negotiations, trying to get lower price so they can get better returns or what-have-you, but overall things are very good. The cruise product that we offer is well received and excellent. We're going to have our first purpose-built ship, the Majestic Princess, going in next year. She is being met with very, very positive response by the distributors already. And we have our first ship for AIDA, as I mentioned, going in next year. And then we have our base for Costa and the rest of the Princess, but on balance, it's the equivalent of adding one ship. And so we'll be going from 5% of our capacity to 6% of our capacity, which is not very large at all even with the industry moving in a few additional ships and stuff that can be managed.

Onboard revenues have grown every year in the cruise industry, except -- and for us, our onboard revenues have grown every year, except 1 year in the whole history of the time we've been in the business, and so that we can look back to in time. And that's in all kinds of environments, recessionary environments, crises environments, everything. So underpenetrated, big base of people who already want a cruise, great dynamics. It's hard to say, but I don't anticipate acceleration of retirements of ships. But the point is we have mobile assets.

This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, via",1672,"Good morning, everyone and welcome to our First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. 
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, via phone from Italy; as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, who heads up our Investor Relations, here with me in Miami. 
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking, therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. 
Our company is off to a strong start this year, with first quarter adjusted earnings nearly double the prior year and well above the high end of our December guidance range. The first quarter result, combined with our strong booked position, has enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our full year earnings expectations. 
I'm proud to acknowledge all of our employees globally for the industry-leading guest experience efforts that are central to our sustained earnings improvement. I especially thank our travel agent partners for the critical role they play in connecting guests with our great brand experience. 
It was reinforcing to see revenue yield growth of 5.7% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit yield improvement. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements in our core Caribbean itinerary, which represents 47% of our first quarter deployment. We drove revenue yield growth at Costa by creating relative scarcity through our brand team success and increasing demand via our ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with new impactful creative featuring Shakira. While at the same time, we reduced supply in the more challenging trading environment in Southern Europe by transferring Costa capacity to China. 
As you recall, our Costa brand was the first global cruise line to home port in China back in 2006. Today, we are the largest in China and the first global cruise company with 6 ships based there across 2 of our brands, Costa and Princess, representing nearly half of the Chinese cruise industry. 
While it represents less than 5% of our global capacity, for us, China continues to be a promising unit growth opportunity. China has quickly become the world's largest outbound travel market at an estimated 135 million strong, yet just over 1 million cruise today. We expect to continue to grow over time and have further plans for AIDA and Carnival Cruise Lines to enter China in the near future. 
China contributed to our strong quarterly results. We absorb over 60% more capacity there and enjoy strong profit improvement and return on invested capital accretion. At the same time, the capacity shift to China helped create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. 
Beyond China during the quarter, we made further progress globally in creating demand for all of our brands in excess of measured capacity growth. Part of that demand creation is the excitement around the much anticipated delivery of AIDAprima. And I can tell you, she is well worth the wait. The ship is absolutely fantastic. The first of the next-generation platform for AIDA that combines leading-edge environmental attributes and well-designed features that foster an exceptional guest experience. 
All of our features, whether racing water slides, a lazy river, multiple climbing walls, an expansive German spa, an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling and even a traditional Christmas market, together, create an experience that truly resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests. 
And we have additional opportunity for demand creation in just a few short days with the delivery of Holland America's new flagship, Koningsdam. Koningsdam was designed with our Holland America guest in mind and to reintroduce Holland America to those who have yet to experience our award-winning service, our 5-star dining, our extensive enrichment program and compelling worldwide itineraries. 
Our new flagship will offer fine dining in several alternative restaurants, including a new French seafood brasserie and a new immersive farm-to-table dinner experience in the Culinary Arts Center. 
Part of enhancing an already great Holland America guest experience includes taking onboard entertainment to a whole new level. We have carefully engineered a Music Walk area which showcases different genres, offering chamber music in Lincoln Center Stage, rocking the crowd with chart-topping hits in Billboard Onboard and bringing the best of Memphis music to sea in our popular B.B. King's Blues Club. 
Responding to our guests, our new flagship will feature Holland America Lines first ever purpose-built staterooms for families as well as single staterooms. 
Newbuilds will also provide additional demand creation opportunities later this year as well, with the delivery of Carnival Vista followed by Seabourn Encore. When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to stimulate demand creation. We continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent recreation of Holland America's Eurodam, incorporating many of the same experiences on board as Koningsdam. In addition, we are undergoing an extensive remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 later this year. 
Destinations are often a powerful tool for demand creation as well, especially when combined with the effect of public relations. Last week, we made history when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 50 years to receive Cuban approval to bring U.S. cruise guests directly from the U.S. to Cuba. 
We made worldwide news, showcasing cruise in a very positive light, with nearly 5 billion media impressions and still counting. We very much look forward to launching our historic Cuba inaugural season in May with fathom, initially with itineraries including Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. We believe there is no better way to experience so much of Cuba in 7 days than with the enriching guest experience on our premium fathom brand. 
As the Adonia carries just 700 guests per sailing, if you have any interest in seeing Cuba through an extraordinary fathom experience, I sincerely recommend you book now. 
Concerning the future of cruises in Cuba, we have already begun the process for approval for other brands to sail for Cuba in the months and years ahead. 
Now beyond ships and destinations, our ongoing marketing and promotional efforts are also part of demand creation. As part of our effort to keep cruise in the forefront of vacationers' minds, Princess is airing a new reality-based show on prime-time U.K. television entitled The Cruise. The documentary follows the lives of our amazing crew and guests on board Regal Princess through a 6-week series. In fact, we've already seen a 40% increase in web traffic for Princess in the U.K. since the show began airing. 
Also airing in the U.K., P&O Cruises' Battlechefs, a new cookery concept set at sea on board Britannia, featuring 5 celebrities testing their culinary skills and judged by celebrity chef Marco Pierre White. 
In Italy, Costa Fortuna was the set of a major motion picture, [Foreign Language], Holidays in the Caribbean, launched early in the quarter, partially cast with Costa crew members. More recently, an episode on Italian reality TV, I Colori Dell'amore [ph], The Colors of Love, was based on the love story between 2 young Costa crew members who met on board. 
In North America, just last week, Carnival Cruise Lines was featured nightly on the ever-popular television show, Wheel of Fortune. While early in the quarter, Carnival announced an exceptional partnership with Grammy award-winning country music superstar Carrie Underwood, and Operation Homefront, supporting our U.S. military personnel. Media coverage from that announcement alone generated more than 1 billion media impressions, and our Carnival brand continues to outperform. 
Also in North America, we partnered with AT&T and Samsung to create a virtual reality experience that showcased in nearly 1,200 AT&T stores, promoting consideration for cruise by allowing new-to-cruise to virtually experience a cruise vacation. We estimate nearly 400,000 people have already have the virtually reality experience, showcasing our portfolio of leading brands. All of these efforts heighten global awareness and consideration for our world-leading cruise lines as we continue to capture a greater share of the vacation suitcase. 
During the quarter, we continued to make progress on cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues, and in summer of 2016, will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory. The prototype will foster yield uplift as well as inspire improvements for final system development. Since most of this year's bookings will be behind us by the summer, we look forward to a greater contribution on this effort in 2017. 
And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We have negotiations underway on 16 separate purchasing categories, with 22 more RFPs outstanding, all of which will contribute to our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. 
Our ongoing operational improvement is a testament of the success of our combined efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth and to leverage our scale. The strong first quarter we have enjoyed affirms our conviction to deliver this year's earnings forecast and accelerates progress toward double-digit return on invested capital. We remain well on track for the delivery of over 8.5% return on invested capital this year and crossing the double-digit threshold in the next 2 to 3 years. At the same time, we have accelerated our return of capital to shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we have completed our first $1 million share repurchase authorization and are well into our second billion, bringing the cumulative total of purchase to date to $1.3 billion and approximately 27 million shares. We plan to continue to return free cash flow to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our target range. 
And now, I will turn the call over to David."

Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.

Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends. And finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. 
Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.39. This was $0.09 above the midpoint of our December guidance despite a $0.01 drag from fuel and currency. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: $0.07 from net ticket revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic; and $0.03 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters. 
Now let's turn to the first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. Our total net revenue yields were up 5.7%. 
Let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up almost 7%. As Arnold indicated, we enjoyed ticket price improvements on both sides of the Atlantic. The increase was driven by the strength of pricing in the Caribbean, which represented 47% of our capacity in the quarter. In addition, our European, Australian and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, saw solid price improvements on their year-round European programs. 
Onboard and other yields increased almost 3%, in line with December guidance. The increase was mainly related to bar, casino and communications as our efforts in these areas continued to pay dividends. Net cruise costs per ALBD, excluding fuel, were up about 1.5%, which was less than planned in our December guidance, again due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. 
In summary, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.19 higher than the prior year, driven by operational improvements worth $0.15 and favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.03. 
Now let's turn to booking trends for 2016. Bookings during this year's wave season was strong. Volumes are ahead of last year's historically high level at higher prices. At this point in time, for the remaining 3 quarters of 2016, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we're well ahead on the booked position, with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, bodes well for pricing over the next few months. 
Now let's drill down into the cumulative fleet-wide booked position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year, also at nicely higher prices. 2015 was a great Alaskan season and I'm happy to say 2016 is shaping up to be even better. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is nicely ahead of the prior year at lower prices, driven by the geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands, for Europe, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our prior guidance. While we are behind on pricing, and not surprisingly behind on percentage occupancy given our over 60% increase in China capacity and our significant increase in Australia capacity, remember, Asia and particularly China, is a unit growth opportunity and we are achieving strong unit profits and returns that exceed our corporate average. 
Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our first quarter results, combined with strong booked position, enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our earnings expectations for the year. Our 2016 March guidance is now $3.20 to $3.40. The $0.05 improvement was driven by improved net revenue yields worth $0.04 and the accretive impact from the additional shares we repurchased since our December call, worth $0.05. These improvements were partially offset by a $0.04 drag from fuel and currency. 
Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are still expected to be up approximately 2%, no change from our December guidance. While we were favorable to the guidance in the first quarter, as I previously indicated, the favorability was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. 
Remember that while the year is expected to be up approximately 2%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5% while the guidance for the second quarter is expected to be up only 0.5% to 1.5%. However, for the third quarter, we expect net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD to be up 5% to 6%, driven by the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock and higher advertising expense. Offsetting that, however, is the expectation that cost will be down slightly in the fourth quarter. 
So far this fiscal year, we have repurchased over 21 million of our shares and we still have almost $700 million left under the second $1 billion share repurchase authorization that was approved by the Board of Directors just 2 months ago. Our March guidance EPS calculation assume approximately 760 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis. 
On a final note, for your planning purposes, I wanted to let you know that we expect our June conference call to be a little later in June than usual to allow some extra time for quarter-end reconciliation and analysis, given that we are currently in the process of implementing a significant upgrade to our Oracle enterprise reporting platform, which includes moving to a single instance of the general ledger as we further leverage our scale. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Arnold."

Are you saying that pricing is still higher in China than the rest of the world? You are adding capacity in China and that -- this is a unit growth story. I wanted to understand those 2 things. So to me, it sounds like almost like you're simply adding more capacity at a higher price relative to the rest of the fleet, but that the pricing maybe is not as high as it was maybe last year, is that what you're saying? And then one other thing on this China opportunity, which I think gets outsize attention because it really is a huge opportunity and is a big pricing opportunity too, is how were the travel agents doing in that market? Is there anything we can read from them and their reaction to the capacity that is coming?"

You probably noticed that overall, we -- for the year, we were $2 -- our guidance is $2 per metric ton better.

Of course, you had -- we have a little benefit there. We had -- offsetting that was some additional derivative losses. So the overall fuel number was negligible in terms of a change from our December guidance. Currency did move against us. And remember, we have a basket of currencies. So it depends on the movement. The one currency from December through March that moved the most was the British pound. And if you look back, we were using $1.51 as the rate for the British pound back in December. The rate now, I think, in our press release in the second quarter was like $1.43. So there was like a 5% movement. So depending on what you're looking at, because of the different basket of currencies and the movements, the British pound is the biggest impact. And that was a negative impact on our bottom line.

Obviously, that will ramp up over time and we'll have more inventory that goes through it. By the time it's up and running, '16 will be pretty much booked. And so the real impact, we won't see until '17. But I have to tell you, we are enjoying some benefits now just from the brands collaborating, working on the tool together, sharing lots of information. There's improved decision-making going on, on revenue management all along the way and is definitely contributing to some of the yield improvement that we have enjoyed the past few quarters and including this past quarter. So over time, when we go to the next phase of the tool, which will be implemented next year, pretty much all the brands will be using the tool. We have some brands that have already more sophisticated tools than others. And this tool, the baseload, it will be at one level of sophistication.

Because once they go on the ships and experience the brand, the difference is dramatic and you very much get a very different feel from 1 brand to the next in terms of what type of cruise experience it is. And because those brands resonate around the world across different, what we call, psychographic segments, with 1.3 billion people, China is very capable of absorbing lots of different brands. And so we see it, at this stage, as we just have a toe in the water. There's 135 million estimated outbound Chinese tourists today already. And less than 1 million of them or roughly 1 million today are cruising today. So we haven't even touched, begun to touch the surface, hardly. So there's plenty of room and capacity. Our belief is that at the consuming level, at the guest level, that in the price ranges we're in, the guests today are relatively pricing elastic. Whether, I'm in Australia, I was in Cuba last week, the Mainland Chinese filled the paladar that I was in, the private restaurant in Havana I was in. And so they have money, they're able to travel. They're not exactly shopping for price. They fill up the retail outlets and spend several levels higher than the typical tourist would from other places in the world. So we don't see any major barriers at this point except, as you just referred, good communication, execution, training the distribution system, giving them the exposure they need so they can represent the various brands well. We think there's plenty of room for everybody, for several of our brands and we're going to bring AIDA in, in '17 and the Carnival brand right now is scheduled to go in, in '18."

First of all, in China, as you know, the industry, believe it or not, is capacity constrained because of the limited number of shipyards to build ships. And obviously, we've got partnerships with both Fincantieri and with Meyer in Germany in terms of securing slots to enhance our fleets. Having said that, in China, we can't grow too fast because we're just limited to the availability of ships. So we'll probably be, by 2020, somewhere in the 8% to 9% range of our fleet, which means most of the growth in capacity we have will actually be going to China. And that means that we'll be growing at a much slower rate in the rest of the world markets, 1% to 2% there. While a big percentage increase is in China, but in terms of absolute number of ships, still relatively small compared to the latent demand that exists in the country. So to answer your question, by 2020, depending on how things go -- and that's the beauty of this, we have flexibility. Depending on how things go, we could be 8%, 9% of our capacity in China. And that means therefore that we didn't grow a lot in the rest of the world. But that fits with our measured capacity growth overall plan to help create relative scarcity, and we continue to drive demand to create excess demand relative to that measured capacity, which obviously allows us to capture more of the value gap that currently exists between land-based vacations and cruise. We're still a much better value than land-based vacations, so we have lots of room to move. David?"

And it's -- whether it's mass media advertising, product placement advertising, digital, all the various forms of it. And PR, public relations efforts. So our belief is that we have to keep cruise out in the public space, in a positive way, on a constant basis. So that when people are considering vacation, there's been enough noise about cruise that they say, ""Well, I have an idea. Hey, let's look at a cruise."" And so the idea is to just keep it out there and that's utilizing all the various forms. There's no question, we have created incremental demand.

And we have tremendous respect for the other companies that operate. And we want them to be successful. We -- that's helps us a lot. The stronger they are, the better it is for us. So having said that, we have 10 brands. We have ultra-luxury in Seabourn. We have luxury in Cunard, both our Queen crew [ph] and Princess crew [ph]. We have Holland America on Neptune [ph]. We have premium brands in fathom, our newest premium brand. But obviously our long-established premium brands are Princess and Holland America and AIDA. And we have mass contemporary brands like Costa and Carnival. So we look at that. But again, the really important thing about cruise is this: We've had Steve Wozniak, who we pay to lecture on Seabourn. But he pays to go on Carnival, okay? Because it's not a demographic choice per se. We have taxi drivers who will save for 5 years to go on a Seabourn cruise and we have billionaires who want to sail on Carnival. And the reality is the experience that you're looking for. And each brand is a different experience, caters to a different psychographic market. So we have ultra-luxury brands, luxury brands, premium brands, et cetera, each with their own experience and that's what drives this for us. But for us, we're definitely looking at penetrating more land-based vacations because all the cabins in the world added up together represent less than -- in the industry, represent less than 2% of hotel rooms in the world. So that means there's 98% of the market to chase as opposed to 1% because -- of that 2%, 1% is ours already. So that's kind of our approach. 
Thank you very much. I really appreciate your questions. Thanks for your support. We look forward to talking to you guys next quarter and in between. And as always, feel free to call Beth with any additional questions or insights you might want to offer us. So thank you."

This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, via",1672,"Good morning, everyone and welcome to our First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. 
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, via phone from Italy; as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, who heads up our Investor Relations, here with me in Miami. 
Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward looking, therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. 
Our company is off to a strong start this year, with first quarter adjusted earnings nearly double the prior year and well above the high end of our December guidance range. The first quarter result, combined with our strong booked position, has enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our full year earnings expectations. 
I'm proud to acknowledge all of our employees globally for the industry-leading guest experience efforts that are central to our sustained earnings improvement. I especially thank our travel agent partners for the critical role they play in connecting guests with our great brand experience. 
It was reinforcing to see revenue yield growth of 5.7% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit yield improvement. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements in our core Caribbean itinerary, which represents 47% of our first quarter deployment. We drove revenue yield growth at Costa by creating relative scarcity through our brand team success and increasing demand via our ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with new impactful creative featuring Shakira. While at the same time, we reduced supply in the more challenging trading environment in Southern Europe by transferring Costa capacity to China. 
As you recall, our Costa brand was the first global cruise line to home port in China back in 2006. Today, we are the largest in China and the first global cruise company with 6 ships based there across 2 of our brands, Costa and Princess, representing nearly half of the Chinese cruise industry. 
While it represents less than 5% of our global capacity, for us, China continues to be a promising unit growth opportunity. China has quickly become the world's largest outbound travel market at an estimated 135 million strong, yet just over 1 million cruise today. We expect to continue to grow over time and have further plans for AIDA and Carnival Cruise Lines to enter China in the near future. 
China contributed to our strong quarterly results. We absorb over 60% more capacity there and enjoy strong profit improvement and return on invested capital accretion. At the same time, the capacity shift to China helped create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. 
Beyond China during the quarter, we made further progress globally in creating demand for all of our brands in excess of measured capacity growth. Part of that demand creation is the excitement around the much anticipated delivery of AIDAprima. And I can tell you, she is well worth the wait. The ship is absolutely fantastic. The first of the next-generation platform for AIDA that combines leading-edge environmental attributes and well-designed features that foster an exceptional guest experience. 
All of our features, whether racing water slides, a lazy river, multiple climbing walls, an expansive German spa, an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling and even a traditional Christmas market, together, create an experience that truly resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests. 
And we have additional opportunity for demand creation in just a few short days with the delivery of Holland America's new flagship, Koningsdam. Koningsdam was designed with our Holland America guest in mind and to reintroduce Holland America to those who have yet to experience our award-winning service, our 5-star dining, our extensive enrichment program and compelling worldwide itineraries. 
Our new flagship will offer fine dining in several alternative restaurants, including a new French seafood brasserie and a new immersive farm-to-table dinner experience in the Culinary Arts Center. 
Part of enhancing an already great Holland America guest experience includes taking onboard entertainment to a whole new level. We have carefully engineered a Music Walk area which showcases different genres, offering chamber music in Lincoln Center Stage, rocking the crowd with chart-topping hits in Billboard Onboard and bringing the best of Memphis music to sea in our popular B.B. King's Blues Club. 
Responding to our guests, our new flagship will feature Holland America Lines first ever purpose-built staterooms for families as well as single staterooms. 
Newbuilds will also provide additional demand creation opportunities later this year as well, with the delivery of Carnival Vista followed by Seabourn Encore. When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to stimulate demand creation. We continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent recreation of Holland America's Eurodam, incorporating many of the same experiences on board as Koningsdam. In addition, we are undergoing an extensive remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 later this year. 
Destinations are often a powerful tool for demand creation as well, especially when combined with the effect of public relations. Last week, we made history when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 50 years to receive Cuban approval to bring U.S. cruise guests directly from the U.S. to Cuba. 
We made worldwide news, showcasing cruise in a very positive light, with nearly 5 billion media impressions and still counting. We very much look forward to launching our historic Cuba inaugural season in May with fathom, initially with itineraries including Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. We believe there is no better way to experience so much of Cuba in 7 days than with the enriching guest experience on our premium fathom brand. 
As the Adonia carries just 700 guests per sailing, if you have any interest in seeing Cuba through an extraordinary fathom experience, I sincerely recommend you book now. 
Concerning the future of cruises in Cuba, we have already begun the process for approval for other brands to sail for Cuba in the months and years ahead. 
Now beyond ships and destinations, our ongoing marketing and promotional efforts are also part of demand creation. As part of our effort to keep cruise in the forefront of vacationers' minds, Princess is airing a new reality-based show on prime-time U.K. television entitled The Cruise. The documentary follows the lives of our amazing crew and guests on board Regal Princess through a 6-week series. In fact, we've already seen a 40% increase in web traffic for Princess in the U.K. since the show began airing. 
Also airing in the U.K., P&O Cruises' Battlechefs, a new cookery concept set at sea on board Britannia, featuring 5 celebrities testing their culinary skills and judged by celebrity chef Marco Pierre White. 
In Italy, Costa Fortuna was the set of a major motion picture, [Foreign Language], Holidays in the Caribbean, launched early in the quarter, partially cast with Costa crew members. More recently, an episode on Italian reality TV, I Colori Dell'amore [ph], The Colors of Love, was based on the love story between 2 young Costa crew members who met on board. 
In North America, just last week, Carnival Cruise Lines was featured nightly on the ever-popular television show, Wheel of Fortune. While early in the quarter, Carnival announced an exceptional partnership with Grammy award-winning country music superstar Carrie Underwood, and Operation Homefront, supporting our U.S. military personnel. Media coverage from that announcement alone generated more than 1 billion media impressions, and our Carnival brand continues to outperform. 
Also in North America, we partnered with AT&T and Samsung to create a virtual reality experience that showcased in nearly 1,200 AT&T stores, promoting consideration for cruise by allowing new-to-cruise to virtually experience a cruise vacation. We estimate nearly 400,000 people have already have the virtually reality experience, showcasing our portfolio of leading brands. All of these efforts heighten global awareness and consideration for our world-leading cruise lines as we continue to capture a greater share of the vacation suitcase. 
During the quarter, we continued to make progress on cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues, and in summer of 2016, will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory. The prototype will foster yield uplift as well as inspire improvements for final system development. Since most of this year's bookings will be behind us by the summer, we look forward to a greater contribution on this effort in 2017. 
And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We have negotiations underway on 16 separate purchasing categories, with 22 more RFPs outstanding, all of which will contribute to our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. 
Our ongoing operational improvement is a testament of the success of our combined efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth and to leverage our scale. The strong first quarter we have enjoyed affirms our conviction to deliver this year's earnings forecast and accelerates progress toward double-digit return on invested capital. We remain well on track for the delivery of over 8.5% return on invested capital this year and crossing the double-digit threshold in the next 2 to 3 years. At the same time, we have accelerated our return of capital to shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we have completed our first $1 million share repurchase authorization and are well into our second billion, bringing the cumulative total of purchase to date to $1.3 billion and approximately 27 million shares. We plan to continue to return free cash flow to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our target range. 
And now, I will turn the call over to David."

Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide som",970,"Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. 
I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends. And finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. 
Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.39. This was $0.09 above the midpoint of our December guidance despite a $0.01 drag from fuel and currency. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: $0.07 from net ticket revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on close-in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic; and $0.03 from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters. 
Now let's turn to the first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. Our total net revenue yields were up 5.7%. 
Let's break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up almost 7%. As Arnold indicated, we enjoyed ticket price improvements on both sides of the Atlantic. The increase was driven by the strength of pricing in the Caribbean, which represented 47% of our capacity in the quarter. In addition, our European, Australian and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, saw solid price improvements on their year-round European programs. 
Onboard and other yields increased almost 3%, in line with December guidance. The increase was mainly related to bar, casino and communications as our efforts in these areas continued to pay dividends. Net cruise costs per ALBD, excluding fuel, were up about 1.5%, which was less than planned in our December guidance, again due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. 
In summary, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.19 higher than the prior year, driven by operational improvements worth $0.15 and favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.03. 
Now let's turn to booking trends for 2016. Bookings during this year's wave season was strong. Volumes are ahead of last year's historically high level at higher prices. At this point in time, for the remaining 3 quarters of 2016, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we're well ahead on the booked position, with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, bodes well for pricing over the next few months. 
Now let's drill down into the cumulative fleet-wide booked position. First, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year, also at nicely higher prices. 2015 was a great Alaskan season and I'm happy to say 2016 is shaping up to be even better. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is nicely ahead of the prior year at lower prices, driven by the geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance. 
Secondly, for our EAA brands, for Europe, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our prior guidance. While we are behind on pricing, and not surprisingly behind on percentage occupancy given our over 60% increase in China capacity and our significant increase in Australia capacity, remember, Asia and particularly China, is a unit growth opportunity and we are achieving strong unit profits and returns that exceed our corporate average. 
Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our first quarter results, combined with strong booked position, enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our earnings expectations for the year. Our 2016 March guidance is now $3.20 to $3.40. The $0.05 improvement was driven by improved net revenue yields worth $0.04 and the accretive impact from the additional shares we repurchased since our December call, worth $0.05. These improvements were partially offset by a $0.04 drag from fuel and currency. 
Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are still expected to be up approximately 2%, no change from our December guidance. While we were favorable to the guidance in the first quarter, as I previously indicated, the favorability was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. 
Remember that while the year is expected to be up approximately 2%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5% while the guidance for the second quarter is expected to be up only 0.5% to 1.5%. However, for the third quarter, we expect net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD to be up 5% to 6%, driven by the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock and higher advertising expense. Offsetting that, however, is the expectation that cost will be down slightly in the fourth quarter. 
So far this fiscal year, we have repurchased over 21 million of our shares and we still have almost $700 million left under the second $1 billion share repurchase authorization that was approved by the Board of Directors just 2 months ago. Our March guidance EPS calculation assume approximately 760 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis. 
On a final note, for your planning purposes, I wanted to let you know that we expect our June conference call to be a little later in June than usual to allow some extra time for quarter-end reconciliation and analysis, given that we are currently in the process of implementing a significant upgrade to our Oracle enterprise reporting platform, which includes moving to a single instance of the general ledger as we further leverage our scale. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Arnold."

Are you saying that pricing is still higher in China than the rest of the world? You are adding capacity in China and that -- this is a unit growth story. I wanted to understand those 2 things. So to me, it sounds like almost like you're simply adding more capacity at a higher price relative to the rest of the fleet, but that the pricing maybe is not as high as it was maybe last year, is that what you're saying? And then one other thing on this China opportunity, which I think gets outsize attention because it really is a huge opportunity and is a big pricing opportunity too, is how were the travel agents doing in that market? Is there anything we can read from them and their reaction to the capacity that is coming?"

You probably noticed that overall, we -- for the year, we were $2 -- our guidance is $2 per metric ton better.

Of course, you had -- we have a little benefit there. We had -- offsetting that was some additional derivative losses. So the overall fuel number was negligible in terms of a change from our December guidance. Currency did move against us. And remember, we have a basket of currencies. So it depends on the movement. The one currency from December through March that moved the most was the British pound. And if you look back, we were using $1.51 as the rate for the British pound back in December. The rate now, I think, in our press release in the second quarter was like $1.43. So there was like a 5% movement. So depending on what you're looking at, because of the different basket of currencies and the movements, the British pound is the biggest impact. And that was a negative impact on our bottom line. And that's what drove the majority of the currency drag."

And so the real impact, we won't see until '17. But I have to tell you, we are enjoying some benefits now just from the brands collaborating, working on the tool together, sharing lots of information. There's improved decision-making going on, on revenue management all along the way and is definitely contributing to some of the yield improvement that we have enjoyed the past few quarters and including this past quarter. So over time, when we go to the next phase of the tool, which will be implemented next year, pretty much all the brands will be using the tool. We have some brands that have already more sophisticated tools than others. And this tool, the baseload, it will be at one level of sophistication. When we put the next layer on top, it will be at a whole another level of sophistication.

Because once they go on the ships and experience the brand, the difference is dramatic and you very much get a very different feel from 1 brand to the next in terms of what type of cruise experience it is. And because those brands resonate around the world across different, what we call, psychographic segments, with 1.3 billion people, China is very capable of absorbing lots of different brands. And so we see it, at this stage, as we just have a toe in the water. There's 135 million estimated outbound Chinese tourists today already. And less than 1 million of them or roughly 1 million today are cruising today. So we haven't even touched, begun to touch the surface, hardly. So there's plenty of room and capacity. Our belief is that at the consuming level, at the guest level, that in the price ranges we're in, the guests today are relatively pricing elastic. Whether, I'm in Australia, I was in Cuba last week, the Mainland Chinese filled the paladar that I was in, the private restaurant in Havana I was in. And so they have money, they're able to travel. They're not exactly shopping for price. They fill up the retail outlets and spend several levels higher than the typical tourist would from other places in the world. So we don't see any major barriers at this point except, as you just referred, good communication, execution, training the distribution system, giving them the exposure they need so they can represent the various brands well. We think there's plenty of room for everybody, for several of our brands and we're going to bring AIDA in, in '17 and the Carnival brand right now is scheduled to go in, in '18."

Even the degree of increase in onboard revenue isn't always correlated to particular economic conditions in a given destination market or a given source market. And so there's just so many variables that come into that, not the least of which is us constantly giving guests more of what they want. And if you do that, the guests onboard will spend more. And that's really -- the issue for us is always tweaking that and figuring out exactly what do guests want.

First of all, in China, as you know, the industry, believe it or not, is capacity constrained because of the limited number of shipyards to build ships. And obviously, we've got partnerships with both Fincantieri and with Meyer in Germany in terms of securing slots to enhance our fleets. Having said that, in China, we can't grow too fast because we're just limited to the availability of ships. So we'll probably be, by 2020, somewhere in the 8% to 9% range of our fleet, which means most of the growth in capacity we have will actually be going to China. And that means that we'll be growing at a much slower rate in the rest of the world markets, 1% to 2% there. While a big percentage increase is in China, but in terms of absolute number of ships, still relatively small compared to the latent demand that exists in the country. So to answer your question, by 2020, depending on how things go -- and that's the beauty of this, we have flexibility. Depending on how things go, we could be 8%, 9% of our capacity in China. And that means therefore that we didn't grow a lot in the rest of the world. But that fits with our measured capacity growth overall plan to help create relative scarcity, and we continue to drive demand to create excess demand relative to that measured capacity, which obviously allows us to capture more of the value gap that currently exists between land-based vacations and cruise. We're still a much better value than land-based vacations, so we have lots of room to move. David?"

But the reality is, we are expecting a return on any investment we make, and that includes advertising. And it's -- whether it's mass media advertising, product placement advertising, digital, all the various forms of it. And PR, public relations efforts. So our belief is that we have to keep cruise out in the public space, in a positive way, on a constant basis. So that when people are considering vacation, there's been enough noise about cruise that they say, ""Well, I have an idea. Hey, let's look at a cruise."" And so the idea is to just keep it out there and that's utilizing all the various forms. There's no question, we have created incremental demand. We also know there's no question that incremental demand has been, in part, created by the fantastic work of our team members across our 10 brands who literally exceed guest expectations every day when they come on board. And that word-of-mouth and that personal experience of having your expectations exceeded is the most powerful marketing tool we have, by far. And that's by the work of our people in engineering, their experiences on board and then delivering against it. So to your question, yes, we've increased advertising overall. We'll continue to look at it. We don't do it willy-nilly. We do a lot of measuring and tracking to see what kind of impact we get, both in attitude and in bookings and so on.

We have premium brands in fathom, our newest premium brand. But obviously our long-established premium brands are Princess and Holland America and AIDA. And we have mass contemporary brands like Costa and Carnival. So we look at that. But again, the really important thing about cruise is this: We've had Steve Wozniak, who we pay to lecture on Seabourn. But he pays to go on Carnival, okay? Because it's not a demographic choice per se. We have taxi drivers who will save for 5 years to go on a Seabourn cruise and we have billionaires who want to sail on Carnival. And the reality is the experience that you're looking for. And each brand is a different experience, caters to a different psychographic market. So we have ultra-luxury brands, luxury brands, premium brands, et cetera, each with their own experience and that's what drives this for us. But for us, we're definitely looking at penetrating more land-based vacations because all the cabins in the world added up together represent less than -- in the industry, represent less than 2% of hotel rooms in the world. So that means there's 98% of the market to chase as opposed to 1% because -- of that 2%, 1% is ours already. So that's kind of our approach.
