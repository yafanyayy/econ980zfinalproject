2015 was a year of considerable progress and execution for Merck. We continue to focus on the most exciting scientific and commercial opportunities in front of us, advancing our pipeline, securing new product approvals and launching expanded indications for key products.
I am pleased that our operating performance across our research and commercial organization, including rigorous cost management, enabled us to exceed our EPS commitment in 2015. 
Despite strong currency headwinds, we were able to deliver growth in 2015 and we expect to deliver growth again in 2016. In fact, 2016 represents the first year in several years, in which Merck's new product sales growth, driven primarily by ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C product, and KEYTRUDA -- are expected to contribute meaningfully above the impact of the products that are losing exclusivity.  To ensure continued progress, it is imperative that we remain focused on 3 priorities: First, we must innovate across all assets of our business that we can pursue and deliver the most promising medical breakthroughs; second, we must execute in our labs and in our markets around the world to deliver results by prioritizing resources to the highest growth areas, key markets and customers and; and finally, we must cultured business model to evolve as the world changes around us.  Specifically, this includes driving the successive our key in-line brands, including JANUVIA, launching new indications for KEYTRUDA in more tumor types, and launching ZEPATIER, which received approval from the FDA just last week. We also anticipate several important pipeline catalysts this year which Roger will discuss in more detail shortly.  Augmenting our pipeline with the best scientific and medical innovations also remains a key priority for us, and we are eager to continue to aggressively seek attractive external opportunities that can further bolster our scientific leadership and welcome them into the current assets in our pipeline.
In closing, in 2016, we will build upon the strong foundation we established last year. We will continue to invest resources to launching and growing our strongest brands, support the most promising internal assets, enhance our pipeline with the best available external science and maintain a balanced and depreciated portfolio, all in the goal of delivering long-term growth and shareholder value.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis."

As Ken reference, 2015 reflected another solid year of operational performance at Merck. We delivered full year revenues of $39.5 billion, which was in the upper part of our original guidance range despite a slightly higher than expected foreign exchange impact for the year.
In addition, as a result of our continued focus on transforming our business model, we were able to deliver full year non-GAAP EPS of $3.59, $0.12 higher than the upper end of our original 2015 guidance range. We also returned over $9 billion  to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
In this strong performance was driven by our continued progress on prioritizing resources to our highest growth areas and reducing net cost by more than $2.5 billion versus 2012 while investing in key in-line brands, including JANUVIA, maximizing launches such as KEYTRUDA and strategically investing in R&D and business development to drive a pipeline that will deliver long-term results.
Now let me turn to some specifics for the fourth quarter, and my remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. In the fourth quarter, we delivered a leveraged P&L with growth excluding exchange on both the top and bottom lines. Total company revenues were $10.2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 3% year-over-year, including 7 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of exchange, fourth quarter revenues grew 4%.
It's worth mentioning that approximately $110 million of our foreign exchange impact on revenues in the quarter was due to a devaluation of our operations in Venezuela where we began using the Samadi [ph] rate in the fourth quarter. Given the current than expected conditions in that market, we anticipate continuing to use the Samadi rate for the P&L in 2016.
In addition, the salt results for global numeral the quarter, which Adam will discuss in a few minutes, the Animal Health business also had a good quarter, with sales growing 8%, excluding exchange. Sales of companion animal products led by BRAVECTO as well as foreign products accounted for the majority of the growth.
Turning to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 74.8% in the quarter, an increase of a 20 basis points year-over-year. Full year gross margins increased 150 basis points to 75.4%. Lower discards and foreign exchange drove the overall improvement in margin percentage.
We continue to manage expenses in Q4, with decreases in both marketing and administrative cost as well as R&D as operational efficiencies in more than offset our investments supporting key products and new launches. On a full-year basis, we delivered operating expenses in line with our guidance with meaningful savings in marketing and administrative expenses more than offsetting modest increases in R&D.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.4%, resulting in a full year tax rate of 21.7%. The quarterly and full year rates reflect the benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit.
Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter, delivering 13% growth, excluding exchange, on the bottom line and significant P&L leverage. 
Now let's turn to guidance and our outlook for 2016. We continue strength of the U.S. dollar against virtually all other currencies, we anticipate foreign exchange will have a meaningful impact again in 2016. We expect revenues to be $38.7 billion to $40.2 billion, using mid-January exchange rates which reflects an approximate 3-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange.
Excluding the impact of exchange, we expect the low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016, as new product launches more than offset the impact from generic and biosimilar competition. Our guidance range also assumes negligible revenues from Venezuela compared to $625 [ph] million in the full year 2015.  We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $3.60 to $3.75, which also reflects on approximately 4-percentage-point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-January rates.  2016 EPS growth would be in the mid to high single digits, excluding the impact of exchange. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings between $1.96 and $2.23.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes 2016 product gross margin will be roughly flat compared to 2015. In addition, we expect operating expenses to be generally in line with the prior year. We will continue to invest in direct selling and promotion to support new product launches while reducing administrative expenses as we continue to focus our operating model.
We remain committed to delivering leveraged P&L and we will monitor our new launches in key products throughout the year resources as appropriate.
Regarding tax, we expect the full year non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 21.5% to 22.5%, which includes the benefit from the recently renewed R&D tax credit.
Finally, we project average diluted shares outstanding of $2.78 [ph] billion for 2016, reflecting a decrease versus the prior year as we continue our share repurchase program.
The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year of execution. We expect this momentum to continue into 2016 as we further innovate in our labs, invest behind our launches and continue our focus on disciplined resource allocation and continuous productivity to deliver a leveraged P&L and shareholder returns.
Now I'll turn the call over to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on global human health performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015.

This morning, I'll provide highlights on global human health performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015. My comments will be in a constant-currency basis.
Total sales reached $34.8 billion in 2015, reflecting growth of 4%. In our fourth quarter, sales reached $9 billion and also grew 4%. Excluding Cubist and divestitures, human health sales grew 2% in 2015. 
Moving now to priority franchise updates. I'll start with the JANUVIA franchise. The JANUVIA franchise grew 7% in 2015, driven primarily by volume increases. However, in the fourth quarter, U.S. revenue was impacted by a significant reduction in channel inventory, following the buy-in that we saw in the third quarter. It's important to note that underlying volume maintained growth of about 3% in the U.S. in the fourth quarter.  Despite increased pricing pressure, we expect to grow the JANUVIA franchise in 2016 x exchange. We have maintained a higher market share of about 75% in the U.S. and 65% globally. Volume increases in the U.S. and internationally position a patient experience with our medicine and macro trends the support the growing market, all reinforce our confidence in JANUVIA.
Moving to hospital and specialty care. Our hospital acute care business grew 11% in 2015, excluding Cubist. Sales in the fourth quarter reached more than $600 million and grew 7%. Performance was driven by our antibiotic and the antifungal treatments, as well as by BRIDION in the international markets. In addition, we are currently launching BRIDION in the U.S. While still early, customer feedback is very positive on this new product that uniquely reverses the neuromuscular block following surgery.
We're also excited to be launching ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in the U.S. and Canada. ZEPATIER offers competitive profile in high cure rates with 12 weeks of therapy for the vast majority of patients in a 1 pill once-a-day treatment. ZEPATIER is differentiated versus other options, including consistent dosing regardless of cirrhosis status, renal impairment or use of PPI and another acid reducing agents. We believe our payer and pricing strategy will maximize ZEPATIER revenue and market share as well as abroad and accelerate patient access. We are enthusiastic to be back in this important market, and our teams are rapidly deploying to capitalize on this opportunity.
Moving to vaccines. The vaccines portfolio grew 3%, with sales of $5.7 billion in 2015. In the fourth quarter, sales reached approximately $1.7 billion, and grew 5% on strong performance for GARDASIL. GARDASIL growth was aided by a timing of public sector purchases in the U.S. of about $50 million and timing government purchases in Brazil in the fourth quarter. GARDASIL 9 now represents approximately 90% of sales in the U.S. as our teams have executed well on converting customers to 9-valent vaccine.
Zostavax sales declined 11% in the fourth quarter, resulting from a very weak flu season in the U.S. We continued to work to educate customers on the reimbursement for Zostavax, and to invest in direct-to-consumer advertising for this important brand.
Finally, I'd like to spend a few moments of commenting on the continued launch of KEYTRUDA. In the fourth quarter, sales were approximately $215 [ph] million, driving strong full year sales of more than $560 million. Our performance was driven largely by the refractory melanoma indications in the U.S. as well as ongoing launches in more than 40 markets x U.S.
In late 2015, we received approval in the United States for first-line treatment of advanced melanoma regardless of BRAF status. The sales force is launching this indication as we speak. 
Looking into 2016 and beyond, we remain enthusiastic about the potential for KEYTRUDA across markets and across cancer types. We are building a critical foundation for PD-L1 testing in lung cancer as we launch in second line.  We believe this will help to set the stage for when the first-line indication is achieved. We have now demonstrated overall survival management for KEYTRUDA versus standard of care in both lung cancer and melanoma, which strengthens our belief that KEYTRUDA has a potential to become foundational to the treatment of cancer over time.
With more than 200 critical trials and more than 100 combinations in over 32 tumor types, we see the potential to drive significant growth for KEYTRUDA over the long term.
In summary, global human health delivered a solid performance in 2015. In 2016, we will continue to prioritize resources focusing on JANUVIA, hospital acute care, vaccines and important product launches, including ZEPATIER and KEYTRUDA.  
The strength of our underlying business, the continued execution of our strategy and the launch opportunities before us position us well for the year ahead.  Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

I provide a brief update on our progress in key programs during the fourth quarter, and we'll note opportunities for further advancement in 2016. 
The fourth quarter was an important one for KEYTRUDA. Our U.S. label was updated to include data from our 006 studies in melanoma, dimensioning that KEYTRUDA treatment is superior to ipilimumab, the prior standard of care in the first line treatment of advanced melanoma as judged by improvements in overall survival and progression free survival.
Data from the 002 study in which KEYTRUDA treatment proved superior by progression-free survival, the traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy was also added to our label.  Hence, in the United States, as in Europe, our KEYTRUDA label documents the superior effectiveness treatment for advanced melanoma as compared with other interventions.
Also in the fourth quarter, we presented data from our key note 010 study, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA provides a superior overall survival as compared with docetaxel treatment in non-small cell lung cancer in patients with PD-L1 expression of 1% or more. This study was presented at the ESMO Asia meeting, simultaneously published in The Lancet, and is already been included in NCCN guidelines for lung cancer treatment. These data have also been submitted for review in the United States and in Europe.
Looking ahead for KEYTRUDA, 2016 promises to be a very exciting year. We'll see data from our keynote 024 first-line non-small cell lung cancer trial, comparing treatment with a range of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens to KEYTRUDA monotherapy by mid-year. Primary endpoint is progression-free survival.
Our KEYNOTE-055 study which a value which response rates in head and neck cancer following KEYTRUDA mode therapy in patients who have failed both agents, and cetuximab treatment, who will also provide important new data.
Looking still further ahead, there are multiple opportunities for filings and other tumor types, including bladder cancer and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, depending upon the results that we observe. As we have noted, that KEYTRUDA development program is exceptionally broad, with the registration labeling studies underway in more than a dozen tumor types.  We do view KEYTRUDA as providing a foundation for the next-generation treatment of malignant disease. Along these lines, we're also steadily commendations when cytotoxic agents, targeted therapies, vaccines and other immuno oncology agents.
In 2015, we gained access to a Phase I cCAM directed antibody program which complements our internal clinical programs to target I-O 10 and many other In all, we have more than 100 combination studies underway as Adam mentioned. 
A few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of IOmet through which will gain access to a set of IDO1 small molecule antagonists, we have previously presented data in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte, suggesting that KEYTRUDA may be fruitfully, combined with their IDO1 inhibitor Phase III study using this soon begin enrolling patients with melanoma.  Our acquisition of IOmet will commit us to explore the IDO1 inhibition much more broadly.
Last week, we announced the approval of ZEPATIER in the United States. ZEPATIER was the subject of 2 breakthrough designations and was evaluated promptly by our priority review. A key strength of the ZEPATIER is the fact that it can be used without those adjustment in patients with chronic renal failure, a group that suffers from increased rates of HCV infection. Going forward, in 2016, we expect to complete Phase IIb and initiate Phase III studies for new regimens that include our MK 3682, nucleoside polymerase, inhibitor MK-8408 and next-generation highly active NS5A inhibitor. These programs emphasize our commitment to complete care of patients with HCV infection, where the goal certainly is to cure as many patients as possible using appropriate and effective regimens.
Our 2016 plan includes numerous other approvals and filings as we have announced previously, our therapy designed to reduce recurrences of associated colitis received priority review designation from the FDA with a PDUFA date of July.  in 2016, we expect to complete our Phase II program and our filing for as both single agent and in combination with JANUVIA. And we will obtain adjudicated data supporting the filing of organic
 
We'll have the opportunity to review Phase III data from our inactivated vaccine in immunocompromised populations and from our Phase III program studying the prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus activation, in patients receiving bone marrow transplants. 
In collaboration with our colleagues at Bayer, we will begin a Phase III heart failure program for [indiscernible] based on Phase II data that we presented last year. We will also have a chance to see important early clinical data from our collaborations with AMGN Pharmaceuticals in metabolic disease and from Midurna [ph] in the vaccine space.

We have noted that in PD-L1-negative populations with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, it's not at all clear that there's a benefit that patients who received PD-1 directed therapy. And that's true for every agent that's been studied, not just our own agents. So I think it is important to be looking at PD-L1 expression in order to decide who, in fact, should be treated with these agents.

Our dosing is not affected by the presence of our says -- cirrhosis. If you look at the competition, they have to change their does there. You can use us with any degree of renal impairment. If the competition, particularly, in certain patients with renal impairment, they can't be used there. And also, you don't have to adjust our dose for acid-reducing agents such as PPIs. So I think there's some things we feel good about in terms of differentiating our product versus the competition in the marketplace. I think what we did was develop a real deliberate and I believe, innovative pricing strategy to try to maximize the product and increase the number of appropriate patients treated. But the first thing I want to say is we want to be competitive across all segments, and we want to look at public private. We want to work with managed care organizations and government agencies, et cetera, et cetera. So we plan to be competitive across all segments. And I believe that the strategy that we implemented could accelerate access to patients in certain segments, where access, frankly, is not broad to date, and including those patients with medical needs in the stage 4, 5, 6 [ph] [indiscernible] So, like I said, we don't give guidance individual products.

We are very pleased with our collaboration with Pfizer on 4-1BB. I believe that the plan is -- assuming that it's excepted to be able to present some of those data at ASCO.

Jami, on the first line opportunity on the -- just to remind you and everyone that -- our approach has been to ask the question of whether or not we can identify populations that would benefit, especially from the treatment of KEYTRUDA. And we chose to use the PD-L1 expression as a marker for that. It's turned out that, that is a marker. And the reason, of course, is it's not because specifically the PD-L1 is that counter ligand for PD-1 but rather, because PD-L1 is a marker for the presence of an immune response. And to that, that PD-L1 as a result is telling us that there already is a pre-existing immune response that can be enhanced by the addition of KEYTRUDA. The 024 study looks at those that are PD-L1 high. And what we've done in all of our studies is that we have looked at the PD-L1 high, those with the proportion scores above 50%, and then looked at those that are expressing PD-L1 above 1% and also, looked at that -- at those that appeared not to be expressing PD-L1 as we move across the line. So for example, and we publish doing widget know that there was a general, in general terms, in the 001 study in melanoma, in general, that those patients who were expressing more PD-L1 had better responses. We've similarly published data in 010 study recently, showing that responses were better in the highest PD-L1 expresses, again, reflecting immune status. The 024 study looks at though that are the highest PD-L1 expression was about 25% of the first line patient population. The 042 study will go on and look at patients who have the 1% on a cut point, and we'll begin to see the data across the entire first line. So we'll have an opportunity to look at that. Frankly, from a biological perspective, I really can't understand why it would be any difference in the first line population from what we've previously shown in other tumor types populations, because again, PD-L1 expression is a reflection of the immune activity."

So I want to start by saying we're really pleased that JANUVIA grew 7% in 2015. And if you look at our underlying performance in the fourth quarter, it was similar to the other quarters in the year. What you saw in the fourth quarter was volume growth in the U.S. of about 3%, which was about the same as what you saw the quarter before and so forth. What happened was there was significant channel reductions that followed the third quarter buy-in which I noted on the last call was more than $100 million. And as you may recall, last quarter, the U.S. grew 22% for JANUVIA, and that's why I noted that there was buy-in and we expect to see buyout. So when you look at the fourth quarter, I would look at the underlying performance, which remains an similar to the other quarters. And I think we had a good year with JANUVIA showing 7% growth versus prior. When you look at 2016, despite the increasing pricing pressure that we'll see in the United States and the biannual price declines that you see in Japan, we expect to grow the franchise globally when you exclude exchange. And what that means -- with regard that EMPA-REG, we don't see a significant impact in 2016. In fact, if you look at the earliest data that you can look at, we are seeing market share shifts within the SGLT2 class but we're not seeing shifts between classes, between DPP-4s and SGLT2s. We'll continue to monitor that closely echo we'll see where this label changes or where there's potential guideline changes, but at this point in time, we feel confident that there should not be a significant impact in 2016 from the SGLT2 class. So let me answer your question on ZEPATIER. And I already stated that we think that we have a competitive product profile, and that's where it all starts. You halve to have a competitive product profit to be successful in the market place. Our efficacy is good, we think we have a strong differentiation versus the competitors. So price is always a lever that you can choose to utilize it, but you don't necessarily have to utilize it nearly as much when you have a differentiated product that you think you can bring to market. So we'll continue to keep you updated on ZEPATIER as we move forward, but we're going to do everything we can to optimize and maximize that brand."

And that declines, that benefit of the decline as you look from '15 into '16, assuming constant rates, basically because of the fact that one of those hedges are in place and the gains of them are smaller.

When I look at the yield history, Schering-Plough is really one of the acquisitions that was quite successful with regard to gaining access to KEYTRUDA, having your BACE inhibitor advance forward. Can you just help me understand why these -- the smaller acquisitions are really the way to go? Obviously, you guys -- and identify those assets but it actually came from a larger deal and was clearly value-generating. And then separately, for Roger -- Roger, well I'm a little perplexed on the timing. If I look at the development of the front-line lung situation, it seems like the studies that faster immuno-oncology consistently show a less robust result. So can you help me understand how the KEYNOTE-024 study has an opportunity to successfully complete earlier than expected and before some of the other competitors studies that are out there? And then my final question, just for Adam. When you look at -- I think you guys have been really respectful, basically not saying that you're going to win but that you will have a foundational product in KEYTRUDA. When other competitors claim and state that they are going to win, particularly from a third or fourth or fifth position, how likely is it given what you've seen historically that, that is a realistic possibility, particularly in the space where new standards of care are being created?"

But JANUVIA was the result of that deal which was done a number of years ago. And so what we have found in the past is -- the best way for us to create value is through those insights early on, that allow us to acquire that kinds of things that you had Roger talked about, NGM and MIdurna [ph], our goal is to find those kinds of things before there's a bidding war to apply our scientific know-how, our development know-how, our molecular -- I'm sorry to say, our medicinal chemistry know-how, and to bring forward the kinds of molecules like Citic Lipton that can actually be pretty important contributions to human health."

I've always said that I believe that this market is good to be a very large market and that there's room for multiple competitors. I also believe that they'll be certain competitors that do really well in 1 tumor type and another competitor might get data in a different tumor types first and therefore, you'll see differences based upon tumor type. It's not too different than if you look at the anti-TNF field where you have multiple products, one might do better in GI, the other one might do better in rheumatoid arthritis. But the other do very well and grow very fast. At the same time, I believe the building a wall of data is important. And when you look at the size and the magnitude of our clinical trials, and when you look at the number of tumor types that we're studying, I think we're going to be in a very good position over the long time. And it's hard to think about late entrants coming in and having a strong position once you have that 1 of data built.

In these patient populations, because higher percentage of the treated patients in principle, should respond, the result will be faster. But it shouldn't be less robust. In fact, in many cases, it would be more robust, simply in terms of the efficacy window. So that's the basis for why the 024 study which is reading out in mid-year, has a good chance of succeeding. We don't know what the data are, but we're eager to see the data and And thereafter, the populations will broaden through 042 and through a whole variety of studies that we're doing.

2015 was a year of considerable progress and execution for Merck. We continue to focus on the most exciting scientific and commercial opportunities in front of us, advancing our pipeline, securing new product approvals and launching expanded indications for key products. I'm pleased that our operating performance across our research and commercial organization, including rigorous cost management, enabled us to exceed our EPS commitment in 2015. 
Despite strong currency headwinds, we were able to deliver growth in 2015, and we expect to deliver growth again in 2016. In fact, 2016 represents the first year in several years in which Merck's new product sales growth, driven primarily by ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C product, and KEYTRUDA, are expected to contribute meaningfully above the impact of the products that are losing exclusivity. 
To ensure continued progress, it is imperative that we remain focused on 3 priorities: first, we must innovate across all aspects of our business that we can pursue and deliver the most promising medical breakthroughs; second, we must execute in our labs and in our markets around the world to deliver results by prioritizing resources to the highest growth areas, key markets and customers; and finally, we must adapt our culture and business model to evolve as the world changes around us. Specifically, this includes driving the successive our key in-line brands, including JANUVIA, launching new indications for KEYTRUDA in more tumor types and launching ZEPATIER, which received approval from the FDA just last week. We also anticipate several important pipeline catalysts this year, which Roger will discuss in more detail shortly. 
Augmenting our pipeline with the best scientific and medical innovations also remains a key priority for us, and we are eager to continue to aggressively seek attractive external opportunities that can further bolster our scientific leadership, while complementing the current assets in our pipeline.
In closing, in 2016, we will build upon the strong foundation we established last year. We will continue to invest resources to launch and grow our strongest brands, support the most promising internal assets, enhance our pipeline with the best available external science and maintain a balanced and depreciated portfolio, all with the goal of delivering long-term growth and shareholder value.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis."

As Ken referenced, 2015 reflected another solid year of operational performance at Merck. We delivered full year revenues of $39.5 billion, which was in the upper part of our original guidance range despite a slightly higher than expected foreign exchange impact for the year.
In addition, as a result of our continued focus on transforming our business model, we were able to deliver full year non-GAAP EPS of $3.59, $0.12 higher than the upper end of our original 2015 guidance range. We also returned over $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This strong performance was driven by our continued focus on prioritizing resources to our highest growth areas and reducing net cost by more than $2.5 billion versus 2012, while investing in key in-line brands, including JANUVIA, maximizing launches, such as KEYTRUDA, and strategically investing in R&D and business development to drive a pipeline that will deliver long-term results.
Now let me turn to some specifics for the fourth quarter, and my remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. In the fourth quarter, we delivered a leveraged P&L, with growth excluding exchange on both the top and bottom lines. Total company revenues were $10.2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 3% year-over-year, including 7 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of exchange, fourth quarter revenues grew 4%.
It's worth mentioning that approximately $110 million of our foreign exchange impact on revenues in the quarter was due to a devaluation of our operations in Venezuela where we began using the Simadi rate in the fourth quarter. Given the current and expected conditions in that market, we anticipate continuing to use the Simadi rate for our P&L in 2016.
In addition, the solid results for Global Human Health in the quarter, which Adam will discuss in a few minutes. The Animal Health business also had a good quarter, with sales growing 8%, excluding exchange. Sales of companion animal products led by BRAVECTO as well as foreign products accounted for the majority of the growth.
Turning to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 74.8% in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points year-over-year. Full year gross margin increased 150 basis points to 75.4%. Lower discards and foreign exchange drove the overall improvement in margin percentage.
We continue to manage expenses in Q4, with decreases in both marketing and administrative costs as well as R&D as operational efficiencies more than offset our investments supporting key products and new launches. On a full year basis, we delivered operating expenses in line with our guidance, with meaningful savings in marketing and administrative expenses more than offsetting modest increases in R&D.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.4%, resulting in a full year tax rate of 21.7%. The quarterly and full year rates reflect the benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit.
Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter, delivering 13% growth, excluding exchange, on the bottom line and significant P&L leverage. 
Now let's turn to guidance and our outlook for 2016. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against virtually all other currencies, we anticipate foreign exchange will have a meaningful impact again in 2016. We expect revenues to be $38.7 billion to $40.2 billion using mid-January exchange rates, which reflects an approximately 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.
Excluding the impact of exchange, we expect the low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 as new product launches more than offset the impact from generic and biosimilar competition. Our guidance range also assumes negligible revenues from Venezuela compared to $625 million in the full year of 2015. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $3.60 to $3.75, which also reflects on approximately 4 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-January rates. 2016 EPS growth would be in the mid- to high single digits, excluding the impact of exchange. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings between $1.96 and $2.23.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes 2016 product gross margin will be roughly flat compared to 2015. In addition, we expect operating expenses to be generally in line with prior year. We will continue to invest in direct selling and promotion to support new product launches while reducing administrative expenses as we continue to focus our operating model. We remain committed to delivering a leveraged P&L, and we will monitor our new launches in key products throughout the year and flex resources as appropriate.
Regarding tax, we expect the full year non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 21.5% to 22.5%, which includes the benefit from the recently renewed R&D tax credit.
Finally, we project average diluted shares outstanding of 2.78 billion for 2016, reflecting a decrease versus the prior year as we continue our share repurchase program.
The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year of execution. We expect this momentum to continue into 2016 as we further innovate in our labs, invest behind our launches and continue our focus on disciplined resource allocation and continuous productivity to deliver a leveraged P&L and shareholder returns.
Now I'll turn the call over to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on Global Human Health performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015. My comments will be in a constant-currency basis.
Total sales reached $34.8 billion in 2015, reflecting growth of 4%. In our fourth quarter, sales reached $9 billion and also grew 4%. Excluding Cubist and divestitures, Human Health sales grew 2% in 2015. 
Moving now to priority franchise updates. I'll start with the JANUVIA franchise. The JANUVIA franchise grew 7% in 2015, driven primarily by volume increases. However, in the fourth quarter, U.S. revenue was impacted by a significant reduction in channel inventory, following the buy-in that we saw in the third quarter. It's important to note that underlying volume maintained growth of about 3% in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. Despite increased pricing pressure, we expect to grow the JANUVIA franchise in 2016 ex exchange. We have maintained a high market share of about 75% in the U.S. and 65% globally. Volume increases in the U.S. and internationally position a patient experience with our medicine, and macro trends that support a growing market all reinforce our confidence in JANUVIA.
Moving to Hospital and Specialty Care. Our hospital acute care business grew 11% in 2015, excluding Cubist. Sales in the fourth quarter reached more than $600 million and grew 7%. Performance was driven by our antibiotic and antifungal treatments as well as by Bridion in the international markets. In addition, we are currently launching Bridion in the U.S. While it's still early, customer feedback is very positive on this new product that uniquely reverses the neuromuscular block following surgery.
We're also excited to be launching ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in the U.S. and Canada. ZEPATIER offers a competitive profile and high cure rates with 12 weeks of therapy for the vast majority of patients in a one pill once-a-day treatment. ZEPATIER is differentiated versus other options, including consistent dosing regardless of cirrhosis status, renal impairment or use of PPIs and another acid-reducing agents. We believe our payer and pricing strategy will maximize ZEPATIER revenue and market share as well as broaden and accelerate patient access. We are enthusiastic to be back in this important market, and our teams are rapidly deploying to capitalize on this opportunity.
Moving to vaccines. The vaccines portfolio grew 3%, with sales of $5.7 billion in 2015. In the fourth quarter, sales reached approximately $1.7 billion and grew 5% on strong performance for GARDASIL. GARDASIL growth was aided by timing of public sector purchases in the U.S. of about $50 million and timing of government purchases in Brazil in the fourth quarter. GARDASIL 9 now represents approximately 90% of sales in the U.S. as our teams have executed well on converting customers to 9-valent vaccine.
Zostavax sales declined 11% in the fourth quarter, resulting from a very weak flu season in the U.S. We continue to work to educate customers on the reimbursement for Zostavax and to invest in direct-to-consumer advertising for this important brand.
Finally, I'd like to spend a few moments commenting on the continued launch of KEYTRUDA. In the fourth quarter, sales were approximately $215 million, driving strong full year sales of more than $560 million. Our performance was driven largely by the refractory melanoma indication in the U.S. as well as ongoing launches in more than 40 markets ex U.S. In late 2015, we received approval in the United States for first-line treatment of advanced melanoma regardless of BRAF status. The sales force is launching this indication as we speak. 
Looking into 2016 and beyond, we remain enthusiastic about the potential for KEYTRUDA across markets and across cancer types. We are building a critical foundation for PD-L1 testing in lung cancer as we launched its second line. We believe this will help to set the stage for when a first-line indication is achieved. We have now demonstrated overall survival management for KEYTRUDA versus standard of care in both lung cancer and melanoma, which strengthens our belief that KEYTRUDA has a potential to become foundational to the treatment of cancer over time. With more than 200 critical trials and more than 100 combinations in over 30 tumor types, we see the potential to drive significant growth for KEYTRUDA over the long term.
In summary, Global Human Health delivered a solid performance in 2015. In 2016, we'll continue to prioritize resources, focusing on JANUVIA, hospital acute care, vaccines and important product launches, including ZEPATIER and KEYTRUDA. The strength of our underlying business, the continued execution of our strategy and the launch opportunities before us position us well for the year ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

I'll provide a brief update on our progress in key programs during the fourth quarter, and we'll note opportunities for further advancement in 2016. 
The fourth quarter was an important one for KEYTRUDA. Our U.S. label was updated to include data from our 006 study in melanoma, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA treatment is superior to ipilimumab, the prior standard of care in the first-line treatment of advanced melanoma, and is judged by improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival.
Data from the 002 study, in which KEYTRUDA treatment proved superior assessed [ph] by progression-free survival, the traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy was also added to our label. Hence, in the United States, as in Europe, our KEYTRUDA label documents the superior effect of this treatment for advanced melanoma as compared with other interventions.
Also in the fourth quarter, we presented data from our KEYNOTE-010 study, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA provides superior overall survival as compared with docetaxel treatment in non-small cell lung cancer in patients with PD-L1 expression of 1% or more. This study was presented at the ESMO Asia Meeting, simultaneously published in The Lancet and is already been included in NCCN guidelines for lung cancer treatment. These data have also been submitted for review in the United States and in Europe.
Looking ahead for KEYTRUDA, 2016 promises to be a very exciting year. We'll see data from our KEYNOTE-024 first-line non-small cell lung cancer trial, comparing treatment with the range of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens to KEYTRUDA monotherapy by midyear. Primary endpoint is progression-free survival.
Our KEYNOTE-055 study, which evaluates response rates in head and neck cancer following KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients who have failed both platinum agents and cetuximab treatment, will also provide important new data.
Looking still further ahead, there are multiple opportunities for filings in other tumor types, including bladder cancer and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, depending upon the results that we observe. As we have noted, the KEYTRUDA development program is exceptionally broad, with the registration-enabling studies underway in more than a dozen tumor types. We do view KEYTRUDA as providing a foundation for the next-generation treatment of malignant disease. Along these lines, we're also studying combinations with cytotoxic agents, targeted therapies, vaccines and other immunomodulatory agents.
In 2015, we gained access to a Phase I cCAM-directed antibody program which complements our internal clinical programs that target GITR, I-O 10 [ph] and many other axis. In all, we have more than 100 combination studies underway, as Adam mentioned. 
A few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of IOmet, through which we will gain access to a set of IDO1 and TDO 1 small molecule antagonists, we've previously presented data in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte, suggesting that KEYTRUDA may be fruitfully combined with their IDO1 inhibitor, and a Phase III study using this agent will soon begin enrolling patients with melanoma. Our acquisition of IOmet will permit us to explore the utility of IDO1 inhibition much more broadly.
Last week, we announced the approval of ZEPATIER in the United States. ZEPATIER was the subject of 2 breakthrough designations and was evaluated promptly by our priority review. A key strength of ZEPATIER is the fact that it can be used without dose adjustment in patients with chronic renal failure, a group that suffers from increased rates of HCV infection. Going forward, in 2016, we expect to complete Phase IIb and initiate Phase III studies for new regimens that include MK -- our 3682, a eurodental [ph] nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, and MK-8408, a next-generation highly active NS5A inhibitor. These programs emphasize our commitment to complete a care of patients with HCV infection, where the goal should certainly be to cure as many patients as possible using appropriate and effective regimens.
Our 2016 plan includes numerous other approvals and filings. As we have announced previously, bezlotoxumab, our therapy designed to reduce recurrences of Clostridium difficile-associated enterocolitis, received priority review designation from the FDA with a PDUFA date in July. In 2016, we expect to complete our Phase III program and our filing for ertugliflozin as both single agent and in combination with JANUVIA. And we will obtain adjudicated data supporting the filing of odanacatib.
 
We'll have the opportunity to review Phase III data from our inactivated varicella zoster vaccine in immunocompromised populations and from our Phase III program studying letermovir as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus activation in patients receiving bone marrow transplants. 
In collaboration with our colleagues at Bayer, we'll begin a Phase III heart failure program for vericiguat based on Phase II data that we presented last year, and we will also have a chance to see important early clinical data from our collaborations with NGM Pharmaceuticals in metabolic disease and from Moderna in the vaccine space. It will be a busy year. Now I'll turn the call over to Teri."

Progression-free survival is an accepted in point. So I think that's where we'll be with respect to first line. And with respect to the 010 study, I'm not sure exactly what PD-L1 minimal expressers. What we showed in the 010 study, of course, was that there was a treatment effect in the 1% expressers well as in the high expressers. We have noted that in PD-L1-negative populations with non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, it's not at all clear that there's a benefit that -- in numerous patients who received PD-1-directed therapy. And that's true for every agent that's been studied, not just our own agents. So I think it is important to be looking at PD-L1 expression in order to decide who, in fact, should be treated with these agents.

Second question, on 4-1BB. Pfizer made some positive comments yesterday. One of the products they've been studying with is your drug, KEYTRUDA. But I'm wondering about the longevity of that deal, and whether they could kick you to the curb potentially now that they have their own PD-L1?

And let me give you some context, and I'll try to answer the question specifically on how we're thinking about the pricing reimbursement contracting strategy. But first of all, I agree with your comment that we do have a competitive product. And we have high cure rates. And if you look at our clinical trials in GT1 patients, it was 94% to 97%. If you look at GT4 patients, it's 97% to 100%. So we start off by showing we have very good efficacy with the product. I also believe we have some important differentiation with the product, right? Our dosing is not affected by the presence of compensated cirrhosis. If you look at the competition, they have to change their does there. You can use us with any degree of renal impairment. If you look at the competition, particularly in certain patients with renal impairment, they can't be used there. And also, you don't have to adjust our dose for acid-reducing agents such as PPIs. So I think those are some things we feel good about in terms of differentiating our product versus the competition in the marketplace. I think what we did was develop a real deliberate, and I believe, innovative pricing strategy to try to maximize the product and increase the number of appropriate patients treated. But the first thing I want to say is we want to be competitive across all segments, and we want to look at public, private. We want to work with managed care organizations and government agencies, et cetera, et cetera. So we plan to be competitive across all segments. And I believe that the strategy that we implemented could accelerate access to patients in certain segments, where access, frankly, is not been as broad to date, including those patients with medical needs in the Stage 4, 5, 6 CKD. So as you said, we don't give guidance for individual products. But we will provide updates as we go through the year. We're just launching right now. The product's not available in the market place yet, but it will be in a matter of days. And then I'll provide updates as we go through the year to give you a sense of where we are."

For example, in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, with immunization, with T-VEC, the oncolytic virus. And of course, we're doing our own studies with other checkpoint inhibitors and another immunogens. We're very pleased with our collaboration with Pfizer on 4-1BB. I believe that the plan is, assuming that it's accepted, to be able to present some of those data at ASCO. And I -- our expectation is that if it turns out that there's a good opportunity there, that we'll continue to collaborate. So I'm not really terribly concerned about not being able to take advantage of an important opportunity to help patients. With respect to KEYNOTE-024, the study is, of course, being continuously monitored by a data monitoring committee.

Jami, on the first-line opportunity and the size, just to remind you and everyone that our approach has been to ask the question of whether or not we can identify populations that would benefit especially from the treatment of KEYTRUDA. And we chose to use the PD-L1 expression as a marker for that. It's turned out that, that is a marker. And the reason, of course, is not because specifically the PD-L1 is that counter ligand for PD-1, but rather because PD-L1 is a marker for the presence of an immune response. And that PD-L1, as a result, is telling us that there already is a pre-existing immune response that can be enhanced by the addition of KEYTRUDA. The 024 study looks at those that are PD-L1 high. And what we've done in all of our studies is that we have looked at the PD-L1 high, those with the proportion scores above 50%, and then looked at those that are expressing PD-L1 above 1% and also looked at those that appeared not to be expressing PD-L1 as we move across the line. So for example, and we published in the New England Journal, that there was, in general, in general terms, in the 001 study in melanoma, in general, that those patients who were expressing more PD-L1 had better responses. We similarly published data in 010 study recently, showing that responses were better in the highest PD-L1 expresses, again, reflecting immune status. The 024 study looks at those that have the highest PD-L1 expression. It was about 25% of the first-line patient population. The 042 study will go on and look at patients who have the 1% out of cut point. And we'll begin to see the data across the entire first line. So we'll have an opportunity to look at that. Frankly, from a biological perspective, I really can't understand why it would be any different in the first-line population from what we've previously shown in other tumor populations, because again, PD-L1 expression is a reflection of the immune activity."

So I want to start by saying we're really pleased that JANUVIA grew 7% in 2015. And if you look at our underlying performance in fourth quarter, it was similar to the other quarters in the year. What you saw in fourth quarter was volume growth in the U.S. of about 3%, which was about the same as what you saw the quarter before and so forth. What happened was there was significant channel reductions that followed the third quarter buy-in, which I noted on the last call, was more than $100 million. And as you may recall, last quarter, the U.S. grew 22% for JANUVIA, and that's why I noted that there was buy-in, and we would expect to see buyout. So when you look at fourth quarter, I would look at the underlying performance, which remains similar to the other quarters, and I think we had a good year with JANUVIA showing 7% growth versus prior. When you look at 2016, despite increasing pricing pressure that we'll see in the United States and the biannual price declines that you see in Japan, we expect to grow the franchise globally when you exclude exchange, and what that means with regard to EMPA-REG, we don't see a significant impact in 2016. In fact, if you look at the earliest data that you can look at, we're are seeing market share shifts within the SGLT2 class, but we're not seeing shifts between classes, between DPP-4s and SGLT2s. We'll continue to monitor that closely. We'll see when this label changes or if there's potential guideline changes. But at this point in time, we feel confident that there should not be a significant impact in 2016 from the SGLT2 class. So let me answer your question on ZEPATIER, and I already stated that we think that we have a competitive product profile, and that's where it all starts. You have to have a competitive product profile to be successful in the market place. Our efficacy is good. We think we have strong differentiation versus the competitors. So price is always a lever that you can choose to utilize it, but you don't necessarily have to utilize it nearly as much when you have a differentiated product that you think you can bring to market. So we'll continue to keep you updated on ZEPATIER as we move forward, but we're going to do everything we can to optimize and maximize that brand."

So on your question, we are seeing a little bit more pressure to earnings than we are in sales from foreign currency. The biggest single driver of that is really how our hedging is flowing through on a year-on-year basis. Recall that in 2015, we flagged in prior quarters and have received a meaningful benefit from hedge gains as a result of the positions we took. And that declines, that benefit of decline, as you look from '15 into '16, assuming constant rates, basically because of the fact that one of those hedges are in place and the gains of them are smaller. So that impact does cause a little bit more of the leveraging effect you're seeing between the top and the bottom line. Other than that, we generally see a proportional move between sales and earnings, but that's the biggest single driver. And then to your question of what we're looking at from a share count -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're assuming 2.70 billion shares as an average for 2016, which is a reduction from where we were in '15."

Ken, as I just listened to your comments, one of the things that I'm trying to better understand is can you give us a little bit of the history of Phase II and earlier stage deals, where Merck has successfully brought forward a product like that into development? When I look at the yield history, Schering-Plough is really one of the acquisitions that was quite successful with regard to gaining access to KEYTRUDA, having your BACE inhibitor advance forward. Can you just help me understand why these -- the smaller acquisitions are really the way to go? Obviously, you guys -- and identify those assets but it actually came from a larger deal and was clearly value-generating. And then separately, for Roger, Roger, well, I'm a little perplexed on the timing. If I look at the development of the front-line lung situation, it seems like studies that finish faster in immuno-oncology consistently show a less robust result. So can you help me understand how the KEYNOTE-024 study has an opportunity to successfully complete earlier than expected and before some of the other competitor studies that are out there? And then my final question, just for Adam, when you look at -- I think you guys have been really respectful, basically not saying that you're going to win, but that you will have a foundational product in KEYTRUDA. When other competitors claim and state that they're going to win, particularly from a third or fourth or fifth position, how likely is it given what you've seen historically that, that is a realistic possibility, particularly in the space where new standards of care are being created?"

So some examples are FOSAMAX, which was the license bid or COZAAR. In my own experience, when I was on the legal side, the work that we did to get access to the DPP-4 technology through a German company, called Probiodrug, when those deals were done, people don't necessarily sit up and take notice of them, but JANUVIA was the result of that deal, which was done a number of years ago. And so what we have found in the past is the best way for us to create value is through those insights early on that allow us to acquire the kinds of things that you had Roger talked about, NGM and Moderna. Our goal is to find those kinds of things before there's a bidding war to apply our scientific know-how, our development know-how, our molecular -- I'm sorry to say, our medicinal chemistry know-how, and to bring forward the kinds of molecules, like [indiscernible] that can actually be pretty important contributions to human health."

I've always said that I believe that this market is to be a very large market, and that there's room for multiple competitors. I also believe that there'll be certain competitors that do really well in 1 tumor type and another competitor might get data in a different tumor type first, and therefore, you'll see differences based upon tumor type. It's not too different than if you look at the anti-TNF field, where you have multiple products, one might do better in GI. The other one might do better in rheumatoid arthritis, but they all tend to do very well and grow very fast. At the same time, I believe building a wall of data is important. And when you look at the size and the magnitude of our clinical trials, and when you look at the number of tumor types that we're studying, I think we're going to be in a very good position over the long term, and it's hard to think about late entrants coming in and having a strong position once you have that wall of data built. So I think the strategy that we put in place is the right strategy over time, and I think, over time, you'll see us in a leadership position."

Just to outline again what our strategy with respect to -- broadly with respect to these tumor types, as I mentioned in response to Jami Rubin's question, is that we've gone in and said, ""Let's look at the patient populations in which we expect to see the best results."" And those are the PD-L1 highs in the current formulations. It's not the only biomarker that we have and that we've evolved other better biomarkers, we believe, but it's one that's useful. In those patient populations, because a higher percentage of the treated patients in principle should respond, the result will be faster, but it shouldn't be less robust. In fact, in many cases, it would be more robust, simply in terms of the efficacy window. So that's the basis for why the 024 study, which is reading out in mid-year, has a good chance of succeeding. We don't know what the data are, but we're eager to see the data on PFS. And thereafter, the populations will broaden through 042 and through a whole variety of other studies that we're doing. So that's the general strategy, and I think it's a good one because it focuses on those patients who need these therapies most."

But in a large number of patients, on more than half, we actually don't see a response. So why don't we see a response in that -- those patients? And one possibility certainly is that there isn't enough pre-existing immune response. And if we could stimulate that through, as you say, a new antigen vaccine, things might go better. We're interested in those kinds of strategies. We, of course, have used other vaccination strategies. I'd point out again, the oncolytic virus strategy, which appears to have some traction, and we are looking at the question of whether or not it's possible to use new antigens, and one of the issues is -- as I'm sure you realize, that introducing a bespoke therapy where each patient receives a unique new antigen cocktail will be very challenging from an industry perspective.

Now the reality of the world is -- as we're seeing, when there are these headlines, you tend to get congressional hearing and you tend to have state attorneys generals writing letters and things of that nature. And I take those things very seriously. But I also think that the most important thing that we can do as an industry is to continue to price our products consistent with the value that they provide to our customers, and to continue to try to educate again people about the long-term positive impact that the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals have on overall health care cost."

2015 was a year of considerable progress and execution for Merck. We continue to focus on the most exciting scientific and commercial opportunities in front of us, advancing our pipeline, securing new product approvals and launching expanded indications for key products. I'm pleased that our operating performance across our research and commercial organization, including rigorous cost management, enabled us to exceed our EPS commitment in 2015. 
Despite strong currency headwinds, we were able to deliver growth in 2015, and we expect to deliver growth again in 2016. In fact, 2016 represents the first year in several years in which Merck's new product sales growth, driven primarily by ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C product, and KEYTRUDA, are expected to contribute meaningfully above the impact of the products that are losing exclusivity. 
To ensure continued progress, it is imperative that we remain focused on 3 priorities: first, we must innovate across all aspects of our business that we can pursue and deliver the most promising medical breakthroughs; second, we must execute in our labs and in our markets around the world to deliver results by prioritizing resources to the highest growth areas, key markets and customers; and finally, we must adapt our culture and business model to evolve as the world changes around us. Specifically, this includes driving the success of our key in-line brands, including JANUVIA, launching new indications for KEYTRUDA in more tumor types and launching ZEPATIER, which received approval from the FDA just last week. We also anticipate several important pipeline catalysts this year, which Roger will discuss in more detail shortly. 
Augmenting our pipeline with the best scientific and medical innovations also remains a key priority for us, and we are eager to continue to aggressively seek attractive external opportunities that can further bolster our scientific leadership, while complementing the current assets in our pipeline.
In closing, in 2016, we will build upon the strong foundation we established last year. We will continue to invest resources to launch and grow our strongest brands, support the most promising internal assets, enhance our pipeline with the best available external science and maintain a balanced and differentiated portfolio, all with the goal of delivering long-term growth and shareholder value.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis."

As Ken referenced, 2015 reflected another solid year of operational performance at Merck. We delivered full year revenues of $39.5 billion, which was in the upper part of our original guidance range despite a slightly higher than expected foreign exchange impact for the year.
In addition, as a result of our continued focus on transforming our business model, we were able to deliver full year non-GAAP EPS of $3.59, $0.12 higher than the upper end of our original 2015 guidance range. We also returned over $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This strong performance was driven by our continued focus on prioritizing resources to our highest growth areas and reducing net cost by more than $2.5 billion versus 2012, while investing in key in-line brands, including JANUVIA, maximizing launches, such as KEYTRUDA, and strategically investing in R&D and business development to drive a pipeline that will deliver long-term results.
Now let me turn to some specifics for the fourth quarter, and my remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. In the fourth quarter, we delivered a leveraged P&L, with growth excluding exchange on both the top and bottom lines. Total company revenues were $10.2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 3% year-over-year, including 7 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of the exchange, fourth quarter revenues grew 4%.
It's worth mentioning that approximately $110 million of our foreign exchange impact on revenues in the quarter was due to a devaluation of our operations in Venezuela where we began using the Simadi rate in the fourth quarter. Given the current and expected conditions in that market, we anticipate continuing to use the Simadi rate for our P&L in 2016.
In addition, the solid results for Global Human Health in the quarter, which Adam will discuss in a few minutes. The Animal Health business also had a good quarter, with sales growing 8%, excluding exchange. Sales of companion animal products led by BRAVECTO as well as foreign products accounted for the majority of the growth.
Turning to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 74.8% in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points year-over-year. Full year gross margin increased 150 basis points to 75.4%. Lower discards and foreign exchange drove the overall improvement in margin percentage.
We continue to manage expenses in Q4, with decreases in both marketing and administrative costs as well as R&D as operational efficiencies more than offset our investments supporting key products and new launches. On a full year basis, we delivered operating expenses in line with our guidance, with meaningful savings in marketing and administrative expenses more than offsetting modest increases in R&D.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.4%, resulting in a full year tax rate of 21.7%. The quarterly and full year rates reflect the benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit.
Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter, delivering 13% growth, excluding exchange, on the bottom line and significant P&L leverage. 
Now let's turn to guidance and our outlook for 2016. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against virtually all other currencies, we anticipate foreign exchange will have a meaningful impact again in 2016. We expect revenues to be $38.7 billion to $40.2 billion using mid-January exchange rates, which reflects an approximately 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.
Excluding the impact of exchange, we expect the low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 as new product launches more than offset the impact from generic and biosimilar competition. Our guidance range also assumes negligible revenues from Venezuela compared to $625 million in the full year of 2015. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $3.60 to $3.75, which also reflects on approximately 4 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-January rates. 2016 EPS growth would be in the mid- to high single digits, excluding the impact of exchange. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings between $1.96 and $2.23.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes 2016 product gross margin will be roughly flat compared to 2015. In addition, we expect operating expenses to be generally in line with prior year. We will continue to invest in direct selling and promotion to support new product launches while reducing administrative expenses as we continue to focus our operating model. We remain committed to delivering a leveraged P&L, and we will monitor our new launches in key products throughout the year and flex resources as appropriate.
Regarding tax, we expect the full year non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 21.5% to 22.5%, which includes the benefit from the recently renewed R&D tax credit.
Finally, we project average diluted shares outstanding of 2.78 billion for 2016, reflecting a decrease versus the prior year as we continue our share repurchase program.
The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year of execution. We expect this momentum to continue into 2016 as we further innovate in our labs, invest behind our launches and continue our focus on disciplined resource allocation and continuous productivity to deliver a leveraged P&L and shareholder returns.
Now I'll turn the call over to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on Global Human Health performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015. My comments will be on a constant-currency basis.
Total sales reached $34.8 billion in 2015, reflecting growth of 4%. In our fourth quarter, sales reached $9 billion and also grew 4%. Excluding Cubist and divestitures, Human Health sales grew 2% in 2015. 
Moving now to priority franchise updates. I'll start with the JANUVIA franchise. The JANUVIA franchise grew 7% in 2015, driven primarily by volume increases. However, in the fourth quarter, U.S. revenue was impacted by a significant reduction in channel inventory, following the buy-in that we saw in the third quarter. It's important to note that underlying volume maintained growth of about 3% in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. Despite increased pricing pressure, we expect to grow the JANUVIA franchise in 2016 ex exchange. We have maintained a high market share of about 75% in the U.S. and 65% globally. Volume increases in the U.S. and internationally position a patient experience with our medicine, and macro trends that support a growing market all reinforce our confidence in JANUVIA.
Moving to Hospital and Specialty Care. Our hospital acute care business grew 11% in 2015, excluding Cubist. Sales in the fourth quarter reached more than $600 million and grew 7%. Performance was driven by our antibiotic and antifungal treatments as well as by Bridion in the international markets. In addition, we are currently launching Bridion in the U.S. While it's still early, customer feedback is very positive on this new product that uniquely reverses the neuromuscular block following surgery.
We're also excited to be launching ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in the U.S. and Canada. ZEPATIER offers a competitive profile and high cure rates with 12 weeks of therapy for the vast majority of patients in a one pill once-a-day treatment. ZEPATIER is differentiated versus other options, including consistent dosing regardless of cirrhosis status, renal impairment or use of PPIs and another acid-reducing agents. We believe our payer and pricing strategy will maximize ZEPATIER revenue and market share as well as broaden and accelerate patient access. We are enthusiastic to be back in this important market, and our teams are rapidly deploying to capitalize on this opportunity.
Moving to vaccines. The vaccines portfolio grew 3%, with sales of $5.7 billion in 2015. In the fourth quarter, sales reached approximately $1.7 billion and grew 5% on strong performance for GARDASIL. GARDASIL growth was aided by timing of public sector purchases in the U.S. of about $50 million and timing of government purchases in Brazil in the fourth quarter. GARDASIL 9 now represents approximately 90% of sales in the U.S. as our teams have executed well on converting customers to 9-valent vaccine.
Zostavax sales declined 11% in the fourth quarter, resulting from a very weak flu season in the U.S. We continue to work to educate customers on the reimbursement for Zostavax and to invest in direct-to-consumer advertising for this important brand.
Finally, I'd like to spend a few moments commenting on the continued launch of KEYTRUDA. In the fourth quarter, sales were approximately $215 million, driving strong full year sales of more than $560 million. Our performance was driven largely by the refractory melanoma indication in the U.S. as well as ongoing launches in more than 40 markets ex U.S. In late 2015, we received approval in the United States for first-line treatment of advanced melanoma regardless of BRAF status. The sales force is launching this indication as we speak. 
Looking into 2016 and beyond, we remain enthusiastic about the potential for KEYTRUDA across markets and across cancer types. We are building a critical foundation for PD-L1 testing in lung cancer as we launched its second line. We believe this will help to set the stage for when a first-line indication is achieved. We have now demonstrated overall survival management for KEYTRUDA versus standard of care in both lung cancer and melanoma, which strengthens our belief that KEYTRUDA has a potential to become foundational to the treatment of cancer over time. With more than 200 critical trials and more than 100 combinations in over 30 tumor types, we see the potential to drive significant growth for KEYTRUDA over the long term.
In summary, Global Human Health delivered a solid performance in 2015. In 2016, we'll continue to prioritize resources, focusing on JANUVIA, hospital acute care, vaccines and important product launches, including ZEPATIER and KEYTRUDA. The strength of our underlying business, the continued execution of our strategy and the launch opportunities before us position us well for the year ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

I'll provide a brief update on our progress in key programs during the fourth quarter, and we'll note opportunities for further advancement in 2016. 
The fourth quarter was an important one for KEYTRUDA. Our U.S. label was updated to include data from our 006 study in melanoma, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA treatment is superior to ipilimumab, the prior standard of care in the first-line treatment of advanced melanoma, and is judged by improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival.
Data from the 002 study, in which KEYTRUDA treatment proved superior as shown by progression-free survival, the traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy was also added to our label. Hence, in the United States, as in Europe, our KEYTRUDA label documents the superior effect of this treatment for advanced melanoma as compared with other interventions.
Also in the fourth quarter, we presented data from our KEYNOTE-010 study, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA provides superior overall survival as compared with docetaxel treatment in non-small cell lung cancer in patients with PD-L1 expression of 1% or more. This study was presented at the ESMO Asia Meeting, simultaneously published in The Lancet and has already been included in NCCN guidelines for lung cancer treatment. These data have also been submitted for review in the United States and in Europe.
Looking ahead for KEYTRUDA, 2016 promises to be a very exciting year. We'll see data from our KEYNOTE-024 first-line non-small cell lung cancer trial, comparing treatment with the range of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens to KEYTRUDA monotherapy by midyear. Primary endpoint is progression-free survival.
Our KEYNOTE-055 study, which evaluates response rates in head and neck cancer following KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients who have failed both platinum agents and cetuximab treatment, will also provide important new data.
Looking still further ahead, there are multiple opportunities for filings in other tumor types, including bladder cancer and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, depending upon the results that we observe. As we have noted, the KEYTRUDA development program is exceptionally broad, with the registration-enabling studies underway in more than a dozen tumor types. We do view KEYTRUDA as providing a foundation for the next-generation treatment of malignant disease. Along these lines, we're also studying combinations with cytotoxic agents, targeted therapies, vaccines and other immunomodulatory agents.
In 2015, we gained access to a Phase I cCAM-directed antibody program which complements our internal clinical programs that target GITR, I-O 10[ph] and many other axes. In all, we have more than 100 combination studies underway, as Adam mentioned. 
A few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of IOmet, through which we will gain access to a set of IDO1 and TDO 1 small molecule antagonists, we've previously presented data in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte, suggesting that KEYTRUDA may be fruitfully combined with their IDO1 inhibitor, and a Phase III study using this agent will soon begin enrolling patients with melanoma. Our acquisition of IOmet will permit us to explore the utility of IDO1 inhibition much more broadly.
Last week, we announced the approval of ZEPATIER in the United States. ZEPATIER was the subject of 2 breakthrough designations and was evaluated promptly by our priority review. A key strength of ZEPATIER is the fact that it can be used without dose adjustment in patients with chronic renal failure, a group that suffers from increased rates of HCV infection. Going forward, in 2016, we expect to complete Phase IIb and initiate Phase III studies for new regimens that include MK -- our 3682, a uridental nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, and MK-8408, a next-generation highly active NS5A inhibitor. These programs emphasize our commitment to complete a care of patients with HCV infection, where the goal should certainly be to cure as many patients as possible using appropriate and effective regimens.
Our 2016 plan includes numerous other approvals and filings. As we have announced previously, bezlotoxumab, our therapy designed to reduce recurrences of Clostridium difficile-associated enterocolitis, received priority review designation from the FDA with a PDUFA date in July. In 2016, we expect to complete our Phase III program and our filing for ertugliflozin as both single agent and in combination with JANUVIA. And we will obtain adjudicated data supporting the filing of odanacatib.
 
We'll have the opportunity to review Phase III data from our inactivated varicella zoster vaccine in immunocompromised populations and from our Phase III program studying letermovir as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus activation in patients receiving bone marrow transplants. 
In collaboration with our colleagues at Bayer, we'll begin a Phase III heart failure program for vericiguat based on Phase II data that we presented last year, and we will also have a chance to see important early clinical data from our collaborations with NGM Pharmaceuticals in metabolic disease and from Moderna in the vaccine space. It will be a busy year. Now I'll turn the call over to Teri."

Progression-free survival is an accepted end point. So I think that's where we'll be with respect to first line. And with respect to the 010 study, I'm not sure exactly what you mean by PD-L1 minimal expressers. What we showed in the 010 study, of course, was that there was a treatment effect in the 1% expressers well as in the high expressers. We have noted that in PD-L1-negative populations with non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, it's not at all clear that there's a benefit that inures the patients who received PD-1-directed therapy. And that's true for every agent that's been studied, not just our own agents. So I think it is important to be looking at PD-L1 expression in order to decide who, in fact, should be treated with these agents.

Payers and your competitors in the space talk about long-term contracting. Knowing where your net pricing is coming in, or at least I think I know where it's coming in, and knowing the positioning of the product, which has some reasonable attributes, can you just talk about what we should expect in 2016? Consensus has, I think, around $600 million. I know you don't guide on the individual products normally, but give us some guidance here if you can, especially in the context of trying to bump what could be a high prevalence of long-term contracts. Second question, on 4-1BB. Pfizer made some positive comments yesterday. One of the products they've been studying with is your drug, KEYTRUDA. But I'm wondering about the longevity of that deal, and whether they could kick you to the curb potentially now that they have their own PD-L1? And then just a third quick question, does KEYNOTE-024 have an interim analysis? Bristol's first-line trial does not."

And let me give you some context, and I'll try to answer the question specifically on how we're thinking about the pricing reimbursement contracting strategy. But first of all, I agree with your comment that we do have a competitive product. And we have high cure rates. And if you look at our clinical trials in GT1 patients, it was 94% to 97%. If you look at GT4 patients, it's 97% to 100%. So we start off by showing we have very good efficacy with the product. I also believe we have some important differentiation with the product, right? Our dosing is not affected by the presence of compensated cirrhosis. If you look at the competition, they have to change their does there. You can use us with any degree of renal impairment. If you look at the competition, particularly in certain patients with renal impairment, they can't be used there. And also, you don't have to adjust our dose for acid-reducing agents such as PPIs. So I think those are some things we feel good about in terms of differentiating our product versus the competition in the marketplace. I think what we did was develop a real deliberate, and I believe, innovative pricing strategy to try to maximize the product and increase the number of appropriate patients treated. But the first thing I want to say is we want to be competitive across all segments, and we want to look at public, private. We want to work with managed care organizations and government agencies, et cetera, et cetera. So we plan to be competitive across all segments. And I believe that the strategy that we implemented could accelerate access to patients in certain segments, where access, frankly, has not been as broad to date, including those patients with medical needs in the Stage 4, 5, 6 CKD. So as you said, we don't give guidance for individual products. But we will provide updates as we go through the year. We're just launching right now. The product's not available in the market place yet, but it will be in a matter of days. And then I'll provide updates as we go through the year to give you a sense of where we are."

For example, in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, with immunization, with T-VEC, the oncolytic virus. And of course, we're doing our own studies with other checkpoint inhibitors and another immunogens. We're very pleased with our collaboration with Pfizer on 4-1BB. I believe that the plan is, assuming that it's accepted, to be able to present some of those data at ASCO. And I -- our expectation is that if it turns out that there's a good opportunity there, that we'll continue to collaborate. So I'm not really terribly concerned about not being able to take advantage of an important opportunity to help patients. With respect to KEYNOTE-024, the study is, of course, being continuously monitored by a data monitoring committee. But importantly, I mean, here we are in February, ClinicalTrials.gov, I think, has the end in June.

Jami, on the first-line opportunity and the size, just to remind you and everyone that our approach has been to ask the question of whether or not we can identify populations that would benefit especially from the treatment of KEYTRUDA. And we chose to use the PD-L1 expression as a marker for that. It's turned out that, that is a marker. And the reason, of course, is not because specifically the PD-L1 is that counter ligand for PD-1, but rather because PD-L1 is a marker for the presence of an immune response. And that PD-L1, as a result, is telling us that there already is a pre-existing immune response that can be enhanced by the addition of KEYTRUDA. The 024 study looks at those that are PD-L1 high. And what we've done in all of our studies is that we have looked at the PD-L1 high, those with the proportion scores above 50%, and then looked at those that are expressing PD-L1 above 1% and also looked at those that appeared not to be expressing PD-L1 as we move across the line. So for example, and we published in the New England Journal, that there was, in general, in general terms, in the 001 study in melanoma, in general, that those patients who were expressing more PD-L1 had better responses. We similarly published data in 010 study recently, showing that responses were better in the highest PD-L1 expressers, again, reflecting immune status. The 024 study looks at those that have the highest PD-L1 expression. It was about 25% of the first-line patient population. The 042 study will go on and look at patients who have the 1% cut point. And we'll begin to see the data across the entire first line. So we'll have an opportunity to look at that. Frankly, from a biological perspective, I really can't understand why it would be any different in the first-line population from what we've previously shown in other tumor populations, because again, PD-L1 expression is a reflection of the immune activity."

So I want to start by saying we're really pleased that JANUVIA grew 7% in 2015. And if you look at our underlying performance in fourth quarter, it was similar to the other quarters in the year. What you saw in fourth quarter was volume growth in the U.S. of about 3%, which was about the same as what you saw the quarter before and so forth. What happened was there was significant channel reductions that followed the third quarter buy-in, which I noted on the last call, was more than $100 million. And as you may recall, last quarter, the U.S. grew 22% for JANUVIA, and that's why I noted that there was buy-in, and we would expect to see buyout. So when you look at fourth quarter, I would look at the underlying performance, which remains similar to the other quarters, and I think we had a good year with JANUVIA showing 7% growth versus prior. When you look at 2016, despite increasing pricing pressure that we'll see in the United States and the biannual price declines that you see in Japan, we expect to grow the franchise globally when you exclude exchange, and what that means with regard to EMPA-REG, we don't see a significant impact in 2016. In fact, if you look at the earliest data that you can look at, we are seeing market share shifts within the SGLT2 class, but we're not seeing shifts between classes, between DPP-4s and SGLT2s. We'll continue to monitor that closely. We'll see when there's label changes or if there's potential guideline changes. But at this point in time, we feel confident that there should not be a significant impact in 2016 from the SGLT2 class. So let me answer your question on ZEPATIER, and I already stated that we think that we have a competitive product profile, and that's where it all starts. You have to have a competitive product profile to be successful in the marketplace. Our efficacy is good. We think we have strong differentiation versus the competitors. So price is always a lever that you can choose to utilize, but you don't necessarily have to utilize it nearly as much when you have a differentiated product that you think you can bring to market. So we'll continue to keep you updated on ZEPATIER as we move forward, but we're going to do everything we can to optimize and maximize that brand."

So on your question, we are seeing a little bit more pressure to earnings than we are in sales from foreign currency. The biggest single driver of that is really how our hedging is flowing through on a year-on-year basis. Recall that in 2015, we flagged in prior quarters and have received a meaningful benefit from hedge gains as a result of the positions we took. And that declines, that benefit of decline, as you look from '15 into '16, assuming constant rates, basically because of the fact that one of those hedges are in place and the gains on them are smaller. So that impact does cause a little bit more of the leveraging effect you're seeing between the top and the bottom line. Other than that, we generally see a proportional move between sales and earnings, but that's the biggest single driver.

When I look at the yield history, Schering-Plough is really one of the acquisitions that was quite successful with regard to gaining access to KEYTRUDA, having your BACE inhibitor advance forward. Can you just help me understand why these -- the smaller acquisitions are really the way to go? Obviously, you guys -- and identify those assets but it actually came from a larger deal and was clearly value-generating. And then separately, for Roger. Roger, where I'm a little perplexed on the timing. If I look at the development of the front-line lung situation, it seems like studies that finish faster in immuno-oncology consistently show a less robust result. So can you help me understand how the KEYNOTE-024 study has an opportunity to successfully complete earlier than expected and before some of the other competitor studies that are out there? And then my final question, just for Adam, when you look at -- I think you guys have been really respectful, basically not saying that you're going to win, but that you will have a foundational product in KEYTRUDA. When other competitors claim and state that they're going to win, particularly from a third or fourth or fifth position, how likely is it given what you've seen historically that, that is a realistic possibility, particularly in the space where new standards of care are being created?"

So some examples are FOSAMAX, which was the license bid or COZAAR. In my own experience, when I was on the legal side, the work that we did to get access to the DPP-4 technology through a German company, called Probiodrug, when those deals were done, people don't necessarily sit up and take notice of them, but JANUVIA was the result of that deal, which was done a number of years ago. And so what we have found in the past is the best way for us to create value is through those insights early on that allow us to acquire the kinds of things that you heard Roger talk about, NGM and Moderna. Our goal is to find those kinds of things before there's a bidding war to apply our scientific know-how, our development know-how, our molecular -- I'm sorry to say, our medicinal chemistry know-how, and to bring forward the kinds of molecules, like sitagliptin, that can actually be pretty important contributions to human health."

I've always said that I believe that this market is going to be a very large market, and that there's room for multiple competitors. I also believe that there'll be certain competitors that do really well in 1 tumor type and another competitor might get data in a different tumor type first, and therefore, you'll see differences based upon tumor type. It's not too different than if you look at the anti-TNF field, where you have multiple products, one might do better in GI. The other one might do better in rheumatoid arthritis, but they all tend to do very well and grow very fast. At the same time, I believe building a wall of data is important. And when you look at the size and the magnitude of our clinical trials, and when you look at the number of tumor types that we're studying, I think we're going to be in a very good position over the long term, and it's hard to think about late entrants coming in and having a strong position once you have that wall of data built. So I think the strategy that we put in place is the right strategy over time, and I think, over time, you'll see us in a leadership position."

Just to outline again what our strategy with respect to -- broadly with respect to these tumor types, as I mentioned in response to Jami Rubin's question, is that we've gone in and said, ""Let's look at the patient populations in which we expect to see the best results."" And those are the PD-L1 highs in the current formulations. It's not the only biomarker that we have and that we've evolved other better biomarkers, we believe, but it's one that's useful. In those patient populations, because a higher percentage of the treated patients in principle should respond, the result will be faster, but it shouldn't be less robust. In fact, in many cases, it would be more robust, simply in terms of the efficacy window. So that's the basis for why the 024 study, which is reading out in mid-year, has a good chance of succeeding. We don't know what the data are, but we're eager to see the data on PFS. And thereafter, the populations will broaden through 042 and through a whole variety of other studies that we're doing.

And one possibility certainly is that there isn't enough pre-existing immune response. And if we could stimulate that through, as you say, a new antigen vaccine, things might go better. We're interested in those kinds of strategies. We, of course, have used other vaccination strategies. I'd point out again, the oncolytic virus strategy, which appears to have some traction, and we are looking at the question of whether or not it's possible to use new antigens, and one of the issues is -- as I'm sure you realize, that introducing a bespoke therapy where each patient receives a unique new antigen cocktail will be very challenging from an industry perspective. So we're looking for those situations where there might be groups of new antigens that could be used, and would be able to improve responses in a large set of patients."

And with respect to the political and regulatory and legal issues around pricing pressures, obviously, the whole issue of pricing and affordability for patients is a significant one. It's a challenge that we have as a society. I think it's unfortunate that, that debate is being amplified and in some ways, distorted by some of the political rhetoric, especially having to do with the presidential election cycle. So from a pharma standpoint, as Chairman of Pharma, we continue to work, educate constituents in Washington, D.C. and around the country on how pharmaceuticals actually help reduce costs in the overall health care system, as well as the impact that they have on individuals as well. Now the reality of the world is -- as we're seeing, when there are these headlines, you tend to get congressional hearing and you tend to have state attorneys generals writing letters and things of that nature. And I take those things very seriously. But I also think that the most important thing that we can do as an industry is to continue to price our products consistent with the value that they provide to our customers, and to continue to try to educate again people about the long-term positive impact that the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals have on overall health care cost."

One of the things that we pointed out when we presented these data at the end of 2014 was that there was a larger than usual discrepancy in adverse experience reporting for investigators versus central review.

2015 was a year of considerable progress and execution for Merck. We continue to focus on the most exciting scientific and commercial opportunities in front of us, advancing our pipeline, securing new product approvals and launching expanded indications for key products. I'm pleased that our operating performance across our research and commercial organization, including rigorous cost management, enabled us to exceed our EPS commitment in 2015. 
Despite strong currency headwinds, we were able to deliver growth in 2015, and we expect to deliver growth again in 2016. In fact, 2016 represents the first year in several years in which Merck's new product sales growth, driven primarily by ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C product, and KEYTRUDA, are expected to contribute meaningfully above the impact of the products that are losing exclusivity. 
To ensure continued progress, it is imperative that we remain focused on 3 priorities: first, we must innovate across all aspects of our business that we can pursue and deliver the most promising medical breakthroughs; second, we must execute in our labs and in our markets around the world to deliver results by prioritizing resources to the highest growth areas, key markets and customers; and finally, we must adapt our culture and business model to evolve as the world changes around us. Specifically, this includes driving the success of our key in-line brands, including JANUVIA, launching new indications for KEYTRUDA in more tumor types and launching ZEPATIER, which received approval from the FDA just last week. We also anticipate several important pipeline catalysts this year, which Roger will discuss in more detail shortly. 
Augmenting our pipeline with the best scientific and medical innovations also remains a key priority for us, and we are eager to continue to aggressively seek attractive external opportunities that can further bolster our scientific leadership, while complementing the current assets in our pipeline.
In closing, in 2016, we will build upon the strong foundation we established last year. We will continue to invest resources to launch and grow our strongest brands, support the most promising internal assets, enhance our pipeline with the best available external science and maintain a balanced and differentiated portfolio, all with the goal of delivering long-term growth and shareholder value.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis."

As Ken referenced, 2015 reflected another solid year of operational performance at Merck. We delivered full year revenues of $39.5 billion, which was in the upper part of our original guidance range despite a slightly higher than expected foreign exchange impact for the year.
In addition, as a result of our continued focus on transforming our business model, we were able to deliver full year non-GAAP EPS of $3.59, $0.12 higher than the upper end of our original 2015 guidance range. We also returned over $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This strong performance was driven by our continued focus on prioritizing resources to our highest growth areas and reducing net cost by more than $2.5 billion versus 2012, while investing in key in-line brands, including JANUVIA, maximizing launches, such as KEYTRUDA, and strategically investing in R&D and business development to drive a pipeline that will deliver long-term results.
Now let me turn to some specifics for the fourth quarter, and my remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. In the fourth quarter, we delivered a leveraged P&L, with growth excluding exchange on both the top and bottom lines. Total company revenues were $10.2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 3% year-over-year, including 7 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of the exchange, fourth quarter revenues grew 4%.
It's worth mentioning that approximately $110 million of our foreign exchange impact on revenues in the quarter was due to a devaluation of our operations in Venezuela where we began using the Simadi rate in the fourth quarter. Given the current and expected conditions in that market, we anticipate continuing to use the Simadi rate for our P&L in 2016.
In addition, the solid results for Global Human Health in the quarter, which Adam will discuss in a few minutes. The Animal Health business also had a good quarter, with sales growing 8%, excluding exchange. Sales of companion animal products led by BRAVECTO as well as swine products accounted for the majority of the growth.
Turning to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 74.8% in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points year-over-year. Full year gross margin increased 150 basis points to 75.4%. Lower discards and foreign exchange drove the overall improvement in margin percentage.
We continue to manage expenses in Q4, with decreases in both marketing and administrative costs as well as R&D as operational efficiencies more than offset our investments supporting key products and new launches. On a full year basis, we delivered operating expenses in line with our guidance, with meaningful savings in marketing and administrative expenses more than offsetting modest increases in R&D.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.4%, resulting in a full year tax rate of 21.7%. The quarterly and full year rates reflect the benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit.
Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter, delivering 13% growth, excluding exchange, on the bottom line and significant P&L leverage. 
Now let's turn to guidance and our outlook for 2016. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against virtually all other currencies, we anticipate foreign exchange will have a meaningful impact again in 2016. We expect revenues to be $38.7 billion to $40.2 billion using mid-January exchange rates, which reflects an approximately 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.
Excluding the impact of exchange, we expect the low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 as new product launches more than offset the impact from generic and biosimilar competition. Our guidance range also assumes negligible revenues from Venezuela compared to $625 million in the full year of 2015. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $3.60 to $3.75, which also reflects an approximately 4 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-January rates. 2016 EPS growth would be in the mid- to high single digits, excluding the impact of exchange. On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $1.96 and $2.23.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes 2016 product gross margin will be roughly flat compared to 2015. In addition, we expect operating expenses to be generally in line with prior year. We will continue to invest in direct selling and promotion to support new product launches while reducing administrative expenses as we continue to focus our operating model. We remain committed to delivering a leveraged P&L, and we will monitor our new launches in key products throughout the year and flex resources as appropriate.
Regarding tax, we expect the full year non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 21.5% to 22.5%, which includes the benefit from the recently renewed R&D tax credit.
Finally, we project average diluted shares outstanding of 2.78 billion for 2016, reflecting a decrease versus the prior year as we continue our share repurchase program.
The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year of execution. We expect this momentum to continue into 2016 as we further innovate in our labs, invest behind our launches and continue our focus on disciplined resource allocation and continuous productivity to deliver a leveraged P&L and shareholder returns.
Now I'll turn the call over to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on Global Human Health performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015. My comments will be on a constant-currency basis.
Total sales reached $34.8 billion in 2015, reflecting growth of 4%. In our fourth quarter, sales reached $9 billion and also grew 4%. Excluding Cubist and divestitures, Human Health sales grew 2% in 2015. 
Moving now to priority franchise updates. I'll start with the JANUVIA franchise. The JANUVIA franchise grew 7% in 2015, driven primarily by volume increases. However, in the fourth quarter, U.S. revenue was impacted by a significant reduction in channel inventory, following the buy-in that we saw in the third quarter. It's important to note that underlying volume maintained growth of about 3% in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. Despite increased pricing pressure, we expect to grow the JANUVIA franchise in 2016 ex exchange. We have maintained a high market share of about 75% in the U.S. and 65% globally. Volume increases in the U.S. and internationally, physician and patient experience with our medicine, and macro trends that support a growing market all reinforce our confidence in JANUVIA.
Moving to Hospital and Specialty Care. Our hospital acute care business grew 11% in 2015, excluding Cubist. Sales in the fourth quarter reached more than $600 million and grew 7%. Performance was driven by our antibiotic and antifungal treatments as well as by Bridion in the international markets. In addition, we are currently launching Bridion in the U.S. While it's still early, customer feedback is very positive on this new product that uniquely reverses the neuromuscular block following surgery.
We're also excited to be launching ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in the U.S. and Canada. ZEPATIER offers a competitive profile and high cure rates with 12 weeks of therapy for the vast majority of patients in a one pill once-a-day treatment. ZEPATIER is differentiated versus other options, including consistent dosing regardless of cirrhosis status, renal impairment or use of PPIs and other acid-reducing agents. We believe our payer and pricing strategy will maximize ZEPATIER revenue and market share as well as broaden and accelerate patient access. We are enthusiastic to be back in this important market, and our teams are rapidly deploying to capitalize on this opportunity.
Moving to vaccines. The vaccines portfolio grew 3%, with sales of $5.7 billion in 2015. In the fourth quarter, sales reached approximately $1.7 billion and grew 5% on strong performance for GARDASIL. GARDASIL growth was aided by timing of public sector purchases in the U.S. of about $50 million and timing of government purchases in Brazil in the fourth quarter. GARDASIL 9 now represents approximately 90% of sales in the U.S. as our teams have executed well on converting customers to 9-valent vaccine.
Zostavax sales declined 11% in the fourth quarter, resulting from a very weak flu season in the U.S. We continue to work to educate customers on the reimbursement for Zostavax and to invest in direct-to-consumer advertising for this important brand.
Finally, I'd like to spend a few moments commenting on the continued launch of KEYTRUDA. In the fourth quarter, sales were approximately $215 million, driving strong full year sales of more than $560 million. Our performance was driven largely by the refractory melanoma indication in the U.S. as well as ongoing launches in more than 40 markets ex U.S. In late 2015, we received approval in the United States for first-line treatment of advanced melanoma regardless of BRAF status. The sales force is launching this indication as we speak. 
Looking into 2016 and beyond, we remain enthusiastic about the potential for KEYTRUDA across markets and across cancer types. We are building a critical foundation for PD-L1 testing in lung cancer as we launched its second line. We believe this will help to set the stage for when a first-line indication is achieved. We have now demonstrated overall survival benefits for KEYTRUDA versus standard of care in both lung cancer and melanoma, which strengthens our belief that KEYTRUDA has a potential to become foundational to the treatment of cancer over time. With more than 200 clinical trials and more than 100 combinations in over 30 tumor types, we see the potential to drive significant growth for KEYTRUDA over the long term.
In summary, Global Human Health delivered a solid performance in 2015. In 2016, we'll continue to prioritize resources, focusing on JANUVIA, hospital acute care, vaccines and important product launches, including ZEPATIER and KEYTRUDA. The strength of our underlying business, the continued execution of our strategy and the launch opportunities before us position us well for the year ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

I'll provide a brief update on our progress in key programs during the fourth quarter, and we'll note opportunities for further advancement in 2016. 
The fourth quarter was an important one for KEYTRUDA. Our U.S. label was updated to include data from our 006 study in melanoma, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA treatment is superior to ipilimumab, the prior standard of care in the first-line treatment of advanced melanoma, and is judged by improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival.
Data from the 002 study, in which KEYTRUDA treatment proved superior assessed by progression-free survival, the traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy was also added to our label. Hence, in the United States, as in Europe, our KEYTRUDA label documents the superior effect of this treatment for advanced melanoma as compared with other interventions.
Also in the fourth quarter, we presented data from our KEYNOTE-010 study, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA provides superior overall survival as compared with docetaxel treatment in non-small cell lung cancer in patients with PD-L1 expression of 1% or more. This study was presented at the ESMO Asia Meeting, simultaneously published in The Lancet and has already been included in NCCN guidelines for lung cancer treatment. These data have also been submitted for review in the United States and in Europe.
Looking ahead for KEYTRUDA, 2016 promises to be a very exciting year. We'll see data from our KEYNOTE-024 first-line non-small cell lung cancer trial, comparing treatment with the range of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens to KEYTRUDA monotherapy by midyear. Primary endpoint is progression-free survival.
Our KEYNOTE-055 study, which evaluates response rates in head and neck cancer following KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients who have failed both platinum agents and cetuximab treatment, will also provide important new data.
Looking still further ahead, there are multiple opportunities for filings in other tumor types, including bladder cancer and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, depending upon the results that we observe. As we have noted, the KEYTRUDA development program is exceptionally broad, with the registration-enabling studies underway in more than a dozen tumor types. We do view KEYTRUDA as providing a foundation for the next-generation treatment of malignant disease. Along these lines, we're also studying combinations with cytotoxic agents, targeted therapies, vaccines and other immunomodulatory agents.
In 2015, we gained access to a Phase I cCAM-directed antibody program which complements our internal clinical programs that target GITR, I-O 10[ph] and many other axes. In all, we have more than 100 combination studies underway, as Adam mentioned. 
A few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of IOmet, through which we will gain access to a set of IDO1 and TDO 1 small molecule antagonists, we've previously presented data in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte, suggesting that KEYTRUDA may be fruitfully combined with their IDO1 inhibitor, and a Phase III study using this agent will soon begin enrolling patients with melanoma. Our acquisition of IOmet will permit us to explore the utility of IDO1 inhibition much more broadly.
Last week, we announced the approval of ZEPATIER in the United States. ZEPATIER was the subject of 2 breakthrough designations and was evaluated promptly by our priority review. A key strength of ZEPATIER is the fact that it can be used without dose adjustment in patients with chronic renal failure, a group that suffers from increased rates of HCV infection. Going forward, in 2016, we expect to complete Phase IIb and initiate Phase III studies for new regimens that include MK -- our 3682, a uridinyl nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, and MK-8408, a next-generation highly active NS5A inhibitor. These programs emphasize our commitment to complete a care of patients with HCV infection, where the goal should certainly be to cure as many patients as possible using appropriate and effective regimens.
Our 2016 plan includes numerous other approvals and filings. As we have announced previously, bezlotoxumab, our therapy designed to reduce recurrences of Clostridium difficile-associated enterocolitis, received priority review designation from the FDA with a PDUFA date in July. In 2016, we expect to complete our Phase III program and our filing for ertugliflozin as both single agent and in combination with JANUVIA. And we will obtain adjudicated data supporting the filing of odanacatib.
 
We'll have the opportunity to review Phase III data from our inactivated varicella zoster vaccine in immunocompromised populations and from our Phase III program studying letermovir as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus activation in patients receiving bone marrow transplants. 
In collaboration with our colleagues at Bayer, we'll begin a Phase III heart failure program for vericiguat based on Phase II data that we presented last year, and we will also have a chance to see important early clinical data from our collaborations with NGM Pharmaceuticals in metabolic disease and from Moderna in the vaccine space. It will be a busy year. Now I'll turn the call over to Teri."

In these studies, we do permit crossover. It's really necessary to do that in these studies. And so you're really comparing the early versus late access to KEYTRUDA. That's understood. Progression-free survival is an accepted end point. So I think that's where we'll be with respect to first line. And with respect to the 010 study, I'm not sure exactly what you mean by PD-L1 minimal expressers. What we showed in the 010 study, of course, was that there was a treatment effect in the 1% expressers well as in the high expressers. We have noted that in PD-L1-negative populations with non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, it's not at all clear that there's a benefit that inures the patients who received PD-1-directed therapy. And that's true for every agent that's been studied, not just our own agents. So I think it is important to be looking at PD-L1 expression in order to decide who, in fact, should be treated with these agents. Adam may have some other thoughts about PD-L1 expression in the second line."

I know you don't guide on the individual products normally, but give us some guidance here if you can, especially in the context of trying to bump what could be a high prevalence of long-term contracts. Second question, on 4-1BB. Pfizer made some positive comments yesterday. One of the products they've been studying with is your drug, KEYTRUDA. But I'm wondering about the longevity of that deal, and whether they could kick you to the curb potentially now that they have their own PD-L1?

And let me give you some context, and I'll try to answer the question specifically on how we're thinking about the pricing reimbursement contracting strategy. But first of all, I agree with your comment that we do have a competitive product. And we have high cure rates. And if you look at our clinical trials in GT1 patients, it was 94% to 97%. If you look at GT4 patients, it's 97% to 100%. So we start off by showing we have very good efficacy with the product. I also believe we have some important differentiation with the product, right? Our dosing is not affected by the presence of compensated cirrhosis. If you look at the competition, they have to change their dose there. You can use us with any degree of renal impairment. If you look at the competition, particularly in certain patients with renal impairment, they can't be used there. And also, you don't have to adjust our dose for acid-reducing agents such as PPIs. So I think those are some things we feel good about in terms of differentiating our product versus the competition in the marketplace. I think what we did was develop a real deliberate, and I believe, innovative pricing strategy to try to maximize the product and increase the number of appropriate patients treated. But the first thing I want to say is we want to be competitive across all segments, and we want to look at public, private. We want to work with managed care organizations and government agencies, et cetera, et cetera. So we plan to be competitive across all segments. And I believe that the strategy that we implemented could accelerate access to patients in certain segments, where access, frankly, has not been as broad to date, including those patients with medical needs in the Stage 4, 5, 6 CKD. So as you said, we don't give guidance for individual products. But we will provide updates as we go through the year. We're just launching right now. The product's not available in the market place yet, but it will be in a matter of days. And then I'll provide updates as we go through the year to give you a sense of where we are."

For example, in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, with immunization, with T-VEC, the oncolytic virus. And of course, we're doing our own studies with other checkpoint inhibitors and other immunogens. We're very pleased with our collaboration with Pfizer on 4-1BB. I believe that the plan is, assuming that it's accepted, to be able to present some of those data at ASCO. And I -- our expectation is that if it turns out that there's a good opportunity there, that we'll continue to collaborate. So I'm not really terribly concerned about not being able to take advantage of an important opportunity to help patients. With respect to KEYNOTE-024, the study is, of course, being continuously monitored by a data monitoring committee.

Jami, on the first-line opportunity and the size, just to remind you and everyone that our approach has been to ask the question of whether or not we can identify populations that would benefit especially from the treatment of KEYTRUDA. And we chose to use the PD-L1 expression as a marker for that. It's turned out that, that is a marker. And the reason, of course, is not because specifically the PD-L1 is that counter ligand for PD-1, but rather because PD-L1 is a marker for the presence of an immune response. And that PD-L1, as a result, is telling us that there already is a pre-existing immune response that can be enhanced by the addition of KEYTRUDA. The 024 study looks at those that are PD-L1 high. And what we've done in all of our studies is that we have looked at the PD-L1 high, those with the proportion scores above 50%, and then looked at those that are expressing PD-L1 above 1% and also looked at those that appeared not to be expressing PD-L1 as we move across the line. So for example, and we published in the New England Journal, that there was, in general, in general terms, in the 001 study in melanoma, in general, that those patients who were expressing more PD-L1 had better responses. We similarly published data in 010 study recently, showing that responses were better in the highest PD-L1 expressers, again, reflecting immune status. The 024 study looks at those that have the highest PD-L1 expression. It was about 25% of the first-line patient population. The 042 study will go on and look at patients who have the 1% cut point. And we'll begin to see the data across the entire first line. So we'll have an opportunity to look at that. Frankly, from a biological perspective, I really can't understand why it would be any different in the first-line population from what we've previously shown in other tumor populations, because again, PD-L1 expression is a reflection of the immune activity."

So I want to start by saying we're really pleased that JANUVIA grew 7% in 2015. And if you look at our underlying performance in fourth quarter, it was similar to the other quarters in the year. What you saw in fourth quarter was volume growth in the U.S. of about 3%, which was about the same as what you saw the quarter before and so forth. What happened was there was significant channel reductions that followed the third quarter buy-in, which I noted on the last call, was more than $100 million. And as you may recall, last quarter, the U.S. grew 22% for JANUVIA, and that's why I noted that there was buy-in, and we would expect to see buyout. So when you look at fourth quarter, I would look at the underlying performance, which remains similar to the other quarters, and I think we had a good year with JANUVIA showing 7% growth versus prior. When you look at 2016, despite increasing pricing pressure that we'll see in the United States and the biannual price declines that you see in Japan, we expect to grow the franchise globally when you exclude exchange, and what that means with regard to EMPA-REG, we don't see a significant impact in 2016. In fact, if you look at the earliest data that you can look at, we are seeing market share shifts within the SGLT2 class, but we're not seeing shifts between classes, between DPP-4s and SGLT2s. We'll continue to monitor that closely. We'll see when there's label changes or if there's potential guideline changes. But at this point in time, we feel confident that there should not be a significant impact in 2016 from the SGLT2 class. So let me answer your question on ZEPATIER, and I already stated that we think that we have a competitive product profile, and that's where it all starts. You have to have a competitive product profile to be successful in the marketplace. Our efficacy is good. We think we have strong differentiation versus the competitors. So price is always a lever that you can choose to utilize, but you don't necessarily have to utilize it nearly as much when you have a differentiated product that you think you can bring to market. So we'll continue to keep you updated on ZEPATIER as we move forward, but we're going to do everything we can to optimize and maximize that brand."

So on your question, we are seeing a little bit more pressure to earnings than we are in sales from foreign currency. The biggest single driver of that is really how our hedging is flowing through on a year-on-year basis. Recall that in 2015, we flagged in prior quarters and have received a meaningful benefit from hedge gains as a result of the positions we took. And that declines, that benefit of decline, as you look from '15 into '16, assuming constant rates, basically because of the fact that a lot of those hedges were in place and the gains on them were smaller. So that impact does cause a little bit more of the leveraging effect you're seeing between the top and the bottom line. Other than that, we generally see a proportional move between sales and earnings, but that's the biggest single driver. And then to your question of what we're looking at from a share count -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're assuming 2.70 billion shares as an average for 2016, which is a reduction from where we were in '15."

Ken, as I just listened to your comments, one of the things that I'm trying to better understand is can you give us a little bit of the history of Phase II and earlier stage deals, where Merck has successfully brought forward a product like that into development? When I look at the yield history, Schering-Plough is really one of the acquisitions that was quite successful with regard to gaining access to KEYTRUDA, having your BACE inhibitor advance forward. Can you just help me understand why these -- the smaller acquisitions are really the way to go? Obviously, you guys -- and identified those assets but it actually came from a larger deal and was clearly value-generating. And then separately, for Roger. Roger, where I'm a little perplexed on the timing. If I look at the development of the front-line lung situation, it seems like studies that finish faster in immuno-oncology consistently show a less robust result. So can you help me understand how the KEYNOTE-024 study has an opportunity to successfully complete earlier than expected and before some of the other competitor studies that are out there? And then my final question, just for Adam, when you look at -- I think you guys have been really respectful, basically not saying that you're going to win, but that you will have a foundational product in KEYTRUDA. When other competitors claim and state that they're going to win, particularly from a third or fourth or fifth position, how likely is it given what you've seen historically that, that is a realistic possibility, particularly in the space where new standards of care are being created?"

So some examples are FOSAMAX, which was the licensed in or COZAAR. In my own experience, when I was on the legal side, the work that we did to get access to the DPP-4 technology through a German company, called Probiodrug, when those deals were done, people don't necessarily sit up and take notice of them, but JANUVIA was the result of that deal, which was done a number of years ago. And so what we have found in the past is the best way for us to create value is through those insights early on that allow us to acquire the kinds of things that you heard Roger talk about, NGM and Moderna. Our goal is to find those kinds of things before there's a bidding war to apply our scientific know-how, our development know-how, our molecular -- I'm sorry to say, our medicinal chemistry know-how, and to bring forward the kinds of molecules, like sitagliptin, that can actually be pretty important contributions to human health."

I've always said that I believe that this market is going to be a very large market, and that there's room for multiple competitors. I also believe that there'll be certain competitors that do really well in 1 tumor type and another competitor might get data in a different tumor type first, and therefore, you'll see differences based upon tumor type. It's not too different than if you look at the anti-TNF field, where you have multiple products, one might do better in GI. The other one might do better in rheumatoid arthritis, but they all tend to do very well and grow very fast. At the same time, I believe building a wall of data is important. And when you look at the size and the magnitude of our clinical trials, and when you look at the number of tumor types that we're studying, I think we're going to be in a very good position over the long term, and it's hard to think about late entrants coming in and having a strong position once you have that wall of data built. So I think the strategy that we put in place is the right strategy over time, and I think, over time, you'll see us in a leadership position."

Just to outline again what our strategy with respect to -- broadly with respect to these tumor types, as I mentioned in response to Jami Rubin's question, is that we've gone in and said, ""Let's look at the patient populations in which we expect to see the best results."" And those are the PD-L1 highs in the current formulations. It's not the only biomarker that we have and that we've evolved other better biomarkers, we believe, but it's one that's useful. In those patient populations, because a higher percentage of the treated patients in principle should respond, the result will be faster, but it shouldn't be less robust. In fact, in many cases, it would be more robust, simply in terms of the efficacy window. So that's the basis for why the 024 study, which is reading out in mid-year, has a good chance of succeeding. We don't know what the data are, but we're eager to see the data on PFS. And thereafter, the populations will broaden through 042 and through a whole variety of other studies that we're doing. So that's the general strategy, and I think it's a good one because it focuses on those patients who need these therapies most."

But in a large number of patients, on more than half, we actually don't see a response. So why don't we see a response in that -- those patients? And one possibility certainly is that there isn't enough pre-existing immune response. And if we could stimulate that through, as you say, a neoantigen vaccine, things might go better. We're interested in those kinds of strategies. We, of course, have used other vaccination strategies. I'd point out again, the oncolytic virus strategy, which appears to have some traction, and we are looking at the question of whether or not it's possible to use new antigens, and one of the issues is -- as I'm sure you realize, that introducing a bespoke therapy where each patient receives a unique neoantigen cocktail will be very challenging from an industry perspective.

So from a pharma standpoint, as Chairman of PhRMA, we continue to work, educate constituents in Washington, D.C. and around the country on how pharmaceuticals actually help reduce costs in the overall health care system, as well as the impact that they have on individuals as well. Now the reality of the world is -- as we're seeing, when there are these headlines, you tend to get congressional hearing and you tend to have state attorneys generals writing letters and things of that nature. And I take those things very seriously. But I also think that the most important thing that we can do as an industry is to continue to price our products consistent with the value that they provide to our customers, and to continue to try to educate again people about the long-term positive impact that the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals have on overall health care cost."

And I think we potentially would have some areas of differentiation that could be important. In addition to that, I think we developed a good pricing strategy that's going to help ZEPATIER be successful in the marketplace. What we did was we priced our list price to be competitive where the market's current net prices are, and our list price makes us competitive across all segments, and I think it could potentially help us in some currently underserved segments. I think also lower list prices could potentially have a positive impact on out-of-pocket medication cost for some patients. There's some patients in Part D where the list price does matter in terms of the out-of-pocket cost, and I think it could be beneficial for us there. I wouldn't read into our discounting strategy based upon our initial pricing strategy. What we intend to do is to compete in all segments of the market, and to have an appropriate discounting strategy that allows us to have access."

And I said at the time that the benefit-risk profile for odanacatib appeared favorable. And so it's a novel oral therapy that does what it's supposed to do in terms of reducing fractures actually quite dramatically, quite impressively. In terms of clinical vertebral fractures, it's really the best that I've seen, and I've been doing this for a while. So it looks really quite good. One of the things that we pointed out when we presented these data at the end of 2014 was that there was a larger than usual discrepancy in adverse experience reporting for investigators versus central review. And in order to resolve that problem, we undertook an adjudication process, and that adjudication process has taken much longer than we imagined. We worked with FDA to define that process, and we've worked with an external organization to go through it. It took all of last year. We are nearly done.

We are off to a good start this year with our first quarter performance. Our KEYTRUDA program expanded as we continued to launch this important cancer medicine around the world. Also, in the first quarter, we launched our new hepatitis C medicine, ZEPATIER. In addition to these ongoing product launches, our key in-line brands performed well, particularly JANUVIA, which continues to command predominant share within the DPP-4 class. Adam will provide context on this shortly.
We remain committed to delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. To do so, we will stay true to our goal of becoming the premier research and intensive global by pharmaceutical company reform our the adjustment of the world's greatest health needs.

Our performance in the first quarter reflects our focus on execution and continued productivity improvements. We again delivered P&L leverage with growth excluding exchange on both the top and bottom line. Total company revenues were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, first quarter revenues grew 3%, driven by both our Human Health and Animal Health businesses.
Venezuela negatively impacted Q1 revenues by approximately $240 million, reflecting the reductions of our operations in the country. As a reminder, we recorded $625 million of sales in Venezuela in 2015, which were more weighted to the first half of the year. So the year-over-year impact will be greatest in the first 2 quarters of this year.
Looking to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 77% in the quarter, an increase of 50 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Lower discards were the biggest driver of the year-over-year improvement. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $3.9 billion was 3% lower year-over-year or roughly flat excluding foreign exchange favorability. Higher promotional spend behind our new products drove a slight increase in marketing and administrative were lower licensing expenses contributed to a decline in research and development.
Trading [ph] together, we earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter, delivering 10% growth, excluding exchange, which reflects our continued commitment to delivering a leveraged P&L.
Turning now to our outlook for the rest of the year. We are narrowing and raising our revenue and EPS guidance for 2016. While we are experiencing more favorable exchange rates versus our original guidance, we are facing a few headwinds, in particular, the entry of generic needs in the United States earlier than originally assumed; which we expect will partially offset the exchange rate favorability this year. We now expect full year 2015 revenues to be between $39 billion and $40.2 billion. This reflects an approximately 2% negative impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates.
We continue to expect our non-GAAP 2016 product gross margin and operating expenses to be roughly in line with 2015, and we still anticipate the non-GAAP tax rate for the full year to be between 21.5% and 22.5%. In terms of our 2016 EPS outlook, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $3.65 to $3.77. This reflects an approximately 2 percentage negative point impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates.
To summarize, we demonstrated strong performance, leveraging top line growth to deliver 10% growth in non-GAAP EPS, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We benefited from the contribution of new product launches while continuing to see growth in our key franchises and driving operational improvement across the company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger -- I'm sorry, to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on the Global Human Health performance for the first quarter, and the comments on the constant-currency basis.  We are off to a solid start to the year. Total Human Health sales reached $841 [ph] billion, growing 2%, and we grow growth across our core areas of diabetes, vaccines, hospital specialty care and oncology.
I would highlight few franchises and product launches, and I'll start with primary care. The JANUVIA franchise had a strong quarter, growing 4% globally. In the United States, sales grew 9%, driven primarily by volume increases and a some benefit from customer volume patterns. Outside of the U.S., we saw strong growth in Europe and Japan, offset by emerging markets which was impacted by Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, JANUVIA franchise sales grew 5% outside of the U.S.
First quarter results for JANUVIA demonstrate that we can't continue to grow volume and retain strong market share of about 75% in the United States and 65% globally. We continue to expect global JANUVIA franchise growth x exchange in 2016.
Now I'll move on to our vaccine business. Sales of our vaccines portfolio grew 1%, and reached about $1.3 [ph] billion, and steady growth in GARDASIL and pediatric vaccines, partially offset by declines in our adult singles vaccine ZOSTAVAX. ZOSTAVAX sales declined in the first quarter, resulting from a weaker flu season in the U.S., which leaves that less people go to get vaccinated in general, but also the recent changes to a CIA recommendations for pneumococci vaccines. We are actively working with customers to help them navigate the reimbursement for ZOSTAVAX, and expect this to be less of a hurdle over time.
Global GARDASIL franchise sales grew this quarter on continued strength in GARDASIL 9 launch in the U.S. We are encouraged by the recent CBC publication that reported a significant decrease in vaccines high [ph] HPV prevalence since the introduction of HPV vaccination in the United States. The reduction was 64% in females aged 14 to 19, and 34% in females aged 20 to 24. If you consider that this supports since impact only through 2012 and does not yet include males, it's because the parent that worry really can make a difference to prevent certain HPV-related cancers in the United States.
Next on Hospital and Specialty Care. Our acute care performance you performed well in the quarter on steady growth on antibiotics, antifungals and Bridion. We are also pleased to be adding to our specialty care business with the launch of ZEPATIER. 
Sales in the first quarter were $50 million. While we're still early in the launch, we are seeing positive signs that ZEPATIER will play an important role in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Our team is working to secure assets for separate year will cover systems currently in going with many different public and private payers. The addition of ZEPATIER to pulmonary at the Veterans Administration and with other customers reinforces our believe that our payer and our pricing strategy will maximize revenue and market share and it also broadened accelerate patient access.  Customers values ZEPATIER's profile, which offers high cure rates across a diverse group of patients. And we continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunity for ZEPATIER.
Finally, on oncology. We see significant potential for KEYTRUDA, which positions us as a global leader in immuno-oncology. And the first quarter sales reached approximately $250 million, and it continue to be driven by our melanoma indications as well as early [indiscernible] in the U.S. in lung cancer. We are working to integrate PD-L1 testing as part of the routine treatment of lung cancer by continuing to demonstrate the value testing physicians, the payers and to patients.
Testing rates in the United States continued to increase, which is important not only for our second line indication but we believe also for when we have a first-line indication. We also see very strong performance outside of the U.S, which represented nearly half of first quarter KEYTRUDA sales. We are launching in melanoma in approximately 50 markets globally. And in some markets, we are the market leader despite being second to launch.
Given a strong survival results through demonstrated in melanoma and second lung lung cancer, the early data we've seen in more than 20 cancer types, as well as the breadth and the depth of KEYTRUDA development program, we remain confident that KEYTRUDA will become foundational to the treatment of cancer over time.
In closing, we're off to a good start in 2016. This year, we will have to offset generic penetration of products Paris, including NASONEX and CUBICIN. However, our investments in JANUVIA and KEYTRUDA and in ZEPATIER and in other core areas, are delivering results and positioning us for future growth.

The momentum that our clinical development and regulatory groups established last year continues in 2016. I'll briefly review the highlights of the first quarter.
As has already mentioned, beginning in January, we obtain regulatory approval for ZEPATIER in Canada, the United States and Switzerland. And speaking with have pathologists and infectious disease specialists, there is general enthusiasm for the high cure rates observed for ZEPATIER, and the ability to use in separate year in patients with compromised renal function, including patients undergoing hemodialysis.
Public health organizations is increasingly embracing and the goal of large-scale elimination of hepatitis C infection, and we have been developing data, some of which we presented at the liver meetings in Barcelona last month, documenting the ability of ZEPATIER in this process, including in very difficult to treat patients who suffer from what opioid addiction.
As at a medicated, we've successfully launched ZEPATIER in the United States, and are seeking approval in many markets around the world. In the of our European review for ZEPATIER, the European Medicines Agency's cited Merck is third-party benefactor, issues largely related to inadequate record-keeping and the need for improvement in their quality of management systems. We are working assiduously with the regulators to resolve these issues. I should noted that we do not believe that the problems identified at our third manufacturer the safety, efficacy or quality specifications of the product, and we do not believe that these problems will affect the supply to the U.S. market.
Nevertheless, we take all matters related to good manufacturing prefaces very seriously, and we are working with regulatory agencies and the manufacturer to resolve these issues as expeditiously as possible. We continue to believe that EU approval can be achieved according to their mid-year time line that we perversely disclose. However, our European launch will be delayed until the fourth quarter or perhaps, until the end of the first quarter of 2017 not depending on how quickly these matters can be resolved.
For the registration process, ZEPATIER continues, we're also completing phase IIb studies of MK-3682 them, our uridinyl nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, when used in combination with ZEPATIER, or in combination with another advanced MS 5A in a better MK-8408. Data from these studies which will emerge over the next few months will permit defendant selection of the appropriate registration enabling regiments that will provide option for the estimated 150 million people around the world who are infected with hepatitis C virus. 
During the first quarter of our studies -- our studies of KEYTRUDA also events significantly in April, we announced the FBS attempted filing on a priority review basis for the use of KEYTRUDA in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, following platinum-based chemotherapy for the PDUFA date in early August. This filing makes use of the unit dosing and 200 milligrams every 3 weeks. We have shown that this dose yields exposure is comparable to those observed using weight-based dosing and you do dozing obviously relives providers of the responsibility of calculating patient-specific dose volumes.
Our head and neck cancer filing is reinforced by an exceptionally broad array of ongoing studies in this disease, including a control second line study that KEYNOTE-00240 study, our first-line study KEYNOTE-0048, which we'll provide data in 2017.
We're also testing the use of KEYTRUDA in combination with the radiation, with radiation plus chemotherapy with the T-VEC oncolytic virus in collaboration with our colleagues at Amgen, and with an IDO1 inhibitor in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte.
Substantial amount of important new data from our KEYTRUDA program will be presented in the American Society for Clinical Oncology Meeting next[ph]  months including results in head and neck cancer patients who failed both platinum and [indiscernible] therapy and long-term survival data in melanoma patients from our original KEYNOTE-001 study. 
Also in April, we announced that the FDA granted the forest break your destination for KEYTRUDA in the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. As Merck has shift [indiscernible] Dana-Farber Cancer research center showed in the paper published last month in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, amplification of the chromosomal locus including both PD-L1 and PD-L2 [indiscernible] is very common in Hodgkin lymphoma, and they represent a critical factor in the malignant transformation of [indiscernible] the characteristic cell type in this cancer.
This observation may help to explain why the very high response rates following KEYTRUDA treatment and Hodgkin's lymphoma patients are observed. Meanwhile, we continue to pursue registration for KEYTRUDA in second line lung cancer in Europe and are KEYNOTE-010 study, which will improve understanding of how best to use KEYTRUDA in this disease, is under review in the United States.
You'll recall that in the KEYNOTE-010 trial, KEYTRUDA treatment meaningfully improved overall survival in the patients with non-small cell lung cancer and histology of tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker of tumor cells as compared to what can be achieved using conventional docetaxel chemotherapy.
Our first-line study of KEYTRUDA KEYNOTE-024 comparing KEYTRUDA treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with a PD-L1 strongly positive tumors, remains on track to deliver data at mid year.
Finally, progress continues across a broad range of other programs, the cetuximab, our therapy designed to recurrences of C. difficile associated enterocolitis received priority review designation from the FDA with PDUFA date in July. The FDA will hold Advisory Committee meeting to review the [indiscernible] filing on June 9, and our filing is also under review in the European Union.
Clinical data are beginning to emerge for [indiscernible] which will support our comprehensive filing for this new molecular entity as both a single agent and in combination with JANUVIA or metformin by the end of the year. Separately, the long-awaited adjudication of our Phase III of [indiscernible] data now almost complete, with these data in hand, we will at last, be in a position to assemble retreat dossier supported the registration of this important once-weekly treatment for osteoporosis.
And among the many programs, for which considerable interest is expressed when I meet with external clinicians and scientists, is our Phase III trial studying with [indiscernible] as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus activation in patients receiving bone marrow transplant, we expect to have data in-house from this study by the end of the third quarter.

We're still in early in the latch but we have been working really hard to secure assets, and we have conversations ongoing across all segments, many different customers. Many of them are for access in 2017, but some of those such as the VA we're hoping to have access and sometime in 2016. So it's still a little bit too early to give you exactly accounts in the names of accounts. What I can tell you that we feel good about potential assets for '17, and then we'll see where we end up with up with '16, but I do think that there's opportunity there. And then if you look at how we're approaching the marketplace, we really are focusing on having access and it's important that we have parity with the competitors. So we're spending a lot of time trying to get access that parity across the different segments in the United States so that there's physician patient choice."

There's no mystery here really. The mechanisms for statistical analysis of these kinds of studies have been refined over a period of many decades, and while the statistical literature continues to advance in ways that are quite intriguing, the reality is that we have a lot of data based on all of the prior studies that we've done with the KEYTRUDA and with Opdivo, the studies that have been published with Opdivo as well that provide substantial amount of positive predictive value. So in a Bayesian sense, one can predict the outcomes fairly comfortably and we know, therefore, we could put that information into our power calculations. We have pretty good understanding of where we're going and when we have to look. Of course, you can get surprises in different tumor types. By I guess, one thing to stress is the general consistency of the responses that we've seen across a very large number of tumor types, both with respect to response rates and durability. So we don't find it mysterious. I think the explanation for the early stopping at the Bristol-Myers the studies is largely related to the size of the studies and -- more than anything else. And there's nothing special about non-proportional analysis."

If you look at where sales are coming from, the vast majority of the sales are still coming from melanoma indications. And if you look at that, a lot of it is still coming in second line, although we see first-line continuing to grow. Internationally, the sales are coming primarily, obviously, from our melanoma indication. As you start to think about lung, we are seeing increases in and the number of physicians that are testing patients now. And a lot of those increases are actually coming from patients with first line lung being captive. So the fact that we continue to encourage testing, believe, is only going to help us ultimately when we launch a first line lung. And then the first thing that you want to do is you want to see who gets the market first. And I think that, that always matters. So let's see who gets the market first in first line lung, and that will be an important milestone. So undoubtedly, she said, we have to see what the cutoff points are. But in addition to that, even the cutoff points -- we also have to see with the guidelines say, and how the reimbursement works. So I feel pretty good about where we are today.

But we -- our expectation is that monotherapy is rapidly going to move to combination therapy.

And clearly, your competitors have evolved pursued combinations either with IOR -- chemo combo. So just -- you have pursued a monotherapy strategy and are behind the curve on combination.

So I think those boards and those management teams are going through the process of letting those -- the new reality, if you will, settle in with them.

And Jami, on the general approach to how one treats cancer, I actually don't agree with your assessment of our strategy, so let me try and reinterpret a little bit for you. First of all, what of all said was in that it understands the benefits of combination therapy, you have to understand how monotherapy behaves. And we launched a very broad program in monotherapy with more than 30 different tumor types in many lines of therapy. But we've not shortened the combination studies. If you look on ClinicalTrials.gov right now, about something over 270 studies on ClinicalTrials.gov with KEYTRUDA I haven't checked today, more than 100 of those are combination studies. And it includes studies that are registration -- potentially registration enabling. If you look at the KEYNOTE-189 study for example, delivering data next year and combination with chemotherapy, in addition to, of course, combination with chemotherapy data we presented, there's quite a lot going on in combinations. , and we have combinations with radiation therapy, combinations with immunotherapies, combinations with traditional chemotherapies and combinations with targeted chemotherapies. And in addition, we have in the clinic, together LAG3, IL 10 and cCAM, which are our own Phase I programs that provide immuno-oncology molecules that could potentially be used in combination. So in totality, we have a very, very broad combination program, which includes both things that we own and things that either shouldn't be owned because they're in essence, generic, doing collaborations with others. And, for example, in the Arab program, we are both collaborating with Incyte, and we have our own programs that we own as well. So a lot of work going on and in combination. Our goal absolutely is to identify the very best possible regimens from the many thousands that you and I have discussed previously, the many thousands of regimens that potentially we'd employ in treating candid considerations."

It doesn't mean that we don't want to GLP-1 potentially or other types of diabetes medicines, but we look at those as their own opportunities.

I think you used the term bolt-on acquisitions in your release. Could you just help us understand a little bit how large a deal could be and still considered to be a bolt-on for Merck? I guess, for example, with Cubist or is there something that larger and have considered a bolt-on, or you should think about Merck targeting some smaller transactions here? My second question was on ZEPATIER and just the HCV market place in general. I think one of your competitors have added some pricing pressures in the space emerging again this year. I guess how do you see the pricing environment evolving over time with 3 main players in the space? And I guess specifically, should we think about price continue to erode here over time? Will you get more access, or we should think about the downward trend on price overall?"

It depends on what the company brings, what their pipeline brings, what level of scientific innovation they have internally, and how we believe it can complement our portfolio and pipeline going forward."

The problems do not affect, we do not believe, the safety efficacy or quality specifications of product. And hence, we do not believe the problems will affect the supply of the U.S. market. But we take these good manufacturing practice issues very seriously. And we're working with both regulatory agencies and the contract manufacturer to resolve the issues, as expeditiously as possible. And secondly with respect to [indiscernible], as you know, our program has been in the clinic for quite some time but we have been advancing it very slowly because of concerns in our part, on the part of regulators, too, we should consider his agonist antibody could stimulate a fairly profound immune activation response, and those responses can be difficult to manage. So we're just getting to the point of an advancing that program where we believe we're in a therapeutic range. We certainly do have data that our [indiscernible] is an agonist. I think one of the issues has to do with cross-linking and -- FC receptors are engaged by the therapy. As you know, we have 2 [indiscernible]  antibodies that are in the clinic. This a lot of enthusiasm in the community, but it will be some time, I think, before we understand whether to what extent antibodies will be useful."

And therefore, I think that the dosing for first-line lung patients could end up being an advantage for us if PD-L1 testing is communicated by all companies. But the other thing I want to emphasize as I said all along, this is a long term view of this market. There will be multiple competitors that can do really well in this market. I don't think we should look at any 1 quarter or short period of time. This market over the next several years with a number of tumor types that we're studying, with the amount of how well that were continuing to develop, combination products -- we can continue to do really well.

We have a 75% share in the U.S. and is 65% share globally.

Today, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs.
Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out a couple of items. First, you will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we've excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provided a reconciliation of these items in table 2 of our press release. We've also provided a table to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units and products, which can be found in Table 3 of our press release.
Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current belief of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2015 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. And you can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on www.merck.com.
With that, I'd like to show the call over to Ken."

We are off to a good start this year with our first quarter performance. Our KEYTRUDA program expanded as we continued to launch this important cancer medicine around the world. Also, in the first quarter, we launched our new hepatitis C medicine, ZEPATIER. In addition to these ongoing product launches, our key in-line brands performed well, particularly JANUVIA, which continues to command predominant share within the DPP-4 class. Adam will provide context on this shortly.
We remain committed to delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. To do so, we will stay true to our goal of becoming the premier research-intensive global biopharmaceutical company, bringing forward medically important products that address many of the world's greatest health needs. And above all, it is critical that we do this in a sustainable manner that enables us to continuously reinvest in R&D.
Business development remains one of our most important priorities, and we are very actively engaged in finding the best external innovation that will help grow our portfolio and pipeline. We are confident that our scientific discernment, coupled with financial discipline, will allow us to identify and acquire the right assets at the right valuation to create long-term value for shareholders consistent with our innovation strategy.
Before I conclude, let me also emphasize that we are fully engaged in the challenging policy environment that our industry experiences now. We are actively addressing the key policy issues that can have an impact on our ability to fund the discovery and development of the next generation of innovative and differentiated medicines and vaccines, most notably pricing and tax reform in the United States. We're engaging key stakeholders in the health care environment to seek constructive solutions and to ensure that they understand the therapeutic and economic value Merck's products and business operations provide.
In closing, we remain committed to our innovation strategy and are focused on advancing and augmenting our broad pipeline, both through internal and external means, as well as driving marketplace success with our launches in key in-line brands.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Our performance in the first quarter reflects our focus on execution and continued productivity improvements. We again delivered P&L leverage with growth, excluding exchange, on both the top and bottom lines. Tota",467,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone.  Our performance in the first quarter reflects our focus on execution and continued productivity improvements. We again delivered P&L leverage with growth, excluding exchange, on both the top and bottom lines. Total company revenues were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, first quarter revenues grew 3%, driven by both our Human Health and Animal Health businesses.
Venezuela negatively impacted Q1 revenues by approximately $240 million, reflecting the reduction of our operations in the country. As a reminder, we recorded $625 million of sales in Venezuela in 2015, which were more weighted to the first half of the year. So the year-over-year impact will be greatest in the first 2 quarters of this year.
Looking to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 77% in the quarter, an increase of 50 basis points versus the first quarter of 2015. Lower discards was the biggest driver of the year-over-year improvement. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $3.9 billion was 3% lower year-over-year or roughly flat, excluding foreign exchange favorability-s. Higher promotional spend behind our new products drove a slight increase in marketing and administrative, while lower licensing expenses contributed to a decline in research and development.
Taken together, we earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter, delivering 10% growth, excluding exchange, which reflects our continued commitment to delivering a leveraged P&L.
Turning now to our outlook for the rest of the year. We are narrowing and raising our revenue and EPS guidance for 2016. While we are experiencing more favorable exchange rates versus our original guidance, we are facing a few headwinds, in particular, the entry of generic NASONEX in the United States earlier than originally assumed, which we expect will partially offset the exchange rate favorability this year. We now expect full year 2016 revenues to be between $39 billion and $40.2 billion. This reflects an approximately 2% negative impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates.
We continue to expect our non-GAAP 2016 product gross margin and operating expenses to be roughly in line with 2015, and we still anticipate the non-GAAP tax rate for the full year to be between 21.5% and 22.5%. In terms of our 2016 EPS outlook, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $3.65 to $3.77. This reflects an approximately 2 percentage negative point impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates.
To summarize, we demonstrated strong performance, leveraging top line growth to deliver 10% growth in non-GAAP EPS, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We benefited from the contribution of new product launches while continuing sustained growth in our key franchises and driving operational improvement across the company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger -- or I'm sorry, to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on the Global Human Health performance for the first quarter, and my comments will be on a constant currency basis. We are off to a solid start to the year. Total Human Health sales reached $8.1 billion, growing 2%, and we grow -- growth across our core areas of diabetes, vaccines, hospital specialty Care and oncology.
I want to do now is highlight a few of our franchises and product launches, and I'll start with primary care. The JANUVIA franchise had a strong quarter, growing 4% globally. In the United States, sales grew 9%, driven primarily by volume increases and a some benefit from customer buying patterns. Outside of the U.S., we saw strong growth in Europe and Japan, offset by emerging markets, which was impacted by Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, JANUVIA franchise sales grew 5% outside of the U.S.
First quarter results for JANUVIA demonstrate that we can continue to grow volume and retain strong market share of about 75% in the United States and 65% globally. We continue to expect global JANUVIA franchise growth, ex exchange, in 2016.
Now I'll move on to our vaccine business. Sales of our vaccine portfolio grew 1% and reached about $1.3 billion on steady growth in GARDASIL and pediatric vaccines, partially offset by declines in our adult singles vaccine ZOSTAVAX. ZOSTAVAX sales declined in the first quarter, resulting from a weaker flu season in the U.S., which means that less people go to get vaccinated in general, but also the recent changes to a ACIP recommendations for pneumococci vaccines. We are actively working with customers to help them navigate the reimbursement for ZOSTAVAX, and expect this to be less of a hurdle over time.
Global GARDASIL franchise sales grew this quarter on continued strength from GARDASIL 9 launch in the U.S. We are encouraged by the recent CDC publication that reported a significant decrease in vaccines-type HPV prevalence since the introduction of HPV vaccination in the United States. The reduction was 64% in females aged 14 to 19, and 34% in females aged 20 to 24. If you consider that this reports those impact only through 2012 and does not yet include males, it's become apparent that we really can make a difference to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in the United States.
Next on Hospital and Specialty Care. Our acute care portfolio performed well in the quarter on steady growth from antibiotics, antifungals and Bridion. We are also pleased to be adding to our specialty care business with the launch of ZEPATIER. 
Sales in the first quarter were $50 million. While we're still early in the launch, we are seeing positive signs that ZEPATIER will play an important role in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Our team is working to secure assets for ZEPATIER, with conversations currently in going with many different public and private payers. The addition of ZEPATIER to a formulary at the veterans' administration and with other customers reinforces our believe that our payer and our pricing strategy will maximize revenue and market share, and it will also broaden and accelerate patient access.  Customers value ZEPATIER's profile, which offers high cure rates across a diverse group of patients, and we continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunity for ZEPATIER.
Finally, on oncology. We see significant potential for KEYTRUDA, which positions us as a global leader in immuno-oncology. In the first quarter, sales reached approximately $250 million, and it continued to be driven by our melanoma indications, as well as early traction in the U.S. in lung cancer. 
We are working to integrate PD-L1 testing as part of the routine treatment of lung cancer by continuing to demonstrate the value testing brings to physicians, the payers and to patients. Testing rates in the United States continue to increase, which is important not only for our second-line indication, but we believe also for when we have a first-line indication. 
We also see very strong performance outside of the U.S, which represented nearly half of first quarter KEYTRUDA sales. We are launching in melanoma in approximately 50 markets globally. And in some markets, we are the market leader despite being second to launch.
Given the strong survival results we demonstrated in melanoma and second-line lung cancer, the early data we've seen in more than 20 cancer type, as well as the breadth and the depth of KEYTRUDA development program, we remain confident that KEYTRUDA will become foundational to the treatment of cancer over time.
In closing, we're off to a good start in 2016. This year, we will have to offset generic penetration of products, including NASONEX and CUBICIN. However, our investments in JANUVIA and KEYTRUDA and in ZEPATIER and other core areas are delivering results and positioning us for future growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

The momentum that our clinical development and regulatory groups established last year continues in 2016.

The momentum that our clinical development and regulatory groups established last year continues in 2016. I'll briefly review the highlights of the first quarter.
As has already been mentioned, beginning in January, we obtained regulatory approval for ZEPATIER in Canada, the United States and Switzerland. And speaking with hepatologists and infectious disease specialists, there is general enthusiasm for the high cure rates observed for ZEPATIER, and the ability to use in ZEPATIER in patients with compromised renal function, including patients undergoing hemodialysis.
Public health organizations is increasingly embracing a goal of large-scale elimination of hepatitis C infection, and we have been developing data, some of which we've presented at the liver meetings in Barcelona last month, documenting the ability of ZEPATIER to assist in this process, including in very difficult to treat patients who suffer from opioid addiction.
As Adam indicated, we've successfully launched ZEPATIER in the United States and are seeking approval in many markets around the world. In the course of our European review for ZEPATIER, the European Medicines Agency's cited Merck's third-party manufacturer for issues largely related to inadequate record keeping and the need for improvement in their quality management systems. We are working assiduously with regulators to resolve these issues. 
I should note that we do not believe that the problems identified at our third-party manufacturer affect the safety, efficacy or quality specifications of the product, and we do not believe that these problems will affect the supply to the U.S. market. Nevertheless, we take all matters related to good manufacturing prefaces very seriously, and we are working with regulatory agencies and the manufacturer to resolve these issues as expeditiously as possible. 
We continue to believe that EU approval can be achieved according to the mid-year time line that we perversely disclose. However, our European launch will be delayed until the fourth quarter, or perhaps until the end of the first quarter of 2017, depending on how quickly these matters can be resolved.
For the registration process with ZEPATIER continues, we are also completing phase IIb studies of MK-3682, our uridinal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, when used in combination with ZEPATIER or in combination with another advanced NS5A inhibitor, MK-8408. Data from these studies, which will emerge over the next few months, will permit definitive selection of the appropriate registration-enabling regimens that will provide options for the estimated 150 million people around the world who are infected with hepatitis C virus. 
During the first quarter of our studies -- our studies of KEYTRUDA also advanced significantly. In April, we announced that FDA has accepted our filing on a priority review basis for the use of KEYTRUDA in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, following platinum-based chemotherapy, with a PDUFA date in early August. And this filing makes use of unit dosing at 200 milligrams every 3 weeks. We have shown that this dose yields exposures comparable to those observed using weight-based dosing, and unit dosing obviously relives providers of the responsibility of calculating patient-specific dose volumes.
Our head and neck cancer filing is reinforced by an exceptionally broad array of ongoing studies in this disease, including a controlled second-line study, the KEYNOTE-040 study; our first-line study, KEYNOTE-048, which will provide data in 2017.
We're also testing the use of KEYTRUDA in combination with the radiation -- with radiation plus chemotherapy with the TVEC oncolytic virus in collaboration with our colleagues at Amgen, and with an IDO1 inhibitor in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte.
Substantial amount of important new data from our KEYTRUDA program will be presented in the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings next month, including results in head and neck cancer patients who have failed both platinum and cetuximab therapy, and long-term survival data in melanoma patients from our original KEYNOTE-001 study. 
Also in April, we announced that the FDA granted a fourth breakthrough your destination for KEYTRUDA in the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. As Margaret Shippen [ph] College -- from the Dana-Farber Cancer research center showed in the paper published last month in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, amplification of the chromosomal locus, including both PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands is very common in Hodgkin lymphoma, and they represent a critical factor in the malignant transformation of Reed–Sternberg cell, the characteristic cell type in this cancer. This observation may help to explain why the very high response rates following KEYTRUDA treatment in Hodgkin's lymphoma patients are observed. 
Meanwhile, we continue to pursue registration for KEYTRUDA in second-line lung cancer in Europe. And our KEYNOTE-010 study, which will improve understanding of how best to use KEYTRUDA in this disease, is under review in the United States. You'll recall that in the KEYNOTE-010 trial, KEYTRUDA treatment meaningfully improved overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer NE histology for tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker in 1% or more of a tumor cell, as compared to what could be achieved using conventional docetaxel chemotherapy.
Our first-line study of KEYTRUDA KEYNOTE-024, comparing KEYTRUDA treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 strongly positive tumors, remains on track to deliver data at midyear.
Finally, progress continues across a broad range of other programs. Bezlotoxumab, our therapy designed to recurrences of C. difficile associated enterocolitis, received priority review designation from the FDA with a PDUFA date in July. The FDA will hold an Advisory Committee meeting to review the bezlotoxumab filing on June 9, and our file is also under review in the European Union.
Clinical data are beginning to emerge for ertugliflozin, which will support our comprehensive filing for this new molecular entity, as both a single agent and in combination with JANUVIA or metformin by the end of the year. 
Separately, the long-awaited adjudication of our Phase III odanacatib data is now almost complete. With these data in hand, we will at last be in a position to assemble regulatory dossiers supporting the registration of this important once-weekly treatment for osteoporosis.
And among the many programs, for which considerable interest is expressed when I meet with external clinicians and scientists, is our Phase III trial studying letermovir as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus activation in patients receiving bone marrow transplants. We expect to have data in-house from this study by the end of the third quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Teri."

So it's still a little bit too early to give you exact accounts and names of accounts, but I can tell you that we feel good about potential access for '17, and then we'll see where we end up for '16.

There's no mystery here, really. The mechanisms for statistical analysis of these kinds of studies have been refined over a period of many decades, and while the statistical literature continues to advance in ways that are quite intriguing, the reality is that we have a lot of data based on all of the prior studies that we've done with KEYTRUDA and with Opdivo, the studies that have been done and published with Opdivo as well, that provide a substantial amount of positive predictive value. So in a Bayesian sense, one can predict outcomes fairly comfortably, and we know, therefore, we could put that information into our power calculations. We have pretty good understanding of where we're going and when we have to look. Of course, you can get surprises in different tumor types. But I guess one thing to stress is the general consistency of the responses that we've seen across a very large number of tumor types, both with respect to response rates and durability. So we don't find it mysterious. I think the explanation for the early stopping of the Bristol-Myers the studies is largely related to the size of the studies and -- more than anything else. And there's nothing special about non-proportional analyses."

About half the sales were outside the U.S., half the sales in the U.S. And we continue to see growth in the U.S. It's really not inventory issues at -- to any large degree for this product, frankly. If you look at where sales are coming from, the vast majority of the sales are still coming from melanoma indications. And if you look at that, a lot of it is still coming in second-line, although we see first-line continuing to grow. Internationally, the sales are coming primarily, obviously, from our melanoma indication. As you start to think about lung, we are seeing increases in the number of physicians that are testing patients now. And a lot of those increases are actually coming from patients with first-line lung being tested. So the fact that we continue to encourage testing, I believe, is only going to help us ultimately when we launch in first-line lung. And then the first thing that you want to do is you want to see who gets to market first. And I think that, that always matters. So let's see who gets to market first in first-line lung, and that will be an important milestone. Secondarily, as you said, we have to see what the cutoff points are. But in addition to that, even with cutoff points, we also have to see what the guidelines say and how the reimbursement works. So I feel pretty good about where we are today. I feel optimistic about first-line lung. I can tell you, I'm thrilled that we're only 1 of 2 PD-L1s in the marketplace today, and I think that sets us up for very good growth in the future."

We knew, of course, about the -- Lilly's evacetrapib study, it's nice to have the data now in much more detail. The differences between the 2 studies have been discussed in terms of the patient populations that were enrolled and in terms of the duration of the studies, which the a follow-up duration is important since you do expect, as you manipulate lipid profiles, the effects should accrue over time. That's probably the biggest impact. I think that when we look at this, because of the dramatic lowering in LDL cholesterol, the dramatic increase in HDL cholesterol, the changes in Lp(a), the expectation is that patients who are receiving anacetrapib should do better in terms of major cardiovascular events. That's what we're testing, it's a 30,000 patient study. And we're going to have the data next year, and we'll have a chance to look and see. We're approaching the end of the treatment period. And we'll -- at some point, the clouds will part and the sun will shine, and we'll have a chance to see what the landscape looks like. At the moment, there's no point of speculating.

I think the 2 other points are important. First of all, we're already seeing about 30% of patients with lung being tested, and about 70% of those are in first-line. The other thing that's important is that when patients are being tested, if it's positive right now, the vast majority of those patients are going to KEYTRUDA.

I was intrigued that in your press release, you highlighted business development as a high priority. If you'll recall, at our CEO conference back in January, you highlighted your high priority to complete deals, being more aggressive this year, moving up the risk curve. Can you provide a little bit more granularity as to specifically what you're looking for? Clearly, we've seen a major derating of valuations of biotech stocks, yet we haven't really seen any motion or rumors or anything out of Merck. What are you looking for, specifically? Are they late-stage assets? Are they early-stage assets? What compels you to highlight that early on in your press release? That's my first question. And second questions are for you, Roger, and Adam, if you want to comment. There's been a lot of focus on this call today on monotherapy. Obviously, we -- first-line lung monotherapy. But we -- our expectation is that monotherapy is rapidly going to move to combination therapy. And as you know, oncologists believe that the best way to treat cancer is with cocktail or combination therapy. And clearly, your competitors have all pursued combinations, either with I-O or chemo combo. So just -- you have pursued a monotherapy strategy and are behind the curve on combination. What is your strategy to catch up? And then just as a corollary to that question, the market wisdom is that you have to own a combination to speed them to market. What is your strategy to do that?"

You have any -- you haven't seen the deals come through quite yet, but that doesn't mean that we're not very, very much engaged in active discussions with those companies. And you mentioned the issue around valuation, I think that a lot of those companies are looking at their current stock prices and trying to decide whether those are indicative of where they're going to be in the future. So I think those boards and those management teams are going through the process of letting those -- the new reality, if you will, settle in with them. But from our perspective, I guess what I'm trying to highlight is, first of all, we have a strong balance sheet and we can go after deals across the whole spectrum: Early-, middle- and late-stage compounds. And we will look for those deals consistent with good science and financial discipline. So we want to be aggressive in going after deals, but we want to do deals that create value for our shareholders."

And Jami, on the general approach to how one treats cancer, I actually don't agree with your assessment of our strategy, so let me try and reinterpret a little bit for you. First of all, what I've always said was in order to understand the benefits of combination therapy, you have to understand how monotherapy behaves. And we launched a very broad program in monotherapy with more than 30 different tumor types in many lines of therapy. But we've not shorted the combination studies. You look on ClinicalTrials.gov right now, about something, over 270 studies on ClinicalTrials.gov with KEYTRUDA, I haven't checked today. More than 100 of those are combination studies. And they include studies that are registration -- potentially registration-enabling. If you look at the KEYNOTE-189 study, for example, which will be delivering data next year in combination with chemotherapy. In addition to, of course, combination with chemotherapy data that we've already presented, there's quite a lot going on in combinations. Now we have combinations with radiation therapy, combinations with immunotherapies, combinations with traditional chemotherapies and combinations with targeted chemotherapies. And in addition, we have in the clinic, the GITR, LAG3, IL 10 and cCAM, which are our own Phase I programs that provide immuno-oncology molecules that could potentially be used in combination. So in totality, we have a very, very broad combination program, which includes both things that we own and things that either shouldn't be owned because they're, in essence, generic, where -- that we're doing in collaborations with others. And for example, in the IDO program, we're both collaborating with Incyte, and we have our own programs that we own as well. So a lot of work going on and -- in combinations. Our goal, absolutely, is to identify the very best possible regimens from the many thousands that you and I have discussed previously, the many thousands of regimens that potentially we can employ in treating cancer patients."

And with regard to having to own them all, I don't think you have to, particularly, if they can't be combined into a similar dosage form or have the same type of dosing regimen. And I get asked that all the time in diabetes for many years, where people said, ""Don't you have to have an insulin and a GLP-1 for JANUVIA to be successful?"" And we've shown that JANUVIA can be successful even if we don't have some of those combinations. It doesn't mean that we don't want a GLP-1 potentially, or other types of diabetes medicines, but we look at those as their own opportunities. At the same time, the reason that we think that the combination of our SGLT2 with JANUVIA can be successful is because you can put them into 1 tablet with the same dosing regimen. So that's the way we look at the combinations, and I think that our strategy is a good one."

With that in mind, we wanted to explore more fully the landscape of IDO1 and CDO1 inhibitors. We had an opportunity with IOmet to gain access to, actually, quite a large set of starting materials and new chemistry, which enables us to think about how we would design an optimal molecule that could be used in whole variety of different tumor types. We have a very good collaborative relationship with Incyte, and we're eager to see those programs advance just as quickly as possible for the benefit of patients, but we think there's some running room as well and an opportunity for us to use our chemical insights potentially to improve treatment regimens in that regard.

The problems do not affect, we do not believe, the safety, efficacy or quality specifications of product. And hence, we don't believe the problems will affect the supply of the U.S. market, but we take these good manufacturing practice issues very seriously. And we're working with both regulatory agencies and the contract manufacturer to resolve the issues as expeditiously as possible. Secondly with respect to GITR, as you know, our program has been in the clinic for quite some time, but we have been advancing it very slowly because of concerns on our part, and on the part of regulators, too, we share these concerns that an agonist antibody could stimulate a fairly profound immune activation response, and those responses can be difficult to manage. So we're just getting to the point of -- in advancing that program, where we believe we're in the therapeutic range. We certainly do have data that our anti-GITR antibody behaves as an agonist. I think one of the issues has to do with cross-linking and which FC receptors are engaged by the therapy. As you know, we have 2 GITR antibodies that are in the clinic. There is a lot of enthusiasm in the community, but it will be some time, I think, before we understand whether to what extent GITR antibodies will be useful."

We saw -- sealed a deal earlier with IOmet that we talked about. So we like to build on those areas where we already have leadership. But it's also important for us not to be too blinded to the fact that there's important science going on in other areas. And so what we want to look for are significant opportunities to have a leading positions in growing areas of therapeutic significance going forward. Obviously, immuno-oncology would be one leading area, but we are also willing to do business development if we think we can get an asset that we can leverage inside our portfolio for leadership position."

When you think about first-line lung, all competitors will be talking about PD-L1 testing. So I believe that barrier will go away because all of us together will be talking about it. And the other thing that I think is important, is if the playing field is equal in lung and all else is close, every-3-week dosing is an advantage versus competition. And therefore, I think that the dosing for first-line lung patients could end up being an advantage for us if PD-L1 testing is communicated by all companies. But the other thing I want to emphasize is I've said all along, this is a long-term view of this market. There will be multiple competitors that can do really well in this market. I don't think we should look at any 1 quarter or short period of time. This market, over the next several years, with the number of tumor types that we're studying, with the amount of how well that we're continuing to develop combination products, we can continue to do really well. The last thing I'll say is that if you look at Europe, in countries in Europe, we actually came to market after competition. And in many markets, including big markets like Germany in melanoma, despite that, we now are the market leader. So I believe it shows our strength outside of the U.S., where I believe PD-L1 testing will be even more relevant and accepted by payers than potentially in the U.S. for second-line."

We're just waiting until we hit the prespecified event trigger which defines the power for the study. And once that's available, then we'll be able to do that.

And then the second question I have a is on Alzeimer's, and I would love to just get Merck's perspective on this. There's obviously been a lot of discussion around end points with the changes Lilly made recently to the solanezumab study. And for yours -- for your BACE inhibitor, in Prodromal, you have -- CDR Sum of boxes as your primary, I believe, in the Prodromal study. In the mild to moderate, you have ADAS-Cog and ADCS-ADL as co-primaries.

And as you look at the guidance we provided, we flowed part of that benefit through in the guidance, but not all of it.

With respect to Alzeimer's endpoints, of course, there's been a lot of discussion over a long period of time about how to best to measure the deterioration that occurs as a result of Alzeimer's-related neurodegeneration. There are 2, at least 2, different things to be concerned about. One of course, is direct measurement of cognitive function by whatever tools one has, typically things like mental status examinations. And the other is the functional capability of individuals who are unfortunately suffering from Alzeimer's. Typically, the agency has asked to see both of those things assessed directly. And often in the primary endpoint, as a composite endpoint in clinical trials, it is possible, of course, to do that, [indiscernible] them and take a single endpoint. Our view with respect to mild to moderate is that the best strategy is to look at both of those aspects of Alzeimer's-related performance, and that's the way we've handled it.

Where the pressure was primarily was Venezuela, but obviously, there's some turmoil that's happening in markets, particularly in the Middle East, that have some impact. If you look at emerging markets over time, there's been a slight decline in growth, but we still expect there to be growth as we move forward into the future. With regard to JANUVIA, I said in the U.S., we had 9% growth versus prior year, but the best way to understand that is to look at underlying volume growth, which was about 5% versus prior year. And therefore, we did see some inventory movement of JANUVIA. It's important to note that just like last year, the quarters will fluctuate to some degree from one quarter to the next quarter. But overall, across the year, we expected growth for the JANUVIA franchise. And then the last thing I'll say is with regard to omarigliptin, for business reasons, we decided not to move forward submitting the applications in the United States or Europe. And it did not result from concerns on efficacy or safety, it was really for business reasons, for 2 primary reasons. Number one, we have a very high share of JANUVIA in those markets, so a lot of the product would've been cannibalizing our own DPP-4 share. We have a 75% share in the U.S. and a 65% share globally. The second reason is we are excited about launching, not just the monotherapy SGLT2, but the also the commission of an SGLT2 with JANUVIA, which we would've anticipated would be launched not too far after omarigliptin. And in order to focus more on growing JANUVIA but then also the SGLT2 mono and more specifically the combo with JANUVIA, we felt was a better place for us to focus."

We remain committed to delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. To do so, we will stay true to our goal of becoming the premier research-intensive global biopharmaceutical company, bringing forward medically important products that address many of the world's greatest health needs. And above all, it is critical that we do this in a sustainable manner that enables us to continuously reinvest in R&D.

We are confident that our scientific discernment, coupled with financial discipline, will allow us to identify and acquire the right assets at the right valuation to create long-term value for shareholders consistent with our innovation strategy.
Before I conclude, let me also emphasize that we are fully engaged in the challenging policy environment that our industry experiences now. We are actively addressing the key policy issues that can have an impact on our ability to fund the discovery and development of the next generation of innovative and differentiated medicines and vaccines, most notably pricing and tax reform in the United States. We're engaging key stakeholders in the health care environment to seek constructive solutions and to ensure that they understand the therapeutic and economic value Merck's products and business operations provide.

Our performance in the first quarter reflects our focus on execution and continued productivity improvements. We again delivered P&L leverage with growth, excluding exchange, on both the top and bottom lines. Tota",469,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone.  Our performance in the first quarter reflects our focus on execution and continued productivity improvements. We again delivered P&L leverage with growth, excluding exchange, on both the top and bottom lines. Total company revenues were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, first quarter revenues grew 3%, driven by both our Human Health and Animal Health businesses.
Venezuela negatively impacted Q1 revenues by approximately $240 million, reflecting the reduction of our operations in the country. As a reminder, we recorded $625 million of sales in Venezuela in 2015, which were more weighted to the first half of the year. So the year-over-year impact will be greatest in the first 2 quarters of this year.
Looking to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 77% in the quarter, an increase of 50 basis points versus the first quarter of 2015. Lower discards was the biggest driver of the year-over-year improvement. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $3.9 billion was 3% lower year-over-year or roughly flat, excluding foreign exchange favorability. Higher promotional spend behind our new products drove a slight increase in marketing and administrative, while lower licensing expenses contributed to a decline in research and development.
Taken together, we earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter, delivering 10% growth, excluding exchange, which reflects our continued commitment to delivering a leveraged P&L.
Turning now to our outlook for the rest of the year. We are narrowing and raising our revenue and EPS guidance for 2016. While we are experiencing more favorable exchange rates versus our original guidance, we are facing a few headwinds, in particular, the entry of generic NASONEX in the United States earlier than originally assumed, which we expect will partially offset the exchange rate favorability this year. We now expect full year 2016 revenues to be between $39 billion and $40.2 billion. This reflects an approximately 2% negative impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates.
We continue to expect our non-GAAP 2016 product gross margin and operating expenses to be roughly in line with 2015, and we still anticipate the non-GAAP tax rate for the full year to be between 21.5% and 22.5%. In terms of our 2016 EPS outlook, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $3.65 to $3.77. This reflects an approximately 2 percentage negative point impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates.
To summarize, we demonstrated strong performance, leveraging top line growth to deliver 10% growth in non-GAAP EPS, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We benefited from the contribution of new product launches while continuing to send [ph] growth in our key franchises and driving operational improvement across the company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger -- or I'm sorry, to Adam."
288502,330442316,974318,"Merck & Co. Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone.This morning, I'll provide highlights on the Global Human Health performance for the first quarter, and my comments will be on a constant currency basis. We are off to a solid start to the year. Total Human Health",808,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone.
This morning, I'll provide highlights on the Global Human Health performance for the first quarter, and my comments will be on a constant currency basis. We are off to a solid start to the year. Total Human Health sales reached $8.1 billion, growing 2%, and we drove growth across our core areas of diabetes, vaccines, hospital specialty care and oncology.
And what I'll do now is highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'll start with primary care. The JANUVIA franchise had a strong quarter, growing 4% globally. In the United States, sales grew 9%, driven primarily by volume increases and some benefit from customer buying patterns. Outside of the U.S., we saw strong growth in Europe and Japan, offset by emerging markets, which was impacted by Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, JANUVIA franchise sales grew 5% outside of the U.S.
First quarter results for JANUVIA demonstrate that we can continue to grow volume and retain strong market share of about 75% in the United States and 65% globally. We continue to expect global JANUVIA franchise growth, ex exchange, in 2016.
Now I'll move on to our vaccine business. Sales of our vaccine portfolio grew 1% and reached about $1.3 billion on steady growth from GARDASIL and pediatric vaccines, partially offset by declines in our adult shingles vaccine ZOSTAVAX. ZOSTAVAX sales declined in the first quarter, resulting from a weaker flu season in the U.S., which means that less people go to get vaccinated in general, but also the recent changes to a ACIP recommendations for pneumococcal vaccines. We are actively working with customers to help them navigate the reimbursement for ZOSTAVAX, and expect this to be less of a hurdle over time.
Global GARDASIL franchise sales grew this quarter on continued strength from GARDASIL 9 launch in the U.S. We are encouraged by the recent CDC publication that reported a significant decrease in vaccine-type HPV prevalence since the introduction of HPV vaccination in the United States. The reduction was 64% in females aged 14 to 19, and 34% in females aged 20 to 24. If you consider that this reports those impacts only through 2012 and does not yet include males, it becomes apparent that we really can make a difference to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in the United States.
Next on Hospital and Specialty Care. Our acute care portfolio performed well in the quarter on steady growth from antibiotics, antifungals and Bridion. We are also pleased to be adding to our specialty care business with the launch of ZEPATIER. 
Sales in the first quarter were $50 million. While we're still early in the launch, we are seeing positive signs that ZEPATIER will play an important role in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Our team is working to secure assets for ZEPATIER, with conversations currently ongoing with many different public and private payers. The addition of ZEPATIER to the formulary at the Veterans Administration and with other customers reinforces our belief that our payer and our pricing strategy will maximize revenue and market share, and it will also broaden and accelerate patient access.  Customers value ZEPATIER's profile, which offers high cure rates across a diverse group of patients, and we continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunity for ZEPATIER.
Finally, in oncology. We see significant potential for KEYTRUDA, which positions us as a global leader in immuno-oncology. In the first quarter, sales reached approximately $250 million, and it continued to be driven by our melanoma indications, as well as early traction in the U.S. in lung cancer. 
We are working to integrate PD-L1 testing as part of the routine treatment of lung cancer by continuing to demonstrate the value testing brings to physicians, to payers and to patients. Testing rates in the United States continue to increase, which is important not only for our second-line indication, but we believe also for when we have a first-line indication. 
We also see very strong performance outside of the U.S, which represented nearly half of first quarter KEYTRUDA sales. We are launching in melanoma in approximately 50 markets globally. And in some markets, we are the market leader despite being second to launch.
Given the strong survival results we've demonstrated in melanoma and second-line lung cancer, the early data we've seen in more than 20 cancer type, as well as the breadth and the depth of KEYTRUDA development program, we remain confident that KEYTRUDA will become foundational for the treatment of cancer over time.
In closing, we're off to a good start in 2016. This year, we will have to offset generic penetration of products, including NASONEX and CUBICIN. However, our investments in JANUVIA and KEYTRUDA and in ZEPATIER and other core areas are delivering results and positioning us for future growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

The momentum that our clinical development and regulatory groups established last year continues in 2016.

The momentum that our clinical development and regulatory groups established last year continues in 2016. I'll briefly review the highlights of the first quarter.
As has already been mentioned, beginning in January, we obtained regulatory approval for ZEPATIER in Canada, the United States and Switzerland. And speaking with hepatologists and infectious disease specialists, there is general enthusiasm for the high cure rates observed with ZEPATIER, and the ability to use in ZEPATIER in patients with compromised renal function, including patients undergoing hemodialysis.
Public health organizations are increasingly embracing a goal of large-scale elimination of hepatitis C infection, and we have been developing data, some of which we've presented at the liver meetings in Barcelona last month, documenting the ability of ZEPATIER to assist in this process, including in very difficult to treat patients who suffer from opioid addiction.
As Adam indicated, we've successfully launched ZEPATIER in the United States and are seeking approval in many markets around the world. In the course of our European review for ZEPATIER, the European Medicines Agency's cited Merck's third-party manufacturer for issues largely related to inadequate record keeping and the need for improvement in their quality management systems. We are working assiduously with regulators to resolve these issues. 
I should note that we do not believe that the problems identified at our third-party manufacturer affect the safety, efficacy or quality specifications of the product, and we do not believe that these problems will affect the supply to the U.S. market. Nevertheless, we take all matters related to good manufacturing prefaces very seriously, and we are working with regulatory agencies and the manufacturer to resolve these issues as expeditiously as possible. 
We continue to believe that EU approval can be achieved according to the mid-year time line that we perversely disclosed. However, our European launch will be delayed until the fourth quarter, or perhaps until the end of the first quarter of 2017, depending on how quickly these matters can be resolved.
While the registration process with ZEPATIER continues, we are also completing phase IIb studies of MK-3682, our uridinal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, when used in combination with ZEPATIER or in combination with another advanced NS5A inhibitor, MK-8408. Data from these studies, which will emerge over the next few months, will permit definitive selection of the appropriate registration-enabling regimens that will provide additional options for the estimated 150 million people around the world who are infected with hepatitis C virus. 
During the first quarter of our studies -- our studies of KEYTRUDA also advanced significantly. In April, we announced that FDA has accepted our filing on a priority review basis for the use of KEYTRUDA in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, following platinum-based chemotherapy, with a PDUFA date in early August. And this filing makes use of unit dosing at 200 milligrams every 3 weeks. We have shown that this dose yields exposures comparable to those observed using weight-based dosing, and unit dosing obviously relives providers of the responsibility of calculating patient-specific dose volumes.
Our head and neck cancer filing is reinforced by an exceptionally broad array of ongoing studies on this disease, including a controlled second-line study, the KEYNOTE-040 study; our first-line study, KEYNOTE-048, which will provide data in 2017.
We're also testing the use of KEYTRUDA in combination with the radiation -- with radiation plus chemotherapy with the TVEC oncolytic virus in collaboration with our colleagues at Amgen, and with an IDO1 inhibitor in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte.
A substantial amount of important new data from our KEYTRUDA program will be presented in the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings next month, including results in head and neck cancer patients who have failed both platinum and cetuximab therapy, and long-term survival data in melanoma patients from our original KEYNOTE-001 study. 
Also in April, we announced that the FDA granted a fourth breakthrough designation for KEYTRUDA in the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. As Margaret Shipp and colleagues from the Dana-Farber Cancer Research Center showed in a paper published last month in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, amplification of the chromosomal locus, including both PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands, is very common in Hodgkin lymphoma, and may represent a critical factor in the malignant transformation of Reed–Sternberg cells, the characteristic cell type in this cancer. This observation may help to explain why the very high response rates following KEYTRUDA treatment in Hodgkin's lymphoma patients are observed. 
Meanwhile, we continue to pursue registration for KEYTRUDA in second-line lung cancer in Europe. And our KEYNOTE-010 study, which will improve understanding of how best to use KEYTRUDA in this disease, is under review in the United States. You'll recall that in the KEYNOTE-010 trial, KEYTRUDA treatment meaningfully improved overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer NE histology, where tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker in 1% or more of a tumor cell, as compared to what could be achieved using conventional docetaxel chemotherapy.
Our first-line study of KEYTRUDA, KEYNOTE-024, comparing KEYTRUDA treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 strongly positive tumors, remains on track to deliver data at midyear.
Finally, progress continues across a broad range of other programs. Bezlotoxumab, our therapy designed to reduce recurrences of C. difficile associated enterocolitis, received priority review designation from the FDA with a PDUFA date in July. The FDA will hold an Advisory Committee meeting to review the bezlotoxumab filing on June 9, and our file is also under review in the European Union.
Clinical data are beginning to emerge for ertugliflozin, which will support our comprehensive filing for this new molecular entity, as both a single agent and in combination with JANUVIA or metformin by the end of the year. 
Separately, the long-awaited adjudication of our Phase III odanacatib data is now almost complete. With these data in hand, we will at last be in a position to assemble regulatory dossiers supporting the registration of this important once-weekly treatment for osteoporosis.
And among the many programs, for which considerable interest is expressed when I meet with external clinicians and scientists, is our Phase III trial studying letermovir as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus activation in patients receiving bone marrow transplants. We expect to have data in-house from this study by the end of the third quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Teri."

So it's still a little bit too early to give you exact accounts and names of accounts, but I can tell you that we feel good about potential access for '17, and then we'll see where we end up for '16. But I do think that there is opportunity there. And then if you look at how we're approaching the marketplace, we really are focusing on having access, and it's important that we have parity with the competitors. So we're spending a lot of time trying to get access at parity across the different segments in the United States, so that there's physician and patient choice."

All companies are analyzing I-O data with the FDA-required Cox stratified proportional hazards statistical test. However, Bristol implies that it analyzes I-O data a unique way, which emphasizes the non-proportional aspect of the I-O curve. And I guess in support of their view, they have stopped more studies early than any other company. It is also true that Bristol studies generally are longer than competitors' studies. Does Merck understand what Bristol is doing? Does Merck believe it is doing the same thing? And if not, how is what Merck is doing different?"

There's no mystery here, really. The mechanisms for statistical analysis of these kinds of studies have been refined over a period of many decades, and while the statistical literature continues to advance in ways that are quite intriguing, the reality is that we have a lot of data based on all of the prior studies that we've done with KEYTRUDA and with Opdivo, the studies that have been done and published with Opdivo as well, that provide a substantial amount of positive predictive value. So in a Bayesian sense, one can predict outcomes fairly comfortably, and we know, therefore, we can put that information into our power calculations. We have pretty good understanding of where we're going and when we have to look. Of course, you can get surprises in different tumor types. But I guess one thing to stress is the general consistency of the responses that we've seen across a very large number of tumor types, both with respect to response rates and durability. So we don't find it mysterious. I think the explanation for the early stopping of the Bristol-Myers studies is largely related to the size of the studies and -- more than anything else. And there's nothing special about non-proportional analyses."

About half the sales were outside the U.S., half the sales in the U.S. And we continued to see growth in the U.S. There's really not inventory issues, to any large degree, for this product, frankly. If you look at where sales are coming from, the vast majority of the sales are still coming from melanoma indications. And if you look at that, a lot of it is still coming in second-line, although we see first-line continuing to grow. Internationally, the sales are coming primarily, obviously, from our melanoma indication. As you start to think about lung, we are seeing increases in the number of physicians that are testing patients now. And a lot of those increases are actually coming from patients with first-line lung being tested. So the fact that we continue to encourage testing, I believe, is only going to help us ultimately when we launch in first-line lung. And then the first thing that you want to do is you want to see who gets to market first. And I think that, that always matters. So let's see who gets to market first in first-line lung, and that will be an important milestone. Secondarily, as you said, we have to see what the cutoff points are. But in addition to that, even with cutoff points, we also have to see what the guidelines say and how the reimbursement works. So I feel pretty good about where we are today.

I think that when we look at this, because of the dramatic lowering in LDL cholesterol, the dramatic increase in HDL cholesterol, the changes in Lp(a), the expectation is that patients who are receiving anacetrapib should do better in terms of major cardiovascular events. That's what we're testing, it's a 30,000 patient study. And we're going to have the data next year, and we'll have a chance to look and see. We're approaching the end of the treatment period.

Are they late-stage assets? Are they early-stage assets? What compels you to highlight that early on in your press release? That's my first question. And second questions are for you, Roger, and Adam, if you want to comment. There's been a lot of focus on this call today on monotherapy. Obviously, we -- first-line lung monotherapy. But we -- our expectation is that monotherapy is rapidly going to move to combination therapy. And as you know, oncologists believe that the best way to treat cancer is with cocktail or combination therapy. And clearly, your competitors have all pursued combinations, either with I-O/I-O or chemo combo. So just -- you have pursued a monotherapy strategy and are behind the curve on combination. What is your strategy to catch up? And then just as a corollary to that question, the market wisdom is that you have to own a combination to speed them to market. What is your strategy to do that?"

We feel it's very important for us to access the best external innovation. And we're very actively engaged with companies that we think have good science. You haven't -- you haven't seen the deals come through quite yet, but that doesn't mean that we're not very, very much engaged in active discussions with those companies. And you mentioned the issue around valuation, I think that a lot of those companies are looking at their current stock prices and trying to decide whether those are indicative of where they're going to be in the future. So I think those boards and those management teams are going through the process of letting those -- the new reality, if you will, settle in with them. But from our perspective, I guess what I'm trying to highlight is, first of all, we have a strong balance sheet and we can go after deals across the whole spectrum: Early-, middle- and late-stage compounds. And we will look for those deals consistent with good science and financial discipline. So we want to be aggressive in going after deals, but we want to do deals that create value for our shareholders."

And Jami, on the general approach to how one treats cancer, I actually don't agree with your assessment of our strategy, so let me try and reinterpret a little bit for you. First of all, what I've always said was in order to understand the benefits of combination therapy, you have to understand how monotherapy behaves. And we launched a very broad program in monotherapy with more than 30 different tumor types and many lines of therapy. But we've not shorted the combination studies. You look on ClinicalTrials.gov right now, about something, over 270 studies on ClinicalTrials.gov with KEYTRUDA, I haven't checked today. More than 100 of those are combination studies. And they include studies that are registration -- potentially registration-enabling. If you look at the KEYNOTE-189 study, for example, which will be delivering data next year in combination with chemotherapy. In addition to, of course, combination with chemotherapy data that we've already presented, there's quite a lot going on in combinations. Now we have combinations with radiation therapy, combinations with immunotherapies, combinations with traditional chemotherapies and combinations with targeted chemotherapies. And in addition, we have in the clinic, the GITR, LAG3, IL 10 and cCAM, which are our own Phase I programs that provide immuno-oncology molecules that could potentially be used in combination. So in totality, we have a very, very broad combination program, which includes both things that we own and things that either shouldn't be owned because they're, in essence, generic, or that we're doing in collaborations with others. And for example, in the IDO program, we're both collaborating with Incyte, and we have our own programs that we own as well. So a lot of work going on in combinations. Our goal, absolutely, is to identify the very best possible regimens from the many thousands that you and I have discussed previously, the many thousands of regimens that potentially we can employ in treating cancer patients."

And with regard to having to own them all, I don't think you have to. Particularly, if they can't be combined into a similar dosage form or have the same type of dosing regimen. And I get asked that all the time in diabetes for many years, where people said, ""Don't you have to have an insulin and a GLP-1 for JANUVIA to be successful?"" And we've shown that JANUVIA can be successful even if we don't have some of those combinations. It doesn't mean that we don't want a GLP-1 potentially, or other types of diabetes medicines, but we look at those as their own opportunities. At the same time, the reason that we think that the combination of our SGLT2 with JANUVIA can be successful is because you can put them into 1 tablet with the same dosing regimen. So that's the way we look at the combinations and I think that our strategy is a good one."

With that in mind, we wanted to explore more fully the landscape of IDO1 and CDO1 inhibitors. We had an opportunity with IOmet to gain access to, actually, quite a large set of starting materials and new chemistry, which enables us to think about how we would design an optimal molecule that could be used in a whole variety of different tumor types. We have a very good collaborative relationship with Incyte, and we're eager to see those programs advance just as quickly as possible for the benefit of patients, but we think there's some running room as well and an opportunity for us to use our chemical insights potentially to improve treatment regimens in that regard.

So Seamus, just to reiterate that in the course of our European review, the European Medicines Agency cited Merck's third-party manufacturer for issues that are largely related to inadequate record-keeping and the need for improvement in their quality management system. The problems do not affect, we do not believe, the safety, efficacy or quality specifications of the product. And hence, we don't believe the problems will affect the supply of the U.S. market, but we take these good manufacturing practice issues very seriously. And we're working with both regulatory agencies and the contract manufacturer to resolve the issues as expeditiously as possible. Secondly with respect to GITR, as you know, our program has been in the clinic for quite some time, but we have been advancing it very slowly because of concerns on our part, and on the part of regulators, too, we share these concerns that an agonist antibody could stimulate a fairly profound immune activation response, and those responses can be difficult to manage. So we're just getting to the point of -- in advancing that program, where we believe we're in the therapeutic range. We certainly do have data that our anti-GITR antibody behaves as an agonist. I think one of the issues has to do with cross-linking and which FC receptors are engaged by the therapy. As you know, we have 2 GITR antibodies that are in the clinic. There is a lot of enthusiasm in the community, but it will be some time, I think, before we understand whether, to what extent GITR antibodies will be useful."

When you think about first-line lung, all competitors will be talking about PD-L1 testing. So I believe that barrier will go away because all of us together will be talking about it. And the other thing that I think is important, is if the playing field is equal in lung and all else is close, every-3-week dosing is an advantage versus competition. And therefore, I think that the dosing for first-line lung patients could end up being an advantage for us if PD-L1 testing is communicated by all companies. But the other thing I'd want to emphasize, as I've said all along, this is a long-term view of this market. There will be multiple competitors that can do really well in this market. And I don't think we should look at any 1 quarter or short period of time. This market, over the next several years, with the number of tumor types that we're studying, with the amount of how well that we're continuing to develop combination products, we can continue to do really well.

Again, it's important to recognize that this is an event-driven trial. So we have about 300 patients that are enrolled in the study, there's a -- we've powered the study based on a certain number of progression events, progression-free survival is the primary endpoint. So it's actually just a question of when we hit the event number, from the time we hit the event number to the time we get to database lock involves polling the sites and there are a variety of questions that have to be answered. And then once the database is locked, the statistical analysis takes relatively little time. So we're not -- there are no other factors that go into this. We're not in any way manipulating it. We're just waiting until we hit this prespecified event trigger which defines the power for the study. And once that's available, then we'll be able to do that. Just with respect to ASCO, since you mentioned it. I didn't have a chance to go into it, but there's going to be a lot of new material presented at ASCO. We have 84, currently, abstracts, including 13 oral presentations that will be presented at ASCO. We're going to be discussing data from 20 different tumor types. We'll have additional data that we'll be presenting with respect to chemo combinations. And in particular, the data that comes from the KEYNOTE-021 study, which is combinations with traditional chemotherapy, Carbo-Pemetrexed, where overall response rates are really very high, nearly 60%. So there's a lot of information that will be communicated at ASCO."

And if so, what is it that's sort of bringing down the sales guidance by about $300 million, if you take out the impact of the currency move? And then the second question I have a is on Alzeimer's, and I would love to just get Merck's perspective on this. There's obviously been a lot of discussion around end points with the changes Lilly made recently to the solanezumab study. And for yours -- for your BACE inhibitor, in Prodromal, you have CDR sum of the boxes as your primary, I believe, in the Prodromal study. In the mild to moderate, you have ADAS-Cog and ADCS-ADL as co-primaries. So if you could just talk through sort of those end points and sort of how you think about the pros and cons of each in the different patient populations, I think that would be helpful, just given all the investor interest in that area."

And as you look at the guidance we provided, we flowed part of that benefit through in the guidance, but not all of it. And the single largest reason we did not flow all of it is the fact that we face earlier-than-expected generic entry on NASONEX, which is the largest driver of the number you quoted."

With respect to Alzeimer's endpoints, of course, there's been a lot of discussion over a long period of time about how to best to measure the deterioration that occurs as a result of Alzeimer's-related neurodegeneration. There are 2 -- at least 2, different things to be concerned about. One of course, is direct measurement of cognitive function by whatever tools one has, typically things like mental status examinations. And the other is the functional capability of individuals who are unfortunately suffering from Alzeimer's. Typically, the agency has asked to see both of those things assessed directly. And often in a primary endpoint, as a composite endpoint in clinical trials, it is possible, of course, to do that seriatum and take a single endpoint. Our view with respect to mild to moderate is that the best strategy is to look at both of those aspects of Alzeimer's-related performance, and that's the way we've handled it. We understand Lilly's thinking with respect to their earlier study and we continue to look at these questions. But at the moment, I think we feel comfortable with where we are with our end points."

And we're seeing good growth in countries like China, where we had about 11% growth outside of foreign exchange. And we're seeing good success in the areas of vaccines, our diabetes franchise and so forth. Where the pressure was primarily was Venezuela, but obviously, there's some turmoil that's happening in some markets, particularly in the Middle East, that have some impact. If you look at emerging markets over time, there's been a slight decline in growth, but we still expect there to be growth as we move forward into the future. With regard to JANUVIA, I said in the U.S., we had 9% growth versus prior year, but the best way to understand that is to look at underlying volume growth, which was about 5% versus prior year. And therefore, we did see some inventory movement of JANUVIA. It's important to note that just like last year, the quarters will fluctuate to some degree from one quarter to the next quarter. But overall, across the year, we expect growth for the JANUVIA franchise. And then the last thing I'll say is with regard to omarigliptin, for business reasons, we decided not to move forward submitting the applications in the United States or Europe. And it did not result from concerns on efficacy or safety, it was really for business reasons, for 2 primary reasons. Number one, we have a very high share of JANUVIA in those markets, so a lot of the product would've been cannibalizing our own DPP-4 share. We have a 75% share in the U.S. and a 65% share globally. The second reason is we are excited about launching, not just the monotherapy SGLT2, but the also the combination of an SGLT2 with JANUVIA, which we would've anticipated would be launched not too far after omarigliptin. And in order to focus more on growing JANUVIA, but then also the SGLT2 mono and more specifically the combo with JANUVIA, we felt was a better place for us to focus."

We are off to a good start this year with our first quarter performance. Our KEYTRUDA program expanded as we continued to launch this important cancer medicine around the world. Also, in the first quarter, we launched our new hepatitis C medicine, ZEPATIER. In addition to these ongoing product launches, our key in-line brands performed well, particularly JANUVIA, which continues to command predominant share within the DPP-4 class. Adam will provide context on this shortly.
We remain committed to delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. To do so, we will stay true to our goal of becoming the premier research-intensive global biopharmaceutical company, bringing forward medically important products that address many of the world's greatest health needs. And above all, it is critical that we do this in a sustainable manner that enables us to continuously reinvest in R&D.
Business development remains one of our most important priorities, and we are very actively engaged in finding the best external innovation that will help grow our portfolio and pipeline. We are confident that our scientific discernment, coupled with financial discipline, will allow us to identify and acquire the right assets at the right valuation to create long-term value for shareholders consistent with our innovation strategy.
Before I conclude, let me also emphasize that we are fully engaged in the challenging policy environment that our industry experiences now. We are actively addressing the key policy issues that can have an impact on our ability to fund the discovery and development of the next generation of innovative and differentiated medicines and vaccines, most notably pricing and tax reform in the United States. We're engaging key stakeholders in the health care environment to seek constructive solutions and to ensure that they understand the therapeutic and economic value Merck's products and business operations provide.

Our performance in the first quarter reflects our focus on execution and continued productivity improvements. We again delivered P&L leverage with growth, excluding exchange, on both the top and bottom lines. Total company revenues were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, first quarter revenues grew 3%, driven by both our Human Health and Animal Health businesses.
Venezuela negatively impacted Q1 revenues by approximately $240 million, reflecting the reduction of our operations in the country. As a reminder, we recorded $625 million of sales in Venezuela in 2015, which were more weighted to the first half of the year. So the year-over-year impact will be greatest in the first 2 quarters of this year.
Looking to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 77% in the quarter, an increase of 50 basis points versus the first quarter of 2015. Lower discards was the biggest driver of the year-over-year improvement. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $3.9 billion was 3% lower year-over-year or roughly flat, excluding foreign exchange favorability. Higher promotional spend behind our new products drove a slight increase in marketing and administrative, while lower licensing expenses contributed to a decline in research and development.
Taken together, we earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter, delivering 10% growth, excluding exchange, which reflects our continued commitment to delivering a leveraged P&L.
Turning now to our outlook for the rest of the year. We are narrowing and raising our revenue and EPS guidance for 2016. While we are experiencing more favorable exchange rates versus our original guidance, we are facing a few headwinds, in particular, the entry of generic NASONEX in the United States earlier than originally assumed, which we expect will partially offset the exchange rate favorability this year. We now expect full year 2016 revenues to be between $39 billion and $40.2 billion. This reflects an approximately 2% negative impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates.
We continue to expect our non-GAAP 2016 product gross margin and operating expenses to be roughly in line with 2015, and we still anticipate the non-GAAP tax rate for the full year to be between 21.5% and 22.5%. In terms of our 2016 EPS outlook, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $3.65 to $3.77. This reflects an approximately 2 percentage negative point impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates.
To summarize, we demonstrated strong performance, leveraging top line growth to deliver 10% growth in non-GAAP EPS, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We benefited from the contribution of new product launches while continuing to send [ph] growth in our key franchises and driving operational improvement across the company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger -- or I'm sorry, to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on the Global Human Health performance for the first quarter, and my comments will be on a constant currency basis. We are off to a solid start to the year. Total Human Health sales reached $8.1 billion, growing 2%, and we drove growth across our core areas of diabetes, vaccines, hospital specialty care and oncology.
And what I'll do now is highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'll start with primary care. The JANUVIA franchise had a strong quarter, growing 4% globally. In the United States, sales grew 9%, driven primarily by volume increases and some benefit from customer buying patterns. Outside of the U.S., we saw strong growth in Europe and Japan, offset by emerging markets, which was impacted by Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, JANUVIA franchise sales grew 5% outside of the U.S.
First quarter results for JANUVIA demonstrate that we can continue to grow volume and retain strong market share of about 75% in the United States and 65% globally. We continue to expect global JANUVIA franchise growth, ex exchange, in 2016.
Now I'll move on to our vaccine business. Sales of our vaccine portfolio grew 1% and reached about $1.3 billion on steady growth from GARDASIL and pediatric vaccines, partially offset by declines in our adult shingles vaccine ZOSTAVAX. ZOSTAVAX sales declined in the first quarter, resulting from a weaker flu season in the U.S., which means that less people go to get vaccinated in general, but also the recent changes to a ACIP recommendations for pneumococcal vaccines. We are actively working with customers to help them navigate the reimbursement for ZOSTAVAX, and expect this to be less of a hurdle over time.
Global GARDASIL franchise sales grew this quarter on continued strength from GARDASIL 9 launch in the U.S. We are encouraged by the recent CDC publication that reported a significant decrease in vaccine-type HPV prevalence since the introduction of HPV vaccination in the United States. The reduction was 64% in females aged 14 to 19, and 34% in females aged 20 to 24. If you consider that this reports those impacts only through 2012 and does not yet include males, it becomes apparent that we really can make a difference to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in the United States.
Next on Hospital and Specialty Care. Our acute care portfolio performed well in the quarter on steady growth from antibiotics, antifungals and Bridion. We are also pleased to be adding to our specialty care business with the launch of ZEPATIER. 
Sales in the first quarter were $50 million. While we're still early in the launch, we are seeing positive signs that ZEPATIER will play an important role in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Our team is working to secure assets for ZEPATIER, with conversations currently ongoing with many different public and private payers. The addition of ZEPATIER to the formulary at the Veterans Administration and with other customers reinforces our belief that our payer and our pricing strategy will maximize revenue and market share, and it will also broaden and accelerate patient access. Customers value ZEPATIER's profile, which offers high cure rates across a diverse group of patients, and we continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunity for ZEPATIER.
Finally, in oncology. We see significant potential for KEYTRUDA, which positions us as a global leader in immuno-oncology. In the first quarter, sales reached approximately $250 million, and it continued to be driven by our melanoma indications, as well as early traction in the U.S. in lung cancer. 
We are working to integrate PD-L1 testing as part of the routine treatment of lung cancer by continuing to demonstrate the value testing brings to physicians, to payers and to patients. Testing rates in the United States continue to increase, which is important not only for our second-line indication, but we believe also for when we have a first-line indication. 
We also see very strong performance outside of the U.S, which represented nearly half of first quarter KEYTRUDA sales. We are launching in melanoma in approximately 50 markets globally. And in some markets, we are the market leader despite being second to launch.
Given the strong survival results we've demonstrated in melanoma and second-line lung cancer, the early data we've seen in more than 20 cancer type, as well as the breadth and the depth of KEYTRUDA development program, we remain confident that KEYTRUDA will become foundational for the treatment of cancer over time.
In closing, we're off to a good start in 2016. This year, we will have to offset generic penetration of products, including NASONEX and CUBICIN. However, our investments in JANUVIA and KEYTRUDA and in ZEPATIER and other core areas are delivering results and positioning us for future growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

The momentum that our clinical development and regulatory groups established last year continues in 2016.

The momentum that our clinical development and regulatory groups established last year continues in 2016. I'll briefly review the highlights of the first quarter.
As has already been mentioned, beginning in January, we obtained regulatory approval for ZEPATIER in Canada, the United States and Switzerland. And speaking with hepatologists and infectious disease specialists, there is general enthusiasm for the high cure rates observed with ZEPATIER, and the ability to use in ZEPATIER in patients with compromised renal function, including patients undergoing hemodialysis.
Public health organizations are increasingly embracing a goal of large-scale elimination of hepatitis C infection, and we have been developing data, some of which we've presented at the liver meetings in Barcelona last month, documenting the ability of ZEPATIER to assist in this process, including in very difficult to treat patients who suffer from opioid addiction.
As Adam indicated, we've successfully launched ZEPATIER in the United States and are seeking approval in many markets around the world. In the course of our European review for ZEPATIER, the European Medicines Agency's cited Merck's third-party manufacturer for issues largely related to inadequate record keeping and the need for improvement in their quality management systems. We are working assiduously with regulators to resolve these issues. 
I should note that we do not believe that the problems identified at our third-party manufacturer affect the safety, efficacy or quality specifications of the product, and we do not believe that these problems will affect the supply to the U.S. market. Nevertheless, we take all matters related to good manufacturing prefaces very seriously, and we are working with regulatory agencies and the manufacturer to resolve these issues as expeditiously as possible. 
We continue to believe that EU approval can be achieved according to the mid-year time line that we perversely disclosed. However, our European launch will be delayed until the fourth quarter, or perhaps until the end of the first quarter of 2017, depending on how quickly these matters can be resolved.
While the registration process with ZEPATIER continues, we are also completing phase IIb studies of MK-3682, our uridinal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, when used in combination with ZEPATIER or in combination with another advanced NS5A inhibitor, MK-8408. Data from these studies, which will emerge over the next few months, will permit definitive selection of the appropriate registration-enabling regimens that will provide additional options for the estimated 150 million people around the world who are infected with hepatitis C virus. 
During the first quarter of our studies -- our studies of KEYTRUDA also advanced significantly. In April, we announced that FDA has accepted our filing on a priority review basis for the use of KEYTRUDA in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, following platinum-based chemotherapy, with a PDUFA date in early August. And this filing makes use of unit dosing at 200 milligrams every 3 weeks. We have shown that this dose yields exposures comparable to those observed using weight-based dosing, and unit dosing obviously relives providers of the responsibility of calculating patient-specific dose volumes.
Our head and neck cancer filing is reinforced by an exceptionally broad array of ongoing studies on this disease, including a controlled second-line study, the KEYNOTE-040 study; our first-line study, KEYNOTE-048, which will provide data in 2017.
We're also testing the use of KEYTRUDA in combination with the radiation -- with radiation plus chemotherapy with the TVEC oncolytic virus in collaboration with our colleagues at Amgen, and with an IDO1 inhibitor in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte.
A substantial amount of important new data from our KEYTRUDA program will be presented in the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings next month, including results in head and neck cancer patients who have failed both platinum and cetuximab therapy, and long-term survival data in melanoma patients from our original KEYNOTE-001 study. 
Also in April, we announced that the FDA granted a fourth breakthrough designation for KEYTRUDA in the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. As Margaret Shipp and colleagues from the Dana-Farber Cancer Research Center showed in a paper published last month in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, amplification of the chromosomal locus, including both PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands, is very common in Hodgkin lymphoma, and may represent a critical factor in the malignant transformation of Reed–Sternberg cells, the characteristic cell type in this cancer. This observation may help to explain why the very high response rates following KEYTRUDA treatment in Hodgkin's lymphoma patients are observed. 
Meanwhile, we continue to pursue registration for KEYTRUDA in second-line lung cancer in Europe. And our KEYNOTE-010 study, which will improve understanding of how best to use KEYTRUDA in this disease, is under review in the United States. You'll recall that in the KEYNOTE-010 trial, KEYTRUDA treatment meaningfully improved overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer NE histology, where tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker in 1% or more of a tumor cell, as compared to what could be achieved using conventional docetaxel chemotherapy.
Our first-line study of KEYTRUDA, KEYNOTE-024, comparing KEYTRUDA treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 strongly positive tumors, remains on track to deliver data at midyear.
Finally, progress continues across a broad range of other programs. Bezlotoxumab, our therapy designed to reduce recurrences of C. difficile associated enterocolitis, received priority review designation from the FDA with a PDUFA date in July. The FDA will hold an Advisory Committee meeting to review the bezlotoxumab filing on June 9, and our file is also under review in the European Union.
Clinical data are beginning to emerge for ertugliflozin, which will support our comprehensive filing for this new molecular entity, as both a single agent and in combination with JANUVIA or metformin by the end of the year. 
Separately, the long-awaited adjudication of our Phase III odanacatib data is now almost complete. With these data in hand, we will at last be in a position to assemble regulatory dossiers supporting the registration of this important once-weekly treatment for osteoporosis.
And among the many programs, for which considerable interest is expressed when I meet with external clinicians and scientists, is our Phase III trial studying letermovir as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus activation in patients receiving bone marrow transplants. We expect to have data in-house from this study by the end of the third quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Teri."

So it's still a little bit too early to give you exact accounts and names of accounts, but I can tell you that we feel good about potential access for '17, and then we'll see where we end up for '16. But I do think that there is opportunity there.

So we're spending a lot of time trying to get access at parity across the different segments in the United States, so that there's physician and patient choice."

All companies are analyzing I-O data with the FDA-required Cox stratified proportional hazards statistical test. However, Bristol implies that it analyzes I-O data a unique way, which emphasizes the non-proportional aspect of the I-O curve. And I guess in support of their view, they have stopped more studies early than any other company. It is also true that Bristol studies generally are longer than competitors' studies. Does Merck understand what Bristol is doing? Does Merck believe it is doing the same thing? And if not, how is what Merck is doing different?"

There's no mystery here, really. The mechanisms for statistical analysis of these kinds of studies have been refined over a period of many decades, and while the statistical literature continues to advance in ways that are quite intriguing, the reality is that we have a lot of data based on all of the prior studies that we've done with KEYTRUDA and with Opdivo, the studies that have been done and published with Opdivo as well, that provide a substantial amount of positive predictive value. So in a Bayesian sense, one can predict outcomes fairly comfortably, and we know, therefore, we can put that information into our power calculations. We have pretty good understanding of where we're going and when we have to look. Of course, you can get surprises in different tumor types. But I guess one thing to stress is the general consistency of the responses that we've seen across a very large number of tumor types, both with respect to response rates and durability. So we don't find it mysterious. I think the explanation for the early stopping of the Bristol-Myers studies is largely related to the size of the studies and -- more than anything else. And there's nothing special about non-proportional analyses."

So we're now trending, if you just look, at about $1 billion product just based on where we are today. About half the sales were outside the U.S., half the sales in the U.S. And we continued to see growth in the U.S. There's really not inventory issues, to any large degree, for this product, frankly. If you look at where sales are coming from, the vast majority of the sales are still coming from melanoma indications. And if you look at that, a lot of it is still coming in second-line, although we see first-line continuing to grow. Internationally, the sales are coming primarily, obviously, from our melanoma indication. As you start to think about lung, we are seeing increases in the number of physicians that are testing patients now. And a lot of those increases are actually coming from patients with first-line lung being tested. So the fact that we continue to encourage testing, I believe, is only going to help us ultimately when we launch in first-line lung. And then the first thing that you want to do is you want to see who gets to market first. And I think that, that always matters. So let's see who gets to market first in first-line lung, and that will be an important milestone. Secondarily, as you said, we have to see what the cutoff points are. But in addition to that, even with cutoff points, we also have to see what the guidelines say and how the reimbursement works. So I feel pretty good about where we are today. I feel optimistic about first-line lung. I can tell you, I'm thrilled that we're only 1 of 2 PD-L1s in the marketplace today, and I think that sets us up for very good growth in the future."

I think that when we look at this, because of the dramatic lowering in LDL cholesterol, the dramatic increase in HDL cholesterol, the changes in Lp(a), the expectation is that patients who are receiving anacetrapib should do better in terms of major cardiovascular events. That's what we're testing, it's a 30,000 patient study. And we're going to have the data next year, and we'll have a chance to look and see. We're approaching the end of the treatment period.

But we -- our expectation is that monotherapy is rapidly going to move to combination therapy. And as you know, oncologists believe that the best way to treat cancer is with cocktail or combination therapy. And clearly, your competitors have all pursued combinations, either with I-O + I-O or chemo combo. So just -- you have pursued a monotherapy strategy and are behind the curve on combination.

So I think those boards and those management teams are going through the process of letting those -- the new reality, if you will, settle in with them. But from our perspective, I guess what I'm trying to highlight is, first of all, we have a strong balance sheet and we can go after deals across the whole spectrum: Early-, middle- and late-stage compounds.

And Jami, on the general approach to how one treats cancer, I actually don't agree with your assessment of our strategy, so let me try and reinterpret a little bit for you. First of all, what I've always said was in order to understand the benefits of combination therapy, you have to understand how monotherapy behaves. And we launched a very broad program in monotherapy with more than 30 different tumor types and many lines of therapy. But we've not shorted the combination studies. You look on ClinicalTrials.gov right now, about something, over 270 studies on ClinicalTrials.gov with KEYTRUDA, I haven't checked today. More than 100 of those are combination studies. And they include studies that are registration -- potentially registration-enabling. If you look at the KEYNOTE-189 study, for example, which will be delivering data next year in combination with chemotherapy. In addition to, of course, combination with chemotherapy data that we've already presented, there's quite a lot going on in combinations. Now we have combinations with radiation therapy, combinations with immunotherapies, combinations with traditional chemotherapies and combinations with targeted chemotherapies. And in addition, we have in the clinic, the GITR, LAG3, IL 10 and cCAM, which are our own Phase I programs that provide immuno-oncology molecules that could potentially be used in combination. So in totality, we have a very, very broad combination program, which includes both things that we own and things that either shouldn't be owned because they're, in essence, generic, or that we're doing in collaborations with others. And for example, in the IDO program, we're both collaborating with Incyte, and we have our own programs that we own as well. So a lot of work going on in combinations. Our goal, absolutely, is to identify the very best possible regimens from the many thousands that you and I have discussed previously, the many thousands of regimens that potentially we can employ in treating cancer patients."

And I get asked that all the time in diabetes for many years, where people said, ""Don't you have to have an insulin and a GLP-1 for JANUVIA to be successful?"" And we've shown that JANUVIA can be successful even if we don't have some of those combinations. It doesn't mean that we don't want a GLP-1 potentially, or other types of diabetes medicines, but we look at those as their own opportunities. At the same time, the reason that we think that the combination of our SGLT2 with JANUVIA can be successful is because you can put them into 1 tablet with the same dosing regimen. So that's the way we look at the combinations and I think that our strategy is a good one."

With that in mind, we wanted to explore more fully the landscape of IDO1 and CDO1 inhibitors. We had an opportunity with IOmet to gain access to, actually, quite a large set of starting materials and new chemistry, which enables us to think about how we would design an optimal molecule that could be used in a whole variety of different tumor types. We have a very good collaborative relationship with Incyte, and we're eager to see those programs advance just as quickly as possible for the benefit of patients, but we think there's some running room as well and an opportunity for us to use our chemical insights potentially to improve treatment regimens in that regard.

So Seamus, just to reiterate that in the course of our European review, the European Medicines Agency cited Merck's third-party manufacturer for issues that are largely related to inadequate record-keeping and the need for improvement in their quality management system. The problems do not affect, we do not believe, the safety, efficacy or quality specifications of the product. And hence, we don't believe the problems will affect the supply of the U.S. market, but we take these good manufacturing practice issues very seriously. And we're working with both regulatory agencies and the contract manufacturer to resolve the issues as expeditiously as possible. Secondly with respect to GITR, as you know, our program has been in the clinic for quite some time, but we have been advancing it very slowly because of concerns on our part, and on the part of regulators, too, we share these concerns that an agonist antibody could stimulate a fairly profound immune activation response, and those responses can be difficult to manage. So we're just getting to the point of -- in advancing that program, where we believe we're in the therapeutic range. We certainly do have data that our anti-GITR antibody behaves as an agonist. I think one of the issues has to do with cross-linking and which FC receptors are engaged by the therapy. As you know, we have 2 GITR antibodies that are in the clinic. There is a lot of enthusiasm in the community, but it will be some time, I think, before we understand whether, to what extent GITR antibodies will be useful."

When you think about first-line lung, all competitors will be talking about PD-L1 testing. So I believe that barrier will go away because all of us together will be talking about it. And the other thing that I think is important, is if the playing field is equal in lung and all else is close, every-3-week dosing is an advantage versus competition. And therefore, I think that the dosing for first-line lung patients could end up being an advantage for us if PD-L1 testing is communicated by all companies. But the other thing I'd want to emphasize, as I've said all along, this is a long-term view of this market. There will be multiple competitors that can do really well in this market. And I don't think we should look at any 1 quarter or short period of time. This market, over the next several years, with the number of tumor types that we're studying, with the amount of how well that we're continuing to develop combination products, we can continue to do really well. The last thing I'll say is that if you look at Europe, in countries in Europe, we actually came to market after competition. And in many markets, including big markets like Germany in melanoma, despite that, we now are the market leader.

And we're seeing good growth in countries like China, where we had about 11% growth outside of foreign exchange. And we're seeing good success in the areas of vaccines, our diabetes franchise and so forth. Where the pressure was primarily was Venezuela, but obviously, there's some turmoil that's happening in some markets, particularly in the Middle East, that have some impact. If you look at emerging markets over time, there's been a slight decline in growth, but we still expect there to be growth as we move forward into the future. With regard to JANUVIA, I said in the U.S., we had 9% growth versus prior year, but the best way to understand that is to look at underlying volume growth, which was about 5% versus prior year. And therefore, we did see some inventory movement of JANUVIA. It's important to note that just like last year, the quarters will fluctuate to some degree from one quarter to the next quarter. But overall, across the year, we expect growth for the JANUVIA franchise. And then the last thing I'll say is with regard to omarigliptin, for business reasons, we decided not to move forward submitting the applications in the United States or Europe. And it did not result from concerns on efficacy or safety, it was really for business reasons, for 2 primary reasons. Number one, we have a very high share of JANUVIA in those markets, so a lot of the product would've been cannibalizing our own DPP-4 share. We have a 75% share in the U.S. and a 65% share globally. The second reason is we are excited about launching, not just the monotherapy SGLT2, but the also the combination of an SGLT2 with JANUVIA, which we would've anticipated would be launched not too far after omarigliptin. And in order to focus more on growing JANUVIA, but then also the SGLT2 mono and more specifically the combo with JANUVIA, we felt was a better place for us to focus."

Thanks for joining the call this morning.  our performance this quarter reflects our continuing progress in advancing our priority products and programs. As we accelerate the launch of KEYTRUDA around the world, our researchers are continuing to steady KEYTRUDA with an extensive clinical development program that spans a multitude of cancer types. We are confident that KEYTRUDA will be a key treatment in cancer for many years to come.  We also made good strides in the launch of ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C medicine during its full first quarter on the market. Our key in-line brands such as JANUVIA, who's sales are still growing nearly 10 years after its initial launch, also significantly contributed to our performance this quarter. We remain committed to our innovation strategy and our mission on delivering important medicines and vaccines that address many of the world's foremost health care and global unmet medical need.  Business development continues to be a priority, and we are committed to finding the best external signs to enrich our pipeline and portfolio. As I have previously outlined, we are taking a disciplined approach both financially and scientifically, to identify and acquire opportunities at the right finance evaluation. In addition to acquisitions, we also are engaging in scientific and commercial partnerships to pair our best internal innovations with the best external innovation available.  As a recent example of our efforts, earlier this year, we closed on the acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals, which will complement and enhance our primary care pipeline. Last month, we began a new scientific collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics to develop personalized cancer vaccines by combining KEYTRUDA with Moderna vaccine technologies. Additionally, we recently announced our intent to acquire Vallée of Brazil to fortify our Animal Health business in Latin America. 
In closing, our performance in the quarter positions us well for the second half of the year. Looking forward, we will remain focused on executing on our launches and driving the performance of our strongest brands as well as advancing and augmenting our broad pipeline to deliver a balanced and differentiated portfolio of valuable medicines and vaccines.  We believe this strategic focus will create long-term growth for the company and sustainable value for both society and shareholders.

Our results in the second quarter reflect continued execution across the organization with our broad portfolio of products, contributing to growth both on the top and bottom line. Total company revenues were $9.8 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, second quarter revenues grew 3%.  Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses performed well in the quarter, delivering growth despite an approximately $210 million headwind from sales in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015. As you'll remember, we still [indiscernible] our operations in Venezuela towards the end of last year and therefore, reported negligible sales from the country in the second quarter of this year.
Partially offsetting growth in human and animal health this quarter were lower contributions from our revenue hedge program and third-party manufacturing sales versus the prior year. While our revenue hedging program continues to contribute to the top line, it's expected to have a negative impact in each quarter this year on a year-over-year basis.  In terms of revenue guidance, we now expect full year revenue of $39.1 billion [ph] to $40.1 billion [ph] including an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-July rates.
Looking to the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 75.7%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the second quarter of 2015. Foreign exchange and product mix both contributed to the year-over-year improvement, as growth in higher-margin products such as KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER offset the declines in lower margin products such as REMICADE. On a full year basis, non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be roughly flat versus last year.  Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.2 billion increased 4% year-over-year, with lower marketing and administrative expenses and an approximately 2 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange, partially offsetting higher research and development expenses in the quarter. The increase in R&D reflects the $200 million upfront payment from Moderna for our recently announced collaboration on the development of personalized cancer vaccines, as well as higher investments in our clinical programs.  We continue to expect non-GAAP operating expense for the full year to be generally in line with the prior year. We anticipate incremental spend in R&D will be partially offset by lower marketing and administrative expenses.  Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 19%, primarily driven by the beneficial impact of orphan drug federal income tax credits for KEYTRUDA reported in the quarter. We continue to anticipate the full year rate to be between 21.5% and 22.5%, which includes the impact of the R&D tax credit.  Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter, delivering 8% growth or 12%, excluding exchange, and another quarter of P&L leverage.
On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.43 per share in the quarter. For the full year, we're raising the lower end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance narrowing the range to $3.67 to $3.77 per share. We now expect foreign exchange to have an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact in mid-July rates.  On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn $1.98 to $2.08 per share for the full year.
All together, we delivered growth both nominally and excluding exchange on the top and bottom line. We continue to have a number of opportunities in our pipeline, with new product launches and with the potential for business development. We remain disciplined in our approach to expense management, recognizing the need to balance delivering in the short-term while making the appropriate investments to drive long-term growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter, and my comments will be on a constant-currency basis. Global Human Health delivered another quarter of grow",883,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter, and my comments will be on a constant-currency basis. Global Human Health delivered another quarter of growth with sales of $8.7 billion of growth of 2%. We drove increases in core areas of oncology, diabetes, vaccines and Hospital and Specialty Care which approximately offset by declines in REMICADE and NASONEX.
I'll now highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'm going to begin with oncology. This is an exciting time for Merck as the leader in immuno-oncology, and as we work to make KEYTRUDA foundational to the treatment of cancer. We're launching our melanoma indication in more than 50 markets globally, and we are preparing for launches in additional tumors. In the United States, we are maintaining our strong position in melanoma, and we're launching a second-line lung cancer. And we are ready, we are ready to launch imminently in head and neck cancer and we preparing for launch in first-line lung cancer.  In the second quarter, sales of KEYTRUDA reached approximately $315 million, a continued strength for melanoma indication. In the U.S., we're also seeing increasing sales contributions from progress we're making in second-line lung cancer.
Importantly, PBL 1 testing rates continue to increase, with approximately 2/3 of physicians now testing to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from PD-1-directed therapy. This is very important as we prepare for a potential first-line indication where we recently announced the KEYTRUDA offers and overall survival benefit compared to chemotherapy in patients with tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1. Customers are eagerly awaiting opportunity to treat lung cancer in the first-line setting with KEYTRUDA.  We also believe that all of the work that we've been doing to drive testing for second-line use will position us well in first-line when we come to market. With a broad and deep clinical program that continues to grow, and continued to generate positive monotherapy and combination data, we remain very excited about the long-term opportunity for KEYTRUDA.
Next, in Primary Care, the JANUVIA franchise grew 2% this quarter. In the United States, we continue to drive TRX growth of 4% to 5%. As you recall, we saw 14% and 22% growth in the second and third quarters of last year respectively. These cost comparisons has an impact on the year-over-year changes this quarter and will also impact year-over-year changes in the third quarter. But I continue to focus on the underlying TRX volume growth and it remains strong in the United States.  Outside of the U.S., we generated strong growth in Europe and Canada and in emerging markets. We remain confident in our diabetes franchise for the remainder of 2016, and we're pleased with our continued strong access that we expect in 2017.
Moving to our vaccine business, sales of the vaccine portfolio reached about $1.3 billion. Growth of 7% came primarily from our pediatric vaccines, which was partially offset by GARDASIL. Overall, GARDASIL sales declined 7%. In the U.S., sales of GARDASIL grew only 2% due to lower CBC buying. Outside of the U.S., sales were impacted by the timing of public sector purchases in Brazil.  We are celebrating the 10-year anniversary of launch of GARDASIL. Real-world data that was recently published continue to show the benefits of HPV vaccination. And we are seeing increased uptake and utilization of our HPV vaccine around the world. Also, influential organizations, including the CDC, ASCO and the WHO have expressed strong support for HPV vaccination.  It is worth noting that many markets are moving toward implementing a 2-dose regimen of GARDASIL, and we have discussions ongoing in the U.S. as well. We anticipate this change to a 2-dose regimen prevail to an effect in the U.S. by the end of 2016 or early in 2017.
Finally, in Hospital and Specialty Care, sales grew 3% to $2.1 billion. Growth in acute care and contributions from launch products were partially offset by declines in REMICADE and ISENTRESS, due to competitive pressures that we expect will continue going forward. We are making good progress with the ZEPATIER launch. We are having favorable conversations with payers and we have garnered some early wins in both the public and the private sectors for 2016 and 2017. In the VA, utilization of ZEPATIER is ramping up nicely, and we've also started to see some advancement in Medicare Part D, in managed Medicaid and in commercial segments. Customers see the value that ZEPATIER can offer with the high cure rates and a broad and diverse set of patients.  It will take some time for ZEPATIER to ramp up as formularies come online, but we are pleased with the access that we have achieved so far.
Finally, BRIDION is growing well on strong global demand and early contributions in the U.S. launch. In the U.S., our teams are rapidly securing formula assets and initial indicators of used by physicians in the suite are encouraging. 
In closing, our teams delivered another quarter of solid performance. We have momentum in our core focus areas and strong execution for our key launches. This positions us well for the second half of 2016 and for 2017. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

During the second quarter, we made significant progress in gaining registration for important new products and also advance the number of new programs. On the infectious disease front, in June, the FDA Antimicrobial Advisory Committee agreed on a vote of 10 to 5 with 1 abstention that substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of [indiscernible] now called ZINPLAVA, in preventing recurrence of C. difficile infection in patients 18 years and older had been presented. Subsequently, the FDA has requested additional information to enable their review of [indiscernible]  File with a result of a new action date of October 23 has been set. We are working closely with the FDA and with other regulatory agencies to make ZINPLAVA available to patients at risk for recurrent C. difficile infection.  Considerable progress has also been made in advancing curative therapies for hepatitis C virus infection. The European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use known as the CHMP, adopted a positive opinion regarding the approval of ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection noting its high efficacy against HCV genotypes 1 and 4 including in patients with compensated cirrhosis and severe kidney disease.  This recommendation has now been ratified by the European Commission. I remind you that ZEPATIER is not cleared by the kidney and can be used in patients irrespective of baseline renal function.  As I mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, we are working to supply the European market. We've made good progress on this front and still expect that we'll be able to launch ZEPATIER in the EU in the fourth quarter or at the latest in the first quarter of 2017. Reviews and other jurisdictions are also preceding.
Meanwhile, we are continuing to explore additional treatments for the more than 150 million people with hepatitis C virus infection around the world. Progress has made in advancing our triplet regimen and incorporating MK-3682, a nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, along with a protease inhibitor grazoprevir and a novel NS5A inhibitor, MK8408. We now have substantial experience with this combination, with more than 1,000 patients enrolled in clinical trials. The results from our extensive Phase IIb program will be available later this year and will be presented at major scientific meetings.  Because of the favorable properties of MK-3682, we're also exploring a doublet regimen employing just this polymerase inhibitor along with MK-8408. Together we believe that these combinations can offer broad efficacy for HCV-infected patients irrespective of HCV genotype in a variety of clinical settings.
Lastly, on the infectious disease front, I note that our V920 vaccine to prevent Ebola virus disease received FDA breakthrough designation and PRIME designation from the EMA, permitting close regulatory interactions to optimize development and facilitate review of this important potentially life-saving agent.
Turning now to oncology, this was an extremely active quarter for KEYTRUDA, our PD-1 directed immunotherapy for malignant disease. I have said repeatedly that I expect that KEYTRUDA by virtue of the spectrum of its activity will prove to be foundational in future cancer care.  At the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings last month, we presented data demonstrating the activity of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in 15 different tumor types. We also presented data from multiple studies where KEYTRUDA has been used in combination with conventional chemotherapy with targeted therapies and with immunotherapies. In all, we now how more than 300 clinical studies underway exploring the activity of KEYTRUDA in more than 30 different tumor types, more than 100 of these studies employ KEYTRUDA in combination with other agents.
In Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who failed at least 1 prior therapy and whose tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker. We have championed the view that because patient outcomes from the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer are correlated with the extent to which PD-L1 is expressed on the tumor, it is important to assess the status of this biomarker prior to initiating therapy with the PD-1 directed agent.  The data supporting our dossier were derived from the KEYNOTE-010 study, which showed that KEYTRUDA treatment in populations with 1% or more of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 yielded superior overall survival compared with the results from traditional chemotherapy. These data are also under review by the FDA, with an action date of October 24.
During the quarter, we also reported top line results of our KEYNOTE-024 study, which compared KEYTRUDA monotherapy to platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA treatment demonstrated superior progression-free survival and superior overall survival in this setting. A manuscript describing these results has now been accepted for publication, and hence, should appear in the near future.  We've also began to work with regulatory agencies to enable supplementary filing of these data to our existing KEYTRUDA labels. 
Beyond treatment of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, we have pursued accelerated approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. The PDUFA date for this review is August 9.  
Based on our current trial enrollments, we have several additional potential filings for KEYTRUDA over the next 12 to 18 months, including bladder cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and the setting of microsatellite instability and relapsed refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, an indication for which we received breakthrough designation from the FDA in the second quarter.  Moreover, data continue to provide intriguing evidence of that broad-spectrum of KEYTRUDA activity. Earlier this month, for example, Julie Graph and colleagues at the Oregon Health Sciences University published a preliminary report demonstrating meaningful responses in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer who have progressed on [indiscernible]. As Rob noted on the expenses increase this quarter in large part owing to the establishment of our business partnership with Moderna on the development of novel immunogens with the goal of further improving the efficacy of our immunomodulatory agents, including KEYTRUDA. While we have through the Moderna investment as well as the funding of key clinical trials, increased our support for KEYTRUDA in the immuno-oncology, we continue to pursue other important new therapies. For example, this week, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals, which gives us access to a set of P2X3 receptor antagonists. Their lead program, AF-219, is currently under study in a fully enrolled Phase IIb trial for the treatment of chronic cough and also being investigated in a Phase II study for the same indication in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  I look forward to updating you on this and other programs in the coming months.
Meanwhile, we continue to support the development of our ertugliflozin, both as monotherapy and in combination with JANUVIA. We have presented important Phase III data on this program, and will submit regulatory dossiers before the end of the year. Also, we expect to receive the adjudicated cardiovascular safety data from odanacatib from our external evaluators in the next few days, which will then be analyzed over the next several weeks. It is my expectation that the U.S. odanacatib file will be submitted in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Teri."

The first thing is I'll be very glad to being first to market being first to market for indication matters. And I remember when we first to market with melanoma, people asking if you have progressive free survival but you don't have overall survival they come out with overall survival won't matter saying I just want to be first and as long as we have the studies under way to show that ultimately, we can show overall survival that we should be okay. If you look at first-line lung, the first thing I'd say is we're glad to first. The second thing is the issue we have right now with PD-L1 testing in second-line where the competition has all comers, I think that will go away in first-line because everybody will be doing PD-L1 testing. So that obstacle the we face today goes away with first-line. The second question will become, not only what the indication is but what reimbursement occurs. And in even today, you start to see reimbursement occurring even when you don't necessarily have the indication. And the good news is at the time of the first-line launch, we should have data in second-line showing a positive results in the PD-L1 plus 1 positive. So we'll have data and plus 1 to 50 for second line. So we still have to see how it plays out, but I'm pleased to be first to launch hopefully. And then we'll see how the reimbursement works out over time."

Indeed, we have the first data in first-line lung that show that KEYTRUDA is superior to traditional chemotherapy. And that again, it needs to be reviewed, but when people have a chance to look at the data, that represents a real seachange in the way people treat lung cancer. Combination chemotherapy has been the main state of therapy for decades. So that's going to be a pretty big deal. If you look at response rates and in perfect indicator, of course, the best response rates that we see are the combination of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy like, [indiscernible] that we reported small number of patients and 71% overall response rate in lung cancer setting, which is obviously very provocative. With time, I think we'll discover how best to use these agents in combination.

Just again as an example, the fact that we're seeing prostate cancer responses, remember that previously, it was thought prostate cancer was refractory to PD-1-directed therapy, Opdivo treatment, there were really no results. So that shows you that we're still learning a great deal about how to use this as monotherapy. Combinations, a lot of combinations appear to be showing early signs of signals, whether that's combinations with chemotherapy or combinations in the case of Opdivo or us as well, with [indiscernible] with CTLA-4. Time will tell which is the best combination. If it turns out that [indiscernible] was the best combination, then that would be the way to go forward, and we obviously have studies using that combination as to others.

What I am singling out that this is development pervasive very important priority and we are very actively engaged in trying to find the best scientific innovations. OYou're main focus is to continue to augment our Phase II and early-stage pipeline. We remain very active with new partnerships and collaborations, and we're also looking actively for bolt-on acquisitions in key growth areas. From our perspective, I think it's important to remember that for us, a bolt-on acquisition is not defined by size. When we talk about bolt-on, we're focusing more on finding the right asset that can augment our pipeline as compared to doing a large deal just for example cost synergies. So all of that being said, we are looking very carefully, we're taking our time and we're being diligent in seeking out the right assets at the right valuation. And I think that's what you should read into this. And I think if we move across what's happened in the industry, there has been a rereading of certain assets. But those boards and management teams are also taking time to assess what they actually think will happen going forward in their future. So I wouldn't read anything into it other than the deals we've done and the ones that we think can add value and will continue to look at all kinds of deals going forward."

So with regard to REMICADE, our strategy all along has been to try to hold onto as many existing patients that are currently treated as we can.

However, we're certainly starting to see that we're not only moving new patients, but there are some countries in Scandinavia and even some other larger countries that are beginning to think about substituting therapeutically even existing patients. So I do believe that we are going to continue to see erosion for REMICADE, the biosimilar impacts that are accelerating and are going to continue as we go through the year. As I think about biosimilars in the future, I think the key is going to be what your order of entry is into the marketplace and being first to second in the marketplace will matter. Each market molecule is going to be different and we are going to pull different strategies based upon those markets. You see different strategy, for example, you might use in the U.K. and France versus Germany. And we'll have to be very specific by market how we launch our biosimilar portfolio.

With regard to JANUVIA outside the U.S., we continue to see good growth in Europe and Canada. And that growth is coming from volume and the volume growth in most of those markets are fairly strong. I'd say the biggest issue we are facing is the fact that our market share is so high in countries like Germany that it's hard to grow market share so we have to continue to find ways to grow from Sofanarias and ultimately from metformin. But just hundreds of millions of patients that need to be treated outside the U.S. If you look at the emerging markets, we have strong double-digit growth of JANUVIA.

Our performance this quarter reflects our continuing progress in advancing our priority products and programs. As we accelerate the launch of KEYTRUDA around the world, our researchers are continuing to steady KEYTRUDA with an extensive clinical development program that spans a multitude of cancer types. We are confident that KEYTRUDA will be a key treatment in cancer for many years to come. 
We also made good strides in the launch of ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C medicine during its full first quarter on the market. 
Our key in-line brand, such as JANUVIA, whose sales are still growing nearly 10 years after its initial launch, also significantly contributed to our performance this quarter. We remain committed to our innovation strategy and our mission of delivering important medicines and vaccines that address many of the world's foremost health challenges and global unmet medical need. 
Business development continues to be a priority, and we are committed to finding the best external science to enrich our pipeline and portfolio. As I've previously outlined, we are taking a disciplined approach, both financially and scientifically, to identify and acquire opportunities at the right financial evaluation. In addition to acquisitions, we also are engaging in scientific and commercial partnerships to pair our best internal innovations with the best external innovation available. As a recent example of our efforts, earlier this year, we closed on the acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals, which will complement and enhance our primary care pipeline. 
Last month, we began a new scientific collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics to develop personalized cancer vaccines by combining KEYTRUDA with Moderna's vaccine technology. Additionally, we recently announced our intent to acquire Vallée of Brazil to fortify our Animal Health business in Latin America. 
In closing, our performance in the quarter positions us well for the second half of the year. Looking forward, we will remain focused on executing on our launches and driving the performance of our strongest brands as well as advancing and augmenting our broad pipeline to deliver a balanced and differentiated portfolio of valuable medicines and vaccines. We believe this strategic focus will create long-term growth for the company and sustainable value for both society and shareholders.

Our results in the second quarter reflect continued execution across the organization with our broad portfolio of products, contributing to growth both on the top and bottom line. 
Total company revenues were $9.8 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, second quarter revenues grew 3%. Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses performed well in the quarter, delivering growth despite an approximately $210 million headwind from sales in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015. As you'll remember, we scaled back our operations in Venezuela towards the end of last year and therefore, recorded negligible sales from the country in the second quarter of this year.
Partially offsetting growth in Human and Animal Health this quarter were lower contributions from our revenue hedge program and third-party manufacturing sales versus the prior year. While our revenue hedging program continues to contribute to the top line, it's expected to have a negative impact in each quarter this year on a year-over-year basis. In terms of revenue guidance, we now expect full year revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion, including an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-July rates.
Looking to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 75.7%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the second quarter of 2015. Foreign exchange and product mix both contributed to the year-over-year improvement, as growth in higher-margin products, such as KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, offset the declines in lower-margin products such as REMICADE. On a full year basis, non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be roughly flat versus last year. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.2 billion increased 4% year-over-year, with lower marketing and administrative expenses and an approximately 2 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange partially offsetting higher research and development expenses in the quarter. The increase in R&D reflects the $200 million upfront payment to Moderna for our recently announced collaboration on the development of personalized cancer vaccines as well as higher investments in our clinical programs. 
We continue to expect non-GAAP operating expense for the full year to be generally in line with the prior year. We anticipate incremental spend in R&D will be partially offset by lower marketing and administrative expenses.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 19%, primarily driven by the beneficial impact of orphan drug federal income tax credits for KEYTRUDA recorded in the quarter. We continue to anticipate the full year rate to be between 21.5% and 22.5%, which includes the impact of the R&D tax credit. 
Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter, delivering 8% growth or 12%, excluding exchange and another quarter of P&L leverage. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.43 per share in the quarter. 
For the full year, we're raising the lower end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance, narrowing the range to $3.67 to $3.77 per share. We now expect foreign exchange to have an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact in mid-July rates. On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn $1.98 to $2.08 per share for the full year.
Altogether, we delivered growth both nominally and excluding exchange on the top and bottom line. We continue to have a number of opportunities in our pipeline with new product launches and with a potential for business development. We remain disciplined in our approach to expense management, recognizing the need to balance delivering in the short term while making the appropriate investments to drive long-term growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. Global Human Health delivered another quarter of growth",882,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. 
Global Human Health delivered another quarter of growth with sales of $8.7 billion, a growth of 2%. We drove increases in core areas of oncology, diabetes, vaccines and Hospital and Specialty Care, which are partially offset by declines in REMICADE and NASONEX.
I'll now highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'm going to begin with oncology. This is an exciting time for Merck as the leader in immuno-oncology and as we work to make KEYTRUDA foundational to the treatment of cancer. We're launching our melanoma indication in more than 50 markets globally, and we are preparing for launches in additional tumors. In the United States, we are maintaining our strong position in melanoma, and we're launching in second-line lung cancer. And we are ready to launch imminently in head and neck cancer, and we're preparing for the launch in first-line lung cancer. In the second quarter, sales of KEYTRUDA reached approximately $315 million, a continued strength in the melanoma indication. In the U.S., we're also seeing increasing sales contributions from progress we're making in second-line lung cancer.
Importantly, PD-L1 testing rates continue to increase, with approximately 2/3 of physicians now testing to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from PD-1-directed therapy. This is very important as we prepare for a potential first-line indication, where we recently announced that KEYTRUDA offers an overall survival benefit compared to chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1. Customers are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to treat lung cancer in the first-line setting with KEYTRUDA. We also believe that all of the work that we've been doing to drive testing for second-line use will position us well in first-line when we come to market. With the broad and deep clinical program that continues to grow and continues to generate positive monotherapy and combination data, we remain very excited about the long-term opportunity for KEYTRUDA.
Next, in Primary Care. The JANUVIA franchise grew 2% this quarter. In the United States, we continue to drive TRx growth of 4% to 5%. As you'll recall, we saw 14% and 22% growth in the second and third quarters of last year, respectively. These cost comparisons had an impact on the year-over-year change in this quarter and will also impact year-over-year changes in the third quarter. But I continue to focus on the underlying TRx volume growth and it remains strong in the United States. Outside of the U.S., we generated strong growth in Europe and Canada and in emerging markets. We remain confident in our diabetes franchise for the remainder of 2016, and we are pleased with our continued strong access that we expect in 2017.
Moving to our vaccine business. Sales of the vaccine portfolio reached about $1.3 billion. Growth of 7% came primarily from our pediatric vaccines, which was partially offset by GARDASIL. Overall, GARDASIL sales declined 7%. In the U.S., sales of GARDASIL grew only 2% due to lower CDC buying. Outside of the U.S., sales were impacted by the timing of public sector purchases in Brazil. We are celebrating the 10-year anniversary of launch of GARDASIL. Real-World Data that was recently published continue to show the benefits of HPV vaccination, and we are seeing increased uptake and utilization of our HPV vaccine around the world. Also, influential organizations, including the CDC, ASCO and the WHO, have expressed strong support for HPV vaccination. It is worth noting that many markets are moving toward implementing a 2-dose regimen of GARDASIL, and there are discussions ongoing in the U.S. as well. We anticipate this change to a 2-dose regimen could go into effect in the U.S. by the end of 2016 or early in 2017.
Finally, in Hospital and Specialty Care. Sales grew 3% to $2.1 billion. Growth in acute care and contributions from launch products were partially offset by declines in REMICADE and ISENTRESS due to competitive pressures that we expect will continue going forward. We are making good progress with the ZEPATIER launch. We're having favorable conversations with payers, and we've garnered some early wins in both the public and the private sectors for 2016 and 2017. In the VA, utilization of ZEPATIER is ramping up nicely, and we've also started to see some advancement in Medicare Part D, in managed Medicaid and in commercial segments. Customers see the value that ZEPATIER can offer with high cure rates in a broad and diverse set of patients. It will take some time for ZEPATIER to ramp up as formularies come online, but we are pleased with the access that we have achieved so far.
Finally, BRIDION is growing well on strong global demand and early contributions in the U.S. launch. In the U.S., our teams are rapidly securing formulary assets, and initial indicators used by physicians in the surgical suite are encouraging. 
In closing, our teams delivered another quarter of solid performance. We have momentum in our core focus areas and strong execution for our key launches. This positions us well for the second half of 2016 and for 2017. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."
288502,345409426,1017339,"Merck & Co. Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Adam. During the second quarter, we made significant progress in gaining registration for important new products and also advance the number of new programs. On the infectious disease front, in June, the FDA Antimicrobial Advisory Committee agreed",1215,"Thanks, Adam. During the second quarter, we made significant progress in gaining registration for important new products and also advance the number of new programs. On the infectious disease front, in June, the FDA Antimicrobial Advisory Committee agreed on a vote of 10 to 5 with 1 abstention that substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of bezlotoxumab, now called ZINPLAVA, in preventing recurrence of C. difficile infection in patients 18 years and older had been presented. Subsequently, the FDA has requested additional information to enable their review of the ZINPLAVA file with the result that a new action date of October 23 has been set. We are working closely with the FDA and with other regulatory agencies to make ZINPLAVA available to patients at risk for recurrent C. difficile infection. 
Considerable progress has also been made in advancing curative therapies for hepatitis C virus infection. The European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, known as the CHMP, adopted a positive opinion regarding the approval of ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection, noting its high efficacy against HCV genotypes 1 and 4, including in patients with compensated cirrhosis and severe kidney disease. This recommendation has now been ratified by the European Commission. I'll remind you that ZEPATIER is not cleared by the kidney and can be used in patients irrespective of baseline renal function. As I mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, we are working to supply the European market. We've made good progress on this front and still expect that we'll be able to launch ZEPATIER in the EU in the fourth quarter or at the latest, in the first quarter of 2017. Reviews in other jurisdictions are also preceding.
Meanwhile, we are continuing to explore additional treatments for the more than 150 million people with hepatitis C virus infection around the world. Progresses made in advancing our triplet regimen and incorporating MK-3682, a uridinal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor; along with a protease inhibitor, grazoprevir; and a novel NS5A inhibitor, MK-8408. We now have substantial experience with this combination, with more than 1,000 patients enrolled in clinical trials. The results from our extensive Phase IIb program will be available later this year and will be presented at major scientific meetings. Because of the favorable properties of MK-3682, we're also exploring a doublet regimen employing just this polymerase inhibitor, along with MK-8408. Together, we believe that these combinations can offer broad efficacy for HCV-infected patients irrespective of HCV genotype and in a variety of clinical settings.
Lastly, on the infectious disease front, I note that our V920 vaccine to prevent Ebola virus disease received FDA breakthrough designation and PRIME designation from the EMA, permitting close regulatory interactions to optimize development and facilitate review of this important potentially life-saving agent.
Turning now to oncology. This was an extremely active quarter for KEYTRUDA, our PD-1-directed immunotherapy for malignant disease. I've said repeatedly that I expect that KEYTRUDA, by virtue of the spectrum of its activity, will prove to be foundational in future cancer care. At the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings last month, we presented data demonstrating the activity of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in 15 different tumor types. We also presented data from multiple studies, where KEYTRUDA has been used in combination with conventional chemotherapy, with targeted therapies and with immunotherapies. In all, we now have more than 300 clinical studies underway exploring the activity of KEYTRUDA in more than 30 different tumor types. More than 100 of these studies employ KEYTRUDA in combination with other agents.
In Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have failed at least one prior therapy and whose tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker. We have championed the view that because patient outcomes from the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer are correlated with the extent to which PD-L1 is expressed on the tumor, it is important to assess the status of this biomarker prior to initiating therapy with the PD-1-directed agent. The data supporting our dossier were derived from the KEYNOTE-010 study, which showed that KEYTRUDA treatment in populations with 1% or more of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 yielded superior overall survival compared with the results of traditional chemotherapy. These data are also under review by the FDA with an action date of October 24.
During the quarter, we also reported top line results of our KEYNOTE-024 study, which compared KEYTRUDA monotherapy to platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA treatment demonstrated a superior progression-free survival and superior overall survival in this setting. A manuscript describing these results has now been accepted for publication and hence, should appear in the near future. We've also begun to work with regulatory agencies to enable supplementary filing of these data to our existing KEYTRUDA labels. 
Beyond treatment of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, we have pursued accelerated approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. The PDUFA date for this review is August 9. 
Based on our current trial enrollments, we have several additional potential filings for KEYTRUDA over the next 12 to 18 months, including bladder cancer; gastric cancer; colorectal cancer in the setting of microsatellite instability; and relapsed refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, an indication for which we received breakthrough designation from the FDA in the second quarter. 
Moreover, data continue to provide intriguing evidence of the broad spectrum of KEYTRUDA activity. Earlier this month, for example, Julie Graff and colleagues at the Oregon Health & Sciences University published a preliminary report demonstrating meaningful responses in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, who have progressed on enzalutamide. 
As Rob noted, R&D expenses increased this quarter in large part owing to the establishment of our business partnership with Moderna on the development of novel immunogens with the goal of further improving the efficacy of our immunomodulatory agents, including KEYTRUDA. While we have through the Moderna investment as well as our funding of key clinical trials increased our support for KEYTRUDA in immuno-oncology, we continue to pursue other important new therapies. For example, this week, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals, which gives us access to a set of P2X3 receptor antagonists. Their lead program, AF-219, is currently under study in a fully enrolled Phase IIb trial for the treatment of chronic cough and is also being investigated in a Phase II study for the same indication in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. I look forward to updating you on this and other programs in the coming months.
Meanwhile, we continue to support the development of ertugliflozin, both as monotherapy and in combination with JANUVIA. We have presented important Phase III data on this program and will submit regulatory dossiers before the end of the year. Also, we expect to receive the adjudicated cardiovascular safety data from odanacatib from our external evaluators in the next few days, which will then be analyzed over the next several weeks. It is my expectation that the U.S. odanacatib file will be submitted in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Teri."

The first thing is I will be very glad to be first to market -- being first to market for new indication matters. And I remember, when we were first to market with melanoma, people are asking if you have a progression-free survival but you don't have overall survival, they come out with overall survival won't matter. And I kept saying I just want to be first. And as long as we have the studies under way to show that, ultimately, we can show overall survival that we should be okay. If you look at first-line lung, the first thing I'd say is we're glad to be first. The second thing is, the issue that we have right now with PD-L1 testing in second-line, where the competition has all comers, I think that will go away in first-line because everybody will be doing PD-L1 testing. So that obstacle that we face today goes away with first-line. The second question will become not only what the indication is, but what reimbursement occurs. And even today, you start to see reimbursement occurring even where you don't necessarily have the indication. And the good news is at the time of the first-line launch, we should have data in second-line showing positive results in the PD-L1 plus 1 positive. So we'll have data in plus 1 to 50 for second-line. So we still have to see how it plays out, but I'm pleased to be first to launch, hopefully. And then we'll see how the reimbursement works out over time."

The truth of the matter is we really, as I've said, need to understand how well KEYTRUDA works as monotherapy and for that matter, Opdivo, in order to be able to understand how to proceed with combination therapy. So combination therapy work is all extremely early. We do not have any data that tell us that any combination provides superior overall survival versus monotherapy. Indeed, we have the first data in first-line lung that show that KEYTRUDA is superior to traditional chemotherapy. And that -- again, it needs to be reviewed. But when people have a chance to look at the data, that represents a real sea change in the way people treat lung cancer. Combination chemotherapy has been the main state of therapy for decades. So that's going to be a pretty big deal. If you look at response rates, an imperfect indicator, of course, the best response rates that we see are the combination of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy like methotrexate, where we reported small number of patients, 71% overall response rate in the lung cancer setting, which is obviously very provocative. With time, I think we'll discover how best to use these agents in combination, whether that's an immuno-oncology combination with a CTLA-4-directed molecule, with other molecules, we have 10 of them in development of our own, or with chemotherapeutic agents. Time will tell."

Combinations -- a lot of combinations appear to be showing early signs of signals, whether that's combinations with chemotherapy or combinations, in the case of Opdivo or -- and us as well, with ipilimumab with CTLA-4. Time will tell which is the best combination. If it turns out that ipilimumab was the best combination, then that would be the way to go forward. And we obviously have studies using that combination as do others. Our combination studies with targeted chemotherapies and traditional chemotherapies are also very far along, and that will be extremely interesting. We'll have a chance to see those data relatively soon. We'll finish the first of those sets of studies in the third quarter, so we'll have to see the data very soon."

Obviously, the first thing we're doing is trying to secure access. And as I mentioned, we have early wins. So in Medicare Part D, for example, we have United and Express Scripts, where they've added us at parity to their Medicare Part D formulary effective July 1. In Medicaid, we're making significant progress in not only getting our formulary, but some of those Medicaid formularies have increased the number of patients that they're making eligible for treatment. We're working very closely with our commercial customers, and access is progressing. We still have some negotiations that are ongoing as we speak. And as I said, the VA continues to ramp up nicely. So we're encouraged by the access that we're getting. And now we have to work to build market share, and that's what we're going to focus on as we move forward. In terms of the overall market, it's a large market. There's about 3 million patients in the U.S. that still need to be treated, so it's going to be a market that will be around for a while. We're currently seeing just about -- just over 200,000-or-so patients per year treated in the U.S. That's a lot more than if you would've gone back 5 years ago, where there were somewhere between 120,000 to 150,000. So we've certainly seen an increase, but that increase, I think, has maxed out. And I think we'll see more of where we are as a steady-state as we move forward. And it really -- the size and the pace of the market is going to depend on getting more patients diagnosed and through the system as we move forward."

So that's not a concern, frankly. In addition to that, with first-line lung, I believe everybody is going to start to measure PD-L1 right from the start. So even for the competition, I think they're going to be advocating the importance of measuring PD-L1 moving forward. So that obstacle will go away. And then, ultimately, I believe it's going to come down to the market share that you're able to achieve within the lung segment. And therefore, I'm very pleased that we'll be the first one to launch. If you look specifically at our share of our business, about 70% of our business is in melanoma. 15% is in lung, and then the rest is in all other indications.

My view looking at the data is that they're potentially practice-changing, and that's -- it's important that there be a chance to review that. Those data, of course, wouldn't be available for review by NCCN or other agencies until such time this publication takes place. Then the -- you also raised a question about our interaction with regulatory agencies. And all I can say about that is we've begun our discussions, we're working closely with regulatory agencies to understand the basis for filing supplements in the context of having multiple reviews.

We really haven't seen much in the way of deals this year. The deals have been relatively small in nature. Is that what the hint is today? That the types of deals you're likely to do are likely to be like the Moderna deals or the smaller deals?

We remain very active with new partnerships and collaborations, and we're also looking actively for bolt-on acquisitions in key growth areas. From our perspective, I think it's important to remember that, for us, a bolt-on acquisition is not defined by size. When we talk about a bolt-on, we're focusing more on finding the right asset that can augment our pipeline as compared to doing a large deal just for, for example, cost synergies. So all of that being said, we are looking very carefully. We're taking our time, and we're being diligent in seeking out the right assets at the right valuation.

So I do believe that we're going to continue to see erosion for REMICADE, that the biosimilar impacts are accelerating and they're going to continue as we go through the year. As I think about biosimilars in the future, I think the key is going to be what your order of entry is into the marketplace, and being first to second in the marketplace will matter. Each market molecule is going to be different, and we're deploying different strategies based upon those markets.

But we're also pleased that we are maintaining the steady growth of JANUVIA as a foundation to launch this product by KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER. Beyond that, as you know, we have things that are coming out of our pipeline. Roger made reference to building onto our diabetes franchise with ertug as well as odanacatib. And next year, we're looking forward to being unblinded with respect to our base inhibitor, anacetrapib. So those would be some of the internal things. And then as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, we continue to look at business development and inorganic growth as an important critical part of our strategy going forward. As I sit here today, obviously, I haven't anything new to announce to you, but I just want you to know that we're actively pursuing value-creating inorganic growth opportunities."

It's remarkable, when you think about the number of indications that we're studying KEYTRUDA for and we think about how we're building this huge wall of data, it's going to be real hard for followers to match us with the data that we're going to have over time. And we're going to have to find ways to work with payers so that they can really find the right way to ensure the patients that need our monotherapy or our combination therapies in the future have access to it.

So first of all, with regard to emerging markets, ex Venezuela, ex foreign exchange, we grew about 6%. So we continue to have good growth in the emerging markets. And if you look at China, we had 11% growth ex foreign exchange. So the growth, albeit not as good as it was a couple of years ago, it continues to be robust. With that said, lumping emerging markets together today is not a good idea because you have very different dynamics in terms of what's occurring in a market like China versus what's occurring in a market like Russia or what's happening in Argentina. So we really do focus market by market what our opportunities for growth, and then we titrate our expense base in those markets based upon the opportunities. But I do believe that the emerging markets will provide growth going forward and remain an important opportunity for us as we move forward. With regard to JANUVIA outside the U.S., we continue to see good growth in Europe and Canada, and that growth is coming from volume. And the volume growth in most of those markets is very strong. I'd say the biggest issue we're facing is the fact that our market share is so high in countries like Germany that it's hard to grow market share so we have to continue to find ways to grow from Sofanarias and ultimately, from metformin. But just hundreds and millions of patients that need to be treated outside the U.S. If you look at the emerging markets, we have strong double-digit growth of JANUVIA. I think that's going to continue over time. And we really have not gotten NRDL approval for JANUVIA in China yet. So once that's achieved, I think that, that represents another opportunity for us for growth of the JANUVIA franchise outside of the U.S."

Our performance this quarter reflects our continuing progress in advancing our priority products and programs. As we accelerate the launch of KEYTRUDA around the world, our researchers are continuing to study KEYTRUDA with an extensive clinical development program that spans a multitude of cancer types. We are confident that KEYTRUDA will be a key treatment in cancer for many years to come. 
We also made good strides in the launch of ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C medicine, during its full first quarter on the market. 
Our key in-line brands, such as JANUVIA, whose sales are still growing nearly 10 years after its initial launch, also significantly contributed to our performance this quarter. We remain committed to our innovation strategy and our mission of delivering important medicines and vaccines that address many of the world's foremost health challenges and global unmet medical need. 
Business development continues to be a priority, and we are committed to finding the best external science to enrich our pipeline and portfolio. As I've previously outlined, we are taking a disciplined approach, both financially and scientifically, to identify and acquire opportunities at the right financial valuations. In addition to acquisitions, we also are engaging in scientific and commercial partnerships to pair our best internal innovations with the best external innovation available. As a recent example of our efforts, earlier this year, we closed on the acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals, which will complement and enhance our primary care pipeline. 
Last month, we began a new scientific collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics to develop personalized cancer vaccines by combining KEYTRUDA with Moderna's vaccine technology. Additionally, we recently announced our intent to acquire Vallée of Brazil to fortify our Animal Health business in Latin America. 
In closing, our performance in the quarter positions us well for the second half of the year. Looking forward, we will remain focused on executing on our launches and driving the performance of our strongest brands as well as advancing and augmenting our broad pipeline to deliver a balanced and differentiated portfolio of valuable medicines and vaccines. We believe this strategic focus will create long-term growth for the company and sustainable value for both society and shareholders.

Our results in the second quarter reflect continued execution across the organization, with our broad portfolio of products contributing to growth both on the top and bottom line. Total company revenues were $9.8",601,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our results in the second quarter reflect continued execution across the organization, with our broad portfolio of products contributing to growth both on the top and bottom line. 
Total company revenues were $9.8 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, second quarter revenues grew 3%. Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses performed well in the quarter, delivering growth despite an approximately $210 million headwind from sales in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015. As you'll remember, we scaled back our operations in Venezuela towards the end of last year and therefore, recorded negligible sales from the country in the second quarter of this year.
Partially offsetting growth in Human and Animal Health this quarter were lower contributions from our revenue hedge program and third-party manufacturing sales versus the prior year. While our revenue hedging program continues to contribute to the top line, it's expected to have a negative impact in each quarter this year on a year-over-year basis. In terms of revenue guidance, we now expect full year revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion, including an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-July rates.
Looking to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 75.7%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the second quarter of 2015. Foreign exchange and product mix both contributed to the year-over-year improvement, as growth in higher-margin products, such as KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, offset the declines in lower-margin products such as REMICADE. On a full year basis, non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be roughly flat versus last year. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.2 billion increased 4% year-over-year, with lower marketing and administrative expenses and an approximately 2 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange partially offsetting higher research and development expenses in the quarter. The increase in R&D reflects the $200 million upfront payment to Moderna for our recently announced collaboration on the development of personalized cancer vaccines as well as higher investments in our clinical programs. 
We continue to expect non-GAAP operating expense for the full year to be generally in line with the prior year. We anticipate incremental spend in R&D will be partially offset by lower marketing and administrative expenses.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 19%, primarily driven by the beneficial impact of orphan drug federal income tax credits for KEYTRUDA recorded in the quarter. We continue to anticipate the full year rate to be between 21.5% and 22.5%, which includes the impact of the R&D tax credit. 
Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter, delivering 8% growth, or 12% excluding exchange, and another quarter of P&L leverage. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.43 per share in the quarter. 
For the full year, we're raising the lower end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance, narrowing the range to $3.67 to $3.77 per share. We now expect foreign exchange to have an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact at mid-July rates. On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn $1.98 to $2.08 per share for the full year.
Altogether, we delivered growth both nominally and excluding exchange on the top and bottom line. We continue to have a number of opportunities in our pipeline with new product launches and with the potential for business development. We remain disciplined in our approach to expense management, recognizing the need to balance delivering in the short term while making the appropriate investments to drive long-term growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. Global Human Health delivered another quarter of growth",883,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. 
Global Human Health delivered another quarter of growth with sales of $8.7 billion, a growth of 2%. We drove increases in core areas of oncology, diabetes, vaccines and Hospital and Specialty Care, which were partially offset by declines in REMICADE and NASONEX.
I'll now highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'm going to begin with oncology. This is an exciting time for Merck as the leader in immuno-oncology and as we work to make KEYTRUDA foundational to the treatment of cancer. We're launching our melanoma indication in more than 50 markets globally, and we are preparing for launches in additional tumors. In the United States, we are maintaining our strong position in melanoma, and we're launching in second-line lung cancer. And we are ready to launch imminently in head and neck cancer, and we're preparing for the launch in first-line lung cancer. In the second quarter, sales of KEYTRUDA reached approximately $315 million, a continued strength in the melanoma indication. In the U.S., we're also seeing increasing sales contributions from progress we're making in second-line lung cancer.
Importantly, PD-L1 testing rates continue to increase, with approximately 2/3 of physicians now testing to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from PD-1-directed therapy. This is very important as we prepare for a potential first-line indication, where we recently announced that KEYTRUDA offers an overall survival benefit compared to chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1. Customers are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to treat lung cancer in the first-line setting with KEYTRUDA. We also believe that all of the work that we've been doing to drive testing for second-line use will position us well in first-line when we come to market. With a broad and deep clinical program that continues to grow and continues to generate positive monotherapy and combination data, we remain very excited about the long-term opportunity for KEYTRUDA.
Next, in Primary Care. The JANUVIA franchise grew 2% this quarter. In the United States, we continue to drive TRx growth of 4% to 5%. As you'll recall, we saw 14% and 22% growth in the second and third quarters of last year, respectively. These tough comparisons had an impact on the year-over-year changes this quarter and will also impact year-over-year changes in the third quarter. But I continue to focus on the underlying TRx volume growth, and it remains strong in the United States. Outside of the U.S., we generated strong growth in Europe and Canada and in emerging markets. We remain confident in our diabetes franchise for the remainder of 2016, and we are pleased with our continued strong access that we expect in 2017.
Moving to our vaccine business. Sales of the vaccine portfolio reached about $1.3 billion. Growth of 7% came primarily from our pediatric vaccines, which was partially offset by GARDASIL. Overall, GARDASIL sales declined 7%. In the U.S., sales of GARDASIL grew only 2% due to lower CDC buying. Outside of the U.S., sales were impacted by the timing of public sector purchases in Brazil. We are celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the launch of GARDASIL. Real-World Data that was recently published continued to show the benefits of HPV vaccination, and we are seeing increased uptake and utilization of our HPV vaccine around the world. Also, influential organizations, including the CDC, ASCO and the WHO, have expressed strong support for HPV vaccination. It is worth noting that many markets are moving toward implementing a 2-dose regimen of GARDASIL, and there are discussions ongoing in the U.S. as well. We anticipate this change to a 2-dose regimen could go into effect in the U.S. by the end of 2016 or early in 2017.
Finally, in Hospital and Specialty Care. Sales grew 3% to $2.1 billion. Growth in acute care and contributions from launch products were partially offset by declines in REMICADE and ISENTRESS due to competitive pressures that we expect will continue going forward. We are making good progress with the ZEPATIER launch. We're having favorable conversations with payers, and we've garnered some early wins in both the public and the private sectors for 2016 and 2017. In the VA, utilization of ZEPATIER is ramping up nicely, and we've also started to see some advancement in Medicare Part D, in managed Medicaid and in commercial segments. Customers see the value that ZEPATIER can offer with high cure rates in a broad and diverse set of patients. It will take some time for ZEPATIER to ramp up as formularies come online, but we are pleased with the access that we have achieved so far.
Finally, BRIDION is growing well on strong global demand and early contributions from the U.S. launch. In the U.S., our teams are rapidly securing formulary access, and initial indicators of use by physicians in the surgical suite are encouraging. 
In closing, our teams delivered another quarter of solid performance. We have momentum in our core focus areas and strong execution for our key launches. This positions us well for the second half of 2016 and for 2017. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

During the second quarter, we made significant progress in gaining registration for important new products and also advanced a number of new programs. On the infectious disease front, in June, the FDA Antimicrobial Advisory Committee agreed",1216,"Thanks, Adam. During the second quarter, we made significant progress in gaining registration for important new products and also advanced a number of new programs. On the infectious disease front, in June, the FDA Antimicrobial Advisory Committee agreed on a vote of 10 to 5 with 1 abstention that substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of bezlotoxumab, now called ZINPLAVA, in preventing recurrence of C. difficile infection in patients 18 years and older had been presented. Subsequently, the FDA has requested additional information to enable their review of the ZINPLAVA file with the result that a new action date of October 23 has been set. We are working closely with the FDA and with other regulatory agencies to make ZINPLAVA available to patients at risk for recurrent C. difficile infection. 
Considerable progress has also been made in advancing curative therapies for hepatitis C virus infection. The European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, known as the CHMP, adopted a positive opinion regarding the approval of ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection, noting its high efficacy against HCV genotypes 1 and 4, including in patients with compensated cirrhosis and severe kidney disease. This recommendation has now been ratified by the European Commission. I'll remind you that ZEPATIER is not cleared by the kidney and can be used in patients irrespective of baseline renal function. As I mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, we are working to supply the European market. We've made good progress on this front and still expect that we'll be able to launch ZEPATIER in the EU in the fourth quarter or at the latest, in the first quarter of 2017. Reviews in other jurisdictions are also preceding.
Meanwhile, we are continuing to explore additional treatments for the more than 150 million people with hepatitis C virus infection around the world. Progress was made in advancing our triplet regimen and incorporating MK-3682, a uridinal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor; along with a protease inhibitor, grazoprevir; and a novel NS5A inhibitor, MK-8408. We now have substantial experience with this combination, with more than 1,000 patients enrolled in clinical trials. The results from our extensive Phase IIb program will be available later this year and will be presented at major scientific meetings. Because of the favorable properties of MK-3682, we're also exploring a doublet regimen employing just this polymerase inhibitor, along with MK-8408. Together, we believe that these combinations can offer broad efficacy for HCV-infected patients irrespective of HCV genotype and in a variety of clinical settings.
Lastly, on the infectious disease front, I note that our V920 vaccine to prevent Ebola virus disease received FDA breakthrough designation and PRIME designation from the EMA, permitting close regulatory interactions to optimize development and facilitate review of this important potentially life-saving agent.
Turning now to oncology. This was an extremely active quarter for KEYTRUDA, our PD-1-directed immunotherapy for malignant disease. I've said repeatedly that I expect that KEYTRUDA, by virtue of the spectrum of its activity, will prove to be foundational in future cancer care. At the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings last month, we presented data demonstrating the activity of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in 15 different tumor types. We also presented data from multiple studies, where KEYTRUDA has been used in combination with conventional chemotherapy, with targeted therapies and with immunotherapies. In all, we now have more than 300 clinical studies underway exploring the activity of KEYTRUDA in more than 30 different tumor types. More than 100 of these studies employ KEYTRUDA in combination with other agents.
In Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have failed at least one prior therapy and whose tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker. We have championed the view that because patient outcomes from the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer are correlated with the extent to which PD-L1 is expressed on the tumor, it is important to assess the status of this biomarker prior to initiating therapy with the PD-1-directed agent. The data supporting our dossier were derived from the KEYNOTE-010 study, which showed that KEYTRUDA treatment in populations with 1% or more of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 yielded superior overall survival compared with the results of traditional chemotherapy. These data are also under review by the FDA with an action date of October 24.
During the quarter, we also reported top line results of our KEYNOTE-024 study, which compared KEYTRUDA monotherapy to platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA treatment demonstrated a superior progression-free survival and superior overall survival in this setting. A manuscript describing these results has now been accepted for publication and hence, should appear in the near future. We've also begun to work with regulatory agencies to enable supplementary filing of these data to our existing KEYTRUDA labels. 
Beyond treatment of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, we have pursued accelerated approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. The PDUFA date for this review is August 9. 
Based on our current trial enrollments, we have several additional potential filings for KEYTRUDA over the next 12 to 18 months, including bladder cancer; gastric cancer; colorectal cancer in the setting of microsatellite instability; and relapsed refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, an indication for which we received breakthrough designation from the FDA in the second quarter. 
Moreover, data continue to provide intriguing evidence of the broad spectrum of KEYTRUDA activity. Earlier this month, for example, Julie Graff and colleagues at the Oregon Health & Science University published a preliminary report demonstrating meaningful responses in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer who have progressed on enzalutamide. 
As Rob noted, R&D expenses increased this quarter, in large part owing to the establishment of our business partnership with Moderna on the development of novel immunogens with the goal of further improving the efficacy of our immunomodulatory agents, including KEYTRUDA. While we have, through the Moderna investment as well as our funding of key clinical trials, increased our support for KEYTRUDA in immuno-oncology, we continue to pursue other important new therapies. For example, this week, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals, which gives us access to a set of P2X3 receptor antagonists. Their lead program, AF-219, is currently under study in a fully enrolled Phase IIb trial for the treatment of chronic cough and is also being investigated in a Phase II study for the same indication in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. I look forward to updating you on this and other programs in the coming months.
Meanwhile, we continue to support the development of ertugliflozin, both as monotherapy and in combination with JANUVIA. We have presented important Phase III data on this program and will submit regulatory dossiers before the end of the year. Also, we expect to receive the adjudicated cardiovascular safety data from odanacatib from our external evaluators in the next few days, which will then be analyzed over the next several weeks. It is my expectation that the U.S. odanacatib file will be submitted in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Teri."

And I kept saying I just want to be first. And as long as we have the studies underway to show that, ultimately, we can show overall survival that we should be okay. If you look at first-line lung, the first thing I'd say is we're glad to be first. The second thing is, the issue that we have right now with PD-L1 testing in second-line, where the competition has all comers, I think that will go away in first-line because everybody will be doing PD-L1 testing. So that obstacle that we face today goes away with first-line. The second question will become not only what the indication is, but what reimbursement occurs. And even today, you start to see reimbursement occurring even where you don't necessarily have the indication. And the good news is at the time of the first-line launch, we should have data in second-line showing positive results in the PD-L1 plus 1 positive. So we'll have data in plus 1 to 50 for second-line. So we still have to see how it plays out, but I'm pleased to be first to launch, hopefully. And then we'll see how the reimbursement works out over time."

The truth of the matter is we really, as I've said, need to understand how well KEYTRUDA works as monotherapy and, for that matter, Opdivo, in order to be able to understand how to proceed with combination therapy. So combination therapy work is all extremely early. We do not have any data that tell us that any combination provides superior overall survival versus monotherapy. Indeed, we have the first data in first-line lung that show that KEYTRUDA is superior to traditional chemotherapy. And that -- again, it needs to be reviewed. But when people have a chance to look at the data, that represents a real sea change in the way people treat lung cancer. Combination chemotherapy has been the mainstay of therapy for decades. So that's going to be a pretty big deal. If you look at response rates, an imperfect indicator, of course, the best response rates that we see are the combination of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy like pemetrexed, where we reported a small number of patients, 71% overall response rate in the lung cancer setting, which is obviously very provocative. With time, I think we'll discover how best to use these agents in combination, whether that's an immuno-oncology combination with a CTLA-4-directed molecule, with other molecules, we have 10 of them in development of our own, or with chemotherapeutic agents.

So even for the competition, I think they're going to be advocating the importance of measuring PD-L1 moving forward. So that obstacle will go away.

It seems quite a bit lower than I would have anticipated this quarter. The second question is as it relates to the manuscript that's in place -- obviously, we don't know the timing. But one would presume that, that could impact NCCN guidelines and obviously, uptake in the front-line setting. So am I thinking about the commercial impact of that publication, and what would be the second publication to sort of validate the effect that, obviously, you're going to see an overall survival benefit in that patient population? And the last question is relative to the transcript. Obviously, you don't want any surprises with the FDA's filing and evaluation, so one would presume that the filing, in fact, could be with the agency at this point. Would that be a separate filing per se? Or is it possible that, that could be incorporated into the existing filing for KEYNOTE-010? We have seen the agency moving that way before, but should we think of this as a separate and distinct filing? Or is it possible that it could be incorporated into the KEYNOTE-010 filing?"

That's what we refer to as the orphan drug tax credit. This relates to certain indications within and stages within malignant melanoma that did receive a designation. I think we got it back in 2013, and then we spent the majority of the time since then accumulating the data and validating the expense, and that led to the accrual you saw in the quarter.

And the first thing is to step through the primary and secondary endpoints and the characteristics of the treatment results. And thereafter, there'll be a lot of color and shading that will be added in other publications. It's important data to get out there. My view looking at the data is that they're potentially practice-changing, and that's -- it's important that there be a chance to review that. Those data, of course, wouldn't be available for review by NCCN or other agencies until such time as publication takes place. Then the -- you also raised a question about our interaction with regulatory agencies. And all I can say about that is we've begun our discussions, we're working closely with regulatory agencies to understand the basis for filing supplements in the context of having multiple reviews. And maybe if I could elevate just a little bit, I would say that the workload for regulatory agencies, given the very large number of studies that we and our competitors are doing in this field, is quite substantial. And how best to manage that workload and evaluate all these new data that are coming in is something, I think, that FDA and other regulatory agencies are wrestling with."

On almost every conference call or meeting, you hinted at the desire to do deals, business development, the importance of that to your long-term strategy. We really haven't seen much in the way of deals this year. The deals have been relatively small in nature. Is that what the hint is today? That the types of deals you're likely to do are likely to be like the Moderna deals or the smaller deals? Or should we still expect that Merck is likely to announce a major transaction, which is something that I think you kind of signaled earlier in the year?

What I am singling is that business development remains a very important priority, and we are very actively engaged in trying to find the best scientific innovations. Our main focus is to continue to augment our Phase II and early-stage pipeline. We remain very active with new partnerships and collaborations, and we're also looking actively for bolt-on acquisitions in key growth areas. From our perspective, I think it's important to remember that, for us, a bolt-on acquisition is not defined by size. When we talk about a bolt-on, we're focusing more on finding the right asset that can augment our pipeline as compared to doing a large deal just for, for example, cost synergies. So all of that being said, we are looking very carefully. We're taking our time, and we're being diligent in seeking out the right assets at the right valuation. And I think that's what you should read into this. And I think if you look across what's happened in the industry, there has been a re-rating of certain assets. But those boards and management teams are also taking time to assess what they actually think will happen going forward in their future. So I wouldn't read anything into it other than the deals we've done are the ones that we think can add value, and we'll continue to look at all kinds of deals going forward."

So with regard to REMICADE, our strategy all along has been to try to hold onto as many existing patients that are currently treated as we can, and I think we've done a very good job with that. Most of our loss of revenue came from reference pricing due to lower prices from the biosimilars. However, we're certainly starting to see that we're not only losing new patients, but there are some countries in Scandinavia and even some other larger countries that are beginning to think about substituting therapeutically even existing patients. So I do believe that we're going to continue to see erosion for REMICADE, that the biosimilar impacts are accelerating and they're going to continue as we go through the year. As I think about biosimilars in the future, I think the key is going to be what your order of entry is into the marketplace, and being first to second in the marketplace will matter. Each market molecule is going to be different, and we're deploying different strategies based upon those markets. You see a different strategy, for example, that you might use in the U.K. and France versus Germany. And we'll have to be very specific by market how we launch our biosimilar portfolio.

I'd say the biggest issue we're facing is the fact that our market share is so high in countries like Germany that it's hard to grow market share so we have to continue to find ways to grow from sulfonylureas and ultimately, from metformin. But just hundreds and millions of patients that need to be treated outside the U.S. If you look at the emerging markets, we have strong double-digit growth of JANUVIA.

Our performance this quarter reflects our continuing progress in advancing our priority products and programs. As we accelerate the launch of KEYTRUDA around the world, our researchers are continuing to study KEYTRUDA with an extensive clinical development program that spans a multitude of cancer types. We are confident that KEYTRUDA will be a key treatment in cancer for many years to come. 
We also made good strides in the launch of ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C medicine, during its full first quarter on the market. 
Our key in-line brands, such as JANUVIA, whose sales are still growing nearly 10 years after its initial launch, also significantly contributed to our performance this quarter. We remain committed to our innovation strategy and our mission of delivering important medicines and vaccines that address many of the world's foremost health challenges and global unmet medical need. 
Business development continues to be a priority, and we are committed to finding the best external science to enrich our pipeline and portfolio. As I've previously outlined, we are taking a disciplined approach, both financially and scientifically, to identify and acquire opportunities at the right financial valuations. In addition to acquisitions, we also are engaging in scientific and commercial partnerships to pair our best internal innovations with the best external innovation available. As a recent example of our efforts, earlier this year, we closed on the acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals, which will complement and enhance our primary care pipeline. 
Last month, we began a new scientific collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics to develop personalized cancer vaccines by combining KEYTRUDA with Moderna's vaccine technology. Additionally, we recently announced our intent to acquire Vallée of Brazil to fortify our Animal Health business in Latin America. 
In closing, our performance in the quarter positions us well for the second half of the year. Looking forward, we will remain focused on executing on our launches and driving the performance of our strongest brands as well as advancing and augmenting our broad pipeline to deliver a balanced and differentiated portfolio of valuable medicines and vaccines. We believe this strategic focus will create long-term growth for the company and sustainable value for both society and shareholders. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Our results in the second quarter reflect continued execution across the organization, with our broad portfolio of products contributing to growth both on the top and bottom line. Total company revenues were $9.8",601,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our results in the second quarter reflect continued execution across the organization, with our broad portfolio of products contributing to growth both on the top and bottom line. 
Total company revenues were $9.8 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, second quarter revenues grew 3%. Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses performed well in the quarter, delivering growth despite an approximately $210 million headwind from sales in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015. As you'll remember, we scaled back our operations in Venezuela towards the end of last year and therefore, recorded negligible sales from the country in the second quarter of this year.
Partially offsetting growth in Human and Animal Health this quarter were lower contributions from our revenue hedge program and third-party manufacturing sales versus the prior year. While our revenue hedging program continues to contribute to the top line, it's expected to have a negative impact in each quarter this year on a year-over-year basis. In terms of revenue guidance, we now expect full year revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion, including an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-July rates.
Looking to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 75.7%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the second quarter of 2015. Foreign exchange and product mix both contributed to the year-over-year improvement, as growth in higher-margin products, such as KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, offset the declines in lower-margin products such as REMICADE. On a full year basis, non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be roughly flat versus last year. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.2 billion increased 4% year-over-year, with lower marketing and administrative expenses and an approximately 2 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange partially offsetting higher research and development expenses in the quarter. The increase in R&D reflects the $200 million upfront payment to Moderna for our recently announced collaboration on the development of personalized cancer vaccines as well as higher investments in our clinical programs. 
We continue to expect non-GAAP operating expense for the full year to be generally in line with the prior year. We anticipate incremental spend in R&D will be partially offset by lower marketing and administrative expenses.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 19%, primarily driven by the beneficial impact of orphan drug federal income tax credits for KEYTRUDA recorded in the quarter. We continue to anticipate the full year rate to be between 21.5% and 22.5%, which includes the impact of the R&D tax credit. 
Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter, delivering 8% growth, or 12% excluding exchange, and another quarter of P&L leverage. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.43 per share in the quarter. 
For the full year, we're raising the lower end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance, narrowing the range to $3.67 to $3.77 per share. We now expect foreign exchange to have an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact at mid-July rates. On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn $1.98 to $2.08 per share for the full year.
Altogether, we delivered growth both nominally and excluding exchange on the top and bottom line. We continue to have a number of opportunities in our pipeline with new product launches and with the potential for business development. We remain disciplined in our approach to expense management, recognizing the need to balance delivering in the short term while making the appropriate investments to drive long-term growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. Global Human Health delivered another quarter of growth",883,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. 
Global Human Health delivered another quarter of growth with sales of $8.7 billion, a growth of 2%. We drove increases in core areas of oncology, diabetes, vaccines and Hospital and Specialty Care, which were partially offset by declines in REMICADE and NASONEX.
I'll now highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'm going to begin with oncology. This is an exciting time for Merck as the leader in immuno-oncology and as we work to make KEYTRUDA foundational to the treatment of cancer. We're launching our melanoma indication in more than 50 markets globally, and we are preparing for launches in additional tumors. In the United States, we are maintaining our strong position in melanoma, and we're launching in second-line lung cancer. And we are ready to launch imminently in head and neck cancer, and we're preparing for the launch in first-line lung cancer. In the second quarter, sales of KEYTRUDA reached approximately $315 million, a continued strength in the melanoma indication. In the U.S., we're also seeing increasing sales contributions from progress we're making in second-line lung cancer.
Importantly, PD-L1 testing rates continue to increase, with approximately 2/3 of physicians now testing to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from PD-1-directed therapy. This is very important as we prepare for a potential first-line indication, where we recently announced that KEYTRUDA offers an overall survival benefit compared to chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1. Customers are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to treat lung cancer in the first-line setting with KEYTRUDA. We also believe that all of the work that we've been doing to drive testing for second-line use will position us well in first-line when we come to market. With a broad and deep clinical program that continues to grow and continues to generate positive monotherapy and combination data, we remain very excited about the long-term opportunity for KEYTRUDA.
Next, in Primary Care. The JANUVIA franchise grew 2% this quarter. In the United States, we continue to drive TRx growth of 4% to 5%. As you'll recall, we saw 14% and 22% growth in the second and third quarters of last year, respectively. These tough comparisons had an impact on the year-over-year changes this quarter and will also impact year-over-year changes in the third quarter. But I continue to focus on the underlying TRx volume growth, and it remains strong in the United States. Outside of the U.S., we generated strong growth in Europe and Canada and in emerging markets. We remain confident in our diabetes franchise for the remainder of 2016, and we are pleased with our continued strong access that we expect in 2017.
Moving to our vaccine business. Sales of the vaccine portfolio reached about $1.3 billion. Growth of 7% came primarily from our pediatric vaccines, which was partially offset by GARDASIL. Overall, GARDASIL sales declined 7%. In the U.S., sales of GARDASIL grew only 2% due to lower CDC buying. Outside of the U.S., sales were impacted by the timing of public sector purchases in Brazil. We are celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the launch of GARDASIL. Real-World Data that was recently published continued to show the benefits of HPV vaccination, and we are seeing increased uptake and utilization of our HPV vaccine around the world. Also, influential organizations, including the CDC, ASCO and the WHO, have expressed strong support for HPV vaccination. It is worth noting that many markets are moving toward implementing a 2-dose regimen of GARDASIL, and there are discussions ongoing in the U.S. as well. We anticipate this change to a 2-dose regimen could go into effect in the U.S. by the end of 2016 or early in 2017.
Finally, in Hospital and Specialty Care. Sales grew 3% to $2.1 billion. Growth in acute care and contributions from launch products were partially offset by declines in REMICADE and ISENTRESS due to competitive pressures that we expect will continue going forward. We are making good progress with the ZEPATIER launch. We're having favorable conversations with payers, and we've garnered some early wins in both the public and the private sectors for 2016 and 2017. In the VA, utilization of ZEPATIER is ramping up nicely, and we've also started to see some advancement in Medicare Part D, in managed Medicaid and in commercial segments. Customers see the value that ZEPATIER can offer with high cure rates in a broad and diverse set of patients. It will take some time for ZEPATIER to ramp up as formularies come online, but we are pleased with the access that we have achieved so far.
Finally, BRIDION is growing well on strong global demand and early contributions from the U.S. launch. In the U.S., our teams are rapidly securing formulary access, and initial indicators of use by physicians in the surgical suite are encouraging. 
In closing, our teams delivered another quarter of solid performance. We have momentum in our core focus areas and strong execution for our key launches. This positions us well for the second half of 2016 and for 2017. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

During the second quarter, we made significant progress in gaining registration for important new products and also advanced a number of new programs. On the infectious disease front, in June, the FDA Antimicrobial Advisory Committee agreed",1216,"Thanks, Adam. During the second quarter, we made significant progress in gaining registration for important new products and also advanced a number of new programs. On the infectious disease front, in June, the FDA Antimicrobial Advisory Committee agreed on a vote of 10 to 5 with 1 abstention that substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of bezlotoxumab, now called ZINPLAVA, in preventing recurrence of C. difficile infection in patients 18 years and older had been presented. Subsequently, the FDA has requested additional information to enable their review of the ZINPLAVA file with the result that a new action date of October 23 has been set. We are working closely with the FDA and with other regulatory agencies to make ZINPLAVA available to patients at risk for recurrent C. difficile infection. 
Considerable progress has also been made in advancing curative therapies for hepatitis C virus infection. The European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, known as the CHMP, adopted a positive opinion regarding the approval of ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection, noting its high efficacy against HCV genotypes 1 and 4, including in patients with compensated cirrhosis and severe kidney disease. This recommendation has now been ratified by the European Commission. I'll remind you that ZEPATIER is not cleared by the kidney and can be used in patients irrespective of baseline renal function. As I mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, we are working to supply the European market. We've made good progress on this front and still expect that we'll be able to launch ZEPATIER in the EU in the fourth quarter or at the latest, in the first quarter of 2017. Reviews in other jurisdictions are also preceding.
Meanwhile, we are continuing to explore additional treatments for the more than 150 million people with hepatitis C virus infection around the world. Progress was made in advancing our triplet regimen and incorporating MK-3682, a uridinal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor; along with a protease inhibitor, grazoprevir; and a novel NS5A inhibitor, MK-8408. We now have substantial experience with this combination, with more than 1,000 patients enrolled in clinical trials. The results from our extensive Phase IIb program will be available later this year and will be presented at major scientific meetings. Because of the favorable properties of MK-3682, we're also exploring a doublet regimen employing just this polymerase inhibitor, along with MK-8408. Together, we believe that these combinations can offer broad efficacy for HCV-infected patients irrespective of HCV genotype and in a variety of clinical settings.
Lastly, on the infectious disease front, I note that our V920 vaccine to prevent Ebola virus disease received FDA breakthrough designation and PRIME designation from the EMA, permitting close regulatory interactions to optimize development and facilitate review of this important potentially life-saving agent.
Turning now to oncology. This was an extremely active quarter for KEYTRUDA, our PD-1-directed immunotherapy for malignant disease. I've said repeatedly that I expect that KEYTRUDA, by virtue of the spectrum of its activity, will prove to be foundational in future cancer care. At the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings last month, we presented data demonstrating the activity of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in 15 different tumor types. We also presented data from multiple studies, where KEYTRUDA has been used in combination with conventional chemotherapy, with targeted therapies and with immunotherapies. In all, we now have more than 300 clinical studies underway exploring the activity of KEYTRUDA in more than 30 different tumor types. More than 100 of these studies employ KEYTRUDA in combination with other agents.
In Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have failed at least one prior therapy and whose tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker. We have championed the view that because patient outcomes from the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer are correlated with the extent to which PD-L1 is expressed on the tumor, it is important to assess the status of this biomarker prior to initiating therapy with the PD-1-directed agent. The data supporting our dossier were derived from the KEYNOTE-010 study, which showed that KEYTRUDA treatment in populations with 1% or more of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 yielded superior overall survival compared with the results of traditional chemotherapy. These data are also under review by the FDA with an action date of October 24.
During the quarter, we also reported top line results of our KEYNOTE-024 study, which compared KEYTRUDA monotherapy to platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA treatment demonstrated a superior progression-free survival and superior overall survival in this setting. A manuscript describing these results has now been accepted for publication and hence, should appear in the near future. We've also begun to work with regulatory agencies to enable supplementary filing of these data to our existing KEYTRUDA labels. 
Beyond treatment of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, we have pursued accelerated approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. The PDUFA date for this review is August 9. 
Based on our current trial enrollments, we have several additional potential filings for KEYTRUDA over the next 12 to 18 months, including bladder cancer; gastric cancer; colorectal cancer in the setting of microsatellite instability; and relapsed refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, an indication for which we received breakthrough designation from the FDA in the second quarter. 
Moreover, data continue to provide intriguing evidence of the broad spectrum of KEYTRUDA activity. Earlier this month, for example, Julie Graff and colleagues at the Oregon Health & Science University published a preliminary report demonstrating meaningful responses in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer who have progressed on enzalutamide. 
As Rob noted, R&D expenses increased this quarter, in large part owing to the establishment of our business partnership with Moderna on the development of novel immunogens with the goal of further improving the efficacy of our immunomodulatory agents, including KEYTRUDA. While we have, through the Moderna investment as well as our funding of key clinical trials, increased our support for KEYTRUDA in immuno-oncology, we continue to pursue other important new therapies. For example, this week, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals, which gives us access to a set of P2X3 receptor antagonists. Their lead program, AF-219, is currently under study in a fully enrolled Phase IIb trial for the treatment of chronic cough and is also being investigated in a Phase II study for the same indication in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. I look forward to updating you on this and other programs in the coming months.
Meanwhile, we continue to support the development of ertugliflozin, both as monotherapy and in combination with JANUVIA. We have presented important Phase III data on this program and will submit regulatory dossiers before the end of the year. Also, we expect to receive the adjudicated cardiovascular safety data from odanacatib from our external evaluators in the next few days, which will then be analyzed over the next several weeks. It is my expectation that the U.S. odanacatib file will be submitted in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Teri."

The first thing is I will be very glad to be first to market. Being first to market for a new indication matters. And I remember, when we were first to market with melanoma, people are asking if you have progression-free survival but you don't have overall survival, they come out with overall survival, it won't matter. And I kept saying I just want to be first. And as long as we have the studies underway to show that, ultimately, we can show overall survival that we should be okay. If you look at first-line lung, the first thing I'd say is we're glad to be first. The second thing is, the issue that we have right now with PD-L1 testing in second-line, where the competition has all comers, I think that will go away in first-line because everybody will be doing PD-L1 testing. So that obstacle that we face today goes away with first-line. The second question will become not only what the indication is, but what reimbursement occurs. And even today, you start to see reimbursement occurring even where you don't necessarily have the indication. And the good news is at the time of the first-line launch, we should have data in second-line showing positive results in the PD-L1 plus 1 positive. So we'll have data in plus 1 to 50 for second-line. So we still have to see how it plays out, but I'm pleased to be first to launch, hopefully. And then we'll see how the reimbursement works out over time."

Keep in mind that we had a small amount of first-line data that we had obtained in the 001 F [ph] cohort, so we knew that there was benefit in that setting.

Can you help me understand why a physician would use KEYTRUDA in first-line lung or across second-line lung if its next step is and it believes that it needs to go on to an I-O, I-O combo versus an I-O, chemo combo?"

And then there's somewhere 10% to 15% that we believe is in second-line lung, and then the rest is amongst a whole host of different uses. So the utilization in first-line lung right now is very low, but what's important is we're seeing PD-L1 testing start to occur more and more often. And I mentioned that 2/3 of physicians are now testing. And what we see is when physicians test, they tend to use KEYTRUDA. And that's where we see the utilization of KEYTRUDA for lung right now. The good news is the work that we've been doing on testing, I think, is going to pay off for us as we get the first-line indication and the obstacle goes away for second line. So I'm very encouraged and excited about the opportunity to launch in first line, for sure."

The truth of the matter is we really, as I've said, need to understand how well KEYTRUDA works as monotherapy and, for that matter, Opdivo, in order to be able to understand how to proceed with combination therapy. So combination therapy work is all extremely early. We do not have any data that tell us that any combination provides superior overall survival versus monotherapy. Indeed, we have the first data in first-line lung that show that KEYTRUDA is superior to traditional chemotherapy. And that -- again, it needs to be reviewed. But when people have a chance to look at the data, that represents a real sea change in the way people treat lung cancer. Combination chemotherapy has been the mainstay of therapy for decades. So that's going to be a pretty big deal. If you look at response rates, an imperfect indicator, of course, the best response rates that we see are the combination of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy like pemetrexed, where we reported a small number of patients, 71% overall response rate in the lung cancer setting, which is obviously very provocative. With time, I think we'll discover how best to use these agents in combination, whether that's an immuno-oncology combination with a CTLA-4-directed molecule, with other molecules, we have 10 of them in development of our own, or with chemotherapeutic agents.

Just again, as an example, the fact that we're seeing prostate cancer responses -- remember that previously, it was thought prostate cancer was refractory to PD-1-directed therapy, Opdivo treatment, there were really no results. So that's -- that shows you that we're still learning a great deal about how to use this as monotherapy. Combinations -- a lot of combinations appear to be showing early signs of signals, whether that's combinations with chemotherapy or combinations, in the case of Opdivo or -- and us as well, with ipilimumab with CTLA-4. Time will tell which is the best combination. If it turns out that ipilimumab was the best combination, then that would be the way to go forward.

Our combination studies with targeted chemotherapies and traditional chemotherapies are also very far along, and that will be extremely interesting.

So in Medicare Part D, for example, we have United and Express Scripts, where they've added us at parity to their Medicare Part D formulary effective July 1. In Medicaid, we're making significant progress in not only getting on formulary, but some of those Medicaid formularies have increased the number of patients that they're making eligible for treatment. We're working very closely with our commercial customers, and access is progressing. We still have some negotiations that are ongoing as we speak. And as I said, the VA continues to ramp up nicely. So we're encouraged by the access that we're getting. And now we have to work to build market share, and that's what we're going to focus on as we move forward. In terms of the overall market, it's a large market. There's about 3 million patients in the U.S. that still need to be treated, so it's going to be a market that will be around for a while. We're currently seeing just about -- just over 200,000-or-so patients per year treated in the U.S. That's a lot more than if you would've gone back 5 years ago, where there were somewhere between 120,000 to 150,000. So we've certainly seen an increase, but that increase, I think, has maxed out. And I think we'll see more of where we are as a steady-state as we move forward.

So that's not a concern, frankly. In addition to that, with first-line lung, I believe everybody is going to start to measure PD-L1 right from the start. So even for the competition, I think they're going to be advocating the importance of measuring PD-L1 moving forward. So that obstacle will go away. And then, ultimately, I believe it's going to come down to the market share that you're able to achieve within the lung segment. And therefore, I'm very pleased that we'll be the first one to launch. If you look specifically at our share of our business, about 70% of our business is in melanoma, 15% is in lung, and then the rest is in all other indications.

So with regard to REMICADE, our strategy all along has been to try to hold onto as many existing patients that are currently treated as we can, and I think we've done a very good job with that. Most of our loss of revenue came from reference pricing due to lower prices from the biosimilars. However, we're certainly starting to see that we're not only losing new patients, but there are some countries in Scandinavia and even some other larger countries that are beginning to think about substituting therapeutically even existing patients. So I do believe that we're going to continue to see erosion for REMICADE, that the biosimilar impacts are accelerating and they're going to continue as we go through the year. As I think about biosimilars in the future, I think the key is going to be what your order of entry is into the marketplace, and being first to second in the marketplace will matter. Each market molecule is going to be different, and we're deploying different strategies based upon those markets. You see a different strategy, for example, that you might use in the U.K. and France versus Germany. And we'll have to be very specific by market how we launch our biosimilar portfolio. At the same time, what I'd say is SIMPONI grew 16% ex exchange. So even though you'd see an impact on REMICADE, you haven't seen that go over into the other anti-TNFs.

So we really do focus market-by-market what our opportunities for growth are, and then we titrate our expense base in those markets based upon the opportunities. But I do believe that the emerging markets will provide growth going forward and remain an important opportunity for us as we move forward. With regard to JANUVIA outside the U.S., we continue to see good growth in Europe and Canada, and that growth is coming from volume. And the volume growth in most of those markets is very strong. I'd say the biggest issue we're facing is the fact that our market share is so high in countries like Germany that it's hard to grow market share so we have to continue to find ways to grow from sulfonylureas and ultimately, from metformin. But just hundreds and millions of patients that need to be treated outside the U.S. If you look at the emerging markets, we have strong double-digit growth of JANUVIA. I think that's going to continue over time. And we really have not gotten NRDL approval for JANUVIA in China yet.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today.  
Before we discuss our results for the quarter, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the recent ESMO congress, where the latest data were presented from our KEYTRUDA clinical development program for lung cancer and simultaneously published in 2 major scientific journals. Many have noted the significant implications these results may have for the treatment of lung cancer, the deadliest type of cancer in the United States. And just yesterday, the FDA approved KEYTRUDA as the only PD-1 therapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic lung cancer, making it an option for tens of thousands of lung cancer patients in the United States.  For the first time in decades, the standard of care may change for lung cancer patients, offering them renewed hope. 
This advancement is what Merck is all about, and we are honored to be making a real difference in the fight against cancer. The recent KEYTRUDA achievements are proof of concept, if you will, that our innovation strategy is working. Our sustained investment and medically important R&D has yielded a number of recent approvals and regulatory milestones across the various therapeutic areas in our Human Health and Animal Health businesses.
Turning now to the results. In the third quarter, we reported a strong performance that reflects growth across several priority programs, including our vaccines portfolio and also KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, which are continuing to launch around the world. We remain confident in the strength of our portfolio, from our JANUVIA franchise, which is core to our business and continues to maintain its leadership position in the DPP-4 class; to BRIDION, which is quickly contributing to our growth while still in the launch space here in the United States. Looking ahead, we will continue to follow the science, pursuing the best internal and external scientific opportunities that will enable us to take on some of the world's greatest health challenges.  
That is why business development remains an important priority in achieving our goals. Our appetite for business development has not changed. We continue to seek the best opportunities and collaborations with the right financial valuation to augment our portfolio and pipeline. In closing, our performance in the quarter positions us well to continue to invest in our business and to deliver a balanced, differentiated portfolio of medicines and vaccines that will generate long-term growth and sustainable value for shareholders and society.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Total company revenues were $10.5 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, revenue increased 6%. 
Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses contributed 6% and 7% growth, respectively, excluding exchange in the quarter and despite an approximately $170 million headwind from sales in Venezuela in the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, we went through this [indiscernible] rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 so this is the last quarter in which we will face this headwind.  I should note that the year-over-year increase in Human Health sales in the third quarter includes an approximately $200 million benefit from the pull-forward of customer purchases from the fourth quarter. These were mainly due to the timing of shipments in Japan in anticipation of an ERP go-live and the timing of CDC vaccine purchases.  
Taking into account our performance in the first 3 quarters of 2016 and our expectations through year-end, we are narrowing and raising our full year revenue guidance to $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion. We continue to anticipate foreign exchange will have an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact on revenue in 2016.
Looking to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 75.3%, an increase of 20 basis points. Product mix was the primary driver of the increase versus the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat versus last year, with margins in the fourth quarter expected to be lower on a year-over-year basis as we see the mix impact of generic competition for CUBICIN and ZETIA in the U.S. market and declines in FX hedge gains year-on-year, which flow 100% to gross margin.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4 billion were roughly flat versus the third quarter of 2015 as declines in marketing and administrative expenses largely offset an increase in research and development expenses in the quarter. While we are committed to delivering a leveraged P&L over the long term, it may be more challenging in the near term given the impending loss of market exclusivity for ZETIA and VYTORIN in the U.S. and investments that we need to make to support the growing opportunity for KEYTRUDA.  That being said, we remain disciplined and continue to look for opportunities to reallocate resources across the portfolio.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.8% this quarter. We expect the full year rate to trend to the higher end of our previously communicated range of 21.5% and 22.5%, which includes the impact of the R&D tax credit. 
Taken together, we earned $1.07 per share on a non-GAAP basis, delivering 11% growth versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, non-GAAP EPS increased 8%. Of the $0.11 increase in non-GAAP EPS this quarter compared to Q3 2015, approximately $0.04 were related to the customer purchases in Japan that I mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.78 this quarter.  
Given our results in the first 9 months of the year, we are also narrowing and raising our full year non-GAAP EPS range. We now expect to earn $3.71 to $3.78 per share, with foreign exchange still expected to have an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact. On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn $2.02 to $2.09 per share for the full year. Altogether, our top and bottom line growth in the quarter, driven by solid operational performance, sets us up for a strong 2016 overall. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter, and my comments will be on a constant-currency basis.  
Global Human Health delivered another strong quarter with sales of $9.4 billion or an increase of 6%. We drove growth across many of our core areas, including oncology, vaccines and Hospital and Specialty Care. 
I'll highlight now a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'll start with oncology. We continue to execute on the launch of KEYTRUDA, and we are excited by the long-term potential for this important brand. KEYTRUDA generated $356 million in sales in the third quarter, with about half of the sales generated outside of the United States. In the U.S., sales were driven primarily from melanoma, where KEYTRUDA continues to be the leading immuno-oncology therapy, as well as from the ongoing launch in second-line lung cancer. 
In August, we also gained approval for recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, and we began to launch that indication immediately. This represents the first new treatment option for these patients in almost a decade. In addition and very importantly, we are ready to launch in first-line lung cancer, where we've just received FDA approval for the high PD-L1-expressing patients, those who express PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%. We know from several data sources, including our own clinical trials, that this patient population represents about 25% to 30% of non-small cell lung cancer patients. 
In addition, we received expanded labeling for second-line lung cancer based upon our KEYNOTE-010 data. So now patients that express any level of PD-L1 are eligible for KEYTRUDA in the second-line setting. Based upon these 2 new patient populations for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer, we have already begun to see an acceleration of testing for PD-L1 at diagnosis. 
Outside of the United States, we've launched our melanoma indication in more than 50 markets, and we continue to see broad adoption of KEYTRUDA as the leading metastatic melanoma treatment. We've also recently gained EMA approval in second-line lung cancer for all PD-L1-positive patients. We're working through the reimbursement process in each country, which, as you know, can take some time, but we expect that we'll start to ramp up nicely in Europe once reimbursement comes through. In addition, we're preparing for the upcoming launch of KEYTRUDA in Japan, where we recently received an indication for melanoma. 
While we've already achieved a number of milestones for KEYTRUDA, this is just the beginning. We remain dedicated to establishing KEYTRUDA as the leader in lung cancer. In addition, we are very optimistic about the long-term potential for KEYTRUDA across many different tumor types.
Moving now to primary care. The JANUVIA franchise generated sales of almost $1.6 billion this quarter, a 2% decline compared to the same quarter last year. Outside of the United States, we saw strong growth of 9%. This includes favorable impact of about $30 million from the timing of customer purchases in Japan, which was offset by an unfavorable impact of roughly the same magnitude from sales in Venezuela. In the U.S., we saw a decline of 10%, which was anticipated given the tough comparison to third quarter of 2015, where we saw a large buy-in. TRX trends remained strong in the United States with growth of 4%, and JANUVIA continues to be the leading DPP-4 treatment of choice in the market. We expect revenue growth in the United States in the fourth quarter of this year versus fourth quarter of 2015. 
Formulary discussions for 2017 are nearly complete, and we expect similar access in the United States for JANUVIA to what we've had this year. We've seen and expect to continue to see increased pricing pressure in the United States for JANUVIA, but we are pleased by the continued strong volume growth. And thus far, we've been able to offset most of the pricing pressures. We remain confident in our diabetes franchise, and we're pleased with our continued strength in this brand globally.
Now moving to our vaccine business. We had another strong quarter with sales of $2 billion or 27% growth. The increase was primarily driven by GARDASIL, pediatric vaccines and Pneumovax. GARDASIL sales were $860 million globally, a 38% increase versus last year. In the United States, GARDASIL sales were 33%, driven by the timing of public sector purchases but also higher demand. 
On October 7, the FDA approved a 2-dose regimen for 9 to 14-year-olds. And just last week, ACIP voted to recommend 2 doses for certain of these patients. This is aligned with the dosing already adopted in some markets outside of the U.S., and it will have a negative impact on sales for GARDASIL moving forward.
Pneumovax delivered another strong quarter with 24% growth versus prior year. The United States growth was primarily driven by demand, with better follow-through from ACIP recommendations for patients 65 and above to receive Pneumovax 1 year after Prevnar. Outside of the U.S., growth was largely driven by Japan. 
Finally, in Hospital and Specialty Care, sales grew 5% to $2.2 billion. Growth in acute care and contributions from launched products were partially offset by declines in REMICADE. REMICADE sales were down 28% this quarter as tenders and new patient starts increasingly go to biosimilars. We expect the declines in REMICADE to continue given the competitive pressures but also increased switching. 
Now moving to ZEPATIER. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in the first year of launch. ZEPATIER's product profile and positioning are resonating well with both health care professionals and payers. As we continued to communicate last quarter, we have seen some early wins in both the public and private sectors for 2016 and 2017. This includes parity access in the VA, favorable access within the Medicaid segment and key wins in the Medicare Part D and commercial segments. 
It is important to note, though, that some of our major formulary wins had effective dates of either July 1 of this year or January 1 of next year, so we don't expect to see the full effect of these wins immediately. Given the time it takes from formulary success to getting patients on drug, we are only just beginning to see the impact from those plans that became effective this summer.  We are also looking forward to launching ZEPATIER in Japan this quarter, where it was recently approved. 
On the hospital side, we had a stronger-than-expected quarter with CUBICIN as generics only entered the market at the end of the quarter. Now that there are 2 generics in the market, we experienced the declines of CUBICIN which appears to be similar to the fast erosion rates that we've seen for other hospital products once generics launched in the U.S.
Finally, BRIDION had another good quarter with almost 50% growth, driven by strong demand across ex-U.S. markets as well as a good ramp-up in the U.S. following our launch earlier this year. While Japan is currently our largest market in the world, over time, we believe that the U.S. market will become the biggest for BRIDION. 
In closing, we continue to deliver solid performance across many products. We have good momentum and good execution across our core focus areas. And although we'll have to contend with the ZETIA and VYTORIN patent expiry in fourth quarter of this year into next year, we believe we are well positioned for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger."

In the third quarter, Merck Research Laboratories made substantial progress on multiple fronts. First, in the area of infectious disease, based on our landmark Phase III studies and following the favorable vote of the FDA antimicrobial ad",1092,"Thank you, Adam. In the third quarter, Merck Research Laboratories made substantial progress on multiple fronts. First, in the area of infectious disease, based on our landmark Phase III studies and following the favorable vote of the FDA antimicrobial advisory committee, the FDA approved ZINPLAVA for the reduction of the risk of recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection in patients at high risk for such recurrences. I remind you that ZINPLAVA is not an antimicrobial agent per se but contains a monoclonal antibody, bezlotoxumab, which is directed against a toxin made by C. difficile and important in the pathogenesis of C. difficile-mediated disease. Review of the ZINPLAVA file is also proceeding in the EU.  
Also in the infectious disease area, last week, we announced top line results for our Phase III study testing the ability of letermovir to reduce the risk of cytomegalovirus disease in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplants. These programs are only the most recent of our very broad efforts to improve therapies for infectious diseases, including 3 important Phase III programs, ZERBAXA for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia; relebactam to broaden the spectrum of our antibiotic [indiscernible] and doravirine, a non-nucleosidal HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, with what we believe to be improved characteristics versus currently available therapies.
As I had mentioned, we continue to demonstrate impressive activity for ZEPATIER, our hepatitis C virus therapy, including in patients known to have used intravenous drugs. We're also making progress in advancing our triplet therapy for HCV infection, with presentations describing the efficacy of this combination across genotypes to be presented at the upcoming AASLD meeting.
But much of the excitement during the past quarter focused on KEYTRUDA, our PD-1-specific antibody for the treatment of malignant disease. As Ken and Adam mentioned, the FDA has just announced an updated label for KEYTRUDA, which includes our keynote 010 study, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA is superior to traditional chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, including those patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 as few as 1% of  sales. The revised label also includes our KEYNOTE-024 study, which was presented at the European Society from Medical Oncology meetings earlier this month and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In brief, KEYNOTE-024 was a randomized active comparator controlled Phase III study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA, when used for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1 and lack mutations in the EGF receptor our ALK gene, is superior to traditional platinum-based chemotherapy on the type that has been the standard of care in this disease for more than 2 decades.
These data are important because KEYTRUDA treatment at a fixed dose of 200 milligrams every 3 weeks reduce the risk of tumor progression or death by 50%, and reduce the overall risk of death by 40%. Moreover, KEYTRUDA treatment was associated with a lower rate of series adverse events that was observed in the chemotherapy treatment arm. We believe, as Bruce Johnson suggested in an accompanying editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, that KEYTRUDA will come to represent a new standard of care for appropriate lung cancer patients whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1, a population that represents between 25% to 30% of those presenting with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.  Also in the third quarter, we received approval for the use of KEYTRUDA in lung cancer in the European Union, again, based on our KEYNOTE-010 data. Review of the KEYNOTE-024 study is ongoing by the committee for human medicinal products for the European Medicines Agency.
Beyond these very important results, during the third quarter, we also obtained a data from our KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with traditional platinum doublet-based chemotherapy to yield objective response rates far superior to what we've seen in chemotherapy alone. In this study, patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, whose tumors expressed any level of PD-L1, were enrolled provided they lacked EGF receptor or ALK gene mutations. Progression-free survival nearly doubled in the KEYTRUDA containing treatment arm.  The results of the study were published simultaneously in Lancet Oncology. While this is a Phase II study in a relatively small cohort, including just 123 patients, the results complement an earlier single arm study employing the same combination regimen, which we presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology in June. Patients in that court achieved an objective response rate of 71% and the objective response rate was 55% in Cohort G. Hence, there's reason to believe that combinations of traditional chemotherapeutic agents, perhaps acting through an immune activation mechanism, will work in concert with KEYTRUDA to provide superior responses in advanced lung cancer patients in the future. Additional confirmatory study, including our KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 studies are already underway.
Finally, last week, we announced that the independent data monitoring committee supervising our KEYNOTE-045 study in second-line urothelial cancer involving patients with relapsed or refractory bladder or related uroepithelial cancer recommended that the study be stopped on the basis of improved overall survival in the KEYTRUDA treatment arm. KEYNOTE-045 is a Phase III active comparator controlled monotherapy study in a very strict patient population. However, the results obtained in this setting mimic results from the first-line KEYNOTE-052 study that we presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting earlier this month, which showed impressive response rate in the treatment of urothelial malignancies. In sum, KEYTRUDA is changing the cancer treatment landscape.  Already approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma, second-line non-small cell lung cancer, first-line non-small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma to head and neck for which we obtained FDA approval in August, we obtained what we believe to be registration-worthy data in urothelial cancer, have more than 30 registration appropriate studies underway and develop data supporting the activity featured in 22 different malignancies and have more than 360 clinical studies currently underway, including more than 200 combination studies evaluating responses in more than 30 different tumor types. Needless to say, we anticipate additional regulatory filings in the fourth quarter, and of course, in 2017.
Finally, I note that we are making good progress in our diabetes programs. Our insulin glargine filing was accepted for review by the FDA, and with our colleagues at Pfizer, we expect to file for approval of ertugliflozin as monotherapy and as a fixed dose combination with metformin or with sitagliptin before the end of the year.
Now I'll turn the call back to Teri."

You could argue that doing a bigger deal now runs a risk of disrupting the focus that you need in immuno-oncology for example. And then kind of related to that, can you give us some idea of the upper limit to deals you might be considering? Is everything on the table, or are you looking more at mid-sized deals or smaller?

We are always mindful of competition, and we want to make sure that we do everything we can to get as much utilization, appropriate utilization obviously, for the indication that we have as quickly as possible and to really cement our product KEYTRUDA as foundational in the treatment of first-line cancer. With regard to second-line lung, right now, we have about a 10% market share of the second-line lung market in the United States. But if you look at patients that have PD-L1, greater than or equal to 50, that's where the majority of our market share is and our market share is much, much higher in that group. With the new data that we have in first-line lung in a new indication, there's no doubt that PD-L1 testing will become standard. We're already seeing very significant increases in PD-L1 testing since the ESMO meeting. So I believe that the barrier of needing to be tested in second-line for PD-L1 will be removed to a very large degree. And the fact that we now have an indication for all PD-L1-positive patients in the second-line setting, I believe that we should be a leader in not just first-line but second-line as well over time."

Standing back from this, I think one has to be impressed by the general efficacy of combinations of KEYTRUDA with other agents, and that's true with respect to PD-1 blockade and other agents pre-clinically, but also clinically. So if you look at combinations for example, with immuno-active agents like TVEC, there's impressive evidence of activity. There's evidence of activity with other immunologic agents, but there's also, as we've talked about, very impressive combination activity with chemotherapy. And in a way, the 21G results in lung cancer basically put a floor on what to expect from these combinations. At a minimum, you're going to have to see the kinds of response rates and progression-free survival results that we've seen in 21G. Keep in mind, that study, as you know, is 123 patients and nevertheless a highly significant result with respect to progression-free survival. Over time, we'll see if an overall survival result is obtained there at the crossover is so large and the populations may not be possible see it, but I think there is reason to believe that KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with a lot of things and oncologists have a lot of experience using traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. So there's reason to believe that, that those kinds of combinations will work well. That said, one shouldn't discount other kinds of immunologic combinations, including combinations with CTLA-4 directive agents. We've done those studies and shown that there is activity for those combinations. The question is ultimately what provides the best balance in terms of therapeutic efficacy and safety and tolerability. It's early days, and we'll take some time to sort that out, but we'll be pursuing all of those things, and we are."

So the collaboration with NanoString is designed to obtain better, really better diagnostic mechanisms, because we know that PD-L1 expression is an imperfect biomarker. That said, the NanoString test does not exclude PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression is an indicator of an inflammatory response because the PD-L1 transcriptional unit is under the control of cytokines like GAM interfere and wherever there's an immune response, you'll see PD-L1 pregulation. Much of the NanoString signature involves other genes that are similarly regulated. So it isn't the case that the NanoString test will look totally different from a PD-L1 test, it will just have a better receiver operator characteristics. So that you have better sensitivity and specificity. So I guess we continue to refine that signature. It has -- it's working quite well, actually, but it will take a while before we can actually reduce it to practice."

That being said, we have the growing opportunity clinically we see with KEYTRUDA and that's why we made the specific comments we did. Which is what we remain committed to leverage long-term, we recognize that in specific periods, we may not be able to achieve that, given the level of investment we need to make in R&D and the cost we've already taken out elsewhere in the organization. So more to come as we get to the next quarter and we get specific guidance, but that was the purpose of the comment I made in the prepared remarks to highlight what we see as a great opportunity with KEYTRUDA and we're going to invest behind it appropriately."

We actually have quite a large HIV program, which is pretty exciting. And obviously, the HCV program, the Triplett data, are very important. And beyond that, of course, the HER2 filing with our colleagues at Pfizer. Given our traditional strength now in diabetes and the opportunity to combine a really very well-behaved SGLT2 inhibitor with JANUVIA, that can be an important opportunity as well. Nothing there that investors necessarily have missed, but I think important things to pay attention to. Earlier in the pipeline, there's an awful lot going on, but time just not permit me to really review that stuff."

But in the United States, about 60% of physicians are testing PD-L1. This was prior to ESMO. We don't have any new data on that percentage after ESMO. At the same time, we estimated that about 40% of non-small cell lung cancer new patients were being tested prior to ESMO. I get weekly data and it's not perfect, but you can certainly see a trend break where there's a significant increase in the number of patients that are being tested for PD-L1 right after ESMO data was released. So I expect the numbers I just provided you will increase significantly. But I think it's important to remember that even if you look at EGFR testing, it took a while for that to become standard, and even today, after years, about 80% to 85% of patients are routinely tested. So I think there's probably a ceiling of somewhere between 80% to 85% of PD-L1 testing that will occur over time. But with that said, it does take a little while to ramp up, albeit it's ramping up faster. If you look at the length of time it takes to be tested, it's about the same as all other testing for lung cancer. So for this PD-L1 testing, they can get it back within a week, typically as fast as they can get [indiscernible] testing or EGFR testing. So it's very fast. In terms of the way it comes back to physicians, it's not always consistent, different  labs and in academic institutions, they may give it differently. But right now, most of them come back with a number that those PD-L1 55 or 48 as opposed to just a positive or negative sign. And we think that, that's the way it will probably continue over time. We're seeing it in academic hospitals, but we're also seeing it much more utilization even outside of those academic centers as well. With regard to biosimilar opportunity, the bottom line is that we think it is a real commercial opportunity. It's not our strategy. Our strategy remains on innovation. But with $40 billion on a global basis of drugs that are Biologics going off patent or at least biosimilars being able to enter market over the next 5 years, we think there's a real opportunity for us commercially."

And then the last thing I would say is that if you look at ZEPATIER, as I mentioned in previous calls, the marketplace had very significant discounting that was occurring. In fact, the pressure on the rebates and discounts before we even launched into the market was very significant. Despite that, we feel like we've gotten good formulary access. We're doing very well in the VA, Medicare Part D, also in some commercial plants, particularly in the regional plants. As we look at 2017, beginning of January, we do have some new contracts.

First of all, we've had price increases similar to the price increases that we've had in the past. So you haven't seen any difference or acceleration per se. But you also have to realize that the 9-valent cost a bit more than the full Valent and most of the patients are moving to the 9-valent vaccine. So I get the price increase plus the difference in price between those 2, the full Valent and the 9-valent. The thing that is hard for us to understand right now, is if you have 2 doses, will the doses be given in the same year or for example if a person presents themselves in August before back-to-school, do they get 1 dose next year in August but they don't get the second dose until the following year in August. So there's still some things that we're going to have to wait to see in terms of how physicians treat those patients. Some might get it, the first dose in January, the second dose in July or August. Some might just get August dose the 1 and the following year, the second dose. So there's a certainly going to be an impact. The magnitude right now, we can't be certain of. And if you look at the sales by indication, just to give you a rough amount, about 50% to 55% of our sales were melanoma, about 25% or so was in lung; 5% or so was in head and neck cancer.

What I said was approximately 60% of U.S. physicians are testing for PD-L1, not that 60% of patients are being tested. So right now, if you look at the physicians across the U.S. That treat lung cancer we believe about 60% of them test at least sometimes for PD-L1. We also believe that about 40% of non-small cell lung cancer new patients are being tested for PD-L1. So that should give you a better idea what's happening prior to ESMO. Since ESMO, I don't have updates to these numbers because it takes time to have these updated. But I do see a very significant increase in the total number of tests that are being ordered for PD-L1. I don't believe that there's any rate-limiting ability of the labs or the institutions to do the testing, so that's not the issue. The question is how quickly will physicians adopt testing for all patients. And the reason I cap that at about 80% to 85% is because even today, for EGFR testing, we see only about 80% to 85% of patients that are treated. So if we're at 40%, the cap is at 80%, the question is how fast can we go from 40% to the 80% or 85%? And that's what we're working on. With regard to your ramp up for lung, there's not going to be bolus of patients. The 250,000 patients in the top 7 markets around the world come in throughout the entire year. And the question will be as they come in, how quickly will they be put on to KEYTRUDA, if they have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50."

But I don't think I can say categorically that we wouldn't take the kind of deal that has a concentration in 1 product versus another. Obviously, concentration is one of the factors that you weigh when you think about the risk inherent in a deal. As it relates to pricing, we also are very concerned about the whole issue of pricing and affordability for patients. It's a significant one. It's been amplified in this year's political season. We find it unfortunate that a lot of times, the focus is on affordability and pricing rather than the long-term benefit that these therapies provide. So from our perspective, we think that going forward, we don't think these environmental pricing pressures will ease. And that's why we continue to focus on our strategy of investing on innovative R&D for products like KEYTRUDA. But we think those are the kinds of products that will help Merck weather some of the pricing risks and pricing pressures that we will be facing as an industry going forward."

And of course, that's a traditional problem in the development of chemotherapeutic agents and the reason why progression-free survival has been expected as an endpoint in a variety of different tumor types. On the other hand, chemotherapy is active, and for individuals whose disease is controlled by chemotherapy, then the crossover will inherently occur later because we believe that KEYTRUDA provides a more durable benefit to patients with lung cancer and the data from that are clear across a variety of tumor types. Under those circumstances, I would expect separation for overall survival. And as I indicated, it's a fairly complicated set of equations to try and estimate what that's going to look like. I think we probably have to wait for the data."

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today.  
Before we discuss our results for the quarter, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the recent ESMO congress, where the latest data were presented from our KEYTRUDA clinical development program for lung cancer and simultaneously published in 2 major scientific journals. Many have noted the significant implications these results may have for the treatment of lung cancer, the deadliest type of cancer in the United States. And just yesterday, the FDA approved KEYTRUDA as the only PD-1 therapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic lung cancer, making it an option for tens of thousands of lung cancer patients in the United States.  For the first time in decades, the standard of care may change for lung cancer patients, offering them renewed hope. 
This advancement is what Merck is all about, and we are honored to be making a real difference in the fight against cancer. The recent KEYTRUDA achievements are proof of concept, if you will, that our innovation strategy is working. Our sustained investment and medically important R&D has yielded a number of recent approvals and regulatory milestones across the various therapeutic areas in our Human Health and Animal Health businesses.
Turning now to the results. In the third quarter, we reported a strong performance that reflects growth across several priority programs, including our vaccines portfolio and also KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, which are continuing to launch around the world. We remain confident in the strength of our portfolio, from our JANUVIA franchise, which is core to our business and continues to maintain its leadership position in the DPP-4 class; to BRIDION, which is quickly contributing to our growth while still in the launch space here in the United States. Looking ahead, we will continue to follow the science, pursuing the best internal and external scientific opportunities that will enable us to take on some of the world's greatest health challenges.  
That is why business development remains an important priority in achieving our goals. Our appetite for business development has not changed. We continue to seek the best opportunities and collaborations with the right financial valuation to augment our portfolio and pipeline. In closing, our performance in the quarter positions us well to continue to invest in our business and to deliver a balanced, differentiated portfolio of medicines and vaccines that will generate long-term growth and sustainable value for shareholders and society.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Total company revenues were $10.5 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, revenue increased 6%. 
Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses contributed 6% and 7% growth, respectively, excluding exchange in the quarter and despite an approximately $170 million headwind from sales in Venezuela in the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, we went to this commodity [ph] rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 so this is the last quarter in which we will face this headwind.  I should note that the year-over-year increase in Human Health sales in the third quarter includes an approximately $200 million benefit from the pull-forward of customer purchases from the fourth quarter. These were mainly due to the timing of shipments in Japan in anticipation of an ERP go-live and the timing of CDC vaccine purchases.  
Taking into account our performance in the first 3 quarters of 2016 and our expectations through year-end, we are narrowing and raising our full year revenue guidance to $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion. We continue to anticipate foreign exchange will have an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact on revenue in 2016.
Looking to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 75.3%, an increase of 20 basis points. Product mix was the primary driver of the increase versus the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat versus last year, with margins in the fourth quarter expected to be lower on a year-over-year basis as we see the mix impact of generic competition for CUBICIN and ZETIA in the U.S. market and declines in FX hedge gains year-on-year, which flow 100% to gross margin.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4 billion were roughly flat versus the third quarter of 2015 as declines in marketing and administrative expenses largely offset an increase in research and development expenses in the quarter. While we are committed to delivering a leveraged P&L over the long term, it may be more challenging in the near term given the impending loss of market exclusivity for ZETIA and VYTORIN in the U.S. and investments that we need to make to support the growing opportunity for KEYTRUDA.  That being said, we remain disciplined and continue to look for opportunities to reallocate resources across the portfolio.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.8% this quarter. We expect the full year rate to trend to the higher end of our previously communicated range of 21.5% and 22.5%, which includes the impact of the R&D tax credit. 
Taken together, we earned $1.07 per share on a non-GAAP basis, delivering 11% growth versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, non-GAAP EPS increased 8%. Of the $0.11 increase in non-GAAP EPS this quarter compared to Q3 2015, approximately $0.04 were related to the customer purchases in Japan that I mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.78 this quarter.  
Given our results in the first 9 months of the year, we are also narrowing and raising our full year non-GAAP EPS range. We now expect to earn $3.71 to $3.78 per share, with foreign exchange still expected to have an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact. On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn $2.02 to $2.09 per share for the full year. Altogether, our top and bottom line growth in the quarter, driven by solid operational performance, sets us up for a strong 2016 overall. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter, and my comments will be on a constant-currency basis.  Global Human Health delivered another strong quarte",1254,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter, and my comments will be on a constant-currency basis.  
Global Human Health delivered another strong quarter with sales of $9.4 billion or an increase of 6%. We drove growth across many of our core areas, including oncology, vaccines and Hospital and Specialty Care. 
I'll highlight now a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'll start with oncology. We continue to execute on the launch of KEYTRUDA, and we are excited by the long-term potential for this important brand. KEYTRUDA generated $356 million in sales in the third quarter, with about half of the sales generated outside of the United States. In the U.S., sales were driven primarily from melanoma, where KEYTRUDA continues to be the leading immuno-oncology therapy, as well as from the ongoing launch in second-line lung cancer. 
In August, we also gained approval for recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, and we began to launch that indication immediately. This represents the first new treatment option for these patients in almost a decade. In addition and very importantly, we are ready to launch in first-line lung cancer, where we've just received FDA approval for the high PD-L1-expressing patients, those who express PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%. We know from several data sources, including our own clinical trials, that this patient population represents about 25% to 30% of non-small cell lung cancer patients. 
In addition, we received expanded labeling for second-line lung cancer based upon our KEYNOTE-010 data. So now patients that express any level of PD-L1 are eligible for KEYTRUDA in the second-line setting. Based upon these 2 new patient populations for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer, we have already begun to see an acceleration of testing for PD-L1 at diagnosis. 
Outside of the United States, we've launched our melanoma indication in more than 50 markets, and we continue to see broad adoption of KEYTRUDA as the leading metastatic melanoma treatment. We've also recently gained EMA approval in second-line lung cancer for all PD-L1-positive patients. We're working through the reimbursement process in each country, which, as you know, can take some time, but we expect that we'll start to ramp up nicely in Europe once reimbursement comes through. In addition, we're preparing for the upcoming launch of KEYTRUDA in Japan, where we recently received an indication for melanoma. 
While we've already achieved a number of milestones for KEYTRUDA, this is just the beginning. We remain dedicated to establishing KEYTRUDA as the leader in lung cancer. In addition, we are very optimistic about the long-term potential for KEYTRUDA across many different tumor types.
Moving now to primary care. The JANUVIA franchise generated sales of almost $1.6 billion this quarter, a 2% decline compared to the same quarter last year. Outside of the United States, we saw strong growth of 9%. This includes favorable impact of about $30 million from the timing of customer purchases in Japan, which was offset by an unfavorable impact of roughly the same magnitude from sales in Venezuela. In the U.S., we saw a decline of 10%, which was anticipated given the tough comparison to third quarter of 2015, where we saw a large buy-in. TRX trends remained strong in the United States with growth of 4%, and JANUVIA continues to be the leading DPP-4 treatment of choice in the market. We expect revenue growth in the United States in the fourth quarter of this year versus fourth quarter of 2015. 
Formulary discussions for 2017 are nearly complete, and we expect similar access in the United States for JANUVIA to what we've had this year. We've seen and expect to continue to see increased pricing pressure in the United States for JANUVIA, but we are pleased by the continued strong volume growth. And thus far, we've been able to offset most of the pricing pressures. We remain confident in our diabetes franchise, and we're pleased with our continued strength in this brand globally.
Now moving to our vaccine business. We had another strong quarter with sales of $2 billion or 27% growth. The increase was primarily driven by GARDASIL, pediatric vaccines and Pneumovax. GARDASIL sales were $860 million globally, a 38% increase versus last year. In the United States, GARDASIL sales were 33%, driven by the timing of public sector purchases but also higher demand. 
On October 7, the FDA approved a 2-dose regimen for 9 to 14-year-olds. And just last week, ACIP voted to recommend 2 doses for certain of these patients. This is aligned with the dosing already adopted in some markets outside of the U.S., and it will have a negative impact on sales for GARDASIL moving forward.
Pneumovax delivered another strong quarter with 24% growth versus prior year. The United States growth was primarily driven by demand, with better follow-through from ACIP recommendations for patients 65 and above to receive Pneumovax 1 year after Prevnar. Outside of the U.S., growth was largely driven by Japan. 
Finally, in Hospital and Specialty Care, sales grew 5% to $2.2 billion. Growth in acute care and contributions from launched products were partially offset by declines in REMICADE. REMICADE sales were down 28% this quarter as tenders and new patient starts increasingly go to biosimilars. We expect the declines in REMICADE to continue given the competitive pressures but also increased switching. 
Now moving to ZEPATIER. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in the first year of launch. ZEPATIER's product profile and positioning are resonating well with both health care professionals and payers. As we continued to communicate last quarter, we have seen some early wins in both the public and private sectors for 2016 and 2017. This includes parity access in the VA, favorable access within the Medicaid segment and key wins in the Medicare Part D and commercial segments. 
It is important to note, though, that some of our major formulary wins had effective dates of either July 1 of this year or January 1 of next year, so we don't expect to see the full effect of these wins immediately. Given the time it takes from formulary success to getting patients on drug, we are only just beginning to see the impact from those plans that became effective this summer.  We are also looking forward to launching ZEPATIER in Japan this quarter, where it was recently approved. 
On the hospital side, we had a stronger-than-expected quarter with CUBICIN as generics only entered the market at the end of the quarter. Now that there are 2 generics in the market, we experienced the declines of CUBICIN which appears to be similar to the fast erosion rates that we've seen for other hospital products once generics launched in the U.S.
Finally, BRIDION had another good quarter with almost 50% growth, driven by strong demand across ex-U.S. markets as well as a good ramp-up in the U.S. following our launch earlier this year. While Japan is currently our largest market in the world, over time, we believe that the U.S. market will become the biggest for BRIDION. 
In closing, we continue to deliver solid performance across many products. We have good momentum and good execution across our 4 focus areas. And although we'll have to contend with the ZETIA and VYTORIN patent expiry in fourth quarter of this year into next year, we believe we are well positioned for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger."

In the third quarter, Merck Research Laboratories made substantial progress on multiple fronts. First, in the area of infectious disease, based on our landmark Phase III studies and following the favorable vote of the FDA Antimicrobial Ad",1092,"Thank you, Adam. In the third quarter, Merck Research Laboratories made substantial progress on multiple fronts. First, in the area of infectious disease, based on our landmark Phase III studies and following the favorable vote of the FDA Antimicrobial Advisory Committee, the FDA approved ZINPLAVA for the reduction of the risk of recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection in patients at high risk for such recurrences. I'll remind you that ZINPLAVA is not an antimicrobial agent per se but contains a monoclonal antibody, bezlotoxumab, which is directed against a toxin made by C. difficile and important in the pathogenesis of C. difficile-mediated disease. Review of the ZINPLAVA file is also proceeding in the EU.  
Also in the infectious disease area, last week, we announced top line results for our Phase III study testing the ability of letermovir to reduce the risk of cytomegalovirus disease in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplants. These programs are only the most recent of our very broad efforts to improve therapies for infectious diseases, including 3 important Phase III programs: ZERBAXA for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia; relebactam to broaden the spectrum of our antibiotic PRIMAXIN; and doravirine, a non-nucleosidal HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor with what we believe to be improved characteristics versus currently available therapies.
As Adam mentioned, we continue to demonstrate impressive activity for ZEPATIER, our hepatitis C virus therapy, including in patients known to have used intravenous drugs. We're also making progress in advancing our triplet therapy for HCV infection, with presentations describing the efficacy of this combination across genotypes to be presented at the upcoming AASLD meeting.
But much of the excitement during the past quarter focused on KEYTRUDA, our PD-1-specific antibody for the treatment of malignant disease. As Ken and Adam mentioned, the FDA has just announced an updated label for KEYTRUDA, which includes our Keynote-010 study, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA is superior to traditional chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, including those patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 as few as 1% itself. 
The revised label also includes our KEYNOTE-024 study, which was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings earlier this month and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In brief, KEYNOTE-024 was a randomized active comparator-controlled Phase III study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA, when used for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1 and who lack mutations in the EGF receptor or ALK genes, is superior to traditional platinum-based chemotherapy of the type that has been the standard of care in this disease for more than 2 decades.
These data are important because KEYTRUDA treatment at a fixed dose of 200 milligrams every 3 weeks reduce the risk of tumor progression or death by 50% and reduce the overall risk of death by 40%. Moreover, KEYTRUDA treatment was associated with a lower rate of serious adverse effects than was observed in the chemotherapy treatment arm. We believe, as Bruce Johnson suggested in an accompanying editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, that KEYTRUDA will come to represent a new standard of care for appropriate lung cancer patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1, a population that represents between 25% to 30% of those presenting with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.  
Also in the third quarter, we received approval for the use of KEYTRUDA in lung cancer in the European Union, again, based on our KEYNOTE-010 data. Review of the KEYNOTE-024 study is ongoing by the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (sic) [Committee on Human Medicinal Products ] of the European Medicines Agency.
Beyond these very important results, during the third quarter, we also obtained a data from our KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with traditional platinum doublet-based chemotherapy to yield objective response rates far superior to what we've seen with chemotherapy alone. In this study, patients with metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors expressed any level of PD-L1 were enrolled provided they lacked EGF receptor or ALK gene mutations. Progression-free survival nearly doubled in the KEYTRUDA-containing treatment arm. The results of the study were published simultaneously in Lancet Oncology. 
While this was a Phase II study in a relatively small cohort, including just 123 patients, the results complement an earlier single-arm study employing the same combination regimen, which we presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology in June. Patients in that cohort achieved an objective response rate of 71%, and the objective response rate was 55% in Cohort G. Hence, there is reason to believe that combinations of traditional chemotherapeutic agents, perhaps acting through an immune-activation mechanism, will work in concert with KEYTRUDA to provide superior responses in advanced lung cancer patients in the future. Additional confirmatory studies, including our KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 studies are already underway.
Finally, last week, we announced that the independent data monitoring committee supervising our KEYNOTE-045 study in second-line urothelial cancer involving patients with relapsed or refractory bladder or related uroepithelial cancer recommended that the study be stopped on the basis of improved overall survival in the KEYTRUDA treatment arm. KEYNOTE-045 is a Phase III active comparator-controlled monotherapy study in a very sick patient population. However, the results obtained in this setting mimic results from the first-line KEYNOTE-052 study that we presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting earlier this month, which showed impressive response rates on the treatment of urothelial malignancies. In sum, KEYTRUDA is changing the cancer treatment landscape, already approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma, second-line non-small cell lung cancer, first-line non-small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, for which we obtained FDA approval in August. We obtained what we believe to be registration-worthy data in urothelial cancer, have more than 30 registration-appropriate studies underway, have developed data supporting the activity featured in 22 different malignancies and have more than 360 clinical studies currently underway, including more than 200 combination studies evaluating responses in more than 30 different tumor types. Needless to say, we anticipate additional regulatory filings in the fourth quarter and, of course, in 2017.
Finally, I note that we are making good progress in our diabetes programs. Our insulin glargine filing was accepted for review by the FDA, and with our colleagues at Pfizer, we expect to file for approval of ertugliflozin as monotherapy and as a fixed-dose combination with metformin or with sitagliptin before the end of the year.
Now I'll turn the call back to Teri."

It's a message you've had throughout the year. Two questions on this. I'm wondering how the news of August fits, that suddenly changed alloc for KEYTRUDA might change how you think about M&A. You could argue that doing a bigger deal now runs a risk of disrupting the focus that you'll need on immuno-oncology, for example. And kind of related to that, can you give us some idea of the upper limit to deals you might be considering? Is everything on the table? Or are you looking more at mid-sized deals or smaller? And then second question is on KEYTRUDA and IDO and the timing for making a possible go, no-go decision for Phase III in lung cancer. Is that something that we would learn about maybe in the next 6 months or so?"

We are always mindful of competition, and we want to make sure we do everything we can to get as much utilization -- appropriate utilization, obviously, for the indication that we have as quickly as possible and to really cement our product, KEYTRUDA, as foundational in the treatment of first-line lung cancer. With regard to second-line lung, right now, we have about a 10% market share of the second-line lung market in the United States. But if you look at patients that have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%, that's where the majority of our market share is, and our market share is much, much higher in that group. With the new data that we have in first-line lung in a new indication, there's no doubt that PD-L1 testing will become standard. We're already seeing very significant increases in PD-L1 testing since the ESMO meeting. So I believe that the barrier of needing to be tested in second-line for PD-L1 will be removed to a very large degree. And the fact that we now have an indication for all PD-L1-positive patients in the second-line setting, I believe that we should be a leader in not just first line but second line as well over time."

Standing back from this, I think one has to be impressed by the general efficacy of combinations of KEYTRUDA with other agents. And that's true with respect to PD-1 blockade and other agents preclinically but also clinically. So if you look at combinations, for example, with immuno-active agents like TVEC, there's impressive evidence of activity. There's evidence of activity with other immunologic agents but there's also, as we've talked about, very impressive combination activity with chemotherapy. And in a way, the 021G results in lung cancer basically put a floor on what to expect from these combinations. At a minimum, you're going to have to see the kinds of response rates and progression-free survival results that we've seen in 021G. Keep in mind, that study, as you know, is just 123 patients and, nevertheless, a highly significant result with respect to progression-free survival. Over time, we'll see if an overall survival result is obtained there. Across the -- crossover is so large in those populations, it may not be possible see it. But I think that there is reason to believe that KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with a lot of things, and oncologists have a lot of experience using traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. So there's reason to believe that those kinds of combinations will work well. That said, one shouldn't discount other kinds of immunologic combinations, including combinations with CTLA-4-directed agents. We've done those studies and shown that there is activity for those combinations. The question is ultimately what provides the best balance in terms of therapeutic efficacy and safety and tolerability. It's early days. It will take some time to sort that out, but we'll be pursuing all of those things and we are."

So the collaboration with NanoString is designed to obtain better -- really better diagnostic mechanisms because we know that PD-L1 expression is an imperfect biomarker. That said, the NanoString test does not exclude PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression is an indicator of an inflammatory response because the PD-L1 transcriptional unit is under the control of cytokines like gamma interferon (sic) [  interferon-gamma ], and wherever there's an immune response, you'll see PD-L1 upregulation. Much of the NanoString signature involves other genes that are similarly regulated. So it isn't the case that the NanoString test will look totally different from a PD-L1 test. It will just have a better receiver/operator characteristics. So that you have better sensitivity and specificity. So I guess we continue to refine that signature. It has -- it's working quite well actually, but it will take a while before we can actually reduce it to practice."

I'll focus first on the U.S. because the dynamics are a little bit different in some other markets in the world. But in the United States, about 60% of physicians are testing PD-L1. This was prior to",418,"Okay. So let me address the questions on PD-L1 testing. I'll focus first on the U.S. because the dynamics are a little bit different in some other markets in the world. But in the United States, about 60% of physicians are testing PD-L1. This was prior to ESMO. We don't have any new data on that percentage after ESMO. At the same time, we estimated that about 40% of non-small cell lung cancer new patients were being tested prior to ESMO. I get weekly data. And it's not perfect, but you can certainly see a trend break, where there's a significant increase in the number of patients that are being tested for PD-L1 as -- right after ESMO data was released. So I expect the numbers I just provided you will increase significantly. But I think it's important to remember that even if you look at EGFR testing, it took a while for that to become standard, and even today, after years, about 80% to 85% of patients are routinely tested. So I think there's probably a ceiling of somewhere between 80% to 85% of PD-L1 testing that will occur over time. But with that said, it does take a little while to ramp up, albeit it's ramping up faster. If you look at the length of time it takes to be tested, it's about the same as all other testing for lung cancer. So for this NanoString [ph] PD-L1 testing, they can get it back within a week, typically as fast as they can get ALK testing or EGFR testing. So it's very fast. In terms of the way it comes back to physicians, it's not always consistent. Different labs and in academic institutions, they may give it differently. But right now, most of them come back with a number, that there's PD-L1 55% or 48% as opposed to just a positive or a negative sign. And we think that, that's the way it will probably continue over time. We're seeing it in academic hospitals, but we're also seeing much more utilization even outside of those academic centers as well. With regard to biosimilar opportunity, the bottom line is that we think it is a real commercial opportunity. It's not our strategy. Our strategy remains on innovation. But with $40 billion on a global basis of drugs that are biologics going off patent or at least biosimilars being able to enter the market over the next 5 years, we think there's a real opportunity for us commercially."

That's when they would be considered for utilization for KEYTRUDA. So I would not expect a big bolus that would come into the marketplace in fourth quarter. It's going to be new patient by new patient. Over a year in the United States, Japan and the EU, there's about 250,000 patients that are new patients with non-small cell lung cancer. And based on everything that we've seen, we believe that 25% to 30% is the right number for you to think about as we look at those patients in the marketplace. And then the last thing I'd say is if you look at ZEPATIER, as I mentioned on previous calls, the marketplace had very significant discounting that was occurring. In fact, the pressure on the rebates and discounts before we even launched into the market was very significant. Despite that, we feel like we've gotten good formulary access. We're doing very well in the VA, Medicare Part D, also in some commercial plans, particularly in the regional plans. As we look at 2017, beginning of January, we do have some new contracts. Many of them are at parity, but I think there will be 1 or 2 that we'll be able to discuss in not-too-distant future, where we will have a preferred position."

With respect to the exclusion criteria in KEYNOTE-024, I don't think you should worry about that too much. Patients with active brain metastases are treated with -- typically with radiation directed towards those metastases as a medical emergency. Those are the same kinds of patients that we enrolled in this study. There weren't really significant exclusion criteria that are different from what appears in routine practice. So the number that we're quoting is pretty much what you should expect. Our studies are aligned with what's been seen epidemiologically. And for KEYNOTE-189, I think the ClinicalTrials.gov dates are the dates you should probably use. That study, final data entry is listed in September, and that's probably a good time to think about the 189 study."

First of all, we've had price increases similar to the price increases that we've had in the past. So you haven't seen any difference or acceleration per se. But you also have to realize that the 9-valent is -- costs a bit more than the 4-valent, and most of the patients are moving to the 9-valent vaccine. So I'd net the price increase plus the difference in price between those 2, the 4-valent and the 9-valent. The thing that is hard for us to understand right now is, if you have 2 doses, will the doses be given in the same year? Or for example, if a person presents themselves in August before back-to-school, do they get 1 dose next year in August but they don't get the second dose until the following year in August? So there's still some things that we're going to have to wait to see in terms of how physicians treat those patients. Some might get the first dose in January, the second dose in July or August. Some might just get August dose, the one, and then the following year, the second dose. So there's certainly going to be an impact. The magnitude right now, we can't be certain of. And if you look at the sales by indication, just to give you a rough amount, about 50% to 55% of our sales were melanoma, about 25% or so was in lung, 5% or so was in head and neck cancer.

First of all, I want to be clear on the 60% number that I provided. What I said was approximately 60% of U.S. physicians are testing for PD-L1, not that 60% of patients are being tested.

What I said was approximately 60% of U.S. physicians are testing for PD-L1, not that 60% of patients are being tested. So right now, if you look at the physicians across the U.S. that treat lung cancer, we believe about 60% of them test at least sometimes for PD-L1. We also believe that about 40% of non-small cell lung cancer new patients are being tested for PD-L1. So that should give you a better idea of what's happening prior to ESMO. Since ESMO, I don't have updates to these numbers because it takes time to have these updated, but I do see a very significant increase in the total number of tests that are being ordered for PD-L1. I don't believe that there's any rate-limiting ability of the labs or the institutions to do the testing, so that's not the issue. The question is how quickly will physicians adopt testing for all patients. And the reason I cap that at about 80% to 85% is because, even today, for EGFR testing, we see only about 80% to 85% of patients that are treated. So if we're at 40%, the cap is at 80%, the question is how fast can we go from 40% to the 80% or 85%. And that's what we're working on. With regard to ramp-up for lung, there's not going to be a bolus of patients. The 250,000 patients in the top 7 markets around the world come in throughout the entire year. And the question will be, as they come in, how quickly will they be put on to KEYTRUDA if they have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%."

Would love to just hear your thoughts on that topic. And then the second one, just coming back to some of the business development priorities. I know the focus is on bolt-ons. But when we're thinking about larger deals specifically, would Merck be willing to take on single program or product risk in a larger deal?

I would start by saying that I think we will look at each deal based on its particular merits, and so I don't think this is a way for me to respond to that. I think what our past experience has been is we've tried to look for those deals where we believe we're going to get scientific assets going forward. And if we can get good assets that are in the marketplace now, that's something that we would be willing to do. But I don't think I can say categorically that we wouldn't take the kind of deal that has a concentration in 1 product versus another. Obviously, concentration is one of the factors that you weigh when you think about the risk inherent in a deal. As it relates to pricing, we also are very concerned about the whole issue of pricing and affordability for patients. It's a significant one. It's been amplified in this year's political season. We find it unfortunate that a lot of times, the focus is on affordability and pricing rather than the long-term benefit that these therapies provide. So from our perspective, we think that going forward, we don't think these environmental pricing pressures will ease. And that's why we continue to focus on our strategy of investing in innovative R&D for products like KEYTRUDA because we think those are the kinds of products that will help Merck weather some of the pricing risks and pricing pressures that we will be facing as an industry going forward."

And of course, that's a traditional problem in the development of chemotherapeutic agents and the reason why progression-free survival has been accepted as an endpoint in a variety of different tumor types. On the other hand, chemotherapy is active, and for individuals whose disease is controlled by chemotherapy, then the crossover will inherently occur later. Because we believe that KEYTRUDA provides a more durable benefit to patients with lung cancer, and the data from that are clear across a variety of tumor types, under those circumstances, I would expect separation for overall survival. And as I indicated, it's a fairly complicated set of equations to try and estimate what that's going to look like. I think we probably have to wait for the data."

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today.  
Before we discuss our results for the quarter, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the recent ESMO congress, where the latest data were presented from our KEYTRUDA clinical development program for lung cancer and simultaneously published in 2 major scientific journals. Many have noted the significant implications these results may have for the treatment of lung cancer, the deadliest type of cancer in the United States. And just yesterday, the FDA approved KEYTRUDA as the only PD-1 therapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic lung cancer, making it an option for tens of thousands of lung cancer patients in the United States.  For the first time in decades, the standard of care may change for lung cancer patients; offering them renewed hope. 
This advancement is what Merck is all about, and we are honored to be making a real difference in the fight against cancer. The recent KEYTRUDA achievements are proof of concept, if you will, that our innovation strategy is working. Our sustained investment in medically important R&D has yielded a number of recent approvals and regulatory milestones across the various therapeutic areas in our Human Health and Animal Health businesses.
Turning now to the results. In the third quarter, we reported a strong performance that reflects growth across several priority programs, including our vaccines portfolio and also KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, which are continuing to launch around the world. We remain confident in the strength of our portfolio, from our JANUVIA franchise, which is core to our business and continues to maintain its leadership position in the DPP-4 class; to BRIDION, which is quickly contributing to our growth while still in the launch phase here in the United States. Looking ahead, we will continue to follow the science, pursuing the best internal and external scientific opportunities that will enable us to take on some of the world's greatest health challenges.  
That is why business development remains an important priority in achieving our goals. Our appetite for business development has not changed. We continue to seek the best opportunities and collaborations, with the right financial valuation, to augment our portfolio and pipeline. In closing, our performance in the quarter positions us well to continue to invest in our business and to deliver a balanced, differentiated portfolio of medicines and vaccines that will generate long-term growth and sustainable value for shareholders and society.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

As a reminder, we went to this [indiscernible]  rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 so this is the last quarter in which we will face this headwind.  I should note that the year-over-year increase in Human Health sales in the third quarter includes an approximately $200 million benefit from the pull-forward of customer purchases from the fourth quarter. These were mainly due to the timing of shipments in Japan in anticipation of an ERP go-live and the timing of CDC vaccine purchases.

We continue to anticipate foreign exchange will have an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact on revenue in 2016.
Looking to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 75.3%, an increase of 20 basis points. Product mix was the primary driver of the increase versus the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat versus last year, with margins in the fourth quarter expected to be lower on a year-over-year basis as we see the mix impact of generic competition for CUBICIN and ZETIA in the U.S. market and declines in FX hedge gains year-on-year, which flow 100% to gross margin.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4 billion were roughly flat versus the third quarter of 2015, as declines in marketing and administrative expenses largely offset an increase in research and development expenses in the quarter. While we are committed to delivering a leveraged P&L over the long term, it may be more challenging in the near term given the impending loss of market exclusivity for ZETIA and VYTORIN in the U.S. and investments that we need to make to support the growing opportunity for KEYTRUDA.  That being said, we remain disciplined and continue to look for opportunities to reallocate resources across the portfolio.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.8% this quarter. We expect the full year rate to trend to the higher end of our previously communicated range of 21.5% and 22.5%, which includes the impact of the R&D tax credit. 
Taken together, we earned $1.07 per share on a non-GAAP basis, delivering 11% growth versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, non-GAAP EPS increased 8%. Of the $0.11 increase in non-GAAP EPS this quarter compared to Q3 2015, approximately $0.04 were related to the customer purchases in Japan that I mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.78 this quarter.  
Given our results in the first 9 months of the year, we are also narrowing and raising our full year non-GAAP EPS range. We now expect to earn $3.71 to $3.78 per share, with foreign exchange still expected to have an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact. On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn $2.02 to $2.09 per share for the full year. Altogether, our top and bottom line growth in the quarter, driven by solid operational performance, sets us up for a strong 2016 overall. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter, and my comments will be on a constant-currency basis.  Global Human Health delivered another strong quarte",1255,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter, and my comments will be on a constant-currency basis.  
Global Human Health delivered another strong quarter with sales of $9.4 billion or an increase of 6%. We drove growth across many of our core areas, including oncology, vaccines and Hospital and Specialty Care. 
I'll highlight now a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'll start with oncology. We continue to execute on the launch of KEYTRUDA, and we are excited by the long-term potential for this important brand. KEYTRUDA generated $356 million in sales in the third quarter, with about half of the sales generated outside of the United States. In the U.S., sales were driven primarily from melanoma, where KEYTRUDA continues to be the leading immuno-oncology therapy, as well as from the ongoing launch in second-line lung cancer. 
In August, we also gained approval for recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, and we began to launch that indication immediately. This represents the first new treatment option for these patients in almost a decade. In addition and very importantly, we are ready to launch in first-line lung cancer, where we've just received FDA approval for the high PD-L1-expressing patients, those who express PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%. We know from several data sources, including our own clinical trials, that this patient population represents about 25% to 30% of non-small cell lung cancer patients. 
In addition, we received expanded labeling for second-line lung cancer based upon our KEYNOTE-010 data. So now patients that express any level of PD-L1 are eligible for KEYTRUDA in the second-line setting. Based upon these 2 new patient populations for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer, we have already begun to see an acceleration of testing for PD-L1 at diagnosis. 
Outside of the United States, we've launched our melanoma indication in more than 50 markets, and we continue to see broad adoption of KEYTRUDA as the leading metastatic [ph] melanoma treatment. We've also recently gained EMA approval in second-line lung cancer for all PD-L1-positive patients. We're working through the reimbursement process in each country, which, as you know, can take some time, but we expect that we'll start to ramp up nicely in Europe once reimbursement comes through. In addition, we're preparing for the upcoming launch of KEYTRUDA in Japan, where we recently received an indication for melanoma. 
While we've already achieved a number of milestones for KEYTRUDA, this is just the beginning. We remain dedicated to establishing KEYTRUDA as the leader in lung cancer. In addition, we are very optimistic about the long-term potential for KEYTRUDA across many different tumor types.
Moving now to primary care. The JANUVIA franchise generated sales of almost $1.6 billion this quarter, a 2% decline compared to the same quarter last year. Outside of the United States, we saw strong growth of 9%. This includes favorable impact of about $30 million from the timing of customer purchases in Japan, which was offset by an unfavorable impact of roughly the same magnitude from sales in Venezuela. In the U.S., we saw a decline of 10%, which was anticipated given the tough comparison to third quarter of 2015, where we saw a large buy-in. TRX trends remained strong in the United States with growth of 4%, and JANUVIA continues to be the leading DPP-4 treatment of choice in the market. We expect revenue growth in the United States in the fourth quarter of this year versus fourth quarter of 2015. 
Formulary discussions for 2017 are nearly complete, and we expect similar access in the United States for JANUVIA to what we've had this year. We've seen and expect to continue to see increased pricing pressure in the United States for JANUVIA, but we are pleased by the continued strong volume growth. And thus far, we've been able to offset most of the pricing pressures. We remain confident in our diabetes franchise, and we're pleased with our continued strength in this brand globally.
Now moving to our vaccine business. We had another strong quarter with sales of $2 billion or 27% growth. The increase was primarily driven by GARDASIL, pediatric vaccines and Pneumovax. GARDASIL sales were $860 million globally, a 38% increase versus last year. In the United States, GARDASIL sales grew 33%, driven by the timing of public sector purchases but also higher demand. 
On October 7, the FDA approved a 2-dose regimen for 9 to 14-year-olds. And just last week, ACIP voted to recommend 2 doses for certain of these patients. This is aligned with the dosing already adopted in some markets outside of the U.S., and it will have a negative impact on sales for GARDASIL moving forward.
Pneumovax delivered another strong quarter with 24% growth versus prior year. The United States growth was primarily driven by demand, with better follow-through from ACIP recommendations for patients 65 and above to receive Pneumovax 1 year after Prevnar. Outside of the U.S., growth was largely driven by Japan. 
Finally, in Hospital and Specialty Care, sales grew 5% to $2.2 billion. Growth in acute care and contributions from launched products were partially offset by declines in REMICADE. REMICADE sales were down 28% this quarter as tenders and new patient starts increasingly go to biosimilars. We expect the declines in REMICADE to continue given the competitive pressures but also increased switching. 
Now moving to ZEPATIER. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in the first year of launch. ZEPATIER's product profile and positioning are resonating well with both health care professionals and payers. As we continued to communicate last quarter, we have seen some early wins in both the public and private sectors for 2016 and 2017. This includes parity access in the VA, favorable access within the Medicaid segment and key wins in the Medicare Part D and commercial segments. 
It is important to note, though, that some of our major formulary wins had effective dates of either July 1 of this year or January 1 of next year, so we don't expect to see the full effect of these wins immediately. Given the time it takes from formulary success to getting patients on drug, we are only just beginning to see the impact from those plans that became effective this summer.  We are also looking forward to launching ZEPATIER in Japan this quarter, where it was recently approved. 
On the hospital side, we had a stronger-than-expected quarter with CUBICIN as generics only entered the market at the end of the quarter. Now that there are 2 generics in the market, we experienced the declines of CUBICIN which appears to be similar to the fast erosion rates that we've seen for other hospital products once generics launched in the U.S.
Finally, BRIDION had another good quarter with almost 50% growth, driven by strong demand across ex-U.S. markets as well as a good ramp-up in the U.S. following our launch earlier this year. While Japan is currently our largest market in the world, over time, we believe that the U.S. market will become the biggest for BRIDION. 
In closing, we continue to deliver solid performance across many products. We have good momentum and good execution across our 4 focus areas. And although we'll have to contend with the ZETIA and VYTORIN patent expiry in fourth quarter of this year into next year, we believe we are well positioned for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger."

In the third quarter, Merck Research Laboratories made substantial progress on multiple fronts. First, in the area of infectious disease, based on our landmark Phase III studies and following the favorable vote of the FDA Antimicrobial Ad",1094,"Thank you, Adam. In the third quarter, Merck Research Laboratories made substantial progress on multiple fronts. First, in the area of infectious disease, based on our landmark Phase III studies and following the favorable vote of the FDA Antimicrobial Advisory Committee, the FDA approved ZINPLAVA for the reduction of the risk of recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection in patients at high risk for such recurrences. I'll remind you that ZINPLAVA is not an antimicrobial agent per se but contains a monoclonal antibody, bezlotoxumab, which is directed against a toxin made by C. difficile and important in the pathogenesis of C. difficile-mediated disease. Review of the ZINPLAVA file is also proceeding in the EU.  
Also in the infectious disease area, last week, we announced top line results for our Phase III study testing the ability of letermovir to reduce the risk of cytomegalovirus disease in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplants. These programs are only the most recent of our very broad efforts to improve therapies for infectious diseases, including 3 important Phase III programs: ZERBAXA for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia; relebactam to broaden the spectrum of our antibiotic PRIMAXIN; and doravirine, a non-nucleosidal HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor with what we believe to be improved characteristics versus currently available therapies.
As Adam mentioned, we continue to demonstrate impressive activity for ZEPATIER, our hepatitis C virus therapy, including in patients known to have used intravenous drugs. We're also making progress in advancing our triplet therapy for HCV infection, with presentations describing the efficacy of this combination across genotypes to be presented at the upcoming AASLD meeting.
But much of the excitement during the past quarter focused on KEYTRUDA, our PD-1-specific antibody for the treatment of malignant disease. As Ken and Adam mentioned, the FDA has just announced an updated label for KEYTRUDA, which includes our Keynote-010 study, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA is superior to traditional chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, including those patients whose tumors express PD-L1 in as few as 1% of cells. 
The revised label also includes our KEYNOTE-024 study, which was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings earlier this month and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In brief, KEYNOTE-024 was a randomized active comparator-controlled Phase III study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA, when used for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 and who lack mutations in the EGF receptor or ALK genes, is superior to traditional platinum-based chemotherapy of the type that has been the standard of care in this disease for more than 2 decades.
These data are important because KEYTRUDA treatment at a fixed dose of 200 milligrams every 3 weeks reduced the risk of tumor progression or death by 50% and reduce the overall risk of death by 40%. Moreover, KEYTRUDA treatment was associated with a lower rate of serious adverse effects than was observed in the chemotherapy treatment arm. We believe, as Bruce Johnson suggested in an accompanying editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, that KEYTRUDA will come to represent a new standard of care for appropriate lung cancer patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1, a population that represents between 25% to 30% of those presenting with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.  
Also in the third quarter, we received approval for the use of KEYTRUDA in lung cancer in the European Union, again, based on our KEYNOTE-010 data. Review of the KEYNOTE-024 study is ongoing by the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (sic) [Committee on Human Medicinal Products ] of the European Medicines Agency.
Beyond these very important results, during the third quarter, we also obtained a data from our KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with traditional platinum doublet-based chemotherapy to yield objective response rates far superior to what we've seen with chemotherapy alone. In this study, patients with metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors expressed any level of PD-L1 were enrolled provided they lacked EGF receptor or ALK gene mutations. Progression-free survival nearly doubled in the KEYTRUDA-containing treatment arm. The results of the study were published simultaneously in Lancet Oncology. 
While this was a Phase II study in a relatively small cohort, including just 123 patients, the results complement an earlier single-arm study employing the same combination regimen, which we presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology in June. Patients in that cohort achieved an objective response rate of 71%, and the objective response rate was 55% in Cohort G. Hence, there is reason to believe that combinations of traditional chemotherapeutic agents, perhaps acting through an immune-activation mechanism, will work in concert with KEYTRUDA to provide superior responses in advanced lung cancer patients in the future. Additional confirmatory studies, including our KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 studies are already underway.
Finally, last week, we announced that the independent data monitoring committee supervising our KEYNOTE-045 study in second-line urothelial cancer involving patients with relapsed or refractory bladder or related uroepithelial cancer recommended that the study be stopped on the basis of improved overall survival in the KEYTRUDA treatment arm. KEYNOTE-045 is a Phase III active comparator-controlled monotherapy study in a very sick patient population. However, the results obtained in this setting mimic results from the first-line KEYNOTE-052 study that we presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting earlier this month, which showed impressive response rates on the treatment of urothelial malignancies. In sum, KEYTRUDA is changing the cancer treatment landscape, already approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma, second-line non-small cell lung cancer, first-line non-small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, for which we obtained FDA approval in August, we obtained what we believe to be registration-worthy data in urothelial cancer, have more than 30 registration-appropriate studies underway, have developed data supporting the activity featured in 22 different malignancies and have more than 360 clinical studies currently underway, including more than 200 combination studies evaluating responses in more than 30 different tumor types. Needless to say, we anticipate additional regulatory filings in the fourth quarter and, of course, in 2017.
Finally, I note that we are making good progress in our diabetes programs. Our insulin glargine filing was accepted for review by the FDA, and with our colleagues at Pfizer, we expect to file for approval of ertugliflozin as monotherapy and as a fixed-dose combination with metformin or with sitagliptin before the end of the year.
Now I'll turn the call back to Teri."

Yes. So let me start. First of all, we are thrilled to be the first to launch in first-line lung. And I give Roger and his team a lot of credit for the design of the trials and the ability for us to actually be the first to have approval there. We are always looking at competition. We are always mindful of competition, and we want to make sure we do everything we can to get as much utilization -- appropriate utilization, obviously, for the indication that we have as quickly as possible and to really cement our product, KEYTRUDA, as foundational in the treatment of first-line lung cancer. With regard to second-line lung, right now, we have about a 10% market share of the second-line lung market in the United States. But if you look at patients that have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%, that's where the majority of our market share is, and our market share is much, much higher in that group. With the new data that we have in first-line lung in a new indication, there's no doubt that PD-L1 testing will become standard. We're already seeing very significant increases in PD-L1 testing since the ESMO meeting. So I believe that the barrier of needing to be tested in second-line for PD-L1 will be removed to a very large degree. And the fact that we now have an indication for all PD-L1-positive patients in the second-line setting, I believe that we should be a leader in not just first line but second line as well over time."

Standing back from this, I think one has to be impressed by the general efficacy of combinations of KEYTRUDA with other agents. And that's true with respect to PD-1 blockade and other agents preclinically but also clinically. So if you look at combinations, for example, with immuno-active agents like TVEC, there's impressive evidence of activity. There's evidence of activity with other immunologic agents but there's also, as we've talked about, very impressive combination activity with chemotherapy. And in a way, the 021G results in lung cancer basically put a floor on what to expect from these combinations. At a minimum, you're going to have to see the kinds of response rates and progression-free survival results that we've seen in 021G. Keep in mind, that study, as you know, is just 123 patients and, nevertheless, a highly significant result with respect to progression-free survival. Over time, we'll see if an overall survival result is obtained there. Across the -- crossover is so large in those populations, it may not be possible see it. But I think that there is reason to believe that KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with a lot of things, and oncologists have a lot of experience using traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. So there's reason to believe that those kinds of combinations will work well. That said, one shouldn't discount other kinds of immunologic combinations, including combinations with CTLA-4-directed agents. We've done those studies and shown that there is activity for those combinations. The question is ultimately what provides the best balance in terms of therapeutic efficacy and safety and tolerability. It's early days. It will take some time to sort that out, but we'll be pursuing all of those things and we are."

So the collaboration with NanoString is designed to obtain better -- really better diagnostic mechanisms because we know that PD-L1 expression is an imperfect biomarker. That said, the NanoString test does not exclude PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression is an indicator of an inflammatory response because the PD-L1 transcriptional unit is under the control of cytokines like gamma interferon (sic) [  interferon-gamma ], and wherever there's an immune response, you'll see PD-L1 upregulation. Much of the NanoString signature involves other genes that are similarly regulated. So it isn't the case that the NanoString test will look totally different from a PD-L1 test. It will just have a better receiver/operator characteristics. So that you have better sensitivity and specificity. So I guess we continue to refine that signature. It has -- it's working quite well actually, but it will take a while before we can actually reduce it to practice."

This was prior to",419,"Okay. So let me address the questions on PD-L1 testing. I'll focus first on the U.S. because the dynamics are a little bit different in some other markets in the world. But in the United States, about 60% of physicians are testing PD-L1. This was prior to ESMO. We don't have any new data on that percentage after ESMO. At the same time, we estimated that about 40% of non-small cell lung cancer new patients were being tested prior to ESMO. I get weekly data. And it's not perfect, but you can certainly see a trend break, where there's a significant increase in the number of patients that are being tested for PD-L1 as -- right after ESMO data was released. So I expect the numbers I just provided you will increase significantly. But I think it's important to remember that even if you look at EGFR testing, it took a while for that to become standard, and even today, after years, about 80% to 85% of patients are routinely tested. So I think there's probably a ceiling of somewhere between 80% to 85% of PD-L1 testing that will occur over time. But with that said, it does take a little while to ramp up, albeit it's ramping up faster. If you look at the length of time it takes to be tested, it's about the same as all other testing for lung cancer. So if a physician asks for PD-L1 testing, they can get it back within a week, typically as fast as they can get ALK testing or EGFR testing. So it's very fast. In terms of the way it comes back to physicians, it's not always consistent. Different labs and in academic institutions, they may give it differently. But right now, most of them come back with a number, that there's PD-L1 55% or 48% as opposed to just a positive or a negative sign. And we think that, that's the way it will probably continue over time. We're seeing it in academic hospitals, but we're also seeing much more utilization even outside of those academic centers as well. With regard to biosimilar opportunity, the bottom line is that we think it is a real commercial opportunity. It's not our strategy. Our strategy remains on innovation. But with $40 billion on a global basis of drugs that are biologics going off patent or at least biosimilars being able to enter the market over the next 5 years, we think there's a real opportunity for us commercially."

And based on everything that we've seen, we believe that 25% to 30% is the right number for you to think about as we look at those patients in the marketplace. And then the last thing I'd say is if you look at ZEPATIER, as I mentioned on previous calls, the marketplace had very significant discounting that was occurring. In fact, the pressure on the rebates and discounts before we even launched into the market was very significant. Despite that, we feel like we've gotten good formulary access. We're doing very well in the VA, Medicare Part D, also in some commercial plans, particularly in the regional plans. As we look at 2017, beginning of January, we do have some new contracts.

So I'd net the price increase plus the difference in price between those 2, the 4-valent and the 9-valent. The thing that is hard for us to understand right now is, if you have 2 doses, will the doses be given in the same year? Or for example, if a person presents themselves in August before back-to-school, do they get 1 dose next year in August but they don't get the second dose until the following year in August? So there's still some things that we're going to have to wait to see in terms of how physicians treat those patients. Some might get the first dose in January, the second dose in July or August. Some might just get August dose, the one, and then the following year, the second dose. So there's certainly going to be an impact. The magnitude right now, we can't be certain of. And if you look at the sales by indication, just to give you a rough amount, about 50% to 55% of our sales were melanoma, about 25% or so was in lung, 5% or so was in head and neck cancer.

What I said was approximately 60% of U.S. physicians are testing for PD-L1, not that 60% of patients are being tested. So right now, if you look at the physicians across the U.S. that treat lung cancer, we believe about 60% of them test at least sometimes for PD-L1. We also believe that about 40% of non-small cell lung cancer new patients are being tested for PD-L1. So that should give you a better idea of what's happening prior to ESMO. Since ESMO, I don't have updates to these numbers because it takes time to have these updated, but I do see a very significant increase in the total number of tests that are being ordered for PD-L1. I don't believe that there's any rate-limiting ability of the labs or the institutions to do the testing, so that's not the issue. The question is how quickly will physicians adopt testing for all patients. And the reason I cap that at about 80% to 85% is because, even today, for EGFR testing, we see only about 80% to 85% of patients that are treated. So if we're at 40%, the cap is at 80%, the question is how fast can we go from 40% to the 80% or 85%. And that's what we're working on. With regard to ramp-up for lung, there's not going to be a bolus of patients. The 250,000 patients in the top 7 markets around the world come in throughout the entire year. And the question will be, as they come in, how quickly will they be put on to KEYTRUDA if they have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%."

Just how do you see this playing out for the industry? Are you guys thinking about price differently than the past? Should we be thinking about a more challenging pricing environment going forward? Would love to just hear your thoughts on that topic. And then the second one, just coming back to some of the business development priorities. I know the focus is on bolt-ons. But when we're thinking about larger deals specifically, would Merck be willing to take on single program or product risk in a larger deal? As we think about those, if a sizable component valuation were tied to 1 or 2 core programs, is that something that fits what Merck's looking for? Or should we be thinking about more diversified assets as we think about things that are beyond bolt-ons?"

I would start by saying that I think we will look at each deal based on its particular merits, and so I don't think there is a way for me to respond to that. I think what our past experience has been is we've tried to look for those deals where we believe we're going to get scientific assets going forward. And if we can get good assets that are in the marketplace now, that's something that we would be willing to do. But I don't think I can say categorically that we wouldn't take the kind of deal that has a concentration in one product versus another. Obviously, concentration is one of the factors that you weigh when you think about the risk inherent in a deal. As it relates to pricing, we also are very concerned about the whole issue of pricing and affordability for patients. It's a significant one. It's been amplified in this year's political season. We find it unfortunate that a lot of times, the focus is on affordability and pricing rather than the long-term benefit that these therapies provide. So from our perspective, we think that going forward, we don't think these environmental pricing pressures will ease. And that's why we continue to focus on our strategy of investing in innovative R&D for products like KEYTRUDA because we think those are the kinds of products that will help Merck weather some of the pricing risks and pricing pressures that we will be facing as an industry going forward."

And of course, that's a traditional problem in the development of chemotherapeutic agents and the reason why progression-free survival has been accepted as an endpoint in a variety of different tumor types. On the other hand, chemotherapy is active, and for individuals whose disease is controlled by chemotherapy, then the crossover will inherently occur later. Because we believe that KEYTRUDA provides a more durable benefit to patients with lung cancer, and the data from that are clear across a variety of tumor types, under those circumstances, I would expect separation for overall survival. And as I indicated, it's a fairly complicated set of equations to try and estimate what that's going to look like. I think we probably have to wait for the data."

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today.  
Before we discuss our results for the quarter, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the recent ESMO congress, where the latest data were presented from our KEYTRUDA clinical development program for lung cancer and simultaneously published in 2 major scientific journals. Many have noted the significant implications these results may have for the treatment of lung cancer, the deadliest type of cancer in the United States. And just yesterday, the FDA approved KEYTRUDA as the only PD-1 therapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic lung cancer, making it an option for tens of thousands of lung cancer patients in the United States.  For the first time in decades, the standard of care may change for lung cancer patients; offering them renewed hope. 
This advancement is what Merck is all about, and we are honored to be making a real difference in the fight against cancer. The recent KEYTRUDA achievements are proof of concept, if you will, that our innovation strategy is working. Our sustained investment in medically important R&D has yielded a number of recent approvals and regulatory milestones across the various therapeutic areas in our Human Health and Animal Health businesses.
Turning now to the results. In the third quarter, we reported a strong performance that reflects growth across several priority programs, including our vaccines portfolio and also KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, which are continuing to launch around the world. We remain confident in the strength of our portfolio, from our JANUVIA franchise, which is core to our business and continues to maintain its leadership position in the DPP-4 class; to BRIDION, which is quickly contributing to our growth while still in the launch phase here in the United States. Looking ahead, we will continue to follow the science, pursuing the best internal and external scientific opportunities that will enable us to take on some of the world's greatest health challenges.  
That is why business development remains an important priority in achieving our goals. Our appetite for business development has not changed. We continue to seek the best opportunities and collaborations, with the right financial valuation, to augment our portfolio and pipeline. In closing, our performance in the quarter positions us well to continue to invest in our business and to deliver a balanced, differentiated portfolio of medicines and vaccines that will generate long-term growth and sustainable value for shareholders and society.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Total company revenues were $10.5 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, revenue increased 6%. 
Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses contributed 6% and 7% growth, respectively, excluding exchange in the quarter and despite an approximately $170 million headwind from sales in Venezuela in the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, we went to this [indiscernible]  rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 so this is the last quarter in which we will face this headwind.  I should note that the year-over-year increase in Human Health sales in the third quarter includes an approximately $200 million benefit from the pull-forward of customer purchases from the fourth quarter. These were mainly due to the timing of shipments in Japan in anticipation of an ERP go-live and the timing of CDC vaccine purchases.  
Taking into account our performance in the first 3 quarters of 2016 and our expectations through year-end, we are narrowing and raising our full year revenue guidance to $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion. We continue to anticipate foreign exchange will have an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact on revenue in 2016.
Looking to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 75.3%, an increase of 20 basis points. Product mix was the primary driver of the increase versus the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat versus last year, with margins in the fourth quarter expected to be lower on a year-over-year basis as we see the mix impact of generic competition for CUBICIN and ZETIA in the U.S. market and declines in FX hedge gains year-on-year, which flow 100% to gross margin.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4 billion were roughly flat versus the third quarter of 2015, as declines in marketing and administrative expenses largely offset an increase in research and development expenses in the quarter. While we are committed to delivering a leveraged P&L over the long term, it may be more challenging in the near term given the impending loss of market exclusivity for ZETIA and VYTORIN in the U.S. and investments that we need to make to support the growing opportunity for KEYTRUDA.  That being said, we remain disciplined and continue to look for opportunities to reallocate resources across the portfolio.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.8% this quarter. We expect the full year rate to trend to the higher end of our previously communicated range of 21.5% and 22.5%, which includes the impact of the R&D tax credit. 
Taken together, we earned $1.07 per share on a non-GAAP basis, delivering 11% growth versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, non-GAAP EPS increased 8%. Of the $0.11 increase in non-GAAP EPS this quarter compared to Q3 2015, approximately $0.04 were related to the customer purchases in Japan that I mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.78 this quarter.  
Given our results in the first 9 months of the year, we are also narrowing and raising our full year non-GAAP EPS range. We now expect to earn $3.71 to $3.78 per share, with foreign exchange still expected to have an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact. On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn $2.02 to $2.09 per share for the full year. Altogether, our top and bottom line growth in the quarter, driven by solid operational performance, sets us up for a strong 2016 overall. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Adam."

This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter, and my comments will be on a constant-currency basis.  
Global Human Health delivered another strong quarter with sales of $9.4 billion or an increase of 6%. We drove growth across many of our core areas, including oncology, vaccines and Hospital and Specialty Care. 
I'll highlight now a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'll start with oncology. We continue to execute on the launch of KEYTRUDA, and we are excited by the long-term potential for this important brand. KEYTRUDA generated $356 million in sales in the third quarter, with about half of the sales generated outside of the United States. In the U.S., sales were driven primarily from melanoma, where KEYTRUDA continues to be the leading immuno-oncology therapy, as well as from the ongoing launch in second-line lung cancer. 
In August, we also gained approval for recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, and we began to launch that indication immediately. This represents the first new treatment option for these patients in almost a decade. In addition and very importantly, we are ready to launch in first-line lung cancer, where we've just received FDA approval for the high PD-L1-expressing patients, those who express PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%. We know from several data sources, including our own clinical trials, that this patient population represents about 25% to 30% of non-small cell lung cancer patients. 
In addition, we received expanded labeling for second-line lung cancer based upon our KEYNOTE-010 data. So now patients that express any level of PD-L1 are eligible for KEYTRUDA in the second-line setting. Based upon these 2 new patient populations for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer, we have already begun to see an acceleration of testing for PD-L1 at diagnosis. 
Outside of the United States, we've launched our melanoma indication in more than 50 markets, and we continue to see broad adoption of KEYTRUDA as the leading metastatic [ph] melanoma treatment. We've also recently gained EMA approval in second-line lung cancer for all PD-L1-positive patients. We're working through the reimbursement process in each country, which, as you know, can take some time, but we expect that we'll start to ramp up nicely in Europe once reimbursement comes through. In addition, we're preparing for the upcoming launch of KEYTRUDA in Japan, where we recently received an indication for melanoma. 
While we've already achieved a number of milestones for KEYTRUDA, this is just the beginning. We remain dedicated to establishing KEYTRUDA as the leader in lung cancer. In addition, we are very optimistic about the long-term potential for KEYTRUDA across many different tumor types.
Moving now to primary care. The JANUVIA franchise generated sales of almost $1.6 billion this quarter, a 2% decline compared to the same quarter last year. Outside of the United States, we saw strong growth of 9%. This includes favorable impact of about $30 million from the timing of customer purchases in Japan, which was offset by an unfavorable impact of roughly the same magnitude from sales in Venezuela. In the U.S., we saw a decline of 10%, which was anticipated given the tough comparison to third quarter of 2015, where we saw a large buy-in. TRX trends remained strong in the United States with growth of 4%, and JANUVIA continues to be the leading DPP-4 treatment of choice in the market. We expect revenue growth in the United States in the fourth quarter of this year versus fourth quarter of 2015. 
Formulary discussions for 2017 are nearly complete, and we expect similar access in the United States for JANUVIA to what we've had this year. We've seen and expect to continue to see increased pricing pressure in the United States for JANUVIA, but we are pleased by the continued strong volume growth. And thus far, we've been able to offset most of the pricing pressures. We remain confident in our diabetes franchise, and we're pleased with our continued strength in this brand globally.
Now moving to our vaccine business. We had another strong quarter with sales of $2 billion or 27% growth. The increase was primarily driven by GARDASIL, pediatric vaccines and Pneumovax. GARDASIL sales were $860 million globally, a 38% increase versus last year. In the United States, GARDASIL sales grew 33%, driven by the timing of public sector purchases but also higher demand. 
On October 7, the FDA approved a 2-dose regimen for 9 to 14-year-olds. And just last week, ACIP voted to recommend 2 doses for certain of these patients. This is aligned with the dosing already adopted in some markets outside of the U.S., and it will have a negative impact on sales for GARDASIL moving forward.
Pneumovax delivered another strong quarter with 24% growth versus prior year. The United States growth was primarily driven by demand, with better follow-through from ACIP recommendations for patients 65 and above to receive Pneumovax 1 year after Prevnar. Outside of the U.S., growth was largely driven by Japan. 
Finally, in Hospital and Specialty Care, sales grew 5% to $2.2 billion. Growth in acute care and contributions from launched products were partially offset by declines in REMICADE. REMICADE sales were down 28% this quarter as tenders and new patient starts increasingly go to biosimilars. We expect the declines in REMICADE to continue given the competitive pressures but also increased switching. 
Now moving to ZEPATIER. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in the first year of launch. ZEPATIER's product profile and positioning are resonating well with both health care professionals and payers. As we continued to communicate last quarter, we have seen some early wins in both the public and private sectors for 2016 and 2017. This includes parity access in the VA, favorable access within the Medicaid segment and key wins in the Medicare Part D and commercial segments. 
It is important to note, though, that some of our major formulary wins had effective dates of either July 1 of this year or January 1 of next year, so we don't expect to see the full effect of these wins immediately. Given the time it takes from formulary success to getting patients on drug, we are only just beginning to see the impact from those plans that became effective this summer.  We are also looking forward to launching ZEPATIER in Japan this quarter, where it was recently approved. 
On the hospital side, we had a stronger-than-expected quarter with CUBICIN as generics only entered the market at the end of the quarter. Now that there are 2 generics in the market, we experienced the declines of CUBICIN which appears to be similar to the fast erosion rates that we've seen for other hospital products once generics launched in the U.S.
Finally, BRIDION had another good quarter with almost 50% growth, driven by strong demand across ex-U.S. markets as well as a good ramp-up in the U.S. following our launch earlier this year. While Japan is currently our largest market in the world, over time, we believe that the U.S. market will become the biggest for BRIDION. 
In closing, we continue to deliver solid performance across many products. We have good momentum and good execution across our 4 focus areas. And although we'll have to contend with the ZETIA and VYTORIN patent expiry in fourth quarter of this year into next year, we believe we are well positioned for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger."

In the third quarter, Merck Research Laboratories made substantial progress on multiple fronts. First, in the area of infectious disease, based on our landmark Phase III studies and following the favorable vote of the FDA Antimicrobial Advisory Committee, the FDA approved ZINPLAVA for the reduction of the risk of recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection in patients at high risk for such recurrences. I'll remind you that ZINPLAVA is not an antimicrobial agent per se but contains a monoclonal antibody, bezlotoxumab, which is directed against a toxin made by C. difficile and important in the pathogenesis of C. difficile-mediated disease. Review of the ZINPLAVA file is also proceeding in the EU.  
Also in the infectious disease area, last week, we announced top line results for our Phase III study testing the ability of letermovir to reduce the risk of cytomegalovirus disease in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplants. These programs are only the most recent of our very broad efforts to improve therapies for infectious diseases, including 3 important Phase III programs: ZERBAXA for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia; relebactam to broaden the spectrum of our antibiotic PRIMAXIN; and doravirine, a non-nucleosidal HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor with what we believe to be improved characteristics versus currently available therapies.
As Adam mentioned, we continue to demonstrate impressive activity for ZEPATIER, our hepatitis C virus therapy, including in patients known to have used intravenous drugs. We're also making progress in advancing our triplet therapy for HCV infection, with presentations describing the efficacy of this combination across genotypes to be presented at the upcoming AASLD meeting.
But much of the excitement during the past quarter focused on KEYTRUDA, our PD-1-specific antibody for the treatment of malignant disease. As Ken and Adam mentioned, the FDA has just announced an updated label for KEYTRUDA, which includes our Keynote-010 study, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA is superior to traditional chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, including those patients whose tumors express PD-L1 in as few as 1% of cells. 
The revised label also includes our KEYNOTE-024 study, which was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings earlier this month and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In brief, KEYNOTE-024 was a randomized active comparator-controlled Phase III study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA, when used for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 and who lack mutations in the EGF receptor or ALK genes, is superior to traditional platinum-based chemotherapy of the type that has been the standard of care in this disease for more than 2 decades.
These data are important because KEYTRUDA treatment at a fixed dose of 200 milligrams every 3 weeks reduced the risk of tumor progression or death by 50% and reduce the overall risk of death by 40%. Moreover, KEYTRUDA treatment was associated with a lower rate of serious adverse effects than was observed in the chemotherapy treatment arm. We believe, as Bruce Johnson suggested in an accompanying editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, that KEYTRUDA will come to represent a new standard of care for appropriate lung cancer patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1, a population that represents between 25% to 30% of those presenting with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.  
Also in the third quarter, we received approval for the use of KEYTRUDA in lung cancer in the European Union, again, based on our KEYNOTE-010 data. Review of the KEYNOTE-024 study is ongoing by the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (sic) [Committee on Human Medicinal Products ] of the European Medicines Agency.
Beyond these very important results, during the third quarter, we also obtained a data from our KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with traditional platinum doublet-based chemotherapy to yield objective response rates far superior to what we've seen with chemotherapy alone. In this study, patients with metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors expressed any level of PD-L1 were enrolled provided they lacked EGF receptor or ALK gene mutations. Progression-free survival nearly doubled in the KEYTRUDA-containing treatment arm. The results of the study were published simultaneously in Lancet Oncology. 
While this was a Phase II study in a relatively small cohort, including just 123 patients, the results complement an earlier single-arm study employing the same combination regimen, which we presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology in June. Patients in that cohort achieved an objective response rate of 71%, and the objective response rate was 55% in Cohort G. Hence, there is reason to believe that combinations of traditional chemotherapeutic agents, perhaps acting through an immune-activation mechanism, will work in concert with KEYTRUDA to provide superior responses in advanced lung cancer patients in the future. Additional confirmatory studies, including our KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 studies are already underway.
Finally, last week, we announced that the independent data monitoring committee supervising our KEYNOTE-045 study in second-line urothelial cancer involving patients with relapsed or refractory bladder or related uroepithelial cancer recommended that the study be stopped on the basis of improved overall survival in the KEYTRUDA treatment arm. KEYNOTE-045 is a Phase III active comparator-controlled monotherapy study in a very sick patient population. However, the results obtained in this setting mimic results from the first-line KEYNOTE-052 study that we presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting earlier this month, which showed impressive response rates on the treatment of urothelial malignancies. In sum, KEYTRUDA is changing the cancer treatment landscape, already approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma, second-line non-small cell lung cancer, first-line non-small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, for which we obtained FDA approval in August, we obtained what we believe to be registration-worthy data in urothelial cancer, have more than 30 registration-appropriate studies underway, have developed data supporting the activity featured in 22 different malignancies and have more than 360 clinical studies currently underway, including more than 200 combination studies evaluating responses in more than 30 different tumor types. Needless to say, we anticipate additional regulatory filings in the fourth quarter and, of course, in 2017.
Finally, I note that we are making good progress in our diabetes programs. Our insulin glargine filing was accepted for review by the FDA, and with our colleagues at Pfizer, we expect to file for approval of ertugliflozin as monotherapy and as a fixed-dose combination with metformin or with sitagliptin before the end of the year.
Now I'll turn the call back to Teri."

You could argue that doing a bigger deal now runs a risk of disrupting the focus that you'll need on immuno-oncology, for example. And kind of related to that, can you give us some idea of the upper limit to deals you might be considering? Is everything on the table? Or are you looking more at mid-sized deals or smaller? And then second question is on KEYTRUDA and IDO and the timing for making a possible go, no-go decision for Phase III in lung cancer.

We are always mindful of competition, and we want to make sure we do everything we can to get as much utilization -- appropriate utilization, obviously, for the indication that we have as quickly as possible and to really cement our product, KEYTRUDA, as foundational in the treatment of first-line lung cancer. With regard to second-line lung, right now, we have about a 10% market share of the second-line lung market in the United States. But if you look at patients that have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%, that's where the majority of our market share is, and our market share is much, much higher in that group. With the new data that we have in first-line lung in a new indication, there's no doubt that PD-L1 testing will become standard. We're already seeing very significant increases in PD-L1 testing since the ESMO meeting. So I believe that the barrier of needing to be tested in second-line for PD-L1 will be removed to a very large degree. And the fact that we now have an indication for all PD-L1-positive patients in the second-line setting, I believe that we should be a leader in not just first line but second line as well over time."

Standing back from this, I think one has to be impressed by the general efficacy of combinations of KEYTRUDA with other agents. And that's true with respect to PD-1 blockade and other agents preclinically but also clinically. So if you look at combinations, for example, with immuno-active agents like TVEC, there's impressive evidence of activity. There's evidence of activity with other immunologic agents but there's also, as we've talked about, very impressive combination activity with chemotherapy. And in a way, the 021G results in lung cancer basically put a floor on what to expect from these combinations. At a minimum, you're going to have to see the kinds of response rates and progression-free survival results that we've seen in 021G. Keep in mind, that study, as you know, is just 123 patients and, nevertheless, a highly significant result with respect to progression-free survival. Over time, we'll see if an overall survival result is obtained there. Across the -- crossover is so large in those populations, it may not be possible see it. But I think that there is reason to believe that KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with a lot of things, and oncologists have a lot of experience using traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. So there's reason to believe that those kinds of combinations will work well. That said, one shouldn't discount other kinds of immunologic combinations, including combinations with CTLA-4-directed agents. We've done those studies and shown that there is activity for those combinations. The question is ultimately what provides the best balance in terms of therapeutic efficacy and safety and tolerability. It's early days. It will take some time to sort that out, but we'll be pursuing all of those things and we are."

So the collaboration with NanoString is designed to obtain better -- really better diagnostic mechanisms because we know that PD-L1 expression is an imperfect biomarker. That said, the NanoString test does not exclude PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression is an indicator of an inflammatory response because the PD-L1 transcriptional unit is under the control of cytokines like gamma interferon (sic) [  interferon-gamma ], and wherever there's an immune response, you'll see PD-L1 upregulation. Much of the NanoString signature involves other genes that are similarly regulated. So it isn't the case that the NanoString test will look totally different from a PD-L1 test. It will just have a better receiver/operator characteristics. So that you have better sensitivity and specificity. So I guess we continue to refine that signature. It has -- it's working quite well actually, but it will take a while before we can actually reduce it to practice."

I'll focus first on the U.S. because the dynamics are a little bit different in some other markets in the world. But in the United States, about 60% of physicians are testing PD-L1. This was prior to",419,"Okay. So let me address the questions on PD-L1 testing. I'll focus first on the U.S. because the dynamics are a little bit different in some other markets in the world. But in the United States, about 60% of physicians are testing PD-L1. This was prior to ESMO. We don't have any new data on that percentage after ESMO. At the same time, we estimated that about 40% of non-small cell lung cancer new patients were being tested prior to ESMO. I get weekly data. And it's not perfect, but you can certainly see a trend break, where there's a significant increase in the number of patients that are being tested for PD-L1 as -- right after ESMO data was released. So I expect the numbers I just provided you will increase significantly. But I think it's important to remember that even if you look at EGFR testing, it took a while for that to become standard, and even today, after years, about 80% to 85% of patients are routinely tested. So I think there's probably a ceiling of somewhere between 80% to 85% of PD-L1 testing that will occur over time. But with that said, it does take a little while to ramp up, albeit it's ramping up faster. If you look at the length of time it takes to be tested, it's about the same as all other testing for lung cancer. So if a physician asks for PD-L1 testing, they can get it back within a week, typically as fast as they can get ALK testing or EGFR testing. So it's very fast. In terms of the way it comes back to physicians, it's not always consistent. Different labs and in academic institutions, they may give it differently. But right now, most of them come back with a number, that there's PD-L1 55% or 48% as opposed to just a positive or a negative sign. And we think that, that's the way it will probably continue over time. We're seeing it in academic hospitals, but we're also seeing much more utilization even outside of those academic centers as well. With regard to biosimilar opportunity, the bottom line is that we think it is a real commercial opportunity. It's not our strategy. Our strategy remains on innovation. But with $40 billion on a global basis of drugs that are biologics going off patent or at least biosimilars being able to enter the market over the next 5 years, we think there's a real opportunity for us commercially."

And far too often, when people present with lung cancer, it is already at a quite advanced stage. And the question of how to give those people the greatest possible benefit, whether they will choose to use chemotherapy combinations, obviously, these are approved drugs, I don't know. But certainly, I've heard physicians discuss that. They wanted to discuss that with me and with others. So I think there is some consideration of that kind of issue. I think in the population of individuals who are -- who have significant comorbidities, of course, the generally more favorable tolerability of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy will drive decision-making."

And there's new in-class competitors that have had significant discounts, and every year, the rebates and discounts have increased. And the same will be true in '17. But at the same time, with our strong position in terms of market share and our ability to grow our demand, in particular TRx volume, we've been able to offset most of the pricing pressures with the increase in demand. So I think that 2017, of course, will be more pressure than '16, but we're optimistic as we move into the year."

So I was wondering if you could characterize a bit more your base case for what you see the ramp is into first line given the level of PD-L1 testing you're seeing already. Should we expect a fast ramp into the 4Q? Is there a warehouse of patients ready to get on therapy? And then given the exclusion criteria in 024, so brain met, autoimmune, EGFR, ALK, et cetera, should we think about the real-world addressable population of KEYNOTE-024 as perhaps lower than the 25%, 30% of first-line lung that has PD-L1 expression? Or does that number bake in the excluded patients [ph]? And then quickly, are there any interims built into the Phase III KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 chemo combo studies that have the potential to stop early? So do we have a sense for when those may be? And then briefly on ZEPATIER, can you characterize what you're seeing out there in terms of discounting? And is discounting increasing? And then you mentioned that new formulary position will take into effect in January of next year. I was wondering if those are parity contracts. Or are there any exclusive contracts there?"

That's when they would be considered for utilization for KEYTRUDA. So I would not expect a big bolus that would come into the marketplace in fourth quarter. It's going to be new patient by new patient. Over a year in the United States, Japan and the EU, there's about 250,000 patients that are new patients with non-small cell lung cancer. And based on everything that we've seen, we believe that 25% to 30% is the right number for you to think about as we look at those patients in the marketplace. And then the last thing I'd say is if you look at ZEPATIER, as I mentioned on previous calls, the marketplace had very significant discounting that was occurring. In fact, the pressure on the rebates and discounts before we even launched into the market was very significant. Despite that, we feel like we've gotten good formulary access. We're doing very well in the VA, Medicare Part D, also in some commercial plans, particularly in the regional plans. As we look at 2017, beginning of January, we do have some new contracts. Many of them are at parity, but I think there will be 1 or 2 that we'll be able to discuss in not-too-distant future, where we will have a preferred position."

First of all, we've had price increases similar to the price increases that we've had in the past. So you haven't seen any difference or acceleration per se. But you also have to realize that the 9-valent is -- costs a bit more than the 4-valent, and most of the patients are moving to the 9-valent vaccine. So I'd net the price increase plus the difference in price between those 2, the 4-valent and the 9-valent. The thing that is hard for us to understand right now is, if you have 2 doses, will the doses be given in the same year? Or for example, if a person presents themselves in August before back-to-school, do they get 1 dose next year in August but they don't get the second dose until the following year in August? So there's still some things that we're going to have to wait to see in terms of how physicians treat those patients. Some might get the first dose in January, the second dose in July or August. Some might just get August dose, the one, and then the following year, the second dose. So there's certainly going to be an impact. The magnitude right now, we can't be certain of. And if you look at the sales by indication, just to give you a rough amount, about 50% to 55% of our sales were melanoma, about 25% or so was in lung, 5% or so was in head and neck cancer. This is for the U.S. specifically. And then the rest was in all other."

And where are we with -- in front line -- how many docs -- or how much of that testing is for PD-1? And again, I know we've been trying to get a sense for time line, but can you elaborate a little bit longer on how long that's going to take for the market to be prepared to -- for a large penetration of KEYTRUDA in front line just given that PD-1 testing is probably in its early stages? But if you can elaborate on that. And also, Roger, just on the compendia listing issue for KEYNOTE-021, which we learned, was rejected. There was a lot of enthusiasm expressed about that at ESMO.

First of all, I want to be clear on the 60% number that I provided. What I said was approximately 60% of U.S. physicians are testing for PD-L1, not that 60% of patients are being tested.

What I said was approximately 60% of U.S. physicians are testing for PD-L1, not that 60% of patients are being tested. So right now, if you look at the physicians across the U.S. that treat lung cancer, we believe about 60% of them test at least sometimes for PD-L1. We also believe that about 40% of non-small cell lung cancer new patients are being tested for PD-L1. So that should give you a better idea of what's happening prior to ESMO. Since ESMO, I don't have updates to these numbers because it takes time to have these updated, but I do see a very significant increase in the total number of tests that are being ordered for PD-L1. I don't believe that there's any rate-limiting ability of the labs or the institutions to do the testing, so that's not the issue. The question is how quickly will physicians adopt testing for all patients. And the reason I cap that at about 80% to 85% is because, even today, for EGFR testing, we see only about 80% to 85% of patients that are treated. So if we're at 40%, the cap is at 80%, the question is how fast can we go from 40% to the 80% or 85%. And that's what we're working on. With regard to ramp-up for lung, there's not going to be a bolus of patients. The 250,000 patients in the top 7 markets around the world come in throughout the entire year. And the question will be, as they come in, how quickly will they be put on to KEYTRUDA if they have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%."

Now other things could change, but I think what we would expect is that with the availability of KEYNOTE-189 and others, there'll be the opportunity to pursue it -- presuming that those data are actually confirmatory, to pursue labeling for that.

I think what our past experience has been is we've tried to look for those deals where we believe we're going to get scientific assets going forward. And if we can get good assets that are in the marketplace now, that's something that we would be willing to do. But I don't think I can say categorically that we wouldn't take the kind of deal that has a concentration in one product versus another. Obviously, concentration is one of the factors that you weigh when you think about the risk inherent in a deal. As it relates to pricing, we also are very concerned about the whole issue of pricing and affordability for patients. It's a significant one. It's been amplified in this year's political season. We find it unfortunate that a lot of times, the focus is on affordability and pricing rather than the long-term benefit that these therapies provide. So from our perspective, we think that going forward, we don't think these environmental pricing pressures will ease. And that's why we continue to focus on our strategy of investing in innovative R&D for products like KEYTRUDA because we think those are the kinds of products that will help Merck weather some of the pricing risks and pricing pressures that we will be facing as an industry going forward."

And of course, that's a traditional problem in the development of chemotherapeutic agents and the reason why progression-free survival has been accepted as an endpoint in a variety of different tumor types. On the other hand, chemotherapy is active, and for individuals whose disease is controlled by chemotherapy, then the crossover will inherently occur later. Because we believe that KEYTRUDA provides a more durable benefit to patients with lung cancer, and the data from that are clear across a variety of tumor types, under those circumstances, I would expect separation for overall survival. And as I indicated, it's a fairly complicated set of equations to try and estimate what that's going to look like. I think we probably have to wait for the data."
