Given the amount of information we are going to cover on this call, we are happy to extend the Q&A a few minutes as needed to ensure you get your questions in. In a minute, I'll take you through the 2016-2017 o",2119,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone. Given the amount of information we are going to cover on this call, we are happy to extend the Q&A a few minutes as needed to ensure you get your questions in. In a minute, I'll take you through the 2016-2017 outlook and plan but before I do so, let me touch briefly on the fourth quarter.
Clearly, the difficult environment that began midsummer continued through the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding that, Equity Sales & Trading and Investment Banking was strong, and wealth management and investment management was solid. We acted on those things within our control by initiating a major restructuring of FICC; conducting a large reduction in force in December; reducing our compensation-to-revenue ratio; launching a large-scale firm-wide expense initiative, more on that later; significantly reducing RWAs and FICC to $136 billion, well below our target of $180 billion; and closing the sale of our oil merchanting business. Finally, we put in place the leadership team drive forward over the next several years.
On that, I look forward to having join me as our President. He brings highly complementary skills and will help take this firm to the next level. The previous appointments of Ted Pick as Global Head of Sales and Trading, as Head of Investment Management and John Pruzan as CFO are hard evidence of our deep and talented bench. Finally, Smith will run Fixed Income and Commodities, working for Ted.
In light of these changes, it was expected that Greg Fleming would pursue opportunities away from Morgan Stanley. We thank Greg for all he has done and wish him well for the future. Our bench and wealth management is particularly strong. Andy Saperstein and Shelley O'Connor have over 40 years experience in that business. Shelley previously ran the field organization, a position Andy also previously held as well as running products. Colin will help oversee wealth management, and of course, it is a business I have a very long history in. 
Building a first-class leadership team is among my most important responsibilities. I'm delighted we made these decisions and look forward to a period of stability with this team. Now our entire focus is on driving results. 
Please, if you will, turn to the slides that you can find on the Investor Relations website. After I go through these, John will take you through the quarter in more detail then we'll both take your questions.
Let's start with Slide #3. As you can see, as a result of many changes, our business makes us much more balanced with complementary franchises in the Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. 
In our Institutional Securities business, we've maintained our leadership positions in investment banking and Equity Sales & Trading as illustrated on Slide 4. In Equity Sales & Trading, we are first among global peers as of the third quarter year-to-date. We've built on the momentum of recent years under the leadership of and Ted with full year revenues ex DVA of $8.1 billion, up 18% year-over-year. In banking, we continue to see strength and finished second in global announced M&A and #1 in IPOs.
Slide 5 recaps what we laid out last year and our results. In Wealth Management, we achieved a full year profit margin of 22%, with pretax earnings of $3.3 billion, a record for this business. We expect to see further growth in Wealth Management.
We grew our U.S. bank's net interest income by 46% year-over-year in a flat rate environment. However, in Fixed Income and Commodities, we failed to improve on our financial results. While we've been reshaping FICC for several years, the volatile and shrinking revenue pool, coupled with the steady increasing capital requirements, led us to take further significant action at year-end. Through our recently announced FICC restructuring, we will better align the capital and resources committed to the business with the opportunity we see.
Through the year, our funding costs benefited from the realization of our funding tailwind as the debt we issued was at much tighter spreads than the post-crisis debt that matured. We'll continue to see benefit from the associated going forward.
We maintained our focus on expense management and achieved a full year ISG compensation ratio ex DVA of 37%, below our stated goal of 39% or less. And finally, we increased our common dividend by 50% and increased our annual buyback from $1 billion to $2.5 billion. We intend to further increase capital returns to shareholders in the years ahead, subject, of course, to regulatory approval.
As you can see on Page 6, our ROE for 2015, excluding DVA and the discrete tax benefits, were 7% on a capital base of $67 billion. We remain committed to our 10% ROE target. Obviously, that cap is a function of both earnings and equity.
On Slide 7, we lay out the key elements of our plan for achieving returns of 10% or greater. These include: capital sufficiency, expense efficiency, Wealth Management revenue growth and capital returns to shareholders. These, of course, are in addition to the continued improvements across Institutional Securities and Investment Management. 
Since 2012, we have made significant progress in derisking our balance sheet on planned assets. This is shown on Slide 8. We continue to accrete common equity despite continued increase in capital returns to shareholders. We believe our robust equity base, coupled with the derisked balance sheet and a transformed business mix, provides a strong foundation to support our current plan.
As shown on Slide 9, our pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.1% and pro forma supplementary leverage ratio of 5.8% are well in excess of their prospective requirements. Building a very strong capital base has been a critical part of our strategy, as evidenced by our ratios. By comparison, in the first quarter of 2014, our pro forma Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under the advanced approach was 11.6%, and our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio was just 4.2%. 
We await clarification on the impact and timing of the GSIB buffer and CCAR. When that clarity is provided, we will be -- we believe we will be near the end of supervisory changes, and therefore, our capital is appropriately sized to support our business going forward.
Turning to Fixed Income and Commodities on Slide 10. Notwithstanding considerable efforts to reduce the capital required to support FICC, further regulatory changes in recent years and a prolonged difficult environment led us to believe that much more radical actions were necessary. We have reset the long-term RWA target for FICC at $110 billion and are setting our SLR exposure target of $250 billion. As a result, we're confident that going forward, this business will require $5 billion to $8 billion less capital. Over time, where possible, excess capital will be returned to shareholders.
On Slide 11, we give more details on the FICC restructuring. Given the cyclical, and in some cases, structural challenges facing Fixed Income, driven by the work and Ted did at the end of last year, we took the decision to downsize headcount by 25%, along with our ongoing balance sheet and capital focus. We took this action alongside the recent installation of a new management team, with the objective of credibly size -- credible sizing of the business going forward. 
Our emphasis will be where we have traditional strengths. We have competitive advantages in macro products, specifically in corporate credit connecting to our Investment Banking franchise as well as the mortgage product and in macro products such as structured rates and certain FX products, which we will appropriately resource. 
Even closer integration with equities in banking with an Institutional Securities and in partnership with Wealth Management against our core client base will allow us to enhance asset velocity and ultimately optimize wallet. 
Now let's turn to expense discipline, beginning on Slide 12. As a management team, our #1 priority is to control what we can control, given market realities. In ISG, we previously set our compensation target of 39% and finished the year at approximately 37%, partly a function of having fewer employees to support the business. We intend to stay at or below 37% in ISG and have also set 2017 targets for Wealth Management and Investment Management.
Turning to Slide 13. In addition to our focus on compensation discipline, we've launched a major company-wide initiative called Project Streamline, an effort led by our, CFO John Pruzan and COO Jim Rosenthal, which is designed to identify and implement significant infrastructure expense reductions by the end of 2017. Some of these initiatives are shown here. 
Now is the time to tackle head-on our infrastructure costs and maximize low-cost deployment of talent. We have too many entities, too much duplication of operations and processes and too many employees based in high-cost centers doing work that can sensibly be done in lower-cost centers. You will hear a lot more about Project Streamline in the coming quarters.
The combination of these efforts will enable us to meaningfully improve our efficiency ratio as shown on Slide 14. Our target expense ratio ex DVA in 2015 was 79% and we ended the year at 77%. Expense management is critically important. As such, we've set a new target ratio of 74% in 2017, which translates into $1 billion in expense reductions over the next 2 years. In setting this efficiency ratio, we have assumed flat revenues for 2016 and 2017. To be clear, we do not expect the revenue environment to apply, especially given ongoing growth initiatives like lending and wealth management. However, we believe this assumption is appropriately conservative.
Now let's turn to Wealth Management on Slide 15. We continue to see strong high-quality loan demand on our Wealth Management client base. We've significantly reduced client penetration and increased client penetration in security space lending and residential lending over the last 3 years. But we remain substantially underpenetrated relative to our peers. 
For example, only 1.9% of our clients have a mortgage loan through Morgan Stanley. Increased penetration of all loans will drive $20 billion of lending growth through 2017. A highly scalable business like Wealth Management enables us to add sources of revenue with lower compensation payouts such as net interest growth. 
Slide 16 aggregates the medium-term opportunities in Wealth Management. To provide granularity, we lay out 3 areas where we see obvious potential in margin improvement, assuming stable markets. From today's level of 22%, we see margin potential of 23% to 25% in 2017 through one, loan and deposit growth; two, expense discipline; and three, normal course of business growth.
In addition, it's worth reminding investors that when we completed the Smith Barney transaction, we've put in place a retention program that amortize over 9 years. That amortization will be completed in January 2019 and will add an additional 150 basis points of margin.
Now let's turn to Slide 17. As I've said earlier, we believe we are sufficiently capitalized. Subject to regulatory approval, we intend to increase our payout to shareholders in the coming years just as we've done in the last 4 years.
Let me now turn to Slide 18, the final slide. This sets forth ROE targets for 2017. Over the past several years, our returns have been depressed by very high litigation expenses and penalties; the need to build a strong capital base, resulting in material capital growth every year; the cost of integration of the largest acquisition in Wealth Management history; the challenging Fixed Income markets against which we've carried outsized capital levels; the restructuring of our merchant bank; and of course, the enormous cost and capital brought about by the post-crisis regulatory environment.
We see the next several years very differently. We've identified $1 billion of tangible expense savings. We believe the bank's strategy will be a significant driver of earnings growth in Wealth Management and for the firm. We expect equities and IBD to remain strong and grow revenues, assuming global economic growth. And we believe Investment Management is now positioned for growth. 
Most importantly, we believe our capital is strong and our ongoing balance sheet reductions will free up more capital for distribution, or where that is not possible, reinvestment into our higher return businesses. As a result, we are setting a 2017 ROE target of 9% to 11%. This assumes no material new capital requirements, no outsized new litigation expenses or penalties and a global economy that evidences growth, not turmoil. Either way, in a flat revenue environment, we will reduce run rate expenses by $1 billion on an annual basis beginning in 2017. 
Let me now turn to John who'll briefly touch on the fourth quarter, then together, we will take all of your questions."

Good morning. I will keep my comments brief so we have ample time for Q&A. The fourth quarter of 2015 proved to be a continuation of the third quarter in many ways, with mid-quarter volatility and macro concerns driving clients to the sidelines after relatively constructive markets early in the quarter. 
In a volatile environment, we benefited from the strength of our Equities, Investment Banking and Wealth Management businesses. Against this backdrop, revenues were $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter or $7.9 billion excluding DVA, up 7% versus 3Q '15. Noninterest expenses for the quarter were $6.3 billion. 
Our effective tax rate was 34.5% for the quarter, driven by our geographic mix of earnings throughout the year. For the full year 2015, our tax rate, excluding the discrete tax benefits from the first quarter, was 32.5%.
Now to the businesses. In a challenging environment for some of our institutional security businesses, overall revenues ex DVA, were $3.5 billion, up 2% quarter-on-quarter. Noninterest expense was down 11% versus the third quarter. Compensation expenses were $1.2 billion, down 7% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding DVA, the ISG compensation ratio was down for the quarter, which brought our full year ratio to 37%. Non-compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 13%, driven by lower litigation costs.
In Investment Banking, continued strength in our M&A business and better performance in equity underwriting helped to offset weakness in debt underwriting. For the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in revenues, up 3% sequentially. Advisory revenues for the quarter were strong at $516 million but down 7% from the post-2008 high we achieved last quarter.
Turning to underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $352 million, up 41% versus the third quarter, primarily reflecting increases in IPOs. We continue to see pressure from volatility in Fixed Income underwriting volumes, and revenues were $346 million, down 7% versus the third quarter, driven by decreases in loan fees, partially offset by investment grade bond fees.
The fourth quarter was a continuation of the strength we have seen all year in equity sales and trading as clients remained active, and we delivered across products and regions in a volatile market. Ex DVA, revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, up 3% sequentially. 
For the quarter, cash equity revenues were higher versus comparable quarters as we gained share across regions. Our Prime Brokerage business continued to demonstrate leadership, with revenues up quarter-over-quarter as we stayed closely engaged with our clients. 
Derivative revenues were down quarter-over-quarter against challenging market conditions but up year-over-year. Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading continued to underperform in a difficult environment, characterized by spread widening in various products and lower levels of client activity. For the quarter, revenues were $550 million, excluding DVA, down 6% versus the third quarter. 
Revenues in securitized products and credit continued to be negatively impacted by the environment. Rates revenues in the quarter were up sequentially while FX was down, driven by lower market volatility and lower client engagement. 
Commodity results were down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by our oil merchanting business. We closed the sale of this business on November 1. Given the sale of our 2 large physical oil businesses, we would expect to see less seasonality in our first quarter FICC results going forward. Lastly, average trading VaR for the quarter was $46 million, down from $53 million last quarter, driven by a reduction in interest rates and credit spread as well as commodities.
In our Wealth Management business, we continued to see steadiness. For the quarter and for the full year 2015, we saw average revenues per day of approximately $60 million, with no day below $50 million. Revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of deferred compensation plan investments in both periods, revenues were approximately flat sequentially.
In the quarter, we continued to benefit from our deposit deployment strategy, with net interest income increasing 4% from the third quarter and full year net interest income of $3 billion, up 26%. Funded lending balances in Wealth Management grew approximately $3 billion or 6% during the quarter and $12 billion or 31% year-over-year. 
Growth in NII helped to offset some of the quarter's headwinds, including the 5% decline in Asset Management revenues, which was a function of the third quarter's lower S&P level. We continue to see muted overall activity in transaction revenues, excluding the impact of DCP.
On the expense side, compensation was up 6% quarter-over-quarter due largely to the offsetting impact of the expense associated with the DCP investment gains mentioned earlier. Non-compensation expenses were up 6%, driven by typical 4Q seasonality. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 21% ex severance, down slightly versus 3Q '15, though up year-on-year. For the full year, PBT margin was 22% in Wealth Management. 
Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were $149 billion at year-end, up $10 billion versus the third quarter, reflecting normal seasonality in deposits as well as clients moving to cash in a volatile market. In Investment Management, revenues were $621 million, up significantly quarter-over-quarter, driven by Traditional Asset Management, which was up 5% as well as stronger performance in Merchant Banking and Real Estate Investing, where revenues were $211 million versus a loss in the third quarter. 
Performance in Investment Management will be impacted by the market levels and backdrop. So far this quarter, market indices around the globe are down, with many off to their worst start in history. If they remain down for the rest of the quarter, we will see an impact in Investment Management performance, particularly in our private investing businesses.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $788 billion at December 31, down from $834 billion at the end of the third quarter. Average balance sheet was $814 billion, down from $827 billion in 3Q as clients moved to the sidelines and activity slowed, particularly in the second half of the quarter. Our global liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $203 billion compared with $191 billion at the end of the third quarter, driven by typical seasonality in deposits.
Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $397 billion, down from $434 billion in the third quarter, driven by reductions in market RWAs and a slower client environment. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 19 million shares, and our board declared a $0.15 dividend per share. For the full year, we repurchased $2.1 billion of common stock or 59 million shares.
Turning to outlook. In the first 2 weeks, we have seen a significant rise in volatility across markets and asset classes and an intense focus on the China economy, market and currency as well as declining oil prices. We have had a reasonable start in sales and trading as clients have been engaged as they try and navigate this period of volatility and keep their risk positions close to home. 
M&A has remained active. We are cautious, however, as prolonged volatility is not conducive to M&A activity. The underwriting calendar has been challenged. The capital markets pipeline is healthy but market volatility could delay new issues coming to market. And on the retail side, clients remain cautious. It's way too early to predict how the rest of the quarter unfolds, and we are tightly managing our risk positions, along with our clients. With that, we will open the line to questions."

And going back, I seem to remember a number of $392 billion or thereabouts in around third quarter 2011 in FICC. So we're light years from that. And last year, we thought we'd achieved $180 billion, and as you can see, we ended materially lower than that. On the exact timing of year-end and the trajectory year-end 2017, I can't really help you. We're going to do it opportunistically. We'll deal with sort of minimum damage. We don't want to get rid of assets on a distressed basis. We have some natural rolloff. So we feel very comfortable with these targets, and it's fair to say we haven't disappointed in the last few years. That hasn't been our issue in FICC. As it relates to the capital, we're just arithmetically, if you run these numbers through the models, it does actually free up that much capital. It just means the business doesn't need that capital. Our view is that we were over-capitalized, but our balance sheet was too big in the business, given the revenue and business opportunity. We now -- and we were over-expensed frankly by taking a 25% of the headcount and with that, the expenses on compensation, the Project Streamline that we're now working some of the infrastructure pieces by now reducing the RWAs and DSLR exposure, we will reduce the amount of capital tied up in that business. How that is redeployed is a really good question. Now obviously, over time, we expect we'll deliver that back to shareholders. That's the current plan. We don't control all of the pieces of the plan, we're a regulated institution. We have been through CCAR or SCAR, I think, 5 times. And every time a buyback or dividend, our request has been missed. It's fair to say that we'll continue buybacks and dividends. And where we can't use that capital are trapped capital for some period of time some of it may be, there are clearly other businesses that can use the capital sensibly. We have very high return businesses in both Investment Management and Wealth Management. Clearly, we can use the capital to support our growth in those businesses as indeed we've had very high returns in our equities franchise. So I don't know if that's helpful, but it's hard to lay out a more specific time line for the balance sheet and RWA runoff than what we've given you here with the end state and with the year-end 2017."

What we're doing is reducing the parts of Fixed Income where frankly, we didn't see the revenue opportunity over the last 12 and 24 months. We've always had, as we said in the call, we've always had a good micro business, a good credit business that remains good. We've been very good in the more sophisticated structured rates. We're reducing obviously our exposure in liquid rates. We've never been a major FX trader, and we're focused on the major currencies there, not the non-G10 currencies. And then regionally, we've sort of picked our shots through distressed and high-yield and various other places around the globe where we think we need to be over-emphasized relative [indiscernible] and net of it will be more of a U.S.-focused business, a slimmer business when it comes to some of the macro products.

But you'll note the midpoint of that range is indeed 10%. We're not backing off of the goals. In fact, for the first time, we've put a time line against it and as we laid out all the key drivers of that. Obviously, it's with the appropriate caveat, which you would expect, if we have a major outsized litigation expense or penalties that are unforeseen, if the markets completely collapse here, if we have no revenue growth, if the Fed responded very differently to our capital plans and what we tended, it gets harder. On the other side, if we have stronger revenue growth, we made our expense targets, we do our capital plan, we're confident about certainly about the range and target is the midpoint of that range."

At 4.2 [ph] supplemental leverage ratio, which was just, I think, the beginning of 2014, I'm looking to John, he's nodding 2014, clearly, we weren't there. When -- so problem number one has been solved. We've clearly got enough capital on any metric that you measure. Problem number two is been if you continue to accrete capital, what is the sensible buyback dividend of total payout ratio that you put against that? And then opportunity number three is as you reshape the business mix and move to less capital-intensive parts of the business, you, by definition, off more capital than you've had the day before you did that, what are you able to do with that capital? As to refer Brennan's question, this isn't going to happen tomorrow, Glenn. It's going to happen over as we said a couple of years, so it's not like we're going to have a pool of capital to give back tomorrow. But we are setting ourselves up for increasing returns over the next several years, at the same time make investments across the rest of the business. So I don't know if that helps you, but where it relates to the GSIB buffer, we know what that buffer is. What we don't know is how the Federal Reserve, through the CCAR process, is adjusting its models. Once they put the CCAR buffer, my understanding is there will be adjustments to the models, which will temper that buffer to create a net number, which is lower than the buffer for all the banks. That's my current understanding. Obviously, we have to see that play out. My understanding is the Federal Reserve have models, which were, by definition, harder than they probably would have had in normal circumstance. But that was driven by not having the GSIB buffer put in place. Now that it's in place, the models will be refined, and the net impact is what we'll be looking at. So the combined net impact of the GSIB buffer with these capital reductions from the balance sheet with the amount of capital we're accreting, we still accrete capital last year gives us a reasonably high degree of confidence here that we're going to be seeing increasing capital returns in the years ahead."

We have seen, on the energy complex, we have seen credit migration in that portfolio, and as a result, Glenn, we've increased our allowances. We've seen an increase in some of the negative that we take to our balance -- to our income statement as well as increasing our hedges. And we would expect that pressure on that portfolio to persist for a while. In terms of the total size of the portfolio, it's about $16 billion of both funded and unfunded. This is energy now. That's down from $17 billion in the third quarter. Of that $16 billion, I would say 60% is investment grade -- or excuse me, it's to investment-grade counterparties and only about 30% of that $16 billion is funded. Another focus area within the energy portfolio has really been around E&P. In terms of our statistics, that portfolio is about $4.4 billion. Broken down, $1.7 billion of that is funded to non-investment-grade borrowers and about $2.7 billion is still unfunded. That unfunded piece is about 2/3 to investment-grade borrowers. In terms of the reserves in the allowances, remember, of the $16 billion total energy book, approximately 60% of that is held for investment while 40% is fair value or held for sale. That other portion is marked to market and it primarily flows through our other revenue line in the ISG in terms of income statement and it's been marked to the current environment. We will continue to monitor that portfolio very closely. We regularly stress test it. We're watching for signs of contagion, and we're hedging accordingly and adjusting our hedges accordingly. So I think that's the color on the energy exposures on the event. Again, it's been -- we've seen disruption in that marketplace since August. It's primarily been focused in the single B part of the market. We have had a handful of loans that got caught in that dislocation in downdraft. But again, it is only a handful of loans, a few which we distributed in the fourth quarter and a few which we still hold. The losses related to both the syndicated loans as well as the ones that we still hold are also reflected in our fourth quarter results. The BB and investment-grade markets held in pretty well although the pricing has widened. We see investors wanting to put capital to work in that market but they are being more selective. They're looking at higher-quality names and extracting larger new concessions. But in terms of outlook, we continue to underwrite new commitments predominantly in the BB space and the investment-grade space and that reflects the current environment. So again, those 2 areas of energy and event, we've been highly focused on and containing and managing that position as best we can. Outside of that, we haven't really seen much contagion. Wealth Management book still stays -- looks pretty good. It remains stable, strong credit quality, no real changes in that. Those metrics, commercial real estate portfolio also haven't seen real signs of weakness."

And if we think about a backdrop where there's 4% annual revenue growth, a 74% efficiency ratio, 32% tax rate and flat preferreds and noncontrolling interest, it gets you to about $6 billion of net income to common. And if I even take just the low end of that 9%, 9% to 11% ROE range, the implied common equity is about $66 billion, which suggests payouts in excess of 100% over the next 2 years.

And what we've done here is to frame our investors because understandably, they want to know what is a realistic timeframe, just to Steven's question before, what is a realistic timeframe? How do the pieces add up mathematically to get you there? Are they believable? Are they possible? And we thought, Mike, it will be smart to lay what we think is a realistic timeframe. That kind of range 9% to 11% in 2017. The pieces are we are definitely taking out expenses. Some of them are in the bag, if you will, and some of them are going to be driven by management processes that we've put in place. We believe there is revenue growth across our many parts of our business over a 2-year period. And we believe we are sufficiently capitalized given the world that we operate in.

In the last several years, we couldn't have done that because we couldn't address some of the issues on the right-hand side of that slide."

There is the elevated legal expenses we incurred in the last several years, which we think is unlikely to be carried forward. There is restructuring we did, which frankly just changes the run rate of benefits, medical and the bonus pool for those individuals. And we've already initiated a major effort under the Project Streamlining some of those pieces begin this week. We started with changing our so-called contingent employees or our consultants in faraway markets where we've achieved the objective of what they've been put to work.

I think on the Investment Management question, the way I would try to think about it is there are basically 2 major components of how we make business in that -- how we make money in that business. One is just our fee revenues for managing money. And obviously, that's going to be a rate -- that's a rate times volume equation, so if a of money were managing goes down, that will be impacted by the markets that we're seeing. But that line is pretty stable. The second line, as you said, is the investment line. And when I refer to the investment line, I'm talking about the segment reporting we do in our supplement. That number was negative $235 million last quarter. We said that was predominantly driven by a reversal of carry in our Asia PE fund or funds. This quarter, it was $100 million. That return to a positive number was driven by all of our -- or most of our investment businesses, both private equity infrastructure and real estate so it's more balanced. We said in the third quarter when we took the reversal of carry that, that eliminated the vast majority -- or excuse me, the majority of carry that we have accrued in our Asia PE businesses. We obviously have a carry in other businesses, and that's disclosed in the Q. But the exposure certainly in Asia as been reduced and the fund that was under-stressed in the third quarter had no material changes this quarter. That was the first part of your question. I think the second on transactional revenues. Those numbers have been subdued. Clients are cautious. Whether that's a floor or not, it's hard to tell given the volatility, but we think that, that -- those numbers hopefully are stabilized."

This April, we'll be presenting a different cutoff dates when balance sheets are set and so on. So I don't really want to get into -- I know you didn't ask for specific projection on CCAR, but all we can do is put ourselves in a position where it's clear we have sufficient capital and any incremental changes we make to the business or any incremental earnings that we accrete, by definition, become excess capital.

That had been issued.

That process went out -- that process went on throughout the year. We obviously didn't refinance all the debt on day 1 so we'll continue to get the benefit from those funding savings as we annualize. And so that I think addresses question #1. And question #2 on the deposits, we will continue to grow our deposit base. I think what we would like to try to do this year in 2016 is try to optimize the deposits. We have different deposits that have different liquidity values. We think we can support the lending growth that we've highlighted in this strategy -- strategy deck without growing our deposit base. But clearly, that is the goal. And in 2017, that will be requirement to support our future lending growth. We've talked about some of the digital strategy and cash management products that we're rolling out.

In a minute, I'll take you through the 2016-2017 o",2138,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone. Given the amount of information we are going to cover on this call, we are happy to extend the Q&A a few minutes as needed to ensure you get your questions in. In a minute, I'll take you through the 2016-2017 outlook and plan. But before I do so, let me touch briefly on the fourth quarter.
Clearly, the difficult environment that began midsummer continued through the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding that, Equity Sales & Trading and Investment Banking were strong, and Wealth Management and Investment Management were solid. We acted on those things within our control by initiating a major restructuring of FICC; conducting a large reduction in force in December; reducing our compensation-to-revenue ratio; launching a large-scale firm-wide expense initiative, more on that later; significantly reducing RWAs and FICC to $136 billion, well below our target of $180 billion; and closing the sale of our oil merchanting business. Finally, we put in place the leadership team to drive the term [ph] forward over the next several years.
On that, I look forward to having Colm join me as our President. He brings highly complementary skills and will help take this firm to the next level. The previous appointments of Ted Pick as Global Head of Sales and Trading, Dan Simkowitz as Head of Investment Management and Jon Pruzan as CFO are hard evidence of our deep and talented bench. Finally, Sam Kellie-Smith will run Fixed Income & Commodities, working for Ted. In light of these changes in the business, [ph] it was expected that Greg Fleming will pursue opportunities away from Morgan Stanley. We thank Greg for all he has done and wish him well for the future.
Our bench in Wealth Management is particularly strong. Andy Saperstein and Shelley O'Connor have over 40 years experience in that business. Shelley previously ran the field organization, a position Andy also previously held, as well as running products. Colm will help oversee Wealth Management, and of course, it is a business I have a very long history in.
Building a first-class leadership team is among my most important responsibilities. I'm delighted we made these decisions and look forward to a period of stability with this team. Now our entire focus is on driving results.
Please, if you will, turn to the slides that you can find on the Investor Relations website. After I go through these, Jon will take you through the quarter in more detail then we'll both take your questions.
Let's start with Slide #3. As you can see, as a result of many changes, our business makes us much more balanced with complementary franchises in the Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management.
In our Institutional Securities business, we've maintained our leadership positions in Investment Banking and Equity Sales & Trading as illustrated on Slide 4. In Equity Sales & Trading, we are first among global peers as of the third quarter year-to-date. We've built on the momentum of recent years under the leadership of Colm and Ted with full year revenues ex DVA of $8.1 billion, up 18% year-over-year. In Banking, we continue to see strength and finished second in global announced M&A and #1 in IPOs.
Slide 5 recaps what we laid out last year and our results. In Wealth Management, we achieved a full year profit margin of 22%, with pretax earnings of $3.3 billion, a record for this business. We expect to see further growth in Wealth Management.
We grew our U.S. bank's net interest income by 46% year-over-year in a flat rate environment. However, in Fixed Income & Commodities, we failed to improve on our financial results. While we've been reshaping FICC for several years, the volatile and shrinking revenue pool, coupled with the steady increasing capital requirements, led us to take further significant action at year-end. Through our recently announced FICC restructuring, we will better align the capital and resources committed to the business with the opportunity we see.
Through the year, our funding costs benefited from the realization of our funding tailwind as the debt we issued was at much tighter spreads than the post-crisis debt that matured. We will continue to see benefit from the associated going forward.
We maintained our focus on expense management and achieved a full year ISG compensation ratio ex DVA of 37%, below our stated goal of 39% or less. And finally, we increased our common dividend by 50% and increased our annual buyback from $1 billion to $2.5 billion. We intend to further increase capital return to shareholders in the years ahead, subject, of course, to regulatory approval.
As we can see on Page 6, our ROE for 2015, excluding DVA and the discrete tax benefits, were 7% on a capital base of $67 billion. We remain committed to our 10% ROE target. Obviously, that cap is a function of both earnings and equity.
On Slide 7, we lay out the key elements of our plan for achieving returns of 10% or greater. These include: Capital sufficiency, expense efficiency, Wealth Management revenue growth and capital returns to shareholders. These, of course, are in addition to the continued improvements across Institutional Securities and Investment Management.
Since 2012, we have made significant progress in derisking our balance sheet on planned assets. This is shown on Slide 8. We continue to accrete common equity despite continued increase in capital returns to shareholders. We believe our robust equity base, coupled with the derisked balance sheet and a transformed business mix, provides a strong foundation to support our current plan.
As shown on Slide 9, our pro forma Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.1% and pro forma supplemental leverage ratio of 5.8% are well in excess of their prospective requirements. Building a very strong capital base has been a critical part of our strategy, as evidenced by our ratios. By comparison, in the first quarter of 2014, our pro forma Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under the advanced approach was 11.6%, and our pro forma supplemental leverage ratio was just 4.2%.
We await clarification on the impact and timing of the GSIB buffer and CCAR. When that clarity is provided, we will be -- we believe we will be near the end of supervisory changes, and therefore, our capital is appropriately sized to support our business going forward.
Turning to Fixed Income & Commodities on Slide 10. Notwithstanding considerable efforts to reduce the capital required to support FICC, further regulatory changes in recent years and a prolonged difficult environment led us to believe that much more radical actions were necessary. We have reset the long-term RWA target for FICC at $110 billion and are setting an SLR exposure target of $250 billion. As a result, we're confident that going forward, this business will require $5 billion to $8 billion less capital. Over time, where possible, excess capital will be returned to shareholders.
On Slide 11, we give more details on the FICC restructuring. Given the cyclical, and in some cases, structural challenges facing Fixed Income, driven by the work Colm and Ted did at the end of last year, we took the decision to downsize headcount by 25%, along with our ongoing balance sheet and capital focus. We took this action alongside the recent installation of a new management team, with the objective of credibly size -- credible sizing of the business going forward.
Our emphasis will be where we have traditional strengths. We have competitive advantages in micro products, specifically in corporate credit connecting to our Investment Banking franchise as well as the mortgage product, and in macro products such as structured rates and certain electronified FX products, which we will appropriately resource. Even closer integration with equities and banking within Institutional Securities and in partnership with Wealth Management against our core client base will allow us to enhance asset velocity and ultimately optimize wallet.
Now let's turn to expense discipline, beginning on Slide 12. As a management team, our #1 priority is to control what we can control given market realities. In ISG, we previously set our compensation target of 39% and finished the year at approximately 37%, partly a function of having fewer employees to support the business. We intend to stay at or below 37% in ISG and have also set 2017 targets for Wealth Management and Investment Management.
Turning to Slide 13. In addition to our focus on compensation discipline, we've launched a major company-wide initiative called Project Streamline, an effort led by our CFO Jon Pruzan and COO Jim Rosenthal, which is designed to identify and implement significant infrastructure expense reductions by the end of 2017. Some of these initiatives are shown here.
Now is the time to tackle head-on our infrastructure costs and maximize low-cost deployment of talent. We have too many legal entities, too much duplication of operations and processes and too many employees based in high-cost centers doing work that can sensibly be done in lower-cost centers. You will hear a lot more about Project Streamline in the coming quarters.
The combination of these efforts will enable us to meaningfully improve our efficiency ratio as shown on Slide 14. Our target expense ratio ex DVA in 2015 was 79% and we ended the year at 77%. Expense management is critically important. As such, we've set a new target ratio of 74% in 2017, which translates into $1 billion in expense reductions over the next 2 years. In setting this efficiency ratio, we have assumed flat revenues for 2016 and 2017. To be clear, we do not expect the revenue environment to apply, especially given ongoing growth initiatives like lending and wealth management. However, we believe this assumption is appropriately conservative.
Now let's turn to Wealth Management on Slide 15. We continue to see strong high-quality loan demand on our Wealth Management client base. We have significantly reduced client penetration -- increased client penetration in securities-based lending and residential lending over the last 3 years. But we remain substantially underpenetrated relative to our peers.
For example, only 1.9% of our clients have a mortgage loan through Morgan Stanley. Increased penetration of all loans will drive $20 billion of lending growth through 2017. A highly scalable business like Wealth Management enables us to add sources of revenue with lower compensation payouts such as net interest growth.
Slide 16 aggregates the medium-term opportunities in Wealth Management. To provide granularity, we lay out 3 areas where we see obvious potential in margin improvement, assuming stable markets. From today's level of 22%, we see margin potential of 23% to 25% in 2017 through one, loan and deposit growth; two, expense discipline; and three, normal course of business growth.
In addition, it's worth reminding investors that when we completed the Smith Barney transaction, we've put in place a retention program that amortized over 9 years. That amortization will be completed in January 2019 and will add an additional 150 basis points of margin.
Now let's turn to Slide 17. As I've said earlier, we believe we are sufficiently capitalized. Subject to regulatory approval, we intend to increase our payout to shareholders in the coming years just as we have done in the last 4 years.
Let me now turn to Slide 18, the final slide. This sets forth ROE targets for 2017. Over the past several years, our returns have been depressed by very high litigation expenses and penalties; the need to build a strong capital base, resulting in material capital growth every year; the cost of integration of the largest acquisition in Wealth Management history; the challenging fixed income markets against which we have carried outsized capital levels; the restructuring of our merchant bank; and of course, the enormous cost and capital brought about by the post-crisis regulatory environment.
We see the next several years very differently. We've identified $1 billion of tangible expense savings. We believe the bank's strategy will be a significant driver of earnings growth in Wealth Management and for the firm. We expect equities and IBD to remain strong and grow revenues, assuming global economic growth. And we believe Investment Management is now positioned for growth.
Most importantly, we believe our capital is strong and our ongoing balance sheet reductions will free up more capital for distribution or where that is not possible, reinvestment into our higher return businesses. As a result, we're setting a 2017 ROE target of 9% to 11%. This assumes no material or [ph] new capital requirements, no outsized new litigation expenses or penalties and a global economy that evidences growth, not turmoil. Either way, in a flat revenue environment, we will reduce run rate expenses by $1 billion on an annual basis beginning in 2017.
Let me now turn to Jon who'll briefly touch on the fourth quarter, then together, we will take all of your questions."

Good morning. I will keep my comments brief so we have ample time for Q&A. The fourth quarter of 2015 proved to be a continuation of the third quarter in many ways, with mid-quarter volatility and macro concerns, driving clients to the sidelines after relatively constructive markets early in the quarter. 
In a volatile environment, we benefited from the strength of our Equities, Investment Banking and Wealth Management businesses. Against this backdrop, revenues were $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter or $7.9 billion, excluding DVA, up 7% versus 3Q '15. Noninterest expenses for the quarter were $6.3 billion.
Our effective tax rate was 34.5% for the quarter, driven by our geographic mix of earnings throughout the year. For the full year 2015, our tax rate, excluding the discrete tax benefits from the first quarter, was 32.5%.
Now to the businesses. In a challenging environment for some of our institutional security businesses, overall revenues ex DVA, were $3.5 billion, up 2% quarter-on-quarter. Noninterest expense was down 11% versus the third quarter. Compensation expenses were $1.2 billion, down 7% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding DVA, the ISG compensation ratio was down for the quarter, which brought our full year ratio to 37%. Noncompensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 13%, driven by lower litigation costs.
In Investment Banking, continued strength in our M&A business and better performance in equity underwriting helped to offset weakness in debt underwriting. For the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in revenues, up 3% sequentially. Advisory revenues for the quarter were strong at $516 million but down 7% from the post-2008 high we achieved last quarter.
Turning to underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $352 million, up 41% versus the third quarter, primarily reflecting increases in IPOs. We continue to see pressure from volatility in Fixed Income underwriting volumes, and revenues were $346 million, down 7% versus the third quarter, driven by decreases in loan fees, partially offset by investment-grade bond fees.
The fourth quarter was a continuation of the strength we have seen all year in equity sales and trading as clients remained active and we delivered across products and regions in a volatile market. Ex DVA, revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, up 3% sequentially.
For the quarter, cash equity revenues were higher versus comparable quarters as we gained share across regions. Our Prime Brokerage business continued to demonstrate leadership, with revenues up quarter-over-quarter as we stayed closely engaged with our clients.
Derivative revenues were down quarter-over-quarter against challenging market conditions but up year-over-year. Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading continued to underperform in a difficult environment, characterized by spread widening in various products and lower levels of client activity. For the quarter, revenues were $550 million, excluding DVA, down 6% versus the third quarter.
Revenues in securitized products and credit continued to be negatively impacted by the environment. Rates revenues in the quarter were up sequentially while FX was down, driven by lower market volatility and lower client engagement.
Commodity results were down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by our oil merchanting business. We closed the sale of this business on November 1. Given the sale of our 2 large physical oil businesses, we would expect to see less seasonality in our first quarter FICC results going forward. Lastly, average trading VaR for the quarter was $46 million, down from $53 million last quarter, driven by a reduction in interest rates and credit spread as well as commodities.
In our Wealth Management business, we continued to see steadiness. For the quarter and for the full year 2015, we saw average revenues per day of approximately $60 million, with no day below $50 million. Revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of deferred compensation plan investments in both periods, revenues were approximately flat sequentially.
In the quarter, we continued to benefit from our deposit deployment strategy, with net interest income increasing 4% from the fourth -- third quarter and full year net interest income of $3 billion, up 26%. Funded lending balances in Wealth Management grew approximately $3 billion or 6% during the quarter and $12 billion or 31% year-over-year.
Growth in NII helped to offset some of the quarter's headwinds, including the 5% decline in Asset Management revenues, which was a function of the third quarter's lower S&P level. We continue to see muted overall activity in transactional revenues, excluding the impact of DCP.
On the expense side, compensation was up 6% quarter-over-quarter due largely to the offsetting impact of the expense associated with the DCP investment gains mentioned earlier. Noncompensation expenses were up 6%, driven by typical 4Q seasonality. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 21% ex severance, down slightly versus 3Q '15, though up year-on-year. For the full year, PBT margin was 22% in Wealth Management.
Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were $149 billion at year-end, up $10 billion versus the third quarter, reflecting normal seasonality in deposits as well as clients moving to cash in a volatile market. In Investment Management, revenues were $621 million, up significantly quarter-over-quarter, driven by Traditional Asset Management, which was up 5%, as well as stronger performance in Merchant Banking and Real Estate Investing, where revenues were $211 million versus a loss in the third quarter.
Performance in Investment Management will be impacted by the market levels and backdrop. So far this quarter, market indices around the globe are down, with many off to their worst start in history. If they remain down for the rest of the quarter, we will see an impact in Investment Management performance, particularly in our private investing businesses.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $788 billion at December 31, down from $834 billion at the end of the third quarter. Average balance sheet was $814 billion, down from $827 billion in 3Q as clients move to the sidelines and activity slowed, particularly in the second half of the quarter. Our global liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $203 billion compared with $191 billion at the end of the third quarter, driven by typical seasonality in deposits.
Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $397 billion, down from $434 billion in the third quarter, driven by reductions in market RWAs and a slower client environment. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 19 million shares, and our board declared a $0.15 dividend per share. For the full year, we repurchased $2.1 billion of common stock or 59 million shares.
Turning to outlook. In the first 2 weeks, we have seen a significant rise in volatility across markets and asset classes and an intense focus on the China economy, market and currency as well as declining oil prices. We have had a reasonable start in sales and trading as clients have been engaged as they try and navigate this period of volatility and keep their risk positions close to home.
M&A has remained active. We are cautious, however, as prolonged volatility is not conducive to M&A activity. The underwriting calendar has been challenged. The capital markets pipeline is healthy, but market volatility could delay new issues coming to market. And on the retail side, clients remain cautious. It's way too early to predict how the rest of the quarter unfolds, and we are tightly managing our risk positions along with our clients.
With that, we will open the line to questions."

And going back, I seem to remember a number of like $392 billion or thereabouts in around the third quarter 2011 in FICC. So we're light years from that. And last year, we thought we'd achieve $180 billion. And as you can see, we ended materially lower than that. On the exact timing of year-end and the trajectory year-end 2017, I can't really help you. We're going to do it opportunistically. We'll deal with sort of minimum damage. We don't want to get rid of assets on a distressed basis. We have some natural rolloff. So we feel very comfortable with these targets, and it's fair to say we haven't disappointed in the last few years. That hasn't been our issue in FICC. As it relates to the capital, we're just arithmetically, if you run these numbers through the models, it does actually free up that much capital. It just means the business doesn't need that capital. Our view is that we were overcapitalized, that our balance sheet was too big in the business, given the revenue and business opportunity. We now -- and we were overexpensed frankly by taking a 25% of the headcount and with that, the expenses on compensation, the Project Streamline that will now work on some of the infrastructure pieces by now reducing the RWAs and the SLR exposure. We will reduce the amount of capital tied up in that business. How that is redeployed is a really good question. Now obviously, over time, we expect we'll deliver that back to shareholders. That's the current plan. We don't control all of the pieces of that plan, we're a regulated institution. We have been through CCAR or SCAR, I think, 5 times. And every time we've asked for a buyback or dividend, our request has been missed. It's fair to say that we'll continue to ask for buybacks and dividends. And where we can't use that capital, if it's sort of trapped capital for some period of time, which some of it may be, there are clearly other businesses that can use the capital sensibly. We have very high return businesses in both Investment Management and Wealth Management. Clearly, we can use the capital to support our growth in those businesses as indeed, we've had very high returns in our Equities franchise. So I don't know if that's helpful, but it's hard to lay out a more specific time line for the balance sheet and RWA runoff than what we've given you here with the end state and with the year-end 2017."

So we don't think there's going to be great revenue diminution from this point, given where we finished 2015, which frankly, as we said and we're very candid about, was disappointing. What we're doing is reducing the parts of Fixed Income where frankly, we didn't see the revenue opportunity over the last 12 and 24 months. We've always had, as we said in the call, we've always had a good micro business, a good credit business that remains good. We've been very good in the more sophisticated structured rates. We're reducing, obviously, our exposure in liquid rates. We've never been a major FX trader, and we're focused on the major currencies there, not the non-G10 currencies. And then regionally, we've sort of picked our shots through distressed and high yield and various other places around the globe where we think we need to be overemphasized fairly relative to [indiscernible].

On the other side, if we have stronger revenue growth, we meet our expense targets, we do our capital plan, we're confident about certainly about the range and that target is the midpoint of that range."

At 4.2% supplemental leverage ratio, which was just, I think, the beginning of 2014, I'm looking at Jon, he's nodding, 2014, clearly, we weren't there. When -- so problem number one has been solved. We've clearly got enough capital on any metric that you measure. Problem number two has been if you continue to accrete capital, what is the sensible buyback dividend and total payout ratio that you would put against that? And then opportunity number three is as you reshape the business mix and move to less capital-intensive parts of the business, you, by definition, trade off more capital than you've had the day before you did that, what are you able to do with that capital? As to refer Brennan's question, this isn't going to happen tomorrow, Glenn. It's going to happen over, as we said, a couple of years, so it's not like we're going to have a pool of capital to give back tomorrow. But we are setting ourselves up for increasing returns over the next several years, at the same time as make investments across the rest of the business. So I don't know if that helps you. But where it relates to the GSIB buffer, we know what our buffer is. What we don't know is how the Federal Reserve, through the CCAR process, is adjusting its models. Once they put the CCAR buffering, my understanding is there will be adjustments to the models which will temper that buffer to create a net number, which is lower than the buffer for all of the banks. That's my current understanding. Obviously, we have to see that play out. My understanding is the Federal Reserve have models, which were, by definition, harder than they probably would have had in normal circumstance. But that was driven by not having the GSIB buffer put in place. Now that it's in place, the models will be refined and the net impact is what we'll be looking at. So the combined net impact of the GSIB buffer with these capital reductions from the balance sheet with the amount of capital we're accreting, we still accrete the capital last year, gives us a reasonably high degree of confidence here that we're going to be seeing increasing capital returns in the years ahead."

We have seen -- on the energy complex, we have seen credit migration in that portfolio, and as a result, Glenn, we've increased our allowances. We've seen an increase in some of the negative marks that we take through our balance -- through our income statement as well as increasing our hedges. And we would expect that pressure on that portfolio to persist for a while. In terms of the total size of the portfolio, it's about $16 billion of both funded and unfunded. This is energy now. That's down from $17 billion in the third quarter. Of that $16 billion, I would say 60% is investment grade -- or excuse me, to investment-grade counterparties and only about 30% of that $16 billion is funded. Another focus area within the energy portfolio has really been around E&P. In terms of our statistics, that portfolio is about $4.4 billion. Broken down, $1.7 billion of that is funded to non-investment-grade borrowers and about $2.7 billion is still unfunded. That unfunded piece is about 2/3 to investment-grade borrowers. In terms of the reserves in the allowances, remember, of the $16 billion total energy book, approximately 60% of that is held for investment, while 40% is fair value or held for sale. That other portion is mark to market and it primarily flows through our other revenue line in the ISG in terms of income statement and it's been marked to the current environment. We will continue to monitor that portfolio very closely. We regularly stress test it. We're watching for signs of contagion, and we're hedging accordingly and adjusting our hedges accordingly. So I think that's the color on the energy exposures on the event. Again, it's been -- we've seen disruption in that marketplace since August. It's primarily been focused in the single B part of the market. We have had a handful of loans that got caught in that dislocation in downdraft. But again, it is only a handful of loans, a few which we distributed in the fourth quarter and a few which we still hold. The losses related to both the syndicated loans as well as the ones that we still hold are also reflected in our fourth quarter results. The BB and investment-grade markets held in pretty well, although the pricing has widened. We see investors wanting to put capital to work in that market but they are being more selective. They're looking at higher-quality names and extracting larger new issue concessions. But in terms of outlook, we continue to underwrite new commitments, predominantly in the BB space and the investment-grade space and that reflects the current environment. So again, those 2 areas of energy and event, we've been highly focused on and containing and managing that position as best we can. Outside of that, we haven't really seen much contagion. Wealth Management book still stays -- looks pretty good. Remains stable, strong credit quality, no real changes in that. Those metrics, commercial real estate portfolio also haven't seen real signs of weakness."

But some of the early feedback that I just wanted to relay suggests that there's -- investors are struggling and quite candidly, we're struggling to reconcile the walk to the 9% to 11% ROE versus some of the different guidance components. And if we think about a backdrop where there's 4% annual revenue growth, a 74% efficiency ratio, 32% tax rate and flat preferreds and noncontrolling interest, it gets you to about $6 billion of net income to common. And if I even take just the low end of that 9% -- 9% to 11% ROE range, the implied common equity is about $66 billion, which suggest payouts in excess of 100% over the next 2 years.

When I took this job, our capital base was $40 billion. Today, it's $69 billion. We're in a tremendous E position and the challenge has been to get the R moving consistent with that rate of growth of the E. And what we've done here is to train up investors because understandably, they want to know what is a realistic time frame, just to Steven's question before, what is a realistic time frame? How did the pieces add up mathematically to get you there? Are they believable? Are they possible? And we thought, Mike, it will be smart to lay out what we think is a realistic time frame. That kind of range 9% to 11% in 2017. The pieces are we are definitely taking out expenses. Some of them are in the bag, if you will, and some of them are going to be driven by management processes that we've put in place. We believe there is revenue growth across many parts of our business over a 2-year period. And we believe, we are sufficiently capitalized given the world that we operate in. So if you add all those pieces together, putting it in terms of a target to help investors have a framework rather than open-ended seem to be the right transition point for Morgan Stanley. In the last several years, we couldn't have done that because we couldn't address some of the issues on the right-hand side of that slide."

There is the elevated legal expenses we incurred in the last several years, which we think is unlikely to be carried forward. There is the restructuring we did, which frankly just changes the run rate of your service benefits, medical and the bonus pool for those individuals. And we've already initiated a major effort under this Project Streamline and some of those pieces begin this week. We started with changing our so-called contingent employees or our consultants in faraway markets, where we've achieved the objective of what they've been put to work.

I think on the Investment Management question, the way I would try to think about it is there are basically 2 major components of how we make business in that -- how we make money in that business. One is just our fee revenues for managing money. And obviously, that's going to be a rate -- that's a rate times volume equation, so if the amount of money we're managing goes down, that will be impacted by the markets that we're seeing. But that line is pretty stable. The second line, as you said, is the investment line. And when I refer to the investment line, I'm talking about the segment reporting we do in our supplement. That number was negative $235 million last quarter. We said that was predominantly driven by a reversal of carry in our Asia PE fund or funds. This quarter, it was $100 million. That return to a positive number was driven by all of our -- or most of our investment businesses, both private equity infrastructure and real estate so it's more balanced. We said in the third quarter when we took the reversal of carry that, that eliminated the vast majority -- excuse me, the majority of carry that we have accrued in our Asia PE businesses. We obviously have a carry accrued in other businesses, and that's disclosed in the Q. But the exposure, certainly in Asia has been reduced and the fund that was under-stressed in that third quarter had no material changes this quarter. That was the first part of your question. I think the second on transactional revenues. Those numbers have been subdued. Clients are cautious. Whether that's a floor or not, it's hard to tell given the volatility, but we think that, that -- that those numbers hopefully are stabilized."

I think on the funding question, there's obviously a lot of components that go into those lines, including the size of our balance sheet, secured versus unsecured. What we said just to give you some -- to try to cuff it. We did about $21 billion of new unsecured last year, and those came in at rates that were significantly below where the historical, that had been issued. Our average maturity or WAM on our unsecured stack now is about 6 years, so we were sort of retiring 5-year debt and putting on slightly longer, but we saw our credit spreads were usually 100 tighter than where they were before. That process went out through -- that process went on throughout the year. We obviously didn't refinance all the debt on day 1 so we'll continue to get the benefit from those funding savings as we annualize. And so that I think addresses question number one. And question number two on the deposits, we will continue to grow our deposit base. I think what we would like to try to do this year in 2016 is try to optimize the deposits. We have different deposits that have different liquidity values. We think we can support the lending growth that we've highlighted in this strategy -- assuming in the strategy deck without growing our deposit base, but clearly, that is the goal. And in 2017, that will be a requirement to support our future lending growth. We've talked about some of the digital strategy and cash management products that we're rolling out. And that will support -- that will hopefully drive the deposit growth in 2017 and beyond."

Given the amount of information we are going to cover on this call, we are happy to extend the Q&A a few minutes as needed to ensure you get your questions in. In a minute, I'll take you through the 2016-2017 o",2135,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone. Given the amount of information we are going to cover on this call, we are happy to extend the Q&A a few minutes as needed to ensure you get your questions in. In a minute, I'll take you through the 2016-2017 outlook and plan. But before I do so, let me touch briefly on the fourth quarter.
Clearly, the difficult environment that began midsummer continued through the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding that, Equity Sales & Trading and Investment Banking were strong, and Wealth Management and Investment Management were solid. We acted on those things within our control by initiating a major restructuring of FICC; conducting a large reduction in force in December; reducing our compensation-to-revenue ratio; launching a large-scale firm-wide expense initiative, more on that later; significantly reducing RWAs and FICC to $136 billion, well below our target of $180 billion; and closing the sale of our oil merchanting business. Finally, we put in place the leadership team to drive the plan forward over the next several years.
On that, I look forward to having Colm join me as our President. He brings highly complementary skills and will help take this firm to the next level. The previous appointments of Ted Pick as Global Head of Sales and Trading, Dan Simkowitz as Head of Investment Management and Jon Pruzan as CFO are hard evidence of our deep and talented bench. Finally, Sam Kellie-Smith will run Fixed Income & Commodities, working for Ted. In light of these changes in the business, [ph] it was expected that Greg Fleming will pursue opportunities away from Morgan Stanley. We thank Greg for all he has done and wish him well for the future.
Our bench in Wealth Management is particularly strong. Andy Saperstein and Shelley O'Connor have over 40 years’ experience in that business. Shelley previously ran the field organization, a position Andy also previously held, as well as running products. Colm will help oversee Wealth Management, and of course, it is a business I have a very long history in.
Building a first-class leadership team is among my most important responsibilities. I'm delighted we made these decisions and look forward to a period of stability with this team. Now our entire focus is on driving results.
Please, if you will, turn to the slides that you can find on the Investor Relations website. After I go through these, Jon will take you through the quarter in more detail then we'll both take your questions.
Let's start with Slide #3. As you can see, as a result of many changes, our business mix is much more balanced with complementary franchises in the Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management.
In our Institutional Securities business, we've maintained our leadership positions in Investment Banking and Equity Sales & Trading as illustrated on Slide 4. In Equity Sales & Trading, we are first among global peers as of the third quarter year-to-date. We've built on the momentum of recent years under the leadership of Colm and Ted with full year revenues ex DVA of $8.1 billion, up 18% year-over-year. In Banking, we continue to see strength and finished second in global announced M&A and #1 in IPOs.
Slide 5 recaps what we laid out last year and our results. In Wealth Management, we achieved a full year profit margin of 22%, with pretax earnings of $3.3 billion, a record for this business. We expect to see further growth in Wealth Management.
We grew our U.S. bank's net interest income by 46% year-over-year in a flat rate environment. However, in Fixed Income & Commodities, we failed to improve on our financial results. While we've been reshaping FICC for several years, the volatile and shrinking revenue pool, coupled with the steady increasing capital requirements, led us to take further significant action at year-end. Through our recently announced FICC restructuring, we will better align the capital and resources committed to the business with the opportunity we see.
Through the year, our funding costs benefited from the realization of our funding tailwind as the debt we issued was at much tighter spreads than the post-crisis debt that matured. We will continue to see benefit from the associated going forward.
We maintained our focus on expense management and achieved a full year ISG compensation ratio ex DVA of 37%, below our stated goal of 39% or less. And finally, we increased our common dividend by 50% and increased our annual buyback from $1 billion to $2.5 billion. We intend to further increase capital return to shareholders in the years ahead, subject, of course, to regulatory approval.
As we can see on Page 6, our ROE for 2015, excluding DVA and the discrete tax benefits, were 7% on a capital base of $67 billion. We remain committed to our 10% ROE target. Obviously, that cap is a function of both earnings and equity.
On Slide 7, we lay out the key elements of our plan for achieving returns of 10% or greater. These include: Capital sufficiency, expense efficiency, Wealth Management revenue growth and capital returns to shareholders. These, of course, are in addition to the continued improvements across Institutional Securities and Investment Management.
Since 2012, we have made significant progress in derisking our balance sheet on flat assets. This is shown on Slide 8. We continue to accrete common equity despite continued increase in capital returns to shareholders. We believe our robust equity base, coupled with the derisked balance sheet and a transformed business mix, provides a strong foundation to support our current plan.
As shown on Slide 9, our pro forma Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.1% and pro forma supplemental leverage ratio of 5.8% are well in excess of their prospective requirements. Building a very strong capital base has been a critical part of our strategy, as evidenced by our ratios. By comparison, in the first quarter of 2014, our pro forma Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under the advanced approach was 11.6%, and our pro forma supplemental leverage ratio was just 4.2%.
We await clarification on the impact and timing of the GSIB buffer and CCAR. When that clarity is provided, we will be -- we believe we will be near the end of supervisory changes, and therefore, our capital is appropriately sized to support our business going forward.
Turning to Fixed Income & Commodities on Slide 10. Notwithstanding considerable efforts to reduce the capital required to support FICC, further regulatory changes in recent years and a prolonged difficult environment led us to believe that much more radical actions were necessary. We have reset the long-term RWA target for FICC at $110 billion and are setting an SLR exposure target of $250 billion. As a result, we're confident that going forward, this business will require $5 billion to $8 billion less capital. Over time, where possible, excess capital will be returned to shareholders.
On Slide 11, we give more details on the FICC restructuring. Given the cyclical, and in some cases, structural challenges facing Fixed Income, driven by the work Colm and Ted did at the end of last year, we took the decision to downsize headcount by 25%, along with our ongoing balance sheet and capital focus. We took this action alongside the recent installation of a new management team, with the objective of credibly size -- credible sizing of the business going forward.
Our emphasis will be where we have traditional strengths. We have competitive advantages in micro products, specifically in corporate credit connecting to our Investment Banking franchise as well as the mortgage product, and in macro products such as structured rates and certain electronified FX products, which we will appropriately resource. Even closer integration with equities and banking within Institutional Securities and in partnership with Wealth Management against our core client base will allow us to enhance asset velocity and ultimately optimize wallet.
Now let's turn to expense discipline, beginning on Slide 12. As a management team, our #1 priority is to control what we can control given market realities. In ISG, we previously set our compensation target of 39% and finished the year at approximately 37%, partly a function of having fewer employees to support the business. We intend to stay at or below 37% in ISG and have also set 2017 targets for Wealth Management and Investment Management.
Turning to Slide 13. In addition to our focus on compensation discipline, we've launched a major company-wide initiative called Project Streamline, an effort led by our CFO Jon Pruzan and COO Jim Rosenthal, which is designed to identify and implement significant infrastructure expense reductions by the end of 2017. Some of these initiatives are shown here.
Now is the time to tackle head-on our infrastructure costs and maximize low-cost deployment of talent. We have too many legal entities, too much duplication of operations and processes and too many employees based in high-cost centers doing work that can sensibly be done in lower-cost centers. You will hear a lot more about Project Streamline in the coming quarters.
The combination of these efforts will enable us to meaningfully improve our efficiency ratio as shown on Slide 14. Our target expense ratio ex DVA in 2015 was 79% and we ended the year at 77%. Expense management is critically important. As such, we've set a new target ratio of 74% in 2017, which translates into $1 billion in expense reductions over the next 2 years. In setting this efficiency ratio, we have assumed flat revenues for 2016 and 2017. To be clear, we do not expect the revenue environment to apply, especially given ongoing growth initiatives like lending and wealth management. However, we believe this assumption is appropriately conservative.
Now let's turn to Wealth Management on Slide 15. We continue to see strong high-quality loan demand on our Wealth Management client base. We have significantly reduced client penetration -- increased client penetration in securities-based lending and residential lending over the last 3 years. But we remain substantially underpenetrated relative to our peers.
For example, only 1.9% of our clients have a mortgage loan through Morgan Stanley. Increased penetration of all loans will drive $20 billion of lending growth through 2017. A highly scalable business like Wealth Management enables us to add sources of revenue with lower compensation payouts such as net interest growth.
Slide 16 aggregates the medium-term opportunities in Wealth Management. To provide granularity, we lay out 3 areas where we see obvious potential in margin improvement, assuming stable markets. From today's level of 22%, we see margin potential of 23% to 25% in 2017 through one, loan and deposit growth; two, expense discipline; and three, normal course of business growth.
In addition, it's worth reminding investors that when we completed the Smith Barney transaction, we've put in place a retention program that amortized over 9 years. That amortization will be completed in January 2019 and will add an additional 150 basis points of margin.
Now let's turn to Slide 17. As I've said earlier, we believe we are sufficiently capitalized. Subject to regulatory approval, we intend to increase our payout to shareholders in the coming years just as we have done in the last 4 years.
Let me now turn to Slide 18, the final slide. This sets forth ROE targets for 2017. Over the past several years, our returns have been depressed by very high litigation expenses and penalties; the need to build a strong capital base, resulting in material capital growth every year; the cost of integration of the largest acquisition in Wealth Management history; the challenging fixed income markets against which we have carried outsized capital levels; the restructuring of our merchant bank; and of course, the enormous cost in capital brought about by the post-crisis regulatory environment.
We see the next several years very differently. We've identified $1 billion of tangible expense savings. We believe the bank's strategy will be a significant driver of earnings growth in Wealth Management and for the firm. We expect equities and IBD to remain strong and grow revenues, assuming global economic growth. And we believe Investment Management is now positioned for growth.
Most importantly, we believe our capital is strong and our ongoing balance sheet reductions will free up more capital for distribution or where that is not possible, reinvestment into our higher return businesses. As a result, we're setting a 2017 ROE target of 9% to 11%. This assumes no material new capital requirements, no outsized new litigation expenses or penalties and a global economy that evidences growth, not turmoil. Either way, in a flat revenue environment, we will reduce run rate expenses by $1 billion on an annual basis beginning in 2017.
Let me now turn to Jon who'll briefly touch on the fourth quarter, then together, we will take all of your questions."

I will keep my comments brief so we have ample time for Q&A. The fourth quarter of 2015 proved to be a continuation of the third quarter in many ways, with mid-quarter volatility and macro concerns, driving clients to the side",1241,"Thanks, James. Good morning. I will keep my comments brief so we have ample time for Q&A. The fourth quarter of 2015 proved to be a continuation of the third quarter in many ways, with mid-quarter volatility and macro concerns, driving clients to the sidelines after relatively constructive markets early in the quarter. 
In a volatile environment, we benefited from the strength of our Equities, Investment Banking and Wealth Management businesses. Against this backdrop, revenues were $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter or $7.9 billion, excluding DVA, up 7% versus 3Q '15. Noninterest expenses for the quarter were $6.3 billion.
Our effective tax rate was 34.5% for the quarter, driven by our geographic mix of earnings throughout the year. For the full year 2015, our tax rate, excluding the discrete tax benefits from the first quarter, was 32.5%.
Now to the businesses. In a challenging environment for some of our institutional security businesses, overall revenues ex DVA, were $3.5 billion, up 2% quarter-on-quarter. Noninterest expense was down 11% versus the third quarter. Compensation expenses were $1.2 billion, down 7% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding DVA, the ISG compensation ratio was down for the quarter, which brought our full year ratio to 37%. Noncompensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 13%, driven by lower litigation costs.
In Investment Banking, continued strength in our M&A business and better performance in equity underwriting helped to offset weakness in debt underwriting. For the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in revenues, up 3% sequentially. Advisory revenues for the quarter were strong at $516 million but down 7% from the post-2008 high we achieved last quarter.
Turning to underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $352 million, up 41% versus the third quarter, primarily reflecting increases in IPOs. We continue to see pressure from volatility in Fixed Income underwriting volumes, and revenues were $346 million, down 7% versus the third quarter, driven by decreases in loan fees, partially offset by investment-grade bond fees.
The fourth quarter was a continuation of the strength we have seen all year in equity sales and trading as clients remained active and we delivered across products and regions in a volatile market. Ex DVA, revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, up 3% sequentially.
For the quarter, cash equity revenues were higher versus comparable quarters as we gained share across regions. Our Prime Brokerage business continued to demonstrate leadership, with revenues up quarter-over-quarter as we stayed closely engaged with our clients.
Derivative revenues were down quarter-over-quarter against challenging market conditions but up year-over-year. Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading continued to underperform in a difficult environment, characterized by spread widening in various products and lower levels of client activity. For the quarter, revenues were $550 million, excluding DVA, down 6% versus the third quarter.
Revenues in securitized products and credit continued to be negatively impacted by the environment. Rates revenues in the quarter were up sequentially while FX was down, driven by lower market volatility and lower client engagement.
Commodity results were down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by our oil merchanting business. We closed the sale of this business on November 1. Given the sale of our 2 large physical oil businesses, we would expect to see less seasonality in our first quarter FICC results going forward. Lastly, average trading VaR for the quarter was $46 million, down from $53 million last quarter, driven by a reduction in interest rates and credit spread as well as commodities.
In our Wealth Management business, we continued to see steadiness. For the quarter and for the full year 2015, we saw average revenues per day of approximately $60 million, with no day below $50 million. Revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of deferred compensation plan investments in both periods, revenues were approximately flat sequentially.
In the quarter, we continued to benefit from our deposit deployment strategy, with net interest income increasing 4% from the fourth -- third quarter and full year net interest income of $3 billion, up 26%. Funded lending balances in Wealth Management grew approximately $3 billion or 6% during the quarter and $12 billion or 31% year-over-year.
Growth in NII helped to offset some of the quarter's headwinds, including the 5% decline in Asset Management revenues, which was a function of the third quarter's lower S&P level. We continue to see muted overall activity in transactional revenues, excluding the impact of DCP.
On the expense side, compensation was up 6% quarter-over-quarter due largely to the offsetting impact of the expense associated with the DCP investment gains mentioned earlier. Noncompensation expenses were up 6%, driven by typical 4Q seasonality. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 21% ex severance, down slightly versus 3Q '15, though up year-on-year. For the full year, PBT margin was 22% in Wealth Management.
Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were $149 billion at year-end, up $10 billion versus the third quarter, reflecting normal seasonality in deposits as well as clients moving to cash in a volatile market. In Investment Management, revenues were $621 million, up significantly quarter-over-quarter, driven by Traditional Asset Management, which was up 5%, as well as stronger performance in Merchant Banking and Real Estate Investing, where revenues were $211 million versus a loss in the third quarter.
Performance in Investment Management will be impacted by the market levels and backdrop. So far this quarter, market indices around the globe are down, with many off to their worst start in history. If they remain down for the rest of the quarter, we will see an impact in Investment Management performance, particularly in our private investing businesses.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $788 billion at December 31, down from $834 billion at the end of the third quarter. Average balance sheet was $814 billion, down from $827 billion in 3Q as clients move to the sidelines and activity slowed, particularly in the second half of the quarter. Our global liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $203 billion compared with $191 billion at the end of the third quarter, driven by typical seasonality in deposits.
Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $397 billion, down from $434 billion in the third quarter, driven by reductions in market RWAs and a slower client environment. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 19 million shares, and our board declared a $0.15 dividend per share. For the full year, we repurchased $2.1 billion of common stock or 59 million shares.
Turning to outlook. In the first 2 weeks, we have seen a significant rise in volatility across markets and asset classes and an intense focus on the China economy, market and currency as well as declining oil prices. We have had a reasonable start in sales and trading as clients have been engaged as they try and navigate this period of volatility and keep their risk positions close to home.
M&A has remained active. We are cautious, however, as prolonged volatility is not conducive to M&A activity. The underwriting calendar has been challenged. The capital markets pipeline is healthy, but market volatility could delay new issues coming to market. And on the retail side, clients remain cautious. It's way too early to predict how the rest of the quarter unfolds, and we are tightly managing our risk positions along with our clients.
With that, we will open the line to questions."

And going back, I seem to remember a number of like $392 billion or thereabouts in around the third quarter 2011 in FICC. So we're light years from that. And last year, we thought we'd achieve $180 billion. And as you can see, we ended materially lower than that. On the exact timing of year-end and the trajectory year-end 2017, I can't really help you. We're going to do it opportunistically. We'll do it with sort of minimum damage. We don't want to get rid of assets on a distressed basis. We have some natural roll off. So we feel very comfortable with these targets, and it's fair to say we haven't disappointed in the last few years. That hasn't been our issue in FICC. As it relates to the capital, we're just arithmetically, if you run these numbers through the models, it does actually free up that much capital. It just means the business doesn't need that capital. Our view is that we were overcapitalized, that our balance sheet was too big in the business, given the revenue and business opportunity. We now -- and we were over expensed frankly by taking out 25% of the headcount and with that, the expenses on compensation, the Project Streamline that will now work on some of the infrastructure pieces by now reducing the RWAs and the SLR exposure. We will reduce the amount of capital tied up in that business. How that is redeployed is a really good question. Now obviously, over time, we expect we'll deliver that back to shareholders. That's the current plan. We don't control all of the pieces of that plan, we're a regulated institution. We have been through CCAR or SCAR, I think, 5 times. And every time we've asked for a buyback or dividend, our request has been missed. It's fair to say that we'll continue to ask for buybacks and dividends. And where we can't use that capital, if it's sort of trapped capital for some period of time, which some of it may be, there are clearly other businesses that can use the capital sensibly. We have very high return businesses in both Investment Management and Wealth Management. Clearly, we can use the capital to support our growth in those businesses as indeed, we've had very high returns in our Equities franchise. So I don't know if that's helpful, but it's hard to lay out a more specific time line for the balance sheet and RWA runoff than what we've given you here with the end state and with the year-end 2017."

So we don't think there's going to be great revenue diminution from this point, given where we finished 2015, which frankly, as we said and we're very candid about, was disappointing. What we're doing is reducing the parts of Fixed Income where frankly, we didn't see the revenue opportunity over the last 12 and 24 months. We've always had, as we said in the call, we've always had a good micro business, a good credit business that remains good. We've been very good in the more sophisticated structured rates. We're reducing, obviously, our exposure in liquid rates. We've never been a major FX trader, and we're focused on the major currencies there, not the non-G10 currencies. And then regionally, we've sort of picked our shots through distressed and high yield and various other places around the globe where we think we need to be overemphasized relative to under. The net of it will be more of a U.S.-focused business, a slimmer business when it comes to some of the macro products. And I don't know, Jon, if you want to add at this point any more details on that."

Just is it that the transition may not be complete by '17? How is it -- we should think about that?"

Our goal is to achieve returns above that. Clearly, we can't be that precise. I mean, this is a highly variable set of revenues that we have in these businesses as we're seeing in the markets today versus Friday, for example. So that's why we're expressing it in this range. But you'll note the midpoint of that range is indeed 10%. We're not backing off of the goals. In fact, for the first time, we've put a time line against it and as we laid out what the key drivers of that. Obviously, it's with the appropriate caveat, which you would expect, if we have a major outsized litigation expense or penalties that are unforeseen, if the markets completely collapse here, if we have no revenue growth, if the Fed responded very differently to our capital plans than what we intended, it gets harder. On the other side, if we have stronger revenue growth, we meet our expense targets, we do our capital plan, we're confident about certainly about the range and that target is the midpoint of that range."

At 4.2% supplemental leverage ratio, which was just, I think, the beginning of 2014, I'm looking at Jon, he's nodding, 2014, clearly, we weren't there. When -- so problem number one has been solved. We've clearly got enough capital on any metric that you measure. Problem number two has been if you continue to accrete capital, what is the sensible buyback dividend and total payout ratio that you would put against that? And then opportunity number three is as you reshape the business mix and move to less capital-intensive parts of the business, you, by definition, throwing off more capital than you've had the day before you did that, what are you able to do with that capital? As to refer Brennan's question, this isn't going to happen tomorrow, Glenn. It's going to happen over, as we said, a couple of years, so it's not like we're going to have a pool of capital to give back tomorrow. But we are setting ourselves up for increasing returns over the next several years, at the same time as make investments across the rest of the business. So I don't know if that helps you. But where it relates to the GSIB buffer, we know what our buffer is. What we don't know is how the Federal Reserve, through the CCAR process, is adjusting its models. Once they put the CCAR buffering, my understanding is there will be adjustments to the models which will temper that buffer to create a net number, which is lower than the buffer for all of the banks. That's my current understanding. Obviously, we have to see that play out. My understanding is the Federal Reserve have models, which were, by definition, harder than they probably would have had in normal circumstance. But that was driven by not having the GSIB buffer put in place. Now that it's in place, the models will be refined and the net impact is what we'll be looking at. So the combined net impact of the GSIB buffer with these capital reductions from the balance sheet with the amount of capital we're accreting, we still accrete the capital last year, gives us a reasonably high degree of confidence here that we're going to be seeing increasing capital returns in the years ahead."

We have seen -- on the energy complex, we have seen credit migration in that portfolio, and as a result, Glenn, we've increased our allowances. We've seen an increase in some of the negative marks that we take through our balance -- through our income statement as well as increasing our hedges. And we would expect that pressure on that portfolio to persist for a while. In terms of the total size of the portfolio, it's about $16 billion of both funded and unfunded. This is energy now. That's down from $17 billion in the third quarter. Of that $16 billion, I would say 60% is investment grade -- or excuse me, to investment-grade counterparties and only about 30% of that $16 billion is funded. Another focus area within the energy portfolio has really been around E&P. In terms of our statistics, that portfolio is about $4.4 billion. Broken down, $1.7 billion of that is funded to non-investment-grade borrowers and about $2.7 billion is still unfunded. That unfunded piece is about 2/3 to investment-grade borrowers. In terms of the reserves and the allowances, remember, of the $16 billion total energy book, approximately 60% of that is held for investment, while 40% is fair value or held for sale. That other portion is mark to market and it primarily flows through our other revenue line in the ISG in terms of income statement and it's been marked to the current environment. We will continue to monitor that portfolio very closely. We regularly stress test it. We're watching for signs of contagion, and we're hedging accordingly and adjusting our hedges accordingly. So I think that's the color on the energy exposures on the event. Again, it's been -- we've seen disruption in that marketplace since August. It's primarily been focused in the single B part of the market. We have had a handful of loans that got caught in that dislocation and downdraft. But again, it is only a handful of loans, a few which we distributed in the fourth quarter and a few which we still hold. The losses related to both the syndicated loans as well as the ones that we still hold are also reflected in our fourth quarter results. The BB and investment-grade markets held in pretty well, although the pricing has widened. We see investors wanting to put capital to work in that market but they are being more selective. They're looking at higher-quality names and extracting larger new issue concessions. But in terms of outlook, we continue to underwrite new commitments, predominantly in the BB space and the investment-grade space and that reflects the current environment. So again, those 2 areas of energy and event, we've been highly focused on and containing and managing that position as best we can. Outside of that, we haven't really seen much contagion. Wealth Management book still stays -- looks pretty good. Remains stable, strong credit quality, no real changes in that. Those metrics, commercial real estate portfolio also haven't seen real signs of weakness."

But some of the early feedback that I just wanted to relay suggests that there's -- investors are struggling and quite candidly, we're struggling to reconcile the walk to the 9% to 11% ROE versus some of the different guidance components. And if we think about a backdrop where there's 4% annual revenue growth, a 74% efficiency ratio, 32% tax rate and flat preferreds and noncontrolling interest, it gets you to about $6 billion of net income to common. And if I even take just the low end of that 9% -- 9% to 11% ROE range, the implied common equity is about $66 billion, which suggest payouts in excess of 100% over the next 2 years.

And nobody in this world predicted the last 4 or 5 years of what's going on in the markets and the amount of capital that would be required to support these businesses. When I took this job, our capital base was $40 billion. Today, it's $69 billion. We're in a tremendous E position and the challenge has been to get the R moving consistent with that rate of growth of the E. And what we've done here is to frame up for investors because understandably, they want to know what is a realistic time frame, just to Steven's question before, what is a realistic time frame? How did the pieces add up mathematically to get you there? Are they believable? Are they plausible? And we thought, Mike, it will be smart to lay out what we think is a realistic time frame. That kind of range 9% to 11% in 2017. The pieces are we are definitely taking out expenses. Some of them are in the bag, if you will, and some of them are going to be driven by management processes that we've put in place. We believe there is revenue growth across many parts of our business over a 2-year period. And we believe, we are sufficiently capitalized given the world that we operate in. So if you add all those pieces together, putting it in terms of a target to help investors have a framework rather than open-ended seem to be the right transition point for Morgan Stanley. In the last several years, we couldn't have done that because we couldn't address some of the issues on the right-hand side of that slide."

There is the restructuring we did, which frankly just changes the run rate of your salaries, benefits, medical and the bonus pool for those individuals.

I think on the Investment Management question, the way I would try to think about it is there are basically 2 major components of how we make business in that -- how we make money in that business. One is just our fee revenues for managing money. And obviously, that's going to be a rate -- that's a rate times volume equation, so if the amount of money we're managing goes down, that will be impacted by the markets that we're seeing. But that line is pretty stable. The second line, as you said, is the investment line. And when I refer to the investment line, I'm talking about the segment reporting we do in our supplement. That number was negative $235 million last quarter. We said that was predominantly driven by a reversal of carry in our Asia PE fund or funds. This quarter, it was $100 million. That return to a positive number was driven by all of our -- or most of our investment businesses, both private equity infrastructure and real estate so it's more balanced. We said in the third quarter when we took the reversal of carry that, that eliminated the vast majority -- excuse me, the majority of carry that we have accrued in our Asia PE businesses. We obviously have a carry accrued in other businesses, and that's disclosed in the Q. But the exposure, certainly in Asia has been reduced and the fund that was under stress in that third quarter had no material changes this quarter. That was the first part of your question. I think the second on transactional revenues. Those numbers have been subdued. Clients are cautious. Whether that's a floor or not, it's hard to tell given the volatility, but we think that, that -- that those numbers hopefully are stabilized."

I think on the funding question, there's obviously a lot of components that go into those lines, including the size of our balance sheet, secured versus unsecured. What we said just to give you some -- to try to cuff it. We did about $21 billion of new unsecured last year, and those came in at rates that were significantly below where the historical debt had been issued. Our average maturity or WAM on our unsecured stack now is about 6 years, so we were sort of retiring 5-year debt and putting on slightly longer, but we saw our credit spreads were easily 100 tighter than where they were before. That process went out through -- that process went on throughout the year. We obviously didn't refinance all the debt on day 1 so we'll continue to get the benefit from those funding savings as we annualize. And so that I think addresses question number one. And question number two on the deposits, we will continue to grow our deposit base. I think what we would like to try to do this year in 2016 is try to optimize the deposits. We have different deposits that have different liquidity values. We think we can support the lending growth that we've highlighted in this strategy -- excuse me, in the strategy deck without growing our deposit base, but clearly, that is the goal. And in 2017, that will be a requirement to support our future lending growth. We've talked about some of the digital strategy in cash management products that we're rolling out. And that will support -- that will hopefully drive the deposit growth in 2017 and beyond."

Given the amount of information we are going to cover on this call, we are happy to extend the Q&A a few minutes as needed to ensure you get your questions in. In a minute, I'll take you through the 2016-2017 o",2135,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone. Given the amount of information we are going to cover on this call, we are happy to extend the Q&A a few minutes as needed to ensure you get your questions in. In a minute, I'll take you through the 2016-2017 outlook and plan. But before I do so, let me touch briefly on the fourth quarter.
Clearly, the difficult environment that began midsummer continued through the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding that, Equity Sales & Trading and Investment Banking were strong, and Wealth Management and Investment Management were solid. We acted on those things within our control by initiating a major restructuring of FICC; conducting a large reduction in force in December; reducing our compensation-to-revenue ratio; launching a large-scale firm-wide expense initiative, more on that later; significantly reducing RWAs and FICC to $136 billion, well below our target of $180 billion; and closing the sale of our oil merchanting business. Finally, we put in place the leadership team to drive the plan forward over the next several years.
On that, I look forward to having Colm join me as our President. He brings highly complementary skills and will help take this firm to the next level. The previous appointments of Ted Pick as Global Head of Sales and Trading, Dan Simkowitz as Head of Investment Management and Jon Pruzan as CFO are hard evidence of our deep and talented bench. Finally, Sam Kellie-Smith will run Fixed Income & Commodities, working for Ted. In light of these changes in the business [ph], it was expected that Greg Fleming will pursue opportunities away from Morgan Stanley. We thank Greg for all he has done and wish him well for the future.
Our bench in Wealth Management is particularly strong. Andy Saperstein and Shelley O'Connor have over 40 years’ experience in that business. Shelley previously ran the field organization, a position Andy also previously held, as well as running products. Colm will help oversee Wealth Management, and of course, it is a business I have a very long history in.
Building a first-class leadership team is among my most important responsibilities. I'm delighted we made these decisions and look forward to a period of stability with this team. Now our entire focus is on driving results.
Please, if you will, turn to the slides that you can find on the Investor Relations website. After I go through these, Jon will take you through the quarter in more detail then we'll both take your questions.
Let's start with Slide #3. As you can see, as a result of many changes, our business mix is much more balanced with complementary franchises in the Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management.
In our Institutional Securities business, we've maintained our leadership positions in Investment Banking and Equity Sales & Trading as illustrated on Slide 4. In Equity Sales & Trading, we are first among global peers as of the third quarter year-to-date. We've built on the momentum of recent years under the leadership of Colm and Ted with full year revenues ex DVA of $8.1 billion, up 18% year-over-year. In Banking, we continue to see strength and finished second in global announced M&A and #1 in IPOs.
Slide 5 recaps what we laid out last year and our results. In Wealth Management, we achieved a full year profit margin of 22%, with pretax earnings of $3.3 billion, a record for this business. We expect to see further growth in Wealth Management.
We grew our U.S. bank's net interest income by 46% year-over-year in a flat rate environment. However, in Fixed Income & Commodities, we failed to improve on our financial results. While we've been reshaping FICC for several years, the volatile and shrinking revenue pool, coupled with the steady increasing capital requirements, led us to take further significant action at year-end. Through our recently announced FICC restructuring, we will better align the capital and resources committed to the business with the opportunity we see.
Through the year, our funding costs benefited from the realization of our funding tailwind as the debt we issued was at much tighter spreads than the post-crisis debt that matured. We will continue to see benefit from the associated going forward.
We maintained our focus on expense management and achieved a full year ISG compensation ratio ex DVA of 37%, below our stated goal of 39% or less. And finally, we increased our common dividend by 50% and increased our annual buyback from $1 billion to $2.5 billion. We intend to further increase capital return to shareholders in the years ahead, subject, of course, to regulatory approval.
As we can see on Page 6, our ROE for 2015, excluding DVA and the discrete tax benefits, were 7% on a capital base of $67 billion. We remain committed to our 10% ROE target. Obviously, that cap is a function of both earnings and equity.
On Slide 7, we lay out the key elements of our plan for achieving returns of 10% or greater. These include: Capital sufficiency, expense efficiency, Wealth Management revenue growth and capital returns to shareholders. These, of course, are in addition to the continued improvements across Institutional Securities and Investment Management.
Since 2012, we have made significant progress in derisking our balance sheet on flat assets. This is shown on Slide 8. We continue to accrete common equity despite continued increase in capital returns to shareholders. We believe our robust equity base, coupled with the derisked balance sheet and a transformed business mix, provides a strong foundation to support our current plan.
As shown on Slide 9, our pro forma Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.1% and pro forma supplemental leverage ratio of 5.8% are well in excess of their prospective requirements. Building a very strong capital base has been a critical part of our strategy, as evidenced by our ratios. By comparison, in the first quarter of 2014, our pro forma Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under the advanced approach was 11.6%, and our pro forma supplemental leverage ratio was just 4.2%.
We await clarification on the impact and timing of the GSIB buffer and CCAR. When that clarity is provided, we will be -- we believe we will be near the end of supervisory changes, and therefore, our capital is appropriately sized to support our business going forward.
Turning to Fixed Income & Commodities on Slide 10. Notwithstanding considerable efforts to reduce the capital required to support FICC, further regulatory changes in recent years and a prolonged difficult environment led us to believe that much more radical actions were necessary. We have reset the long-term RWA target for FICC at $110 billion and are setting an SLR exposure target of $250 billion. As a result, we're confident that going forward, this business will require $5 billion to $8 billion less capital. Over time, where possible, excess capital will be returned to shareholders.
On Slide 11, we give more details on the FICC restructuring. Given the cyclical, and in some cases, structural challenges facing Fixed Income, driven by the work Colm and Ted did at the end of last year, we took the decision to downsize headcount by 25%, along with our ongoing balance sheet and capital focus. We took this action alongside the recent installation of a new management team, with the objective of credibly size -- credible sizing of the business going forward.
Our emphasis will be where we have traditional strengths. We have competitive advantages in micro products, specifically in corporate credit connecting to our Investment Banking franchise as well as the mortgage product, and in macro products such as structured rates and certain electronified FX products, which we will appropriately resource. Even closer integration with equities and banking within Institutional Securities and in partnership with Wealth Management against our core client base will allow us to enhance asset velocity and ultimately optimize wallet.
Now let's turn to expense discipline, beginning on Slide 12. As a management team, our #1 priority is to control what we can control given market realities. In ISG, we previously set our compensation target of 39% and finished the year at approximately 37%, partly a function of having fewer employees to support the business. We intend to stay at or below 37% in ISG and have also set 2017 targets for Wealth Management and Investment Management.
Turning to Slide 13. In addition to our focus on compensation discipline, we've launched a major company-wide initiative called Project Streamline, an effort led by our CFO Jon Pruzan and COO Jim Rosenthal, which is designed to identify and implement significant infrastructure expense reductions by the end of 2017. Some of these initiatives are shown here.
Now is the time to tackle head-on our infrastructure costs and maximize low-cost deployment of talent. We have too many legal entities, too much duplication of operations and processes and too many employees based in high-cost centers doing work that can sensibly be done in lower-cost centers. You will hear a lot more about Project Streamline in the coming quarters.
The combination of these efforts will enable us to meaningfully improve our efficiency ratio as shown on Slide 14. Our target expense ratio ex DVA in 2015 was 79% and we ended the year at 77%. Expense management is critically important. As such, we've set a new target ratio of 74% in 2017, which translates into $1 billion in expense reductions over the next 2 years. In setting this efficiency ratio, we have assumed flat revenues for 2016 and 2017. To be clear, we do not expect the revenue environment to apply, especially given ongoing growth initiatives like lending and wealth management. However, we believe this assumption is appropriately conservative.
Now let's turn to Wealth Management on Slide 15. We continue to see strong high-quality loan demand on our Wealth Management client base. We have significantly reduced client penetration -- increased client penetration in securities-based lending and residential lending over the last 3 years. But we remain substantially underpenetrated relative to our peers.
For example, only 1.9% of our clients have a mortgage loan through Morgan Stanley. Increased penetration of all loans will drive $20 billion of lending growth through 2017. A highly scalable business like Wealth Management enables us to add sources of revenue with lower compensation payouts such as net interest growth.
Slide 16 aggregates the medium-term opportunities in Wealth Management. To provide granularity, we lay out 3 areas where we see obvious potential in margin improvement, assuming stable markets. From today's level of 22%, we see margin potential of 23% to 25% in 2017 through one, loan and deposit growth; two, expense discipline; and three, normal course of business growth.
In addition, it's worth reminding investors that when we completed the Smith Barney transaction, we've put in place a retention program that amortized over 9 years. That amortization will be completed in January 2019 and will add an additional 150 basis points of margin.
Now let's turn to Slide 17. As I've said earlier, we believe we are sufficiently capitalized. Subject to regulatory approval, we intend to increase our payout to shareholders in the coming years just as we have done in the last 4 years.
Let me now turn to Slide 18, the final slide. This sets forth ROE targets for 2017. Over the past several years, our returns have been depressed by very high litigation expenses and penalties; the need to build a strong capital base, resulting in material capital growth every year; the cost of integration of the largest acquisition in Wealth Management history; the challenging fixed income markets against which we have carried outsized capital levels; the restructuring of our merchant bank; and of course, the enormous cost in capital brought about by the post-crisis regulatory environment.
We see the next several years very differently. We've identified $1 billion of tangible expense savings. We believe the bank's strategy will be a significant driver of earnings growth in Wealth Management and for the firm. We expect equities and IBD to remain strong and grow revenues, assuming global economic growth. And we believe Investment Management is now positioned for growth.
Most importantly, we believe our capital is strong and our ongoing balance sheet reductions will free up more capital for distribution or where that is not possible, reinvestment into our higher return businesses. As a result, we're setting a 2017 ROE target of 9% to 11%. This assumes no material new capital requirements, no outsized new litigation expenses or penalties and a global economy that evidences growth, not turmoil. Either way, in a flat revenue environment, we will reduce run rate expenses by $1 billion on an annual basis beginning in 2017.
Let me now turn to Jon who'll briefly touch on the fourth quarter, then together, we will take all of your questions."

I will keep my comments brief so we have ample time for Q&A. The fourth quarter of 2015 proved to be a continuation of the third quarter in many ways, with mid-quarter volatility and macro concerns, driving clients to the side",1241,"Thanks, James. Good morning. I will keep my comments brief so we have ample time for Q&A. The fourth quarter of 2015 proved to be a continuation of the third quarter in many ways, with mid-quarter volatility and macro concerns, driving clients to the sidelines after relatively constructive markets early in the quarter. 
In a volatile environment, we benefited from the strength of our Equities, Investment Banking and Wealth Management businesses. Against this backdrop, revenues were $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter or $7.9 billion, excluding DVA, up 7% versus 3Q '15. Noninterest expenses for the quarter were $6.3 billion.
Our effective tax rate was 34.5% for the quarter, driven by our geographic mix of earnings throughout the year. For the full year 2015, our tax rate, excluding the discrete tax benefits from the first quarter, was 32.5%.
Now to the businesses. In a challenging environment for some of our institutional security businesses, overall revenues ex DVA, were $3.5 billion, up 2% quarter-on-quarter. Noninterest expense was down 11% versus the third quarter. Compensation expenses were $1.2 billion, down 7% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding DVA, the ISG compensation ratio was down for the quarter, which brought our full year ratio to 37%. Noncompensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 13%, driven by lower litigation costs.
In Investment Banking, continued strength in our M&A business and better performance in equity underwriting helped to offset weakness in debt underwriting. For the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in revenues, up 3% sequentially. Advisory revenues for the quarter were strong at $516 million but down 7% from the post-2008 high we achieved last quarter.
Turning to underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $352 million, up 41% versus the third quarter, primarily reflecting increases in IPOs. We continue to see pressure from volatility in Fixed Income underwriting volumes, and revenues were $346 million, down 7% versus the third quarter, driven by decreases in loan fees, partially offset by investment-grade bond fees.
The fourth quarter was a continuation of the strength we have seen all year in equity sales and trading as clients remained active and we delivered across products and regions in a volatile market. Ex DVA, revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, up 3% sequentially.
For the quarter, cash equity revenues were higher versus comparable quarters as we gained share across regions. Our Prime Brokerage business continued to demonstrate leadership, with revenues up quarter-over-quarter as we stayed closely engaged with our clients.
Derivative revenues were down quarter-over-quarter against challenging market conditions but up year-over-year. Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading continued to underperform in a difficult environment, characterized by spread widening in various products and lower levels of client activity. For the quarter, revenues were $550 million, excluding DVA, down 6% versus the third quarter.
Revenues in securitized products and credit continued to be negatively impacted by the environment. Rates revenues in the quarter were up sequentially while FX was down, driven by lower market volatility and lower client engagement.
Commodity results were down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by our oil merchanting business. We closed the sale of this business on November 1. Given the sale of our 2 large physical oil businesses, we would expect to see less seasonality in our first quarter FICC results going forward. Lastly, average trading VaR for the quarter was $46 million, down from $53 million last quarter, driven by a reduction in interest rates and credit spread as well as commodities.
In our Wealth Management business, we continued to see steadiness. For the quarter and for the full year 2015, we saw average revenues per day of approximately $60 million, with no day below $50 million. Revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of deferred compensation plan investments in both periods, revenues were approximately flat sequentially.
In the quarter, we continued to benefit from our deposit deployment strategy, with net interest income increasing 4% from the fourth -- third quarter and full year net interest income of $3 billion, up 26%. Funded lending balances in Wealth Management grew approximately $3 billion or 6% during the quarter and $12 billion or 31% year-over-year.
Growth in NII helped to offset some of the quarter's headwinds, including the 5% decline in Asset Management revenues, which was a function of the third quarter's lower S&P level. We continue to see muted overall activity in transactional revenues, excluding the impact of DCP.
On the expense side, compensation was up 6% quarter-over-quarter due largely to the offsetting impact of the expense associated with the DCP investment gains mentioned earlier. Noncompensation expenses were up 6%, driven by typical 4Q seasonality. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 21% ex severance, down slightly versus 3Q '15, though up year-on-year. For the full year, PBT margin was 22% in Wealth Management.
Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were $149 billion at year-end, up $10 billion versus the third quarter, reflecting normal seasonality in deposits as well as clients moving to cash in a volatile market. In Investment Management, revenues were $621 million, up significantly quarter-over-quarter, driven by Traditional Asset Management, which was up 5%, as well as stronger performance in Merchant Banking and Real Estate Investing, where revenues were $211 million versus a loss in the third quarter.
Performance in Investment Management will be impacted by the market levels and backdrop. So far this quarter, market indices around the globe are down, with many off to their worst start in history. If they remain down for the rest of the quarter, we will see an impact in Investment Management performance, particularly in our private investing businesses.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $788 billion at December 31, down from $834 billion at the end of the third quarter. Average balance sheet was $814 billion, down from $827 billion in 3Q as clients move to the sidelines and activity slowed, particularly in the second half of the quarter. Our global liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $203 billion compared with $191 billion at the end of the third quarter, driven by typical seasonality in deposits.
Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $397 billion, down from $434 billion in the third quarter, driven by reductions in market RWAs and a slower client environment. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 19 million shares, and our board declared a $0.15 dividend per share. For the full year, we repurchased $2.1 billion of common stock or 59 million shares.
Turning to outlook. In the first 2 weeks, we have seen a significant rise in volatility across markets and asset classes and an intense focus on the China economy, market and currency as well as declining oil prices. We have had a reasonable start in sales and trading as clients have been engaged as they try and navigate this period of volatility and keep their risk positions close to home.
M&A has remained active. We are cautious, however, as prolonged volatility is not conducive to M&A activity. The underwriting calendar has been challenged. The capital markets pipeline is healthy, but market volatility could delay new issues coming to market. And on the retail side, clients remain cautious. It's way too early to predict how the rest of the quarter unfolds, and we are tightly managing our risk positions along with our clients.
With that, we will open the line to questions."

And going back, I seem to remember a number of like $392 billion or thereabouts in around the third quarter 2011 in FICC. So we're light years from that. And last year, we thought we'd achieve $180 billion. And as you can see, we ended materially lower than that. On the exact timing of year-end and the trajectory year-end 2017, I can't really help you. We're going to do it opportunistically. We'll do it with sort of minimum damage. We don't want to get rid of assets on a distressed basis. We have some natural roll off. So we feel very comfortable with these targets, and it's fair to say we haven't disappointed in the last few years. That hasn't been our issue in FICC. As it relates to the capital, we're just arithmetically, if you run these numbers through the models, it does actually free up that much capital. It just means the business doesn't need that capital. Our view is that we were overcapitalized, that our balance sheet was too big in the business, given the revenue and business opportunity. We now -- and we were over expensed frankly by taking out 25% of the headcount and with that, the expenses on compensation, the Project Streamline that will now work on some of the infrastructure pieces by now reducing the RWAs and the SLR exposure. We will reduce the amount of capital tied up in that business. How that is redeployed is a really good question. Now obviously, over time, we expect we'll deliver that back to shareholders. That's the current plan. We don't control all of the pieces of that plan, we're a regulated institution. We have been through CCAR or SCAR, I think, 5 times. And every time we've asked for a buyback or dividend, our request has been missed. It's fair to say that we'll continue to ask for buybacks and dividends. And where we can't use that capital, if it's sort of trapped capital for some period of time, which some of it may be, there are clearly other businesses that can use the capital sensibly. We have very high return businesses in both Investment Management and Wealth Management. Clearly, we can use the capital to support our growth in those businesses as indeed, we've had very high returns in our Equities franchise. So I don't know if that's helpful, but it's hard to lay out a more specific time line for the balance sheet and RWA runoff than what we've given you here with the end state and with the year-end 2017."

So we don't think there's going to be great revenue diminution from this point, given where we finished 2015, which frankly, as we said and we're very candid about, was disappointing. What we're doing is reducing the parts of Fixed Income where frankly, we didn't see the revenue opportunity over the last 12 and 24 months. We've always had, as we said in the call, we've always had a good micro business, a good credit business that remains good. We've been very good in the more sophisticated structured rates. We're reducing, obviously, our exposure in liquid rates. We've never been a major FX trader, and we're focused on the major currencies there, not the non-G10 currencies. And then regionally, we've sort of picked our shots through distressed and high yield and various other places around the globe where we think we need to be overemphasized relative to under. The net of it will be more of a U.S.-focused business, a slimmer business when it comes to some of the macro products.

But you'll note the midpoint of that range is indeed 10%. We're not backing off of the goals. In fact, for the first time, we've put a time line against it and as we laid out what the key drivers of that. Obviously, it's with the appropriate caveat, which you would expect, if we have a major outsized litigation expense or penalties that are unforeseen, if the markets completely collapse here, if we have no revenue growth, if the Fed responded very differently to our capital plans than what we intended, it gets harder. On the other side, if we have stronger revenue growth, we meet our expense targets, we do our capital plan, we're confident about certainly about the range and that target is the midpoint of that range."

At 4.2% supplemental leverage ratio, which was just, I think, the beginning of 2014, I'm looking at Jon, he's nodding, 2014, clearly, we weren't there. When -- so problem number one has been solved. We've clearly got enough capital on any metric that you measure. Problem number two has been if you continue to accrete capital, what is the sensible buyback dividend and total payout ratio that you would put against that? And then opportunity number three is as you reshape the business mix and move to less capital-intensive parts of the business, you, by definition, throwing off more capital than you've had the day before you did that, what are you able to do with that capital? As to refer Brennan's question, this isn't going to happen tomorrow, Glenn. It's going to happen over, as we said, a couple of years, so it's not like we're going to have a pool of capital to give back tomorrow. But we are setting ourselves up for increasing returns over the next several years, at the same time as make investments across the rest of the business. So I don't know if that helps you. But where it relates to the GSIB buffer, we know what our buffer is. What we don't know is how the Federal Reserve, through the CCAR process, is adjusting its models. Once they put the CCAR buffering, my understanding is there will be adjustments to the models which will temper that buffer to create a net number, which is lower than the buffer for all of the banks. That's my current understanding. Obviously, we have to see that play out. My understanding is the Federal Reserve have models, which were, by definition, harder than they probably would have had in normal circumstance. But that was driven by not having the GSIB buffer put in place. Now that it's in place, the models will be refined and the net impact is what we'll be looking at. So the combined net impact of the GSIB buffer with these capital reductions from the balance sheet with the amount of capital we're accreting, we still accrete the capital last year, gives us a reasonably high degree of confidence here that we're going to be seeing increasing capital returns in the years ahead."

We have seen -- on the energy complex, we have seen credit migration in that portfolio, and as a result, Glenn, we've increased our allowances. We've seen an increase in some of the negative marks that we take through our balance -- through our income statement as well as increasing our hedges. And we would expect that pressure on that portfolio to persist for a while. In terms of the total size of the portfolio, it's about $16 billion of both funded and unfunded. This is energy now. That's down from $17 billion in the third quarter. Of that $16 billion, I would say 60% is investment grade -- or excuse me, to investment-grade counterparties and only about 30% of that $16 billion is funded. Another focus area within the energy portfolio has really been around E&P. In terms of our statistics, that portfolio is about $4.4 billion. Broken down, $1.7 billion of that is funded to non-investment-grade borrowers and about $2.7 billion is still unfunded. That unfunded piece is about 2/3 to investment-grade borrowers. In terms of the reserves and the allowances, remember, of the $16 billion total energy book, approximately 60% of that is held for investment, while 40% is fair value or held for sale. That other portion is mark to market and it primarily flows through our other revenue line in the ISG in terms of income statement and it's been marked to the current environment. We will continue to monitor that portfolio very closely. We regularly stress test it. We're watching for signs of contagion, and we're hedging accordingly and adjusting our hedges accordingly. So I think that's the color on the energy exposures on the event. Again, it's been -- we've seen disruption in that marketplace since August. It's primarily been focused in the single B part of the market. We have had a handful of loans that got caught in that dislocation and downdraft. But again, it is only a handful of loans, a few which we distributed in the fourth quarter and a few which we still hold. The losses related to both the syndicated loans as well as the ones that we still hold are also reflected in our fourth quarter results. The BB and investment-grade markets held in pretty well, although the pricing has widened. We see investors wanting to put capital to work in that market but they are being more selective. They're looking at higher-quality names and extracting larger new issue concessions. But in terms of outlook, we continue to underwrite new commitments, predominantly in the BB space and the investment-grade space and that reflects the current environment. So again, those 2 areas of energy and event, we've been highly focused on and containing and managing that position as best we can. Outside of that, we haven't really seen much contagion. Wealth Management book still stays -- looks pretty good. Remains stable, strong credit quality, no real changes in that. Those metrics, commercial real estate portfolio also haven't seen real signs of weakness."

But some of the early feedback that I just wanted to relay suggests that there's -- investors are struggling and quite candidly, we're struggling to reconcile the walk to the 9% to 11% ROE versus some of the different guidance components. And if we think about a backdrop where there's 4% annual revenue growth, a 74% efficiency ratio, 32% tax rate and flat preferreds and noncontrolling interest, it gets you to about $6 billion of net income to common. And if I even take just the low end of that 9% -- 9% to 11% ROE range, the implied common equity is about $66 billion, which suggest payouts in excess of 100% over the next 2 years.

The most senior management team received as part of their compensation performance units, which are directly affected to -- by ROE and total shareholder return, so that's very specific for the senior team. But we're not doing this to frankly drive up our personal comp. We're doing it because we think these businesses should be run with returns at or above 10%. And nobody in this world predicted the last 4 or 5 years of what's going on in the markets and the amount of capital that would be required to support these businesses. When I took this job, our capital base was $40 billion. Today, it's $69 billion. We're in a tremendous E position and the challenge has been to get the R moving consistent with that rate of growth of the E. And what we've done here is to frame up for investors because understandably, they want to know what is a realistic time frame, just to Steven's question before, what is a realistic time frame? How did the pieces add up mathematically to get you there? Are they believable? Are they plausible? And we thought, Mike, it will be smart to lay out what we think is a realistic time frame. That kind of range 9% to 11% in 2017. The pieces are we are definitely taking out expenses. Some of them are in the bag, if you will, and some of them are going to be driven by management processes that we've put in place. We believe there is revenue growth across many parts of our business over a 2-year period. And we believe, we are sufficiently capitalized given the world that we operate in. So if you add all those pieces together, putting it in terms of a target to help investors have a framework rather than open-ended seem to be the right transition point for Morgan Stanley. In the last several years, we couldn't have done that because we couldn't address some of the issues on the right-hand side of that slide."

I think on the Investment Management question, the way I would try to think about it is there are basically 2 major components of how we make business in that -- how we make money in that business. One is just our fee revenues for managing money. And obviously, that's going to be a rate -- that's a rate times volume equation, so if the amount of money we're managing goes down, that will be impacted by the markets that we're seeing. But that line is pretty stable. The second line, as you said, is the investment line. And when I refer to the investment line, I'm talking about the segment reporting we do in our supplement. That number was negative $235 million last quarter. We said that was predominantly driven by a reversal of carry in our Asia PE fund or funds. This quarter, it was $100 million. That return to a positive number was driven by all of our -- or most of our investment businesses, both private equity infrastructure and real estate so it's more balanced. We said in the third quarter when we took the reversal of carry that, that eliminated the vast majority -- excuse me, the majority of carry that we have accrued in our Asia PE businesses. We obviously have a carry accrued in other businesses, and that's disclosed in the Q. But the exposure, certainly in Asia has been reduced and the fund that was under stress in that third quarter had no material changes this quarter. That was the first part of your question. I think the second on transactional revenues. Those numbers have been subdued. Clients are cautious. Whether that's a floor or not, it's hard to tell given the volatility, but we think that, that -- that those numbers hopefully are stabilized."

Our average maturity or WAM on our unsecured stack now is about 6 years, so we were sort of retiring 5-year debt and putting on slightly longer, but we saw our credit spreads were easily 100 tighter than where they were before. That process went out through -- that process went on throughout the year. We obviously didn't refinance all the debt on day 1 so we'll continue to get the benefit from those funding savings as we annualize. And so that I think addresses question number one. And question number two on the deposits, we will continue to grow our deposit base. I think what we would like to try to do this year in 2016 is try to optimize the deposits. We have different deposits that have different liquidity values. We think we can support the lending growth that we've highlighted in this strategy -- excuse me, in the strategy deck without growing our deposit base, but clearly, that is the goal. And in 2017, that will be a requirement to support our future lending growth. We've talked about some of the digital strategy in cash management products that we're rolling out. And that will support -- that will hopefully drive the deposit growth in 2017 and beyond."

Obviously, 2016 got off to a difficult start. Markets were challenging. Equity issuance was effectively nonexistent, and retail activity was extremely subdued, reflecting the many uncertainties with which investors grappled. These included negative interest rates internationally, questions around the pace of Fed activity in the U.S., the growth rate of the Chinese economy and growing concerns about geopolitical issues like the migration crisis and potential Brexit, among others. The securities businesses were exposed to a number of these factors, which led to a more challenging revenue environment than what we have come to expect in the first quarter of the year. That said, all is not lost. M&A was robust. Equities once again delivered a strong performance, and Wealth Management generated a pretax margin greater than 21% despite market headwinds and fewer trading days. We made real progress in our expense discipline ahead of our broader initiative called Project Streamline, which, as we said, will play out over the next 2 years. 
So where are we now? Though it's impossible to predict the future, we're seeing a slightly better turn in markets, certainly in comparison to what was evident at the start of the first quarter, leading into the early days of February. The M&A pipeline strong, and some green shoots suggest the equity underwriting calendar may open up. The S&P level at the end of the first quarter will help with asset price in our Wealth Management business, where we continue to grow our lending book and see flows into managed accounts. Importantly, Fixed Income, notwithstanding the 25% cut in headcount, improved sequentially. By no means can FIC be considered strong, but the business is showing some resilience in this difficult environment. 
In January, we laid our strategic goals for 2016 and 2017. While we've yet to see the revenue growth we anticipated, it remains early days. In a minute, Jon would take you through the progress we've made to date. It must be said that if these markets where to continue as is, our goals will be extremely difficult to achieve, and we would therefore take additional appropriate actions. We obviously accept the degree of volatility in the revenue environment that has led to lower revenue pools, although we do not expect this as a permanent state. We also recognize that we cannot control the environment in which we operate, but we are focused on what we can control, such as expenses. As part of Streamline, we are reshaping our expense base and have embarked on an aggressive evaluation of our global infrastructure cost, reviewing each product, business and geography globally to convince ourselves that we need our footprint as it is currently configured. 
We operate under a multitude of capital tests and requirements. In January, we discussed our belief that we have sufficient capital for our business mix and risk profile, and we're taking actions that could -- should result in longer-term reduced capital requirements. For SLR and CET1, we are well in excess of the requirements in which we will be subject to in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In terms of capital return, which has been one of the cornerstones of our strategic plan, our binding constraint is CCAR. To be clear, this is not a comment with respect to our capital return plans for this year, which we deem appropriate, but more for the following years. In order to drive capital returns to shareholders on a more substantial base than our current CCAR submission is asking for, we must continue to reduce those parts of our business that give rise to the high stress losses and capital deductions and/or balance sheet usage. 
While in a difficult quarter, we still made $1 billion, our ROE was 6%. This is not acceptable. Finally, we received feedback last week on our resolution plan, which was deemed credible by the FDIC, but on account of one deficiency, was not deemed credible by the Federal Reserve. As you saw, we received very detailed comments, and we are confident we'll be able to address the items that were raised. We've dedicated significant resources and time to this important priority and will continue to work with our regulators to improve it. This management team would do what is necessary to ensure that we continue to progress against our strategic plan. 
I look forward to doing an update at the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference in June. So let me now turn it over to Jon to walk through the quarter in greater detail. Thank you."

Good morning. As James said, the beginning of 2016 got off to a challenging start as negative sentiment and volatility prevailed in the global markets, undermining the traditional strength in client activity we have typically seen at the start of the year. Concerns about global growth, China, commodities and interest rates resulted in divergent performance of global indices and mixed results across international markets. Against this turbulent backdrop, we remain focused on delivering for our clients and helping them navigate these difficult markets. We continued to demonstrate strength in our equities and M&A businesses and stability in Wealth Management. For the quarter, we reported revenues of $7.8 billion, essentially flat versus fourth quarter '15, when excluding DVA for the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we early adopted the accounting guidance that requires that DVA be presented in accumulated other comprehensive income as opposed to net revenues. Results for previous quarters shown in the supplement were not subject to restatement under the guidance. In my remarks, the prior period amounts exclude DVA. 
Noninterest expense for the quarter was $6.1 billion, comprised of $3.7 billion of compensation expense and $2.4 billion of non-compensation expenses. We remain focused on reducing expenses, and as James mentioned, Streamline initiatives have begun to take shape. Some of the areas we are focused on in Streamline include: first, our workforce strategy. We continue to remix our global workforce and have approximately 40% of our infrastructure employees in our centers of excellence around the world. We are targeting to increase the number of employees deployed by 10% to 15% and are actively working toward achieving this by year-end 2017. Many of the initiatives involve leveraging best-in-class technologies. For instance, we are adopting virtualization and private cloud computing to increase agility and asset utilization while achieving a significant reduction in our data center expenses. We are building the next-generation Wealth Management desktop and mobile suite for both our financial advisers and clients while optimizing and automating our operations and workflow. We're also partnering with incumbent technology companies and emerging start-ups on a number of initiatives to improve efficiency and lower costs. And lastly, we are focused on rationalizing our footprint and infrastructure to ensure we are as efficient and productive as possible. In particular, there are opportunities across our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management businesses, where we have the ability to drive efficiencies while improving collaboration. 
Turning to Institutional Securities. Revenues were $3.7 billion, up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, down 13% versus the fourth quarter, driven by a decline in professional services. Compensation expenses were $1.4 billion, reflecting a 37% ISG compensation ratio. In Investment Banking, we saw continued strength in our M&A businesses, offset by a tougher backdrop for our underwriting businesses. IPO volumes were down 82% quarter-on-quarter, and high-yield volumes were down off of already low levels in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, we generated $990 million in revenues, down 18% sequentially. Advisory revenues for the quarter were the strongest postcrisis at $591 million, up 15% as the deals announced last year continue to close. Equity underwriting revenues were $160 million, down 55% versus 4Q, driven largely by the significant decreases in IPOs. Fixed Income underwriting revenues were $239 million, down 31% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting a slowdown in high-yield and leverage loan markets. In equities, we saw continued leadership with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 13% sequentially. Prime brokerage revenues were higher this quarter as we work closely with our clients and continue to focus on the efficiency of our balance sheet and return. Derivatives revenues were up sequentially driven by increased client activity as clients try to navigate volatility and hedge risk exposures. And cash equity revenues were down versus 4Q against the backdrop of lower global equity markets and a limited new issue calendar. And we continue to show leadership in our electronic products suite. 
Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading revenues were $873 million, up 59% versus the fourth quarter, although down 54% versus the first quarter of 2015, when we had a very strong commodities quarter, both in our oil merchanting business, which we sold in 4Q last year and our commodities trading businesses. Throughout the quarter, we saw a continuation of the challenges experienced in the second half of 2015. This translated into ongoing muted levels of client activity across our Fixed Income & Commodities business. Despite these headwinds and the 25% reduction in headcount, we maintained our client focus and improved results from the fourth quarter. We saw some improvement quarter-over-quarter in corporate credit, with strength in investment grade, and we saw continued weakness across commodities. Fixed Income RWAs were down $4 billion in the quarter to $132 billion, and our SLR balance sheet was down approximately $9 billion to $345 billion. While revenues were for the quarter were up sequentially, we are not where we ultimately want them to be. We're focused on driving execution and bringing our sales and trading businesses together to leverage synergies across the platform. 
Other sales and trading revenues were down quarter-over-quarter driven by hedging losses for our relationship lending book. Other revenues were down versus fourth quarter driven by an increase in our allowance for loan losses or are held for investment portfolio. In the quarter, we have continued to see pressure on the energy complex and have seen some credit migration and some bankruptcies. Our loan loss provision on our HFI portfolio of $127 million this quarter was predominantly against our energy portfolio. As a reminder, 40% of our approximately $15 billion funded and unfunded energy exposure is fair value or held for sale where we mark-to-market daily and have taken markdowns this quarter. Our energy exposure is down about $1 billion from last quarter. And importantly, we have not seen any meaningful signs of contagion. Lastly, average trading VaR for the fourth quarter was flat versus last quarter at $46 million. 
Wealth Management revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, down 2% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting muted client activity and unfavorable market environment as well as fewer trading days. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 21.4%, up slightly versus 4Q '15, reflecting the stability of the business. Bright spots for the quarter were continued momentum in our lending strategy and the ongoing secular trends in managed accounts. Flows for the quarter were approximately $6 billion with decent pickup in March. 
The NII story continues with net interest income up 7% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, driven by solid loan growth. Funded lending balances in Wealth Management grew approximately $2 billion or 5% during the quarter and $12 billion or 30% year-over-year. Credit metrics remained strong with an average FICO score of greater than 7 50 for our mortgage borrowers. Transactional activity was particularly weak as clients remained on the sidelines due to market volatility and a lack of new issues. The first quarter for commission revenues were the lowest we have seen in the last 5 years, reflecting the very cautious attitude of investors in this highly uncertain environment. As global and domestic uncertainties abate, we would expect to return to a more normal level of activity. 
On the expense side, compensation was down 3% quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower deferred compensation plans return. Non-compensation expenses were down 5% versus fourth quarter, driven by seasonally lower expenses in market spending and business development. Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were $152 billion in the first quarter, up $3 billion versus the fourth quarter, though lower than the quarter's peak, reflecting some improvement in client activity as market conditions have improved. 
In Investment Management, revenues were $477 million, down 23% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $526 million, up 5% versus 4Q, reflecting the steadiness of this revenue line, and AUM was essentially unchanged at $405 billion. Investment revenues in the quarter were a loss of $64 million, driven by volatility and particular weakness in emerging market investments, resulting in markdowns and some reversal of carry. Overall, expenses were down 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by compensation, which was down 23%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $808 billion at March 31, up from the $787 billion at December 31. The increase reflects a low fourth quarter spot asset level, given lower client activity at the end of the year as well as higher levels of liquidity in the first quarter. Our average balance sheet, however, was down to $802 billion in the quarter from $814 billion in 4Q. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $386 billion, down from $395 billion in the fourth quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced common equity tier 1 ratio increased to 14.5%. Our pro forma supplemental -- supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6%, up from 5.8% in Q4. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 25 million shares, and our board declared a $0.15 dividend per share. Lastly, in the quarter, as you'll see in our supplement, we modified our segment common equity allocation disclosure to basic on fully phased-in regulatory capital as the market has focused more on these ratios than the transitional ratios. As we have said in the past, we look at capital through multiple lenses, so this is not a totally new view for us. Capital was allocated based on risk-based and leverage-based requirements under both business-as-usual as well as stress scenarios. This resulted in a reduction in parent equity from $21 billion to $6 billion, and the resulting $15 billion is allocated across the segments. We will now allocate equity to our segments only at the beginning of the year, and it will remain fixed throughout the year. 
Turning to the outlook. Across sales and trading, we do not believe that the backdrop we saw in the first quarter will become a permanent state and have already seen some improvement in market conditions. However, given the numerous uncertainties across regions, we would expect to see some uneven markets and client activity. We are engaged with our clients and focused on delivering content, liquidity and solutions. 
In banking, M&A pipelines are healthy and client dialogues remain strong, but we would expect a slowdown from last year's elevated pace. We are cautiously optimistic that equity underwriting volumes will improve after a very muted first quarter, probably more weighted to the second half. We have seen IPOs in the U.S. and EMEA starting to come to market. How these transactions are received will be important to confidence going forward. 
In debt underwriting, we would expect the investment-grade markets to remain stable and are seeing signs of life in the non-investment-grade markets, although still selective at the bottom of the capital structure. 
In Wealth Management, we would expect to see the stability in trends seen in the last several quarters to continue. And in Investment Management, we expected asset management fees to remain stable and expect potential lumpiness in the investments line. We will continue to focus on Project Streamline in managing our risk profile. 
With that, we will open up the line to questions."

And then in this environment, obviously, the whole industry has some weakness, and revenues are down 20% for you guys. So when we think about those targets and that revenue range of up low single digits to down 20%, like, how much of the cost structure can be managed, particularly if we're not, obviously, not down 20%, but even if were plus or minus 5% on the revenue base, is that still in an environment, where by the end of 2017, the targets are still attainable?"

I think, first of all, the targets are, as you point out, 2017 targets, and they did have in the -- they were driven in part by 3 efforts: one, was Project Streamline and the ability to take out $1 billion of compensation/non-compensation expenses, assuming a flat revenue environment. The second was modest revenue growth of 3% to 5%, and then, of course, our continuing capital plans. I think it's -- I know we're going to get a lot of calls on this because that's a -- that's the perils of putting out a target is you get asked about it every time, every quarter, until you finally get there. But we did put it out for 2017, but -- so I think, it's very early days here. This is -- as we said, an unusual backdrop. I think everybody would acknowledge the calendar was very weak. As we said, retail investors were very skittish. We still had some cleanup in the Investment Management areas. So it was an unusual backdrop. So we're not really at the stage of second-guessing those targets at this point. What I was trying to make clear in my opening comments, that we're definitely not standing still. If indeed the environment continued as is, we would just be more aggressive on the cost front. That's our job, and we intend to do it. I'm not about to predict what that means in terms of targets. So we're standing by our 9% to 11% by the end of 2017, and let's see how this plays out over a couple of quarters. But we're very focused on this. We think this business mix is attractive against those kind of targets. We have no problem with that. We think we're in a position where, over time, we're going to be doing increasing capital distributions. We believe that the markets are unlikely to be at the level that we're at in the first quarter. But again, we have to deal with reality. If that turns out that is the case, we will react accordingly."

The digital platform is a really exciting opportunity for us. We've talked about a couple of things as being sort of secular trends. The role of managed account and people wanting advice for their balances is something that we can continue and was one of the premises for the merger of Smith Barney in the first place. And we saw that continue. We've got about $800 billion in managed accounts now, about 40% of our assets. And we think we can continue to grow that. And so that is a very important part of the strategy. And I think the digital strategy is just going to help provide our clients with the types of services they need. We have over 2.5 million households. Many of our clients like to interface with their advisers on the phone. Some like to come in. Some like to use technology.

There'll a couple of different components in there. But, let's -- first of all, let's put into context, when we look at at the first quarter of '15 versus the first quarter this year, I said, back in March, that wasn't really a good starting point for comparison for a couple of reasons. First of all, if you recall, last year, we benefited from the extreme weather in the first quarter. Not only was that from our physical oil business, but we saw a significantly higher level of client activity. Since also the first quarter of last year, we continue to restructure and reshape this business both in terms of its footprint and capital intensity. We sold the oil merchanting business in the first quarter or at the end of last year. We had about $190 billion of RWA dedicated to the business. And today, that number is closer to $130 billion. More recently, we changed the leadership, and then in December, we took out 25% of the headcount. So this is a different model -- excuse me, a different business. It's got less capital. It's more focused. In short, we're undertaking a major restructuring. It's against a difficult backdrop. The backdrop has been more negative against our more credit-oriented businesses. And we had a decent quarter. I wouldn't say that was a great quarter, but it was certainly decent. And we want to build on the early progress that we've seen here. We don't expect to see the types of quarters that we saw in the first quarter of '15, but we are focused on doing better and getting more consistent results. You asked about profitability levels. I think in January when we rolled out the strategy, we said we wanted a credible and critical Fixed Income business. We're going to take capital out. We were going to take costs out. We were going to try to maintain the revenue footprint. And therefore, it was obviously going to improve the overall profitability of the business. The last couple of years, we've generated somewhere in the order of $4.2 billion or $4.3 billion of revenue. We're trying to maintain that revenue base. The first quarter is slightly below that run rate, but it's again decent results. And we're still focused on trying to maintain that revenue footprint."

By that I mean, I think next year we'll see the GSIB buffer put into CCAR. And when that is put in, there are likely to be various other changes. As I understand, too, the CCAR model, which would net against that GSIB buffer. Once we have all of that under the 4 ratios in CCAR in each of [indiscernible] the 9 quarters, we'll have a much better sense of what our true capital buffer is. So at the moment, we're sailing a little bit blind. I mean the numbers we've laid out is what we see as a sort of visible buffer right now, but our hope is that, over time, this is not the final end state for us in terms of excess capital. We think, over time, that we will have more excess capital than that. But to get there, we need to do it within the confines of what the CCAR stress test are demanding. And as we get the final, what I think is likely to be the final architecture of CCAR next year, again, not the final models, but the final architecture, we will be able to adjust the business models accordingly."

Secondly, I do think that we obviously saw a pickup in March and signs of early April. We think we can improve our results. They're still below sort of what we've seen historically run rate in some of our stronger product areas. And we expect to improve our revenue results from this quarter. So again, this is one quarter's results. This quarter is a decent starting point because we didn't have the physical oil business in it, but we obviously had a difficult macro backdrop. But these numbers are probably more reflective of the opportunity going forward than the first quarter of 2015, and this is a multiyear process.

Firstly, as it relates to commodities, a lot of focus on the revenue delta year-over-year, which I understand. There was a cold snap last January that obviously flattened the commodities numbers there and obviously not having the business had a reasonably material impact on the revenue. But the broader picture is strategically what we're trying to do. I mean we -- there's a reason that one of the regulators determined that we had a credible plan and the other found only one efficiency. And part of it is because we've simplified our business model. There's a reason that we're confident about Project Streamline, and part of it is because we have few businesses, less infrastructure, less legal entities. And what we did with commodities and selling the physical oil business or get to that simplification reduces RWAs. It reduces capital. It reduces risks, audit compliance, legal, finance, oversight of that part of the business. It is all about simplifying Morgan Stanley and making it a better understandable business from a regulatory perspective and from an investor perspective. Nothing that have happened in the first quarter changes that view. On the expense side, yes, we've been grinding away at our non-comp expenses for a while. We've had some major headwinds with legal expenses, both with litigation and with the cost of lawyers in defending these various claims. We are clearly making progress on that. We're being focused, as Jon used the word maniacally, I think that's fair in our non-comp expenses. That is completely separate from Project Streamline. Project Streamline is a major firm-wide initiative to figure out the most efficient way to run our infrastructure with the most efficient footprint. So those 2 things will go unabated, irrespective of whether the second quarter is strong or weak -- whether the first quarter was strong or weak. There are things which we have clearly on plan. We need to get the ROE of this business up, and one of the ways we're going to do that is being much more efficient in our expense management."

We've seen good progress. You mentioned LIBOR. I think we're more sensitive to the Fed funds rate. We've seen a little bit pickup obviously given what happened in December, but I think the real growth in NII for us within the Wealth Management business is going to come from the fact that we expect the average earning assets to grow probably by -- in the bank, to grow probably by $10 billion to $15 billion this year. You saw some of the balances in the wealth business. It was up dramatically over last year's period. So the key driver to NII growth in the bank, which a good portion of that flows through Wealth Management is we're going to have more average earning assets growing -- yielding somewhere in this 2% range.

But the third lever would be capital return. And so how soon can investors see some of that freed up big capital? I mean you have 5% annualized buybacks this quarter, which is decent. But you also mentioned on the call now that you can reduce the impact to businesses with high stress losses. What are those businesses? Can you get rid of them? And how big are those?"

As I said, I",626,"Good morning, Mike. Nice to hear from you again. As you have I think pretty consistently been asking this management team to put a time frame on our ROE goals, and we did it in January. So in April, we are unlikely to back off of those goals. As I said, I think to the first question, which might have been from Mike Carrier, I think, when you asked about it. We stand by those goals. But as I said, and they weren't caveats, the reality, the implied that we hit our expense target on a flat revenue environment, that our total revenues grew somewhere between 3% and 5%, that we did the right thing around rightsizing our Fixed Income business and freeing up the right capital. As I think you said, we feel pretty good on the expense side. We made some really good progress against non-comp expenses and maintain comp discipline before we really got into the meat of Project Streamline. So I'd put a check us against the sort of early indicator on that one. On the revenue growth -- clearly, we didn't have revenue growth. So that would be a negative at this point one quarter into the program. But I mean clearly, things brightened up a little bit towards the end of the quarter. Not going to get into the business of trying to predict stuff, but we would be surprised and probably you would be most of this people of this call in this environment stay at this for the next 2 years. And hopefully, it was very clear that if it does, we will continue to take a significant action. We're not going to stand and just watch it. And on the capital plan, we just put in our CCAR submission. We have the GSIB buffer coming in the next year's capital plan. Our CET1 fully phased-in ratio, I think, is 14.5%, 14.6%. Our supplemental leverage ratio is 6%. A couple of years ago, supplemental leverage was 14 -- was 4.2%. I think CET1 fully phased-in is probably in the top 2 or 3 of the global 15 or 17 banks. So we feel very good about our capital ratios. What we need to understand is how we come through CCAR. The scenario obviously changes every year, depending upon economic conditions like interest rates and market shocks and the like. And as we see how the CCAR deals with certain parts of our business and the stress losses that are implied by that, we will adjust those businesses as necessary. It's too early to lay out what that might be because we haven't seen the results of it yet. But my main message to you and to our shareholders is that when we put out the 9% to 11%, again subject to the revenue growth I've talked about, which was modest, but was real, certainly not subject to negative revenue growth, we did it with a pretty well-thought through plan that's been building. And I'm the first to acknowledge that we haven't hit our cost of capital for the last several years. I think without being defensive about it, it's fair to say I'm not sure if any banks have. And I'm not sure that the denominator of what you are required to hold capital has been a standing ball. I think it's been a bouncing ball that's going up be every year. So listen, we're making steady progress. We're committed to our goal. We continue to push on expenses. We'll do what we can to free up excess capital. And we believe the environment is likely to improve from where we saw the bottom of the first quarter. More than that, I think it's too early to project."

As you noticed from my",307,"So on your first question. In terms of -- as you know, since taking over, I've been talking about -- we'll look at multiple lenses of capital, so we've been analyzing and looking at our businesses under multiple frames for a while. As you noticed from my prepared remarks and James' prepared remarks, we're always keep referencing a fully phased-in. It seems the market is not interested in what the actual transitional ratios are and they're more focused on fully phased-in. And so at the end of the year, we thought it was the right time as we start 2016 from a disclosure standpoint to put in the fully phased-in ratio numbers. In terms of the second question, I actually -- myself -- doesn't have it. And I just -- I'm looking for the page. There we go. My supplement is missing. Page 12, Glenn. Here we go. In the first quarter of '15, you saw the 19% Wealth Management ratio. I think that the better comparison, the change in the capital allocation, if you look at the middle 2 columns, the business went from 14 to 12. We did -- you saw that the revenues were slightly off this quarter. And so -- we -- the PBT that was down. Part of our Wealth Management business, as you properly point out, is a lending business. And so when we moved into the fully phased-in ratios, we allocated more capital to that business as it continues to grow in that high-quality lending book. The ROE for this quarter was slightly improved to 13. We think that business can be better than the 13% ratio that we are showing, particularly if we see some better signs in the transactional activity. So we think we can build from 13%, but this business does require capital given our lending focus."

Potentially, the minimum level of capital you need for CCAR to get through the test on [indiscernible] supporting higher payouts? And the back of the envelope math suggests that when exclude the unallocated portion and goodwill and intangibles, you're allocating $52 billion across your businesses and as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, that's about 13% target. So a little bit higher from what we were contemplating previously. I just wanted to get a sense whether a 13% core Tier 1 is a reasonable long-term target based on the current mix? And should we expect this to come down? Or how should we expect it to project as litigation efforts take hold?"

While our absolute level of our spot capital ratios won't be the ultimate determinant of how much capital we can return.

Obviously, 2016 got off to a difficult start. Markets were challenging. Equity issuance was effectively nonexistent, and retail activity was extremely subdued, reflecting the many uncertainties with which investors grappled. These included negative interest rates internationally, questions around the pace of Fed activity in the U.S., the growth rate of the Chinese economy and growing concerns about geopolitical issues like the migration crisis and potential Brexit, among others. The securities businesses were exposed to a number of these factors, which led to a more challenging revenue environment than what we have come to expect in the first quarter of the year. That said, all was not lost. M&A was robust. Equities once again delivered a strong performance, and Wealth Management generated a pretax margin greater than 21% despite market headwinds and fewer trading days. We made real progress in our expense discipline ahead of our broader initiative called Project Streamline, which, as we said, will play out over the next 2 years. 
So where are we now? Though it's impossible to predict the future, we're seeing a slightly better turn in markets, certainly in comparison to what was evident at the start of the first quarter, leading into the early days of February. The M&A pipeline is strong, and some green shoots suggests the equity underwriting calendar may open up. The S&P level at the end of the first quarter will help with asset price in our Wealth Management business, where we continue to grow our lending book and see flows into managed accounts. Importantly, Fixed Income, notwithstanding the 25% cut in headcount, improved sequentially. By no means can FIC be considered strong, but the business is showing some resilience in this difficult environment. 
In January, we laid our strategic goals for 2016 and 2017. While we've yet to see the revenue growth we anticipated, it remains early days. In a minute, Jon would take you through the progress we've made to date. It must be said that if these markets where to continue as is, our goals would be extremely difficult to achieve, and we would therefore take additional appropriate actions. We obviously accept the degree of volatility in the revenue environment that has led to lower revenue pools, although we do not expect this as a permanent state. We also recognize that we cannot control the environment in which we operate, but we are focused on what we can control, such as expenses. As part of Streamline, we are reshaping our expense base and have embarked on an aggressive evaluation of our global infrastructure cost, reviewing each product, business and geography globally to convince ourselves that we need our footprint as it is currently configured. 
We operate under a multitude of capital tests and requirements. In January, we discussed our belief that we have sufficient capital for our business mix and risk profile, and we're taking actions that could -- should result in longer-term reduced capital requirements. For SLR and CET1, we are well in excess of the requirements in which we will be subject to in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In terms of capital return, which has been one of the cornerstones of our strategic plan, our binding constraint is CCAR. To be clear, this is not a comment with respect to our capital return plans for this year, which we deem appropriate, but more for the following years. In order to drive capital returns to shareholders on a more substantial base than our current CCAR submission is asking for, we must continue to reduce those parts of our business that give rise to the high stress losses and capital deductions and/or balance sheet usage. 
While in a difficult quarter, we still made $1 billion, our ROE was 6%. This is not acceptable. Finally, we received feedback last week on our resolution plan, which was deemed credible by the FDIC, but on account of one deficiency, was not deemed credible by the Federal Reserve. As you saw, we received very detailed comments, and we are confident we'll be able to address the items that were raised. We've dedicated significant resources and time to this important priority and will continue to work with our regulators to improve it. This management team would do what is necessary to ensure that we continue to progress against our strategic plan. 
I look forward to doing an update at the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference in June. So let me now turn it over to, Jon, to walk through the quarter in greater detail. Thank you."

Good morning. As James said, the beginning of 2016 got off to a challenging start as negative sentiment and volatility prevailed in the global markets, undermining the traditional strength in client activity we have typically seen at the start of the year. Concerns about global growth, China, commodities and interest rates resulted in divergent performance of global indices and mixed results across international markets. Against this turbulent backdrop, we remain focused on delivering for our clients and helping them navigate these difficult markets. We continued to demonstrate strength in our equities and M&A businesses and stability in Wealth Management. For the quarter, we reported revenues of $7.8 billion, essentially flat versus fourth quarter '15, when excluding DVA for the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we early adopted the accounting guidance that requires that DVA be presented in accumulated other comprehensive income as opposed to net revenues. Results for previous quarters shown in the supplement were not subject to restatement under the guidance. In my remarks, the prior period amounts exclude DVA. 
Noninterest expense for the quarter was $6.1 billion, comprised of $3.7 billion of compensation expense and $2.4 billion of non-compensation expenses. We remain focused on reducing expenses, and as James mentioned, Streamline initiatives have begun to take shape. Some of the areas we are focused on in Streamline include: first, our workforce strategy. We continue to remix our global workforce and have approximately 40% of our infrastructure employees in our centers of excellence around the world. We are targeting to increase the number of employees deployed by 10% to 15% and are actively working toward achieving this by year-end 2017. Many of the initiatives involve leveraging best-in-class technologies. For instance, we are adopting virtualization and private cloud computing to increase agility and asset utilization while achieving a significant reduction in our data center expenses. We are building the next-generation Wealth Management desktop and mobile suite for both our financial advisers and clients while optimizing and automating our operations and workflow. We're also partnering with incumbent technology companies and emerging start-ups on a number of initiatives to improve efficiency and lower costs. And lastly, we are focused on rationalizing our footprint and infrastructure to ensure we are as efficient and productive as possible. In particular, there are opportunities across our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management businesses, where we have the ability to drive efficiencies while improving collaboration. 
Turning to Institutional Securities. Revenues were $3.7 billion, up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, down 13% versus the fourth quarter, driven by a decline in professional services. Compensation expenses were $1.4 billion, reflecting a 37% ISG compensation ratio. In Investment Banking, we saw continued strength in our M&A businesses, offset by a tougher backdrop for our underwriting businesses. IPO volumes were down 82% quarter-on-quarter, and high-yield volumes were down off of already low levels in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, we generated $990 million in revenues, down 18% sequentially. Advisory revenues for the quarter were the strongest postcrisis at $591 million, up 15% as the deals announced last year continue to close. Equity underwriting revenues were $160 million, down 55% versus 4Q, driven largely by the significant decreases in IPOs. Fixed Income underwriting revenues were $239 million, down 31% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting a slowdown in high-yield and leverage loan markets. In equities, we saw continued leadership with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 13% sequentially. Prime brokerage revenues were higher this quarter as we work closely with our clients and continue to focus on the efficiency of our balance sheet and returns. Derivatives revenues were up sequentially driven by increased client activity as clients try to navigate volatility and hedge risk exposures. And cash equity revenues were down versus 4Q against the backdrop of lower global equity markets and a limited new issue calendar. And we continue to show leadership in our electronic products suite. 
Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading revenues were $873 million, up 59% versus the fourth quarter, although down 54% versus the first quarter of 2015, when we had a very strong commodities quarter, both in our oil merchanting business, which we sold in 4Q last year and our commodities trading businesses. Throughout the quarter, we saw a continuation of the challenges experienced in the second half of 2015. This translated into ongoing muted levels of client activity across our Fixed Income & Commodities business. Despite these headwinds and the 25% reduction in headcount, we maintained our client focus and improved results from the fourth quarter. We saw some improvement quarter-over-quarter in corporate credit, with strength in investment grade, and we saw continued weakness across commodities. Fixed Income RWAs were down $4 billion in the quarter to $132 billion, and our SLR balance sheet was down approximately $9 billion to $345 billion. While revenues were for the quarter were up sequentially, they are not where we ultimately want them to be. We're focused on driving execution and bringing our sales and trading businesses together to leverage synergies across the platform. 
Other sales and trading revenues were down quarter-over-quarter driven by hedging losses for our relationship lending book. Other revenues were down versus fourth quarter driven by an increase in our allowance for loan losses or are held for investment portfolio. In the quarter, we have continued to see pressure on the energy complex and have seen some credit migration and some bankruptcies. Our loan loss provision on our HFI portfolio of $127 million this quarter was predominantly against our energy portfolio. As a reminder, 40% of our approximately $15 billion funded and unfunded energy exposure is fair value or held for sale where we mark-to-market daily and have taken markdowns this quarter. Our energy exposure is down about $1 billion from last quarter. And importantly, we have not seen any meaningful signs of contagion. Lastly, average trading VaR for the fourth quarter was flat versus last quarter at $46 million. 
Wealth Management revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, down 2% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting muted client activity and an unfavorable market environment as well as fewer trading days. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 21.4%, up slightly versus 4Q '15, reflecting the stability of the business. Bright spots for the quarter were continued momentum in our lending strategy and the ongoing secular trends in managed accounts. Flows for the quarter were approximately $6 billion with decent pickup in March. 
The NII story continues with net interest income up 7% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, driven by solid loan growth. Funded lending balances in Wealth Management grew approximately $2 billion or 5% during the quarter and $12 billion or 30% year-over-year. Credit metrics remained strong with an average FICO score of greater than 7 50 for our mortgage borrowers. Transactional activity was particularly weak as clients remained on the sidelines due to market volatility and a lack of new issues. The first quarter for commission revenues were the lowest we have seen in the last 5 years, reflecting the very cautious attitude of investors in this highly uncertain environment. As global and domestic uncertainties abate, we would expect to return to a more normal level of activity. 
On the expense side, compensation was down 3% quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower deferred compensation plans returns. Non-compensation expenses were down 5% versus fourth quarter, driven by seasonally lower expenses in market spending and business development. Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were $152 billion in the first quarter, up $3 billion versus the fourth quarter, though lower than the quarter's peak, reflecting some improvement in client activity as market conditions have improved. 
In Investment Management, revenues were $477 million, down 23% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $526 million, up 5% versus 4Q, reflecting the steadiness of this revenue line, and AUM was essentially unchanged at $405 billion. Investment revenues in the quarter were a loss of $64 million, driven by volatility and particular weakness in emerging market investments, resulting in markdowns and some reversal of carry. Overall, expenses were down 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by compensation, which was down 23%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $808 billion at March 31, up from the $787 billion at December 31. The increase reflects a low fourth quarter spot asset level, given lower client activity at the end of the year as well as higher levels of liquidity in the first quarter. Our average balance sheet, however, was down to $802 billion in the quarter from $814 billion in 4Q. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $386 billion, down from $395 billion in the fourth quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced common equity tier 1 ratio increased to 14.5%. Our pro forma supplemental -- supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6%, up from 5.8% in Q4. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 25 million shares, and our board declared a $0.15 dividend per share. Lastly, in the quarter, as you'll see in our supplement, we modified our segment common equity allocation disclosure to basic on fully phased-in regulatory capital as the market has focused more on these ratios than the transitional ratios. As we have said in the past, we look at capital through multiple lenses, so this is not a totally new view for us. Capital was allocated based on risk-based and leverage-based requirements under both business-as-usual as well as stress scenarios. This resulted in a reduction in parent equity from $21 billion to $6 billion, and the resulting $15 billion is allocated across the segments. We will now allocate equity to our segments only at the beginning of the year, and it will remain fixed throughout the year. 
Turning to the outlook. Across sales and trading, we do not believe that the backdrop we saw in the first quarter will become a permanent state and have already seen some improvement in market conditions. However, given the numerous uncertainties across regions, we would expect to see some uneven markets and client activity. We are engaged with our clients and focused on delivering content, liquidity and solutions. 
In banking, M&A pipelines are healthy and client dialogues remain strong, but we would expect a slowdown from last year's elevated pace. We are cautiously optimistic that equity underwriting volumes will improve after a very muted first quarter, probably more weighted to the second half. We have seen IPOs in the U.S. and EMEA starting to come to market. How these transactions are received will be important to confidence going forward. 
In debt underwriting, we would expect the investment-grade markets to remain stable and are seeing signs of life in the non-investment-grade markets, although still selective at the bottom of the capital structure. 
In Wealth Management, we would expect to see the stability in trends seen in the last several quarters to continue. And in Investment Management, we expected asset management fees to remain stable and expect potential lumpiness in the investments line. We will continue to focus on Project Streamline and managing our risk profile. 
With that, we will open up the line to questions."

So when we think about those targets and that revenue range of up low single digits to down 20%, like, how much of the cost structure can be managed, particularly if we're not, obviously, not down 20%, but even if were plus or minus 5% on the revenue base, is that still an environment, where by the end of 2017, the targets are still attainable?"

I think, first of all, the targets are, as you point out, 2017 targets, and they did have in them -- they were driven in part by 3 efforts: one, was Project Streamline and the ability to take out $1 billion of compensation/non-compensation expenses, assuming a flat revenue environment. The second was modest revenue growth of 3% to 5%, and then, of course, our continuing capital plans. I think it's -- I know we're going to get a lot of calls on this because that's a -- that's the perils of putting out a target is you get asked about it every time, every quarter, until you finally get there. But we did put it out for 2017, but -- so I think, it's very early days here. This is -- as we said, an unusual backdrop. I think everybody would acknowledge the calendar was very weak. As we said, retail investors were very skittish. We still had some cleanup in the Investment Management areas. So it was an unusual backdrop. So we're not really at the stage of second-guessing those targets at this point. What I was trying to make clear in my opening comments, that we're definitely not standing still. If indeed the environment continued as is, we would be more aggressive on the cost front. That's our job, and we intend to do it. I'm not about to predict what that means in terms of targets. We're standing by our 9% to 11% by the end of 2017, and let's see how this plays out over a couple of quarters. But we're very focused on this. We think this business mix is attractive against those kinds of targets. We have no problem with that. We think we're in a position where, over time, we're going to be doing increasing capital distributions. We believe that the markets are unlikely to be at the level that we're at in the first quarter. But again, we have to deal with reality. If it turns out that is the case, we will react accordingly."

I think in terms of the trends in the business, again, we've been very pleased with the stability of this business. We've been investing in this business for a while. We've been yielding the synergies of bringing the 2 platforms together, bringing the teams together. And the results have been reasonably stable in what is a difficult backdrop. The digital platform is a really exciting opportunity for us. We've talked about a couple of things as being sort of secular trends. The role of managed account and people wanting advice for their balances is something that we can continue and was one of the premises for the merger of Smith Barney in the first place. And we saw that continue. We've got about $800 billion in managed accounts now, about 40% of our assets. And we think we can continue to grow that. And so that is a very important part of the strategy. And I think the digital strategy is just going to help provide our clients with the types of services they need. We have over 2.5 million households. Many of our clients like to interface with their advisers on the phone. Some like to come in. Some like to use technology. So making sure we have good products and services across that full spectrum is going to be important. And I think the recent hire that we made on our digital strategy to lead that in Wealth Management are going to -- is really going to yield some interesting innovations going forward."

There are a couple of different components there. But, let's -- first of all, let's put into context, when we look at the first quarter of '15 versus the first quarter this year, I said, back in March, that wasn't really a good starting point for comparison for a couple of reasons. First of all, if you recall, last year, we benefited from the extreme weather in the first quarter. Not only was that from our physical oil business, but we saw significantly higher levels of client activity. Since also the first quarter of last year, we continue to restructure and reshape this business both in terms of its footprint and capital intensity. We sold the oil merchanting business in the first quarter or at the end of last year. We had about $190 billion of RWA dedicated to the business. And today, that number is closer to $130 billion. More recently, we changed the leadership, and then in December, we took out 25% of the headcount. So this is a different model -- excuse me, a different business. It's got less capital. It's more focused. In short, we're undertaking a major restructuring. It's against a difficult backdrop. The backdrop has been more negative against our more credit-oriented businesses. And we had a decent quarter. I wouldn't say it was a great quarter, but it was certainly decent. And we want to build on the early progress that we've seen here. We don't expect to see the types of quarters that we saw in the first quarter of '15, but we are focused on doing better and getting more consistent results. You asked about profitability levels. I think in January when we rolled out the strategy, we said we wanted a credible and critical Fixed Income business. We're going to take capital out. We were going to take costs out. We were going to try to maintain the revenue footprint. And therefore, it was obviously going to improve the overall profitability of the business. The last couple of years, we've generated somewhere in the order of $4.2 billion or $4.3 billion of revenue. We're trying to maintain that revenue base. The first quarter is slightly below that run rate, but it's again decent results. And we're still focused on trying to maintain that revenue footprint."

That doesn't mean that the actual scenarios won't change year to year. Of course, they're going to change year to year, but the architecture will be in place. By that I mean, I think next year we'll see the GSIB buffer put into CCAR. And when that is put in, there are likely to be various other changes. As I understand it, too, the CCAR model, which would net against the GSIB buffer. Once we have all of that under the 4 ratios in CCAR in each of them over the 9 quarters, we'll have a much better sense of what our true capital buffer is. So at the moment, we're sailing a little bit blind. I mean the numbers we've laid out is what we see as sort of visible buffer right now, but our hope is that, over time, this is not the final end state for us in terms of excess capital. We think, over time, that we will have more excess capital than that. But to get there, we need to do it within the confines of what the CCAR stress tests are demanding. And as we get the final, what I think is likely to be the final architecture of CCAR next year, again, not the final models, but the final architecture, we will be able to adjust the business models accordingly."

So we would expect more quarters to look similar than the volatility that we've seen in the past. It is the first comment. Secondly, I do think that we obviously saw a pickup in March and the signs of early April. We think we can improve our results. They're still below sort of what we've seen historically run rate in some of our stronger product areas. And we expect to improve our revenue results from this quarter. So again, this is one quarter's results. This quarter is a decent starting point because we didn't have the physical oil business in it, but we obviously had a difficult macro backdrop. But these numbers are probably more reflective of the opportunity going forward than the first quarter of 2015 and this is a multiyear process.

Firstly, it relates to commodities, a lot of focus on the revenue delta year-over-year, which I understand, there was a cold snap last January that obviously flatted the commodities numbers there and obviously not having the business had a reasonably material impact on the revenues, but the broader picture is strategically what we're trying to do. I mean we -- there's a reason that one of the regulators determined that we had a credible plan and the other found only one deficiency, and part of it is because we've simplified our business model. There's a reason that we're confident about Project Streamline, and part of it is because we have fewer businesses, less infrastructure, less legal entities. And what we did with commodities and then selling the physical oil business, all get to that simplification. It reduces RWAs, it reduces capital, it reduces risks, audit compliance, legal, finance, oversight of that part of the business, and it's all about simplifying Morgan Stanley and making it a better understandable business from a regulatory perspective and from an investor perspective. Nothing that happened in the first quarter changes that view. On the expense side, yes, we've been grinding away at our non-comp expenses for a while. We've had some major headwinds with legal expenses, both with litigation and with the cost of lawyers in defending these various claims. We are clearly making progress on that. We're being focused, as Jon used the word maniacally, I think that's fair on our non-comp expenses. That is completely separate from Project Streamline. Project Streamline is a major firm-wide initiative to figure out the most efficient way to run our infrastructure with the most efficient footprint. So those 2 things will go unabated, irrespective of whether the second quarter is strong or weak or the first quarter was strong or weak. They are things which we have clearly on plan. We need to get the ROE of this business up, and one of the ways we're going to do that is being much more efficient in our expense management."

You mentioned LIBOR. I think, we're more sensitive to the Fed funds rate. We've seen a little bit pickup obviously given what happened in December, but I think the real growth in NII for us within the Wealth Management business is going to come from the fact that we expect the average earning assets to grow probably by -- in the bank to grow probably by $10 billion to $15 billion this year. You saw some of the balances in the wealth business. It was up dramatically over last year's period. So the key driver to NII growth in the bank, which good portion of that flows through Wealth Management, is we're going to have more average earning assets growing -- yielding somewhere in this 2% range.

And the ROE has been below the cost of capital for the last decade. And the market further expects you to miss your 2017 ROE target of 9% based on consensus earnings forecast. I might add, based on the stock price below, it's tangible book value. So the question is, do you think that you can still meet your 2017 ROE target of 9%, and why? And -- from my standpoint, there's 3 big levers: one would be expenses, which you've highlighted, and you said it, let me say we -- you can take more actions; two would be markets getting better, an early sign. But the third lever would be capital return. And so how soon can investors see some of that freed up big capital? I mean you have 5% annualized buybacks this quarter, which is decent. But you also mentioned on the call now that you can reduce the impact to businesses with high stress losses. What are those businesses? Can you get rid of them, and how big are those?"

As you have, I think, pretty consistently been asking this management team to put a time frame on our ROE goals, and we did it in January. So in April, we are unlikely to back off of those goals as I said. I think to the first question, which might have been from Mike Carrier, I think, when he asked about it, we stand by those goals. But as I said, and they weren't caveats, they were just reality. They implied that we hit our expense targets on the flat revenue environment, that our total revenues grew somewhere between 3% and 5%, and that we did the right thing around rightsizing our Fixed Income business and freeing up the right capital. As I think, you said, we feel pretty good honestly about the expense targets. We made some really good progress against non-comp expenses and maintain comp discipline before we really got into the meat of Project Streamline. So I'd put a check against sort of early indicator on that one. On the revenue growth, clearly, we didn't have revenue growth. So that would be a negative at this point, one quarter into the program. But, I mean, clearly, things brightened up a little bit towards the end of the quarter. Not going to get into the business of trying to predict stuff, but we would be surprised, and probably you would be and most of people on this call if this environment stays as it is for the next 2 years. And hopefully, I was very clear that if it does, we will continue to take a significant action. We're not going to stand and just watch it. And on the capital plan, we've just put in our CCAR submission. We have the GSIB buffer coming in the next year's capital plan. Our CET1 fully phased-in ratio, I think, is 14.5%, 14.6%. Our supplemental leverage ratio is 6%. A couple of years ago, supplemental leverage was 14 -- was 4.2%. I think our CET1 fully phased-in is probably in the top 2 or 3 of the global 15 or 17 banks. So we feel very good about our capital ratios. What we need to understand is how we come through CCAR. The [indiscernible] scenario obviously changes every year depending upon the economic conditions like interest rates and market shocks and the like. And as we see how the CCAR deals with certain parts of our business and the stress losses that are implied by that, we will adjust those businesses as necessary. It's too early to lay out what that might be because we haven't seen the results of it yet. But my main message to you and to our shareholders is that when we put out the 9% to 11%, again subject to the revenue growth I've talked about, which was modest, but was real, certainly not subject to negative revenue growth, we did it with a pretty well-thought through plan that's been building. I'm the first to acknowledge that we haven't hit our cost of capital for the last several years. I think without being defensive about it, it's fair to say I'm not sure very many banks have. And I'm not sure that the denominator of what you are required to hold in capital has been a standing ball. In fact, it's been a bouncing ball that's going up be every year. So listen, we're making steady progress. We're committed to our goals. We'll continue pushing on expenses. We'll do what we can to free up excess capital. And we believe the environment is likely to improve from where we saw the bottoms of the first quarter. More than that, I think it's too early to project."

As you noticed from my prepared remarks and James' prepared remarks, we always keep referencing now fully phased-in. It seems like the market is not interested in what the actual transitional ratios are, and they're more focused on fully phased-in. And so at the end of the year, we thought it was the right time as we start 2016 from a disclosure standpoint to put in the fully phased-in ratio numbers. In terms of the second question, I actually -- myself have been doesn't have it. Can I just -- I'm looking for the page. There we go. My supplement is missing, Page 12, Glenn. Here we go. So in the first quarter of '15, you saw the 19% Wealth Management ratio. I think the better comparison, the change in the capital allocation, if you look at the middle 2 columns, the business went from 14% to 12%. We did -- you saw that the revenues were slightly off this quarter. And so -- we -- the PBT that was down. Part of our Wealth Management business, as you properly point out, is a lending business. And so when we move to the fully phased-in ratios, we allocated more capital to that business as it continues to grow in that high-quality lending book. The ROE for this quarter was slightly improved to 13%. We think that business can be better than the 13% ratio that we are showing, particularly if we see some better signs in the transactional activity. So we think we can build from 13%, but this business does require capital given our lending focus."

It was negative $64 million, about 1/3 -- little less than 1/3 of that, Glenn, was from reversal of carry. The rest was from investment markdowns. And then in terms of what we have left, as we've said in prior quarters, we have written a significant portion of our carry related to our Asia funds down at this point.

And on one of the questions we're getting quite a bit is how we should reconcile the revised fully phased-in capital allocation that you have with essentially a CCAR-required capital or spot-required capital target? Potentially, the minimum level of capital you'll need for CCAR to get through the test on scale to offer so as to reporting higher payouts? And the back of the envelope math suggests that when we exclude the unallocated portion and goodwill and intangibles, you're allocating $52 billion across your businesses and as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, that's about 13% target. So little bit higher than what we were contemplating previously. And I just wanted to get a sense as to whether 13% core Tier 1 is a reasonable long-term target based on the current mix? And should we expect this to come down? Or how should we expect it to traject as FIC mitigation efforts take hold?"

While our absolute level of our spot capital ratios won't be the ultimate determinant of how much capital we can return, but actually, the Fed's stress test, in their severely adverse case, will be the driving force about how much capital we can return.

Obviously, 2016 got off to a difficult start. Markets were challenging. Equity issuance was effectively nonexistent, and retail activity was extremely subdued, reflecting the many uncertainties with which investors grappled. These included negative interest rates internationally, questions around the pace of Fed activity in the U.S., the growth rate of the Chinese economy and growing concerns about geopolitical issues like the migration crisis and potential Brexit, among others. The securities businesses were exposed to a number of these factors, which led to a more challenging revenue environment than what we have come to expect in the first quarter of the year. That said, all was not lost. M&A was robust. Equities once again delivered a strong performance, and Wealth Management generated a pretax margin greater than 21% despite market headwinds and fewer trading days. We made real progress in our expense discipline ahead of our broader initiative called Project Streamline, which, as we said, will play out over the next 2 years. 
So where are we now? Though it's impossible to predict the future, we're seeing a slightly better turn in markets, certainly in comparison to what was evident at the start of the first quarter, leading into the early days of February. The M&A pipeline is strong, and some green shoots suggests the equity underwriting calendar may open up. The S&P level at the end of the first quarter will help with asset price in our Wealth Management business, where we continue to grow our lending book and see flows into managed accounts. Importantly, Fixed Income, notwithstanding the 25% cut in headcount, improved sequentially. By no means can FIC be considered strong, but the business is showing some resilience in this difficult environment. 
In January, we laid our strategic goals for 2016 and 2017. While we've yet to see the revenue growth we anticipated, it remains early days. In a minute, Jon would take you through the progress we've made to date. It must be said that if these markets were to continue as is, our goals would be extremely difficult to achieve, and we would therefore take additional appropriate actions. We obviously accept a degree of volatility in the revenue environment that has led to lower revenue pools, although we do not expect this as a permanent state. We also recognize that we cannot control the environment in which we operate, but we are focused on what we can control, such as expenses. As part of Streamline, we are reshaping our expense base and have embarked on an aggressive evaluation of our global infrastructure cost, reviewing each product, business and geography globally to convince ourselves that we need our footprint as it is currently configured. 
We operate under a multitude of capital tests and requirements. In January, we discussed our belief that we have sufficient capital for our business mix and risk profile, and we're taking actions that could -- should result in longer-term reduced capital requirements. For SLR and CET1, we are well in excess of the requirements in which we will be subject to in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In terms of capital return, which has been one of the cornerstones of our strategic plan, our binding constraint is CCAR. To be clear, this is not a comment with respect to our capital return plans for this year, which we deem appropriate, but more for the following years. In order to drive capital returns to shareholders on a more substantial base than our current CCAR submission is asking for, we must continue to reduce those parts of our business that give rise to the high stress losses and capital deductions and/or balance sheet usage. 
While in a difficult quarter, we still made $1 billion, our ROE was 6%. This is not acceptable. Finally, we received feedback last week on our resolution plan, which was deemed credible by the FDIC, but on account of one deficiency, was not deemed credible by the Federal Reserve. As you saw, we received very detailed comments, and we are confident we'll be able to address the items that were raised. We've dedicated significant resources and time to this important priority and will continue to work with our regulators to improve it. This management team would do what is necessary to ensure that we continue to progress against our strategic plan. 
I look forward to doing an update at the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference in June. So let me now turn it over to, Jon, to walk through the quarter in greater detail. Thank you."

Good morning. As James said, the beginning of 2016 got off to a challenging start as negative sentiment and volatility prevailed in the global markets, undermining the traditional strength in client activity we have typically seen at the start of the year. Concerns about global growth, China, commodities and interest rates resulted in divergent performance of global indices and mixed results across international markets. Against this turbulent backdrop, we remain focused on delivering for our clients and helping them navigate these difficult markets. We continued to demonstrate strength in our equities and M&A businesses and stability in Wealth Management. For the quarter, we reported revenues of $7.8 billion, essentially flat versus fourth quarter '15, when excluding DVA for the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we early adopted the accounting guidance that requires that DVA be presented in accumulated other comprehensive income as opposed to net revenues. Results for previous quarters shown in the supplement were not subject to restatement under the guidance. In my remarks, the prior period amounts exclude DVA. 
Noninterest expense for the quarter were $6.1 billion, comprised of $3.7 billion of compensation expense and $2.4 billion of non-compensation expenses. We remained focused on reducing expenses, and as James mentioned, Streamline initiatives have begun to take shape. Some of the areas we are focused on in Streamline include: first, our workforce strategy. We continue to remix our global workforce and have approximately 40% of our infrastructure employees in our centers of excellence around the world. We are targeting to increase the number of employees deployed by 10% to 15% and are actively working toward achieving this by year-end 2017. Many of the initiatives involve leveraging best-in-class technologies. For instance, we are adopting virtualization and private cloud computing to increase agility and asset utilization while achieving a significant reduction in our data center expenses. We are building the next-generation Wealth Management desktop and mobile suite for both our financial advisers and clients while optimizing and automating our operations and workflow. We're also partnering with incumbent technology companies and emerging start-ups on a number of initiatives to improve efficiency and lower costs. And lastly, we are focused on rationalizing our footprint and infrastructure to ensure we are as efficient and productive as possible. In particular, there are opportunities across our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management businesses, where we have the ability to drive efficiencies while improving collaboration. 
Turning to Institutional Securities. Revenues were $3.7 billion, up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, down 13% versus the fourth quarter, driven by a decline in professional services. Compensation expenses were $1.4 billion, reflecting a 37% ISG compensation ratio. In Investment Banking, we saw continued strength in our M&A business, offset by a tougher backdrop for our underwriting businesses. IPO volumes were down 82% quarter-on-quarter, and high-yield volumes were down off of already low levels in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, we generated $990 million in revenues, down 18% sequentially. Advisory revenues for the quarter were the strongest post-crisis at $591 million, up 15% as the deals announced last year continue to close. Equity underwriting revenues were $160 million, down 55% versus 4Q, driven largely by the significant decreases in IPOs. Fixed Income underwriting revenues were $239 million, down 31% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting a slowdown in high-yield and leverage loan markets. In equities, we saw continued leadership with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 13% sequentially. Prime brokerage revenues were higher this quarter as we work closely with our clients and continue to focus on the efficiency of our balance sheet and returns. Derivatives revenues were up sequentially driven by increased client activity as clients try to navigate volatility and hedge risk exposures. And cash equity revenues were down versus 4Q against the backdrop of lower global equity markets and a limited new issue calendar. And we continue to show leadership in our electronic products suite. 
Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading revenues were $873 million, up 59% versus the fourth quarter, although down 54% versus the first quarter of 2015, when we had a very strong commodities quarter, both in our oil merchanting business, which we sold in 4Q last year and our commodities trading businesses. Throughout the quarter, we saw a continuation of the challenges experienced in the second half of 2015. This translated into ongoing muted levels of client activity across our Fixed Income & Commodities business. Despite these headwinds and the 25% reduction in headcount, we maintained our client focus and improved results from the fourth quarter. We saw some improvement quarter-over-quarter in corporate credit, with strength in investment grade, and we saw continued weakness across commodities. Fixed Income RWAs were down $4 billion in the quarter to $132 billion, and our SLR balance sheet was down approximately $9 billion to $345 billion. While revenues were for the quarter were up sequentially, they are not where we ultimately want them to be. We're focused on driving execution and bringing our sales and trading businesses together to leverage synergies across the platform. 
Other sales and trading revenues were down quarter-over-quarter driven by hedging losses for our relationship lending book. Other revenues were down versus fourth quarter driven by an increase in our allowance for loan losses or are held for investment portfolio. In the quarter, we have continued to see pressure on the energy complex and have seen some credit migration and some bankruptcies. Our loan loss provision on our HFI portfolio of $127 million this quarter was predominantly against our energy portfolio. As a reminder, 40% of our approximately $15 billion funded and unfunded energy exposure is fair value or held for sale where we mark-to-market daily and have taken markdowns this quarter. Our energy exposure is down about $1 billion from last quarter. And importantly, we have not seen any meaningful signs of contagion. Lastly, average trading VaR for the fourth quarter was flat versus last quarter at $46 million. 
Wealth Management revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, down 2% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting muted client activity in an unfavorable market environment as well as fewer trading days. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 21.4%, up slightly versus 4Q '15, reflecting the stability of the business. Bright spots for the quarter were continued momentum in our lending strategy and the ongoing secular trends in managed accounts. Flows for the quarter were approximately $6 billion with decent pickup in March. 
The NII story continues with net interest income up 7% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, driven by solid loan growth. Funded lending balances in Wealth Management grew approximately $2 billion or 5% during the quarter and $12 billion or 30% year-over-year. Credit metrics remained strong with an average FICO score of greater than 7 50 for our mortgage borrowers. Transactional activity was particularly weak as clients remained on the sidelines due to market volatility and a lack of new issues. The first quarter for commission revenues were the lowest we have seen in the last 5 years, reflecting the very cautious attitude of investors in this highly uncertain environment. As global and domestic uncertainties abate, we would expect to return to a more normal level of activity. 
On the expense side, compensation was down 3% quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower deferred compensation plans returns. Non-compensation expenses were down 5% versus fourth quarter, driven by seasonally lower expenses in marketing and business development. Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were $152 billion in the first quarter, up $3 billion versus the fourth quarter, though lower than the quarter's peak, reflecting some improvement in client activity as market conditions have improved. 
In Investment Management, revenues were $477 million, down 23% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $526 million, up 5% versus 4Q, reflecting the steadiness of this revenue line, and AUM was essentially unchanged at $405 billion. Investment revenues in the quarter were a loss of $64 million, driven by volatility and particular weakness in emerging market investments, resulting in markdowns and some reversal of carry. Overall, expenses were down 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by compensation, which was down 23%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $808 billion at March 31, up from the $787 billion at December 31. The increase reflects a low fourth quarter spot asset level, given lower client activity at the end of the year as well as higher levels of liquidity in the first quarter. Our average balance sheet, however, was down to $802 billion in the quarter from $814 billion in 4Q. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $386 billion, down from $395 billion in the fourth quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced common equity tier 1 ratio increased to 14.5%. Our pro forma supplemental -- supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6%, up from 5.8% in Q4. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 25 million shares, and our board declared a $0.15 dividend per share. Lastly, in the quarter, as you'll see in our supplement, we modified our segment common equity allocation disclosure to base it on fully phased-in regulatory capital as the market has focused more on these ratios than the transitional ratios. As we have said in the past, we look at capital through multiple lenses, so this is not a totally new view for us. Capital was allocated based on risk-based and leverage-based requirements under both business-as-usual as well as stress scenarios. This resulted in a reduction in parent equity from $21 billion to $6 billion, and the resulting $15 billion is allocated across the segments. We will now allocate equity to our segments only at the beginning of the year, and it will remain fixed throughout the year. 
Turning to the outlook. Across sales and trading, we do not believe that the backdrop we saw in the first quarter will become a permanent state and have already seen some improvement in market conditions. However, given the numerous uncertainties across regions, we would expect to see some uneven markets and client activity. We are engaged with our clients and focused on delivering content, liquidity and solutions. 
In banking, M&A pipelines are healthy and client dialogues remain strong, but we would expect a slowdown from last year's elevated pace. We are cautiously optimistic that equity underwriting volumes will improve after a very muted first quarter, probably more weighted to the second half. We have seen IPOs in the U.S. and EMEA starting to come to market. How these transactions are received will be important to confidence going forward. 
In debt underwriting, we would expect the investment-grade markets to remain stable and are seeing signs of life in the non-investment-grade markets, although still selective at the bottom of the capital structure. 
In Wealth Management, we would expect to see the stability in trends seen in the last several quarters to continue. And in Investment Management, we expected asset management fees to remain stable and expect potential lumpiness in the investments line. We will continue to focus on Project Streamline and managing our risk profile. 
With that, we will open up the line to questions."

So when we think about those targets and that revenue range of up low single digits to down 20%, like, how much of the cost structure can be managed, particularly if we're not, obviously, not down 20%, but even if were plus or minus 5% on the revenue base, is that still an environment, where by the end of 2017, the targets are still attainable?"

I think, first of all, the targets are, as you point out, 2017 targets, and they did have in them -- they were driven in part by 3 efforts: one, was Project Streamline and the ability to take out $1 billion of compensation/non-compensation expenses, assuming a flat revenue environment. The second was modest revenue growth of 3% to 5%, and then, of course, our continuance of our capital plans. I think it's -- I know we're going to get a lot of calls on this because that's a -- the perils of putting out a target is you get asked about it every time, every quarter, until you finally get there. But we did put it out for 2017, but -- so I think, it's very early days here. This was -- as we said, an unusual backdrop. I think everybody would acknowledge the calendar was very weak. As we said, retail investors were very skittish. We still had some cleanup in the Investment Management areas. So it was an unusual backdrop. So we're not really at the stage of second-guessing those targets at this point. What I was trying to make clear in my opening comments, that we're definitely not standing still. If indeed the environment continued as is, we would be much more aggressive on the cost front. That's our job, and we intend to do it. I'm not about to project what that means in terms of targets. We're standing by our 9% to 11% by the end of 2017, and let's see how this plays out over a couple of quarters. But we're very focused on this. We think this business mix is attractive against those kinds of targets. We have no problem with that. We think we're in a position where, over time, we're going to be doing increasing capital distributions. We believe that the markets are unlikely to be at the level that we're at in the first quarter. But again, we have to deal with reality. If it turns out that is the case, we will react accordingly."

We've been yielding the synergies of bringing the 2 platforms together, bringing the teams together. And the results have been reasonably stable in what is a difficult backdrop. The digital platform is a really exciting opportunity for us. We've talked about a couple of things as being sort of secular trends. The role of managed account and people wanting advice for their balances is something that we can continue and was one of the premises for the merger of Smith Barney in the first place. And we saw that continue. We've got about $800 billion in managed accounts now, about 40% of our assets. And we think we can continue to grow that. And so that is a very important part of the strategy. And I think the digital strategy is just going to help provide our clients with the types of services they need. We have over 2.5 million households. Many of our clients like to interface with their advisers on the phone. Some like to come in. Some like to use technology. So making sure we have good products and services across that full spectrum is going to be important.

There are a couple of different components there. But, let's -- first of all, let's put it into context, when we look at the first quarter of '15 versus the first quarter this year, I said, back in March, that, that wasn't really a good starting point for comparison for a couple of reasons. First of all, if you recall, last year, we benefited from the extreme weather in the first quarter. Not only was that from our physical oil business, but we saw significantly higher levels of client activity. Since also the first quarter of last year, we continue to restructure and reshape this business both in terms of its footprint and capital intensity. We sold the oil merchanting business in the first quarter or at the end of last year. We had about $190 billion of RWA dedicated to the business. And today, that number is closer to $130 billion. More recently, we changed the leadership, and then in December, we took out 25% of the headcount. So this is a different model -- excuse me, a different business. It's got less capital. It's more focused. And in short, we're undertaking a major restructuring. It's against a difficult backdrop. The backdrop has been more negative against our more credit-oriented businesses. And we had a decent quarter. I wouldn't say it was a great quarter, but it was certainly decent. And we want to build on the early progress that we've seen here. We don't expect to see the types of quarters that we saw in the first quarter of '15, but we are focused on doing better and getting more consistent results. You asked about profitability levels. I think in January when we rolled out the strategy, we said we wanted a credible and critical Fixed Income business. We were going to take capital out. We were going to take costs out. We were going to try to maintain the revenue footprint. And therefore, it was obviously going to improve the overall profitability of the business. The last couple of years, we've generated somewhere in the order of $4.2 billion or $4.3 billion of revenue. We're trying to maintain that revenue base. The first quarter is slightly below that run rate, but it's again decent results. And we're still focused on trying to maintain that revenue footprint."

That doesn't mean that the actual scenarios won't change year to year. Of course, they're going to change year to year, but the architecture will be in place. By that I mean, I think next year we'll see the GSIB buffer put into CCAR. And when that is put in, there are likely to be various other changes. As I understand it, too, the CCAR model, which would net against the GSIB buffer. Once we have all of that under the 4 ratios in CCAR in each of them over the 9 quarters, we'll have a much better sense of what our true capital buffer is. So at the moment, we're sailing a little bit blind. I mean the numbers we've laid out is what we see as sort of visible buffer right now, but our hope is that, over time, this is not the final end state for us in terms of excess capital. We think, over time, that we will have more excess capital than that. But to get there, we need to do it within the confines of what the CCAR stress tests are demanding. And as we get the final, what I think is likely to be the final architecture of CCAR next year, again, not the final models, but the final architecture, we will be able to adjust our business models accordingly."

Secondly, I do think that we obviously saw a pickup in March and the signs of early April. We think we can improve our results. They're still below sort of what we've seen historically run rate in some of our stronger product areas. And we expect to improve our revenue results from this quarter. So again, this is one quarter's results. This quarter is a decent starting point because we didn't have the physical oil business in it, but we obviously had a difficult macro backdrop.

Firstly, as it relates to commodities, a lot of focus on the revenue delta year-over-year, which I understand, there was a cold snap last January that obviously flatted the commodities numbers there and obviously not having the business had a reasonably material impact on the revenues, but the broader picture is strategically what we're trying to do. I mean we -- there's a reason that one of the regulators determined that we had a credible plan and the other found only one deficiency, and part of it is because we've simplified our business model. There's a reason that we're confident about Project Streamline, and part of it is because we have fewer businesses, less infrastructure, less legal entities. And what we did with commodities and then selling the physical oil business, all get to that simplification. It reduces RWAs, it reduces capital, it reduces risks, audit compliance, legal, finance, oversight of that part of the business, and it's all about simplifying Morgan Stanley and making it a better understandable business from a regulatory perspective and from an investor perspective. Nothing that happened in the first quarter changes that view. On the expense side, yes, we've been grinding away at our non-comp expenses for a while. We've had some major headwinds with legal expenses, both with litigation and with the cost of lawyers in defending these various claims. We are clearly making progress on that. We've been focused, as Jon used the word, maniacally, I think that's fair on our non-comp expenses. That is completely separate from Project Streamline. Project Streamline is a major firm-wide initiative to figure out the most efficient way to run our infrastructure with the most efficient footprint. So those 2 things will go unabated, irrespective of whether the second quarter is strong or weak, whether the first quarter was strong or weak. They are things which we have clearly on plan. We need to get the ROE of this business up, and one of the ways we're going to do that is being much more efficient in our expense management."

You mentioned LIBOR. I think, we're more sensitive to the Fed funds rate. We've seen a little bit pickup obviously given what happened in December, but I think the real growth in NII for us within the Wealth Management business is going to come from the fact that we expect the average earning assets to grow probably by -- in the bank to grow probably by $10 billion to $15 billion this year. You saw some of the balances in the wealth business. It was up dramatically over last year's period. So the key driver to NII growth in the bank, which good portion of that flows through Wealth Management, is we're going to have more average earning assets growing -- yielding somewhere in this 2% range. So that's a driver to that, and I would pay closer attention to fed funds than to LIBOR. And the second question was..."

And the ROE has been below the cost of capital for the last decade. And the market further expects you to miss your 2017 ROE target of 9% based on consensus earnings forecast. I might add, based on the stock price below tangible book value. So the question is, do you think that you can still meet your 2017 ROE target of 9%, and why? And -- from my standpoint, there's 3 big levers: one would be expenses, which you've highlighted, and you said it, let me say we -- you can take more actions; two would be markets getting better, and you can see early signs. But the third lever would be capital return. And so how soon can investors see some of that freed up big capital? I mean, you have 5% annualized buybacks this quarter, which is decent. But you also mentioned on the call now that you can reduce the impact to businesses with high stress losses. What are those businesses? Can you get rid of them, and how big are those?"

As you have, I think, pretty consistently been asking this management team to put a time frame on our ROE goals, and we did it in January. So in April, we are unlikely to back off of those goals as I said. I think to the first question, which might have been from Mike Carrier, I think, when he asked about it, we stand by those goals. But as I said, and they weren't caveats, they were just reality. They implied that we hit our expense targets on a flat revenue environment, that our total revenues grew somewhere between 3% and 5%, and that we did the right thing around rightsizing our Fixed Income business and freeing up the right capital. As I think you said, we feel pretty good honestly about the expense targets. We made some really good progress against non-comp expenses and maintain comp discipline before we really got into the meat of Project Streamline. So I'd put a check against sort of early indicator on that one. On the revenue growth, clearly, we didn't have revenue growth. So that would be a negative at this point, one quarter into the program. But, I mean, clearly, things brightened up a little bit towards the end of the quarter. Not going to get into the business of trying to predict stuff, but we would be surprised, and probably you would be and most of people on this call if this environment stayed as it is for the next 2 years. And hopefully, I was very clear that if it does, we will continue to take a significant action. We're not going to stand and just watch it. And on the capital plan, we've just put in our CCAR submission. We have the GSIB buffer coming in the next year's capital plan. Our CET1 fully phased-in ratio, I think, is 14.5%, 14.6%. Our supplemental leverage ratio is 6%. A couple of years ago, supplemental leverage was 14 -- was 4.2%. I think our CET1 fully phased-in is probably in the top 2 or 3 of the global 15 or 17 banks. So we feel very good about our capital ratios. What we need to understand is how we come through CCAR. The [indiscernible] scenario obviously changes every year depending upon the economic conditions like interest rates and market shocks and the like. And as we see how the CCAR deals with certain parts of our business and the stress losses that are implied by that, we will adjust those businesses as necessary. It's too early to lay out what that might be because we haven't seen the results of it yet. But my main message to you and to our shareholders is that when we put out the 9% to 11%, again subject to the revenue growth I'd talked about, which was modest, but was real, certainly not subject to negative revenue growth, we did it with a pretty well-thought through plan that's been building. I'm the first to acknowledge that we haven't hit our cost of capital for the last several years. I think without being defensive about it, it's fair to say I'm not sure very many banks have. And I'm not sure that the denominator of what you are required to hold in capital has been a standing ball. In fact, it's been a bouncing ball that's gone up be every year. So listen, we're making steady progress. We're committed to our goals. We'll continue pushing on expenses. We'll do what we can to free up excess capital. And we believe the environment is likely to improve from where we saw the bottoms of the first quarter. More than that, I think it's too early to project."

As you noticed from my prepared remarks and James' prepared remarks, we always keep referencing now fully phased-in. It seems like the market is not interested in what the actual transitional ratios are, and they're more focused on fully phased-in. And so at the end of the year, we thought it was the right time as we start 2016 from a disclosure standpoint to put in the fully phased-in ratio numbers. In terms of the second question, I actually -- my supplement doesn't have it. Can I just -- I'm looking for the page. There we go. My supplement is missing Page 12, Glenn. Here we go. So in the first quarter of '15, you saw the 19% Wealth Management ratio. I think the better comparison, the change in the capital allocation, if you look at the middle 2 columns, the business went from 14% to 12%. We did -- you saw that the revenues were slightly off this quarter. And so -- we -- the PBT bit was down. Part of our Wealth Management business, as you properly point out, is a lending business. And so when we move to the fully phased-in ratios, we allocated more capital to that business as it continues to grow in that high-quality lending book. The ROE for this quarter was slightly improved to 13%. We think that business can be better than the 13% ratio that we are showing, particularly if we see some better signs in the transactional activity. So we think we can build from 13%, but this business does require capital given our lending focus."

And one of the questions we're getting quite a bit is how we should reconcile the revised fully phased-in capital allocation that you have with essentially a CCAR-required capital or spot-required capital target? Potentially, the minimum level of capital you'll need for CCAR to get through the test on scale to offer so as to reporting higher payouts? And the back of the envelope math suggests that when we exclude the unallocated portion and goodwill and intangibles, you're allocating $52 billion across your businesses and as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, that's about a 13% target. So little bit higher than what we were contemplating previously. And I just wanted to get a sense as to whether 13% core Tier 1 is a reasonable long-term target based on the current mix? And should we expect this to come down? Or how should we expect it to traject as FIC mitigation efforts take hold?"

What our absolute level of our spot capital ratios won't be the ultimate determinant of how much capital we can return, but actually, the Fed's stress test, in their severely adverse case, will be the driving force about how much capital we can return.

Obviously, 2016 got off to a difficult start. Markets were challenging. Equity issuance was effectively nonexistent, and retail activity was extremely subdued, reflecting the many uncertainties with which investors grappled. These included negative interest rates internationally, questions around the pace of Fed activity in the U.S., the growth rate of the Chinese economy and growing concerns about geopolitical issues like the migration crisis and potential Brexit, among others. The securities businesses were exposed to a number of these factors, which led to a more challenging revenue environment than what we have come to expect in the first quarter of the year. That said, all was not lost. M&A was robust. Equities once again delivered a strong performance, and Wealth Management generated a pretax margin greater than 21% despite market headwinds and fewer trading days. We made real progress in our expense discipline ahead of our broader initiative called Project Streamline, which, as we said, will play out over the next 2 years. 
So where are we now? Though it's impossible to predict the future, we're seeing a slightly better turn in markets, certainly in comparison to what was evident at the start of the first quarter, leading into the early days of February. The M&A pipeline is strong, and some green shoots suggests the equity underwriting calendar may open up. The S&P level at the end of the first quarter will help with asset price in our Wealth Management business, where we continue to grow our lending book and see flows into managed accounts. Importantly, Fixed Income, notwithstanding the 25% cut in headcount, improved sequentially. By no means can FIC be considered strong, but the business is showing some resilience in this difficult environment. 
In January, we laid our strategic goals for 2016 and 2017. While we've yet to see the revenue growth we anticipated, it remains early days. In a minute, Jon would take you through the progress we've made to date. It must be said that if these markets were to continue as is, our goals would be extremely difficult to achieve, and we would therefore take additional appropriate actions. We obviously accept a degree of volatility in the revenue environment that has led to lower revenue pools, although we do not expect this as a permanent state. We also recognize that we cannot control the environment in which we operate, but we are focused on what we can control, such as expenses. As part of Streamline, we are reshaping our expense base and have embarked on an aggressive evaluation of our global infrastructure cost, reviewing each product, business and geography globally to convince ourselves that we need our footprint as it is currently configured. 
We operate under a multitude of capital tests and requirements. In January, we discussed our belief that we have sufficient capital for our business mix and risk profile, and we're taking actions that could -- should result in longer-term reduced capital requirements. For SLR and CET1, we are well in excess of the requirements in which we will be subject to in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In terms of capital return, which has been one of the cornerstones of our strategic plan, our binding constraint is CCAR. To be clear, this is not a comment with respect to our capital return plans for this year, which we deem appropriate, but more for the following years. In order to drive capital returns to shareholders on a more substantial base than our current CCAR submission is asking for, we must continue to reduce those parts of our business that give rise to the high stress losses and capital deductions and/or balance sheet usage. 
While in a difficult quarter, we still made $1 billion, our ROE was 6%. This is not acceptable. Finally, we received feedback last week on our resolution plan, which was deemed credible by the FDIC, but on account of one deficiency, was not deemed credible by the Federal Reserve. As you saw, we received very detailed comments, and we are confident we'll be able to address the items that were raised. We've dedicated significant resources and time to this important priority and will continue to work with our regulators to improve it. This management team would do what is necessary to ensure that we continue to progress against our strategic plan. 
I look forward to doing an update at the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference in June. So let me now turn it over to, Jon, to walk through the quarter in greater detail. Thank you."

Good morning. As James said, the beginning of 2016 got off to a challenging start as negative sentiment and volatility prevailed in the global markets, undermining the traditional strength in client activity we have typically seen at the start of the year. Concerns about global growth, China, commodities and interest rates resulted in divergent performance of global indices and mixed results across international markets. Against this turbulent backdrop, we remain focused on delivering for our clients and helping them navigate these difficult markets. We continued to demonstrate strength in our equities and M&A businesses and stability in Wealth Management. For the quarter, we reported revenues of $7.8 billion, essentially flat versus fourth quarter '15, when excluding DVA for the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we early adopted the accounting guidance that requires that DVA be presented in accumulated other comprehensive income as opposed to net revenues. Results for previous quarters shown in the supplement were not subject to restatement under the guidance. In my remarks, the prior period amounts exclude DVA. 
Noninterest expense for the quarter were $6.1 billion, comprised of $3.7 billion of compensation expense and $2.4 billion of non-compensation expenses. We remained focused on reducing expenses, and as James mentioned, Streamline initiatives have begun to take shape. Some of the areas we are focused on in Streamline include: first, our workforce strategy. We continue to remix our global workforce and have approximately 40% of our infrastructure employees in our centers of excellence around the world. We are targeting to increase the number of employees deployed by 10% to 15% and are actively working toward achieving this by year-end 2017. Many of the initiatives involve leveraging best-in-class technologies. For instance, we are adopting virtualization and private cloud computing to increase agility and asset utilization while achieving a significant reduction in our data center expenses. We are building the next-generation Wealth Management desktop and mobile suite for both our financial advisers and clients while optimizing and automating our operations and workflow. We're also partnering with incumbent technology companies and emerging start-ups on a number of initiatives to improve efficiency and lower costs. And lastly, we are focused on rationalizing our footprint and infrastructure to ensure we are as efficient and productive as possible. In particular, there are opportunities across our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management businesses, where we have the ability to drive efficiencies while improving collaboration. 
Turning to Institutional Securities. Revenues were $3.7 billion, up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, down 13% versus the fourth quarter, driven by a decline in professional services. Compensation expenses were $1.4 billion, reflecting a 37% ISG compensation ratio. In Investment Banking, we saw continued strength in our M&A business, offset by a tougher backdrop for our underwriting businesses. IPO volumes were down 82% quarter-on-quarter, and high-yield volumes were down off of already low levels in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, we generated $990 million in revenues, down 18% sequentially. Advisory revenues for the quarter were the strongest post-crisis at $591 million, up 15% as the deals announced last year continue to close. Equity underwriting revenues were $160 million, down 55% versus 4Q, driven largely by the significant decreases in IPOs. Fixed Income underwriting revenues were $239 million, down 31% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting a slowdown in high-yield and leverage loan markets. In equities, we saw continued leadership with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 13% sequentially. Prime brokerage revenues were higher this quarter as we work closely with our clients and continue to focus on the efficiency of our balance sheet and returns. Derivatives revenues were up sequentially driven by increased client activity as clients try to navigate volatility and hedge risk exposures. And cash equity revenues were down versus 4Q against the backdrop of lower global equity markets and a limited new issue calendar. And we continue to show leadership in our electronic products suite. 
Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading revenues were $873 million, up 59% versus the fourth quarter, although down 54% versus the first quarter of 2015, when we had a very strong commodities quarter, both in our oil merchanting business, which we sold in 4Q last year and our commodities trading businesses. Throughout the quarter, we saw a continuation of the challenges experienced in the second half of 2015. This translated into ongoing muted levels of client activity across our Fixed Income & Commodities business. Despite these headwinds and the 25% reduction in headcount, we maintained our client focus and improved results from the fourth quarter. We saw some improvement quarter-over-quarter in corporate credit, with strength in investment grade, and we saw continued weakness across commodities. Fixed Income RWAs were down $4 billion in the quarter to $132 billion, and our SLR balance sheet was down approximately $9 billion to $345 billion. While revenues were for the quarter were up sequentially, they are not where we ultimately want them to be. We're focused on driving execution and bringing our sales and trading businesses together to leverage synergies across the platform. 
Other sales and trading revenues were down quarter-over-quarter driven by hedging losses for our relationship lending book. Other revenues were down versus fourth quarter driven by an increase in our allowance for loan losses or are held for investment portfolio. In the quarter, we have continued to see pressure on the energy complex and have seen some credit migration and some bankruptcies. Our loan loss provision on our HFI portfolio of $127 million this quarter was predominantly against our energy portfolio. As a reminder, 40% of our approximately $15 billion funded and unfunded energy exposure is fair value or held for sale where we mark-to-market daily and have taken markdowns this quarter. Our energy exposure is down about $1 billion from last quarter. And importantly, we have not seen any meaningful signs of contagion. Lastly, average trading VaR for the fourth quarter was flat versus last quarter at $46 million. 
Wealth Management revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, down 2% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting muted client activity in an unfavorable market environment as well as fewer trading days. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 21.4%, up slightly versus 4Q '15, reflecting the stability of the business. Bright spots for the quarter were continued momentum in our lending strategy and the ongoing secular trends in managed accounts. Flows for the quarter were approximately $6 billion with decent pickup in March. 
The NII story continues with net interest income up 7% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, driven by solid loan growth. Funded lending balances in Wealth Management grew approximately $2 billion or 5% during the quarter and $12 billion or 30% year-over-year. Credit metrics remained strong with an average FICO score of greater than 7 50 for our mortgage borrowers. Transactional activity was particularly weak as clients remained on the sidelines due to market volatility and a lack of new issues. The first quarter for commission revenues were the lowest we have seen in the last 5 years, reflecting the very cautious attitude of investors in this highly uncertain environment. As global and domestic uncertainties abate, we would expect to return to a more normal level of activity. 
On the expense side, compensation was down 3% quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower deferred compensation plans returns. Non-compensation expenses were down 5% versus fourth quarter, driven by seasonally lower expenses in marketing and business development. Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were $152 billion in the first quarter, up $3 billion versus the fourth quarter, though lower than the quarter's peak, reflecting some improvement in client activity as market conditions have improved. 
In Investment Management, revenues were $477 million, down 23% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $526 million, up 5% versus 4Q, reflecting the steadiness of this revenue line, and AUM was essentially unchanged at $405 billion. Investment revenues in the quarter were a loss of $64 million, driven by volatility and particular weakness in emerging market investments, resulting in markdowns and some reversal of carry. Overall, expenses were down 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by compensation, which was down 23%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $808 billion at March 31, up from the $787 billion at December 31. The increase reflects a low fourth quarter spot asset level, given lower client activity at the end of the year as well as higher levels of liquidity in the first quarter. Our average balance sheet, however, was down to $802 billion in the quarter from $814 billion in 4Q. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $386 billion, down from $395 billion in the fourth quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced common equity tier 1 ratio increased to 14.5%. Our pro forma supplemental -- supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6%, up from 5.8% in Q4. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 25 million shares, and our board declared a $0.15 dividend per share. Lastly, in the quarter, as you'll see in our supplement, we modified our segment common equity allocation disclosure to base it on fully phased-in regulatory capital as the market has focused more on these ratios than the transitional ratios. As we have said in the past, we look at capital through multiple lenses, so this is not a totally new view for us. Capital was allocated based on risk-based and leverage-based requirements under both business-as-usual as well as stress scenarios. This resulted in a reduction in parent equity from $21 billion to $6 billion, and the resulting $15 billion is allocated across the segments. We will now allocate equity to our segments only at the beginning of the year, and it will remain fixed throughout the year. 
Turning to the outlook. Across sales and trading, we do not believe that the backdrop we saw in the first quarter will become a permanent state and have already seen some improvement in market conditions. However, given the numerous uncertainties across regions, we would expect to see some uneven markets and client activity. We are engaged with our clients and focused on delivering content, liquidity and solutions. 
In banking, M&A pipelines are healthy and client dialogues remain strong, but we would expect a slowdown from last year's elevated pace. We are cautiously optimistic that equity underwriting volumes will improve after a very muted first quarter, probably more weighted to the second half. We have seen IPOs in the U.S. and EMEA starting to come to market. How these transactions are received will be important to confidence going forward. 
In debt underwriting, we would expect the investment-grade markets to remain stable and are seeing signs of life in the non-investment-grade markets, although still selective at the bottom of the capital structure. 
In Wealth Management, we would expect to see the stability in trends seen in the last several quarters to continue. And in Investment Management, we expected asset management fees to remain stable and expect potential lumpiness in the investments line. We will continue to focus on Project Streamline and managing our risk profile. 
With that, we will open up the line to questions."

I think it's -- I know we're going to get a lot of calls on this because that's a -- the perils of putting out a target is you get asked about it every time, every quarter, until you finally get there. But we did put it out for 2017, but -- so I think, it's very early days here. This was -- as we said, an unusual backdrop. I think everybody would acknowledge the calendar was very weak. As we said, retail investors were very skittish. We still had some cleanup in the Investment Management areas. So it was an unusual backdrop. So we're not really at the stage of second-guessing those targets at this point. What I was trying to make clear in my opening comments, that we're definitely not standing still. If indeed the environment continued as is, we would be much more aggressive on the cost front. That's our job, and we intend to do it. I'm not about to project what that means in terms of targets. We're standing by our 9% to 11% by the end of 2017, and let's see how this plays out over a couple of quarters. But we're very focused on this. We think this business mix is attractive against those kinds of targets. We have no problem with that. We think we're in a position where, over time, we're going to be doing increasing capital distributions. We believe that the markets are unlikely to be at the level that we're at in the first quarter. But again, we have to deal with reality. If it turns out that is the case, we will react accordingly."

We've been yielding the synergies of bringing the 2 platforms together, bringing the teams together. And the results have been reasonably stable in what is a difficult backdrop. The digital platform is a really exciting opportunity for us. We've talked about a couple of things as being sort of secular trends. The role of managed account and people wanting advice for their balances is something that we can continue and was one of the premises for the merger of Smith Barney in the first place. And we saw that continue. We've got about $800 billion in managed accounts now, about 40% of our assets. And we think we can continue to grow that. And so that is a very important part of the strategy. And I think the digital strategy is just going to help provide our clients with the types of services they need. We have over 2.5 million households. Many of our clients like to interface with their advisers on the phone. Some like to come in. Some like to use technology. So making sure we have good products and services across that full spectrum is going to be important.

There are a couple of different components there. But, let's -- first of all, let's put it into context, when we look at the first quarter of '15 versus the first quarter this year, I said, back in March, that, that wasn't really a good starting point for comparison for a couple of reasons. First of all, if you recall, last year, we benefited from the extreme weather in the first quarter. Not only was that from our physical oil business, but we saw significantly higher levels of client activity. Since also the first quarter of last year, we continue to restructure and reshape this business both in terms of its footprint and capital intensity. We sold the oil merchanting business in the first quarter or at the end of last year. We had about $190 billion of RWA dedicated to the business. And today, that number is closer to $130 billion. More recently, we changed the leadership, and then in December, we took out 25% of the headcount. So this is a different model -- excuse me, a different business. It's got less capital. It's more focused. And in short, we're undertaking a major restructuring. It's against a difficult backdrop. The backdrop has been more negative against our more credit-oriented businesses. And we had a decent quarter. I wouldn't say it was a great quarter, but it was certainly decent. And we want to build on the early progress that we've seen here. We don't expect to see the types of quarters that we saw in the first quarter of '15, but we are focused on doing better and getting more consistent results. You asked about profitability levels. I think in January when we rolled out the strategy, we said we wanted a credible and critical Fixed Income business. We were going to take capital out. We were going to take costs out. We were going to try to maintain the revenue footprint. And therefore, it was obviously going to improve the overall profitability of the business. The last couple of years, we've generated somewhere in the order of $4.2 billion or $4.3 billion of revenue. We're trying to maintain that revenue base. The first quarter is slightly below that run rate, but it's again decent results. And we're still focused on trying to maintain that revenue footprint."

That doesn't mean that the actual scenarios won't change year to year. Of course, they're going to change year to year, but the architecture will be in place. By that I mean, I think next year we'll see the GSIB buffer put into CCAR. And when that is put in, there are likely to be various other changes. As I understand it, too, the CCAR model, which would net against the GSIB buffer. Once we have all of that under the 4 ratios in CCAR in each of them over the 9 quarters, we'll have a much better sense of what our true capital buffer is. So at the moment, we're sailing a little bit blind. I mean the numbers we've laid out is what we see as sort of visible buffer right now, but our hope is that, over time, this is not the final end state for us in terms of excess capital. We think, over time, that we will have more excess capital than that. But to get there, we need to do it within the confines of what the CCAR stress tests are demanding. And as we get the final, what I think is likely to be the final architecture of CCAR next year, again, not the final models, but the final architecture, we will be able to adjust our business models accordingly."

Secondly, I do think that we obviously saw a pickup in March and the signs of early April. We think we can improve our results. They're still below sort of what we've seen historically run rate in some of our stronger product areas. And we expect to improve our revenue results from this quarter. So again, this is one quarter's results. This quarter is a decent starting point because we didn't have the physical oil business in it, but we obviously had a difficult macro backdrop.

Firstly, as it relates to commodities, a lot of focus on the revenue delta year-over-year, which I understand, there was a cold snap last January that obviously flatted the commodities numbers there and obviously not having the business had a reasonably material impact on the revenues, but the broader picture is strategically what we're trying to do. I mean we -- there's a reason that one of the regulators determined that we had a credible plan and the other found only one deficiency, and part of it is because we've simplified our business model. There's a reason that we're confident about Project Streamline, and part of it is because we have fewer businesses, less infrastructure, less legal entities. And what we did with commodities and then selling the physical oil business, all get to that simplification. It reduces RWAs, it reduces capital, it reduces risks, audit compliance, legal, finance, oversight of that part of the business, and it's all about simplifying Morgan Stanley and making it a better understandable business from a regulatory perspective and from an investor perspective. Nothing that happened in the first quarter changes that view. On the expense side, yes, we've been grinding away at our non-comp expenses for a while. We've had some major headwinds with legal expenses, both with litigation and with the cost of lawyers in defending these various claims. We are clearly making progress on that. We've been focused, as Jon used the word, maniacally, I think that's fair on our non-comp expenses. That is completely separate from Project Streamline. Project Streamline is a major firm-wide initiative to figure out the most efficient way to run our infrastructure with the most efficient footprint. So those 2 things will go unabated, irrespective of whether the second quarter is strong or weak, whether the first quarter was strong or weak. They are things which we have clearly on plan. We need to get the ROE of this business up, and one of the ways we're going to do that is being much more efficient in our expense management."

On -- let's do loans first. As we said in the past, we're excited about the bank's strategy, what we call our deposit deployment strategy, taking our lower costs -- lower-yielding securities and converting them into loans, we've seen good progress. You mentioned LIBOR. I think, we're more sensitive to the Fed funds rate. We've seen a little bit pickup obviously given what happened in December, but I think the real growth in NII for us within the Wealth Management business is going to come from the fact that we expect the average earning assets to grow probably by -- in the bank to grow probably by $10 billion to $15 billion this year. You saw some of the balances in the wealth business. It was up dramatically over last year's period. So the key driver to NII growth in the bank, which good portion of that flows through Wealth Management, is we're going to have more average earning assets growing -- yielding somewhere in this 2% range. So that's a driver to that, and I would pay closer attention to fed funds than to LIBOR. And the second question was..."

I might add, based on the stock price below tangible book value. So the question is, do you think that you can still meet your 2017 ROE target of 9%, and why? And -- from my standpoint, there's 3 big levers: one would be expenses, which you've highlighted, and you said it, let me say we -- you can take more actions; two would be markets getting better, and you can see early signs. But the third lever would be capital return. And so how soon can investors see some of that freed up big capital? I mean, you have 5% annualized buybacks this quarter, which is decent. But you also mentioned on the call now that you can reduce the impact to businesses with high stress losses. What are those businesses? Can you get rid of them, and how big are those?"

As you have, I think, pretty consistently been asking this management team to put a time frame on our ROE goals, and we did it in January. So in April, we are unlikely to back off of those goals as I said. I think to the first question, which might have been from Mike Carrier, I think, when he asked about it, we stand by those goals. But as I said, and they weren't caveats, they were just reality. They implied that we hit our expense targets on a flat revenue environment, that our total revenues grew somewhere between 3% and 5%, and that we did the right thing around rightsizing our Fixed Income business and freeing up the right capital. As I think you said, we feel pretty good honestly about the expense targets. We made some really good progress against non-comp expenses and maintain comp discipline before we really got into the meat of Project Streamline. So I'd put a check against sort of early indicator on that one. On the revenue growth, clearly, we didn't have revenue growth. So that would be a negative at this point, one quarter into the program. But, I mean, clearly, things brightened up a little bit towards the end of the quarter. Not going to get into the business of trying to predict stuff, but we would be surprised, and probably you would be and most of people on this call if this environment stayed as it is for the next 2 years. And hopefully, I was very clear that if it does, we will continue to take a significant action. We're not going to stand and just watch it. And on the capital plan, we've just put in our CCAR submission. We have the GSIB buffer coming in the next year's capital plan. Our CET1 fully phased-in ratio, I think, is 14.5%, 14.6%. Our supplemental leverage ratio is 6%. A couple of years ago, supplemental leverage was 14 -- was 4.2%. I think our CET1 fully phased-in is probably in the top 2 or 3 of the global 15 or 17 banks. So we feel very good about our capital ratios. What we need to understand is how we come through CCAR. The [indiscernible] scenario obviously changes every year depending upon the economic conditions like interest rates and market shocks and the like. And as we see how the CCAR deals with certain parts of our business and the stress losses that are implied by that, we will adjust those businesses as necessary. It's too early to lay out what that might be because we haven't seen the results of it yet. But my main message to you and to our shareholders is that when we put out the 9% to 11%, again subject to the revenue growth I'd talked about, which was modest, but was real, certainly not subject to negative revenue growth, we did it with a pretty well-thought through plan that's been building. I'm the first to acknowledge that we haven't hit our cost of capital for the last several years. I think without being defensive about it, it's fair to say I'm not sure very many banks have. And I'm not sure that the denominator of what you are required to hold in capital has been a standing ball. In fact, it's been a bouncing ball that's gone up be every year. So listen, we're making steady progress. We're committed to our goals. We'll continue pushing on expenses. We'll do what we can to free up excess capital. And we believe the environment is likely to improve from where we saw the bottoms of the first quarter. More than that, I think it's too early to project."

As you noticed from my prepared remarks and James' prepared remarks, we always keep referencing now fully phased-in. It seems like the market is not interested in what the actual transitional ratios are, and they're more focused on fully phased-in. And so at the end of the year, we thought it was the right time as we start 2016 from a disclosure standpoint to put in the fully phased-in ratio numbers. In terms of the second question, I actually -- my supplement doesn't have it. Can I just -- I'm looking for the page. There we go. My supplement is missing Page 12, Glenn. Here we go. So in the first quarter of '15, you saw the 19% Wealth Management ratio. I think the better comparison, the change in the capital allocation, if you look at the middle 2 columns, the business went from 14% to 12%. We did -- you saw that the revenues were slightly off this quarter. And so -- we -- the PBT bit was down. Part of our Wealth Management business, as you properly point out, is a lending business. And so when we move to the fully phased-in ratios, we allocated more capital to that business as it continues to grow in that high-quality lending book. The ROE for this quarter was slightly improved to 13%. We think that business can be better than the 13% ratio that we are showing, particularly if we see some better signs in the transactional activity. So we think we can build from 13%, but this business does require capital given our lending focus."

And one of the questions we're getting quite a bit is how we should reconcile the revised fully phased-in capital allocation that you have with essentially a CCAR-required capital or spot-required capital target? Potentially, the minimum level of capital you'll need for CCAR to get through the test on scale to offer so as to reporting higher payouts? And the back of the envelope math suggests that when we exclude the unallocated portion and goodwill and intangibles, you're allocating $52 billion across your businesses and as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, that's about a 13% target. So little bit higher than what we were contemplating previously. And I just wanted to get a sense as to whether 13% core Tier 1 is a reasonable long-term target based on the current mix? And should we expect this to come down? Or how should we expect it to traject as FIC mitigation efforts take hold?"

Our results this quarter reflects solid p",485,"Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I'll make a few brief introductory remarks, and then Jon would take you through the numbers. And of course, we both, as always, look forward to your questions. 
Our results this quarter reflects solid performance in an improved but obviously still relatively fragile environment. Our team had several objectives coming into the quarter, as follows: managing the uncertain macroeconomic environment, continuing the momentum we're building in Fixed Income while preserving stability in our other businesses; maintaining expense discipline; and obtaining approval for our capital plan under CCAR. By and large, we met these objectives and despite the overall lack of conviction in the market, we executed on our strategic plan and performed well in the areas of traditional strength. We saw continued stability and progress in our core businesses with each performing roughly in line with expectations given the environment. We made particular progress in Fixed Income & Commodities, where we generated approximately $1.3 billion in revenue, up significantly from the first quarter. Jon would take you through each of our businesses in a moment. 
On expenses, we remain focused on our cost discipline both tactically and through Project Streamline. We're now a simpler organization and therefore must be leaner and more efficient in our spend. We discussed initiatives that are currently underway last month in our financials conference and are pleased with Project Streamline's progress to date. Our ROE for the quarter was 8.3% and demonstrated progress towards that 2017 target. 
Finally, we received the non-objection from Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan. We believe this decision reflects the changes we undertook as well as our business mix stability. The approval enables us to increase our dividend to $0.20 per quarter and to repurchase up to 3.5 billion in common stock over the next 12 months, commencing in the third quarter. 
CCAR's outcome reinforces our aim to steadily increase the return of capital to shareholders over time. And indeed, it marks the fourth consecutive year in which we have done so. We were also asked to resubmit our plan due to certain deficiencies that the Federal Reserve found in our capital planning process. We're working extremely hard to ensure a successful resubmission towards the end of this year. 
On the macro environment, a lot was going on. Britain's decision to leave the European Union created uncertainty that is likely to persist for some time as the market grapples with the political and economic paths forward. As we've said publicly, we consider this outcome suboptimal, but it did, indeed, provide us with a live stress scenario as we endured record-high volumes and spikes of volatility, our liquidity remains strong, our systems ran smoothly and our clients accessed the market quickly and in size. 
I'll now turn over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail and again look forward to your questions in a few minutes."

As James said, the environment in the second quarter was an improvement over the first. However, we continue to see macro uncertainty, and with it, periods of heightened volatility.

However, we continue to see macro uncertainty, and with it, periods of heightened volatility. Geopolitical events, including Brexit, have kept market participants on the sidelines as they wait for clearer trends to emerge. Despite this backdrop, Morgan Stanley delivered solid results. 
For the quarter, we reported revenues of $8.9 billion versus $7.8 billion in 1Q. Noninterest expenses for the first quarter were $6.4 billion versus $6.1 billion last quarter. The increase is primarily driven by increased compensation expense on higher revenues. 
Profit before taxes for the quarter was $2.5 billion versus $1.7 billion in 1Q '16, highlighting the operating leverage we have in the business model. 
Project Streamline remains on track. In mid-June, James highlighted some of the key initiatives that have been identified to meet our objective of reducing our cost base by $1 billion by 2017. These initiatives will continue to be carried out through the next 18 months, but substantial progress has already been made. 
We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence to optimize workforce costs. We have hired 250 employees with our objective of hiring 1,250 employees through the end of 2017. Offsetting this, headcount has come down in our metro, higher-cost locations. We are 50% complete with our objectives to close 4 North American data centers and are on schedule to close the remaining 2 by 2017. 
We continually seek ways to deploy technology to drive efficiencies and automation. To that end, we just rolled out a cloud-based procurement platform, which will drive future savings through more straight-through processing and payments and greater intelligence and purchasing decisions. We continue to show greater discipline around our nonessential travel and have achieved a 50% reduction through the first half of the year as compared to the first half of 2015. 
Turning to Institutional Securities. Revenues were $4.6 billion, up 23% quarter-on-quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, essentially flat for the first quarter. Streamline initiatives offset costs associated with rising revenues. 
Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion. Our ISG year-to-date compensation to net revenue ratio was 36%. We remain committed to our compensation ratio target of less than or equal to 37% we set out at the beginning of the year. 
In Investment Banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenues, up 12% sequentially. Year-to-date, we were #2 globally in announced M&A, completed M&A, IPOs and equity and equity-linked offerings. 
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $497 million, down 16% off of a strong 1Q. Dialogue and interest in strategic transactions remained strong, but below the 2015 pace. M&A announced volumes are running 20% to 25% below last year, and we would expect that to persist. 
Equity underwriting revenues were $266 million, up 66% versus 1Q. And debt underwriting revenues were $345 million, up 44% sequentially. Although we saw improvements in underwriting, activity remained below historical levels. As we have mentioned on past calls, we have a healthy pipeline of transactions waiting to be executed. Issuer confidence and investor appetite will be critical for the results in underwriting to improve. 
In equities, we remained our leadership position and expect to be #1 globally with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 4% sequentially. Second quarter '16 was a strong quarter across products and regions as we continue to work with our clients through uncertain times. Cash equities was up sequentially. Derivatives remained robust. Prime brokerage continue to be a steady performer, and we improve the efficiency of our balance sheet. 
Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading revenues were $1.3 billion, up 49% versus the first quarter. Revenues improved sequentially across credit, macro and commodities businesses. Our credit businesses benefited from a tightening of spreads. In particular, securitized products performed well against this backdrop. 
In macro, we provided support to our clients leading up to and through the Brexit referendum, where prudent risk management contributed to higher revenues sequentially. Commodities benefited from better credit performance and market conditions, specifically a stabilization in energy credits, resulting in an increase in client activity. Fixed Income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $353 billion in the quarter. 
Other revenues were up versus first quarter, primarily driven by better credit performance for our held for investment and held for sale relationship loans. Lastly, average trading VaR for the second quarter was $46 million, flat to last quarter. VaR was generally range-bound over the quarter, inclusive of Brexit. 
Wealth Management performed well in the second quarter with revenues of $3.8 billion, up 4% sequentially. Even though we have not seen a pickup in retail engagement, this business continues to provide stability against an uncertain macro backdrop. 
Total client assets of $2 trillion increased 2%. Fee-based assets hit a new high of $820 billion. And flows in the quarter were $12 billion, up from $5.9 billion in the first quarter. 
Net interest income was essentially -- was flat sequentially, though up 12% year-over-year. Lending balances were up $3 billion quarter-over-quarter and $11 billion year-over-year, which has resulted in a significant increase in interest income. This growth was partially offset by an increase in amortization as a result of a pickup in mortgage prepayment fees as rates declined. 
Our bank NII forecast that we shared in May remains unchanged, and we are on pace with our bank growth target for 2016. 
Transactional revenues were $798 million this quarter, up 10% sequentially. This improvement was driven by mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans and not a rebound in activity. As mentioned before, transactional activity remained subdued. 
On expenses, compensation was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our compensation ratio decreased to 56.5%, which reflects the benefit of our strategy to grow noncompensable revenues. Non-compensation expenses were essentially flat to 1Q. We continue to invest in digital and our infrastructure to ensure our compliance with DOL. 
Our PBT margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 21.4% in 1Q '16. We remain confident we will hit the 23% to 25% pretax margin target we set for 2017 despite the slower-than-expected pace of future interest rate increases. 
In Investment Management, revenues were $583 million, up 22% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $517 million, essentially flat versus 1Q. AUM was also essentially flat at $406 billion, a continuation of the trend that we have seen over the last several quarters. 
Investment revenues in the quarter improved to $50 million versus a loss in 1Q '16, driven by improved performance across a number of funds, including private equity and real estate investments. Investment revenues remained volatile as global markets and asset prices adjust to the changing political landscape and growth dynamics. Overall, expenses were up 7% quarter-over-quarter driven by higher compensation on investment gains. 
Turning to balance sheet. Total assets were $829 billion at June 30, up from the $807 billion at March 31. The spot increase was driven by a high level of activity at the very end of June, primarily due to Brexit, as we supported our clients. We have seen the balance sheet retreat from this high in the first 2 [ph] weeks of the third quarter. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $365 billion, down from $385 billion in the first quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 15.8% versus 14.6% in the first quarter. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.1%, up from 6% in Q1. As James mentioned, during the second quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 23 million shares, and our board declared a $0.20 dividend per share. 
Last night, we announced that we will deem all of the issued and outstanding TruPS by August 18, 2016. The TruPS carry a blended cost of 6.2%. We received approval to redeem these securities in this year's CCAR. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 33.5%. Going forward, we continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%. 
After a difficult start to 2016, the markets improved in the second quarter. However, the world continues to experience significant geopolitical uncertainty, and with that, the potential for economic underperformance. The Brexit vote and upcoming U.S. elections have only added to a cloudy outlook. It is too early to predict how the second half will play out. On the one hand, the political uncertainty casts a negative shadow over the markets and will undoubtedly cause some corporations to pause over future CapEx and other expansion plans. And many investors, particularly individuals, remain cautious. On the other hand, the movement in currencies and the improvement in commodity and some equity prices is leading many clients to begin to position for what might be a volatile second half. Our pipelines remain healthy and our business is well positioned, but whether this translates into near-term business is an open question. As the coming months unfold, we will remain nimble where we see client opportunities while staying rigorous to our Project Streamline and other expense initiatives. 
With that, we will open up the line to questions."

FX was aided by the volatility we saw from Brexit. Commodities clearly better credit performance. We had a much more stable backdrop. Oil prices going from $38 to $48 versus sort of the wild swings that we saw in the first quarter. So broadly, a very strong performance. It is only one quarter. In the first quarter, when people were talking about our performance, we warned that it was only one quarter. We've made a lot of changes that we think will help this business, and this will take time, but we've been pleased with the progress we've seen to date."

Listen, my view was that there was a general overreaction to the underperformance of FIC in sort of the middle of last year through the first half of the first quarter. And I saw very little downside risk to the business. When we're running at $500 million, $600 million a quarter, I thought the downside risks is very small. The upside risk was actually quite high. And that's why said we thought on a relative normalized basis, a $1 billion run rate a quarter was entirely reasonable. The headcount we took out at the end of the last year, actually many of our competitors have taken that headcounts and dribs and drabs, so it wasn't remarkable against the context of what was going on a market. We just did it at one point in time. And clearly, we were overstaffed at that point in time. And we came to a fundamental view, at the end of last year, to do 2 things: one is to realign the staff to what we thought was a $1 billion-ish run rate business. And maybe, it's more. And we're not going to get ahead of ourselves. Obviously, more this quarter. But we don't think it's materially less than that, to be honest. At the same time, the second thing we did was to align all of our sales and trading businesses together. And with that kind of lots of operational synergies, risk management synergies, overall management, client coverage synergies with our SRM, our senior relationship management program. And I think that wasn't going to evidence itself in the days and weeks following the realignment. But we felt pretty confident in the months and years following it, it would. And maybe we're starting to see some of that. Thirdly, just on the particular mix of our business. Obviously, we're more credit-centric than macro, but we do have a very not FX business that benefited. You have seen a lot more volatility in rates. And clearly, the credit markets, as Jon said, recovered not just in the core FIC -- the Fixed Income business, but in commodities. So the combination of all of these things said that, ""Yes, it's a good number this quarter."" Are we shocked by it? Not really. We weren't nearly shocked when everybody else seemed to be when we were doing $500 million, $600 million. And that's we're not going to get ahead of what we've said a $1 billion run rate. And let's see how it plays out not each individual quarter, but over the next couple of years."

And as you've heard us say in the past, we've been spending significant energy in dollars into investing at our digital platforms in Wealth Management. As you know, we hired Naureen Hassan earlier this year to run that effort for us. We think that the right business model and the winning hand here is a combination of advice and FAs with technology. We've been investing heavily in this area. We've had some good early progress with some of our mobile apps with some recognition and awards. But there are really 3 areas that we've been focused on. One is around data and analytics, so providing our clients with better data and analysis so they can make more informed and better decisions. Secondly, efficiencies around automation. That will be helpful not only from an expense standpoint, but also giving FAs and clients more time to be together and not focus on paperwork and doing other things like that. And then lastly, most importantly, sort of how our clients interface with us. We have 3.5 million households in our footprint with many different investing needs, but also many different requirements and idiosyncratic wants and likes. And so we have been building out a broader platform just in terms of our interface with our clients, whether that's video, whether that's in person, whether that's FA, whether that's mobile, whether that's text. And we have been doing that for quite sometime. So we have been investing in this area. We have told you it's going to be important to the overall business. We believe secular trends here are for advice with technology. And that's the business that we're building."

I think that one has to take into account that the wealth management market in this country is actually extremely diverse. In our own book of business, only 2%, I think, of our client assets are in households with less than $100,000. We have nearly $800 billion in households with $10 million or more. So you got to look at the segmentation. You got to look at the complexity of the client needs, of which access through distinct technologies is a clear need, but it's by no means the only need for folks who've got $10 million, $20 million, $50 million. Portfolio allocation, superior product, access to our underwriting calendar, all of the other things which we bring to the party, including our intellectual capital through our research. So it's a very important development. The whole digital development and finance. In my view, it is the most important in the payment sector followed by the consumer credit sector, followed by to Wealth Management sector. But we're making the investments, as Jon said, through our digital team that we've hired under Maureen's leadership, and we make the investments and will continue making them."

March was more stable, a better backdrop for the businesses that we are in. And April and May looked a lot like March. What we saw in June was sort of a continuation of that trend. As we approached the Brexit referendum, we saw people start to realize the potential impact of this outcome. And we saw more risk management and hedging activity. And then for a couple of days right before and right after we saw heightened volatility and significant volumes. I would tell you that, broadly speaking, 1 or 2 days does not make a quarter for us. It's a much more balanced business than that. Given also all the changes that we made, particularly around the oil merchanting business and some of the other actions, we would expect less volatility than we've seen in the past, but we're obviously not going to print $1 billion every quarter on the nose. So we're going to see fluctuations in that number. I wouldn't say that we over-earned. I would say the volume helped for a day or 2, but again doesn't drive the overall performance of a quarter. And then we are -- we've been pleased with the results. I don't think that the changes that we made restricted our ability to earn. We Weren't constrained in terms of capacity or personnel.

In terms of the mix that we've given historically around held for investment versus fair value held for sale. The held for sale fair value portfolio is down a little bit. It's about a 35%. That's obviously being driven by some of the sales that we've made in that portfolio. E&P also a good story there, down to $3.5 billion from the $4.1 billion that we reported earlier.

And of course, we both, as always, look forward to your questions. 
Our results this quarter reflects solid performance in an improved but obviously still relatively fragile environment. Our team had several objectives coming into the quarter as follows: managing the uncertain macroeconomic environment, continuing the momentum we're building in Fixed Income while preserving stability in our other businesses; maintaining expense discipline; and obtaining approval for our capital plan under CCAR. By and large, we met these objectives, and despite the overall lack of conviction in the market, we executed on our strategic plan and performed well in the areas of traditional strength. We saw continued stability and progress in our core businesses with each performing roughly in line with expectations given the environment. We made particular progress in Fixed Income & Commodities, where we generated approximately $1.3 billion in revenue, up significantly from the first quarter. Jon would take you through each of our businesses in a moment. 
On expenses, we remain focused on our cost discipline both tactically and through Project Streamline. We're now a simpler organization and therefore must be leaner and more efficient in our spend. We discussed initiatives that are currently underway last month in our financials conference and are pleased with Project Streamline's progress to date. 
Our ROE for the quarter was 8.3% and demonstrated progress towards that 2017 target. 
Finally, we received the nonobjection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan. We believe this decision reflects the changes we undertook as well as our business mix stability. The approval enables us to increase our dividend to $0.20 per quarter and a repurchase up to 3.5 billion in common stock over the next 12 months, commencing in the third quarter. 
CCAR's outcome reinforces our aim to steadily increase the return of capital to shareholders over time. And indeed, it marks the fourth consecutive year in which we have done so. We were also asked to resubmit our plan due to certain deficiencies that the Federal Reserve found in our capital planning process. We're working extremely hard to ensure a successful resubmission towards the end of this year. 
On the macro environment, a lot was going on. Britain's decision to leave the European Union created uncertainty that is likely to persist for some time as the market grapples with the political and economic paths forward. As we said publicly, we consider this outcome suboptimal, but it did, indeed, provide us with a live stress scenario as we endured record-high volumes and spikes of volatility, our liquidity remains strong, our systems ran smoothly and our clients accessed the market quickly and in size. 
I'll now turn over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail and again look forward to your questions in a few minutes."

As James said, the environment in the second quarter was an improvement over the first. However, we continue to see macro uncertainty, and with it, periods of heightened volatility. Geopolitical events, including Brexit, have kept market par",1523,"Good morning. As James said, the environment in the second quarter was an improvement over the first. However, we continue to see macro uncertainty, and with it, periods of heightened volatility. Geopolitical events, including Brexit, have kept market participants on the sidelines as they wait for clearer trends to emerge. Despite this backdrop, Morgan Stanley delivered solid results. 
For the quarter, we reported revenues of $8.9 billion versus $7.8 billion in 1Q. Noninterest expenses for the first quarter were $6.4 billion versus $6.1 billion last quarter. The increase is primarily driven by increased compensation expense on higher revenues. 
Profit before taxes for the quarter was $2.5 billion versus $1.7 billion in 1Q '16, highlighting the operating leverage we have in the business model. 
Project Streamline remains on track. In mid-June, James highlighted some of the key initiatives that have been identified to meet our objective of reducing our cost base by $1 billion by 2017. These initiatives will continue to be carried out through the next 18 months, but substantial progress has already been made. 
We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence to optimize workforce costs. We have hired 250 employees with our objective of hiring 1,250 employees through the end of 2017. Offsetting this, headcount has come down in our metro, higher-cost locations. We are 50% complete with our objectives to close 4 North American data centers and are on schedule to close the remaining 2 by 2017. 
We continually seek ways to deploy technology to drive efficiencies and automation. To that end, we just rolled out a cloud-based procurement platform, which will drive future savings through more straight-through processing and payments and greater intelligence and purchasing decisions. We continue to show greater discipline around our nonessential travel and have achieved a 50% reduction through the first half of the year as compared to the first half of 2015. 
Turning to Institutional Securities. Revenues were $4.6 billion, up 23% quarter-on-quarter. Noncompensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, essentially flat to the first quarter. Streamline initiatives offset costs associated with rising revenues. 
Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion. Our ISG year-to-date compensation to net revenue ratio was 36%. We remain committed to our compensation ratio target of less than or equal to 37% we set out at the beginning of the year. 
In Investment Banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenues, up 12% sequentially. Year-to-date, we were #2 globally in announced M&A, completed M&A, IPOs and equity and equity-linked offerings. 
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $497 million, down 16% off of a strong 1Q. Dialogue and interest in strategic transactions remained strong, but below the 2015 pace. M&A announced volumes are running 20% to 25% below last year, and we would expect that to persist. 
Equity underwriting revenues were $266 million, up 66% versus 1Q. And debt underwriting revenues were $345 million, up 44% sequentially. Although we saw improvements in underwriting, activity remained below historical levels. As we have mentioned on past calls, we have a healthy pipeline of transactions waiting to be executed. Issuer confidence and investor appetite will be critical for the results in underwriting to improve. 
In equities, we remained our leadership position and expect to be #1 globally with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 4% sequentially. Second quarter '16 was a strong quarter across products and regions as we continue to work with our clients through uncertain times. Cash equities was up sequentially. Derivatives remained robust. Prime brokerage continue to be a steady performer, and we improve the efficiency of our balance sheet. 
Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading revenues were $1.3 billion, up 49% versus the first quarter. Revenues improved sequentially across credit, macro and commodities businesses. Our credit businesses benefited from a tightening of spreads. In particular, securitized products performed well against this backdrop. 
In macro, we provided support to our clients leading up to and through the Brexit referendum, where prudent risk management contributed to higher revenues sequentially. Commodities benefited from better credit performance and market conditions, specifically a stabilization in energy credits, resulting in an increase in client activity. Fixed Income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $353 billion in the quarter. 
Other revenues were up versus first quarter, primarily driven by better credit performance for our held for investment and held for sale relationship loans. Lastly, average trading VaR for the second quarter was $46 million, flat to last quarter. VaR was generally range-bound over the quarter, inclusive of Brexit. 
Wealth Management performed well in the second quarter with revenues of $3.8 billion, up 4% sequentially. Even though we have not seen a pickup in retail engagement, this business continues to provide stability against an uncertain macro backdrop. 
Total client assets of $2 trillion increased 2%. Fee-based assets hit a new high of $820 billion. And flows in the quarter were $12 billion, up from $5.9 billion in the first quarter. 
Net interest income was essentially -- was flat sequentially, though up 12% year-over-year. Lending balances were up $3 billion quarter-over-quarter and $11 billion year-over-year, which has resulted in a significant increase in interest income. This growth was partially offset by an increase in amortization as a result of a pickup in mortgage prepayment fees as rates declined. 
Our bank NII forecast that we shared in May remains unchanged, and we are on pace with our bank growth target for 2016. 
Transactional revenues were $798 million this quarter, up 10% sequentially. This improvement was driven by mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans and not a rebound in activity. As mentioned before, transactional activity remained subdued. 
On expenses, compensation was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our compensation ratio decreased to 56.5%, which reflects the benefit of our strategy to grow noncompensable revenues. Noncompensation expenses were essentially flat to 1Q. We continue to invest in digital and our infrastructure to ensure our compliance with DOL. 
Our PBT margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 21.4% in 1Q '16. We remain confident we will hit the 23% to 25% pretax margin target we set for 2017 despite the slower-than-expected pace of future interest rate increases. 
In Investment Management, revenues were $583 million, up 22% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $517 million, essentially flat versus 1Q. AUM was also essentially flat at $406 billion, a continuation of the trend that we have seen over the last several quarters. 
Investment revenues in the quarter improved to $50 million versus a loss in 1Q '16, driven by improved performance across a number of funds, including private equity and real estate investments. Investment revenues remained volatile as global markets and asset prices adjust to the changing political landscape and growth dynamic. Overall, expenses were up 7% quarter-over-quarter driven by higher compensation on investment gains. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $829 billion at June 30, up from the $807 billion at March 31. The spot increase was driven by a high level of activity at the very end of June, primarily due to Brexit, as we supported our clients. We have seen the balance sheet retreat from this high in the first -- few weeks of the third quarter. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III Advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $365 billion, down from $385 billion in the first quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 15.8% versus 14.6% in the first quarter. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.1%, up from 6% in Q1. As James mentioned, during the second quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 23 million shares, and our board declared a $0.20 dividend per share. 
Last night, we announced that we will deem all of the issued and outstanding TruPS by August 18, 2016. The TruPS carry a blended cost of 6.2%. We received approval to redeem these securities in this year's CCAR. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 33.5%. Going forward, we continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%. 
After a difficult start to 2016, the markets improved in the second quarter. However, the world continues to experience significant geopolitical uncertainty, and with that, the potential for economic underperformance. The Brexit vote and upcoming U.S. elections have only added to a cloudy outlook. It is too early to predict how the second half will play out. On the one hand, the political uncertainty casts a negative shadow over the markets and will undoubtedly cause some corporations to pause over future CapEx and other expansion plans, and many investors, particularly individuals, remain cautious. On the other hand, the movement in currencies and the improvement in commodity and some equity prices is leading many clients to begin to position for what might be a volatile second half. Our pipelines remain healthy and our business is well positioned, but whether this translates into near-term business is an open question. As the coming months unfold, we will remain nimble where we see client opportunities while staying rigorous to our Project Streamline and other expense initiatives. 
With that, we will open up the line to questions."

I think, as you know, when we laid out our plan in the beginning of the year, we talked about being a critical and incredibly size fixed income business that was relevant to our clients but also supported our other businesses. And what we said is that we were going to -- the goal was to maintain our revenue footprint that we had had on an absolute basis in the last couple of years. Year-to-date, our performance is at about $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion, so it's in line with that revenue footprint. We saw a broad support and broad improvement across all the products, actually, in the second quarter. I highlighted SBG. Tightening spreads helped. Strong performance in agencies. FX was aided by the volatility we saw from Brexit. Commodities clearly better credit performance. We had a much more stable backdrop. Oil prices going from $38 to $48 versus sort of the wild swings that we saw in the first quarter. So broadly, a very strong performance. It is only one quarter. In the first quarter, when people were talking about our performance, we warned that it was only one quarter. We've made a lot of changes that we think will help this business, and this will take time, but we've been pleased with the progress that we've seen to date."

Listen, my view was that there was a general overreaction to the underperformance of FIC in sort of the middle of last year through the first half of the first quarter. And I saw very little downside risk to the business. When we're running at $500 million, $600 million a quarter, I thought the downside risk was very small. The upside risk was actually quite high. And that's why we said we thought on a relative normalized basis, a $1 billion run rate a quarter was entirely reasonable. The headcount we took out at the end of the last year, actually many of our competitors have taken that headcount and dribs and drabs, so it wasn't remarkable against the context of what was going on in the market. We just did it at one point in time. And clearly, we were overstaffed at that point in time. And we came to a fundamental view, at the end of last year, to do 2 things: one is to realign the staff to what we thought was a $1 billion-ish run rate business. And maybe, it's more. And we were not going to get ahead of ourselves. Obviously, it is more this quarter. But we don't think it's materially less than that, to be honest. At the same time, the second thing we did was to align all of our sales and trading businesses together. And with that kind of lots of operational synergies, risk management synergies, overall management, client coverage synergies with our SRM, our senior relationship management program. And I think that wasn't going to evidence itself in the days and weeks following the realignment. But we felt pretty confident in the months and years following it, it would. And maybe we're starting to see some of that. Thirdly, just on the particular mix of our business. Obviously, we are more credit-centric than macro, but we do have a very good FX business that benefited. You have seen a lot more volatility in rates. And clearly, the credit markets, as Jon said, recovered not just in the core FIC -- the Fixed Income business, but in commodities. So the combination of all of these things said that, ""Yes, it's a good number this quarter."" Are we shocked by it? Not really. We weren't nearly shocked when everybody else seemed to be when we were doing $500 million, $600 million. And that's we're not going to get ahead of what we've said a $1 billion run rate. And let's see how it plays out, although not each individual quarter, but over the next couple of years."

And as you've heard us say in the past, we've been spending significant energy and dollars into investing in our digital platforms in Wealth Management. As you know, we hired Naureen Hassan earlier this year to run that effort for us. We think that the right business model and the winning hand here is a combination of advice and FAs with technology. We've been investing heavily in this area. We've had some good early progress with some of our mobile apps with some recognition and awards. But there are really 3 areas that we've been focused on. One is around data and analytics, so providing our clients with better data and analysis so they can make more informed and better decisions. Secondly, efficiencies around automation. That will be helpful not only from an expense standpoint, but also giving FAs and clients more time to be together and not focus on paperwork and doing other things like that. And then lastly, most importantly, sort of how our clients interface with us. We have 3.5 million households in our footprint with many different investing needs, but also many different requirements and idiosyncratic wants and likes. And so we have been building out a broader platform just in terms of how we interface with our clients, whether that's video, whether that's in person with their FA, whether that's mobile, whether that's text. And we have been doing that for quite sometime. So we have been investing in this area. We have told you it's going to be important to the overall business. We believe secular trends here are for advice with technology. And that's the business that we're building."

I think that one has to take into account that the wealth management market in this country is actually extremely diverse. In our own book of business, only 2%, I think, of our client assets are in households with less than $100,000. We have nearly $800 billion in households with $10 million or more. So you got to look at the segmentation. You got to look at the complexity of the client needs, of which access through distinct technologies is a clear need, but it's by no means the only need for folks who've got $10 million, $20 million, $50 million. Portfolio allocation, superior product, access to our underwriting calendar, all of the other things which we bring to the party, including our intellectual capital through our research. So it's a very important development. The whole digital development and finance. In my view, it is the most important in the payment sector followed by the consumer credit sector, followed by the Wealth Management sector. But we're making the investments, as Jon said, through our digital team that we've hired under Naureen's leadership, and we make the investments and will continue making them."

March was more stable, a better backdrop for the businesses that we are in. And then April and May looked a lot like March. What we saw in June was sort of a continuation of that trend. As we approached the Brexit referendum, we saw people start to realize the potential impact of this outcome. And we saw more risk management and hedging activity. And then for the couple of days right before and right after we saw heightened volatility and significant volumes. I would tell you that, broadly speaking, 1 or 2 days does not make a quarter for us. It's a much more balanced business than that. Given also all the changes that we made, particularly around the oil merchanting business and some of the other actions, we would expect less volatility than we've seen in the past, but we're obviously not going to print $1 billion every quarter on the nose. So we're going to see fluctuations in that number. I wouldn't say that we over-earned. I would say that the volume helped for a day or 2, but again doesn't drive the overall performance of a quarter. And then we are -- we've been pleased with the results. I don't think that the changes that we made restricted our ability to earn. We weren't constrained in terms of the capacity or personnel. And it was a good quarter."

In terms of the mix that we've given historically around held for investment versus fair value held for sale. The held for sale fair value portfolio is down a little bit. It's about a 35%. That's obviously being driven by some of the sales that we've made in that portfolio. E&P also a good story there, down to $3.5 billion from the $4.1 billion that we reported earlier.

And of course, we both, as always, look forward to your questions. 
Our results this quarter reflect solid performance in an improved but obviously still relatively fragile environment. Our team had several objectives coming into the quarter, as follows: managing the uncertain macroeconomic environment, continuing the momentum we're building in Fixed Income while preserving stability in our other businesses, maintaining expense discipline and obtaining approval for our capital plan under CCAR. By and large, we met these objectives, and despite the overall lack of conviction in the market, we executed on our strategic plan and performed well in the areas of traditional strength. We saw continued stability and progress in our core businesses with each performing roughly in line with expectations given the environment. We made particular progress in Fixed Income & Commodities, where we generated approximately $1.3 billion in revenue, up significantly from the first quarter. Jon will take you through each of our businesses in a moment. 
On expenses, we remain focused on our cost discipline both tactically and through Project Streamline. We're now a simpler organization and therefore must be leaner and more efficient in our spend. We discussed initiatives that are currently underway last month at our financials conference and are pleased with Project Streamline's progress to date. 
Our ROE for the quarter was 8.3% and demonstrated progress towards that 2017 target. 
Finally, we received a nonobjection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan. We believe this decision reflects the changes we undertook as well as our business mix stability. The approval enables us to increase our dividend to $0.20 per quarter and a repurchase up to $3.5 billion in common stock over the next 12 months, commencing in the third quarter. 
CCAR's outcome reinforces our aim to steadily increase the return of capital to shareholders over time. And indeed, it marks the fourth consecutive year in which we have done so. We were also asked to resubmit our plan due to certain deficiencies that the Federal Reserve found in our capital planning process. We're working extremely hard to ensure a successful resubmission towards the end of this year. 
On the macro environment, a lot was going on. Britain's decision to leave the European Union created uncertainty that is likely to persist for some time as the market grapples with the political and economic paths forward. As we said publicly, we considered this outcome suboptimal, but it did, indeed, provide us with a live stress scenario as we endured record high volumes and spikes of volatility, our liquidity remained strong, our systems ran smoothly and our clients accessed the market quickly and in size. 
I'll now turn over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail and again look forward to your questions in a few minutes."

However, we continued to see macro uncertainty, and with it, periods of heightened volatility. Geopolitical events, including Brexit, have kept market participants on the sidelines as they wait for clearer trends to emerge. Despite this backdrop, Morgan Stanley delivered solid results. 
For the quarter, we reported revenues of $8.9 billion versus $7.8 billion in 1Q. Noninterest expenses for the first quarter were $6.4 billion versus $6.1 billion last quarter. The increase is primarily driven by increased compensation expense on higher revenues. 
Profit before taxes for the quarter was $2.5 billion versus $1.7 billion in 1Q '16, highlighting the operating leverage we have in the business model. 
Project Streamline remains on track. In mid-June, James highlighted some of the key initiatives that have been identified to meet our objective of reducing our cost base by $1 billion by 2017. These initiatives will continue to be carried out through the next 18 months, but substantial progress has already been made. 
We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence to optimize workforce costs. We have hired 250 employees with our objective of hiring 1,250 employees through the end of 2017. Offsetting this, headcount has come down in our metro, higher-cost locations. We are 50% complete with our objectives to close 4 North American data centers and are on schedule to close the remaining 2 by 2017. 
We continually seek ways to deploy technology to drive efficiencies and automation. To that end, we just rolled out a cloud-based procurement platform, which will drive future savings through more straight-through processing and payments and greater intelligence in purchasing decisions. We continue to show greater discipline around our nonessential travel and have achieved a 50% reduction through the first half of the year as compared to the first half of 2015. 
Turning to Institutional Securities. Revenues were $4.6 billion, up 23% quarter-on-quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, essentially flat to the first quarter. Streamline initiatives offset costs associated with rising revenues. 
Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion. Our ISG year-to-date compensation to net revenue ratio was 36%. We remain committed to our compensation ratio target of less than or equal to 37% we set out at the beginning of the year. 
In Investment Banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenues, up 12% sequentially. Year-to-date, we were #2 globally in announced M&A, completed M&A, IPOs and equity and equity-linked offerings. 
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $497 million, down 16% off of a strong 1Q. Dialogue and interest in strategic transactions remained strong, but below the 2015 pace. M&A announced volumes are running 20% to 25% below last year, and we would expect that to persist. 
Equity underwriting revenues were $266 million, up 66% versus 1Q. And debt underwriting revenues were $345 million, up 44% sequentially. Although we saw improvements in underwriting, activity remained below historical levels. As we have mentioned on past calls, we have a healthy pipeline of transactions waiting to be executed. Issuer confidence and investor appetite will be critical for the results in underwriting to improve. 
In equities, we remained in our leadership position and expect to be #1 globally with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 4% sequentially. Second quarter '16 was a strong quarter across products and regions as we continue to work with our clients through uncertain times. Cash equities was up sequentially. Derivatives remained robust. Prime brokerage continued to be a steady performer, and we improved the efficiency of our balance sheet. 
Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading revenues were $1.3 billion, up 49% versus the first quarter. Revenues improved sequentially across credit, macro and commodities businesses. Our credit businesses benefited from a tightening of spreads. In particular, securitized products performed well against this backdrop. 
In macro, we provided support to our clients leading up to and through the Brexit referendum, where prudent risk management contributed to higher revenues sequentially. Commodities benefited from better credit performance and market conditions, specifically a stabilization in energy credits, resulting in an increase in client activity. Fixed Income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $353 billion in the quarter. 
Other revenues were up versus first quarter, primarily driven by better credit performance for our held for investment and held for sale relationship loans. Lastly, average trading VaR for the second quarter was $46 million, flat to last quarter. VaR was generally range-bound over the quarter, inclusive of Brexit. 
Wealth Management performed well in the second quarter with revenues of $3.8 billion, up 4% sequentially. Even though we have not seen a pickup in retail engagement, this business continues to provide stability against an uncertain macro backdrop. 
Total client assets of $2 trillion increased 2%. Fee-based assets hit a new high of $820 billion. And flows in the quarter were $12 billion, up from $5.9 billion in the first quarter. 
Net interest income was essentially -- was flat sequentially, though up 12% year-over-year. Lending balances were up $3 billion quarter-over-quarter and $11 billion year-over-year, which has resulted in a significant increase in interest income. This growth was partially offset by an increase in amortization as a result of a pickup in mortgage prepayment fees as rates declined. 
Our bank NII forecast that we shared in May remains unchanged, and we are on pace with our bank growth target for 2016. 
Transactional revenues were $798 million this quarter, up 10% sequentially. This improvement was driven by mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans and not a rebound in activity. As mentioned before, transactional activity remained subdued. 
On expenses, compensation was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our compensation ratio decreased to 56.5%, which reflects the benefit of our strategy to grow noncompensable revenues. Non-compensation expenses were essentially flat to 1Q. We continue to invest in digital and our infrastructure to ensure our compliance with DOL. 
Our PBT margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 21.4% in 1Q '16. We remain confident we will hit the 23% to 25% pretax margin target we set for 2017 despite the slower-than-expected pace of future interest rate increases. 
In Investment Management, revenues were $583 million, up 22% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $517 million, essentially flat versus 1Q. AUM was also essentially flat at $406 billion, a continuation of the trend that we have seen over the last several quarters. 
Investment revenues in the quarter improved to $50 million versus a loss in 1Q '16, driven by improved performance across a number of funds, including private equity and real estate investments. Investment revenues remained volatile as global markets and asset prices adjust to the changing political landscape and growth dynamic. Overall, expenses were up 7% quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher compensation on investment gains. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $829 billion at June 30, up from the $807 billion at March 31. The spot increase was driven by a high level of activity at the very end of June, primarily due to Brexit, as we supported our clients. We have seen the balance sheet retreat from this high in the first few weeks of the third quarter. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III Advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $365 billion, down from $385 billion in the first quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 15.8% versus 14.6% in the first quarter. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.1%, up from 6% in Q1. As James mentioned, during the second quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 23 million shares, and our board declared a $0.20 dividend per share. 
Last night, we announced that we will redeem all of the issued and outstanding TruPS by August 18, 2016. The TruPS carry a blended cost of 6.2%. We received approval to redeem these securities in this year's CCAR. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 33.5%. Going forward, we continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%. 
After a difficult start to 2016, the markets improved in the second quarter. However, the world continues to experience significant geopolitical uncertainty, and with that, the potential for economic underperformance. The Brexit vote and upcoming U.S. elections have only added to a cloudy outlook. It is too early to predict how the second half will play out. On the one hand, the political uncertainty casts a negative shadow over the markets and will undoubtedly cause some corporations to pause over future CapEx and other expansion plans, and many investors, particularly individuals, remain cautious. On the other hand, the movement in currencies and the improvement in commodity and some equity prices is leading many clients to begin to position for what might be a volatile second half. Our pipelines remain healthy and our business is well positioned, but whether this translates into near-term business is an open question. As the coming months unfold, we will remain nimble where we see client opportunities while staying rigorous to our Project Streamline and other expense initiatives.

I'll try to tackle that. I think, as you know, when we laid out our plan in the beginning of the year, we talked about being a critical and credibly sized fixed income business that was relevant to our clients but also supported our other businesses. And what we said is that we were going to -- the goal was to maintain our revenue footprint that we had, had on an absolute basis in the last couple of years. Year-to-date, our performance is at around $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion, so it's in line with that revenue footprint. We saw broad support and broad improvement across all the products, actually, in the second quarter. I highlighted SBG. Tightening spreads helped. Strong performance in agencies. FX was aided by the volatility we saw from Brexit. Commodities, clearly better credit performance. We had a much more stable backdrop. Oil prices going from $38 to $48 versus sort of the wild swings that we saw in the first quarter. So broadly, a very strong performance. It is only one quarter. In the first quarter, when people were talking about our performance, we warned that it was only one quarter. We made a lot of changes that we think will help this business, and this will take time, but we've been pleased with the progress that we've seen to date."

Listen, my view was that there was a general overreaction to the underperformance of FIC in sort of from the middle of last year through the first half of the first quarter. And I saw very little downside risk to the business. When we're running at $500 million, $600 million a quarter, I thought the downside risk was very small. The upside risk was actually quite high. And that's why we said we thought on a relative normalized basis, a $1 billion run rate a quarter was entirely reasonable. The headcount we took out at the end of the last year, actually many of our competitors have taken out headcount in dribs and drabs, so it wasn't remarkable against the context of what was going on in the market, we just did it at one point in time. And clearly, we were overstaffed at that point in time. And we came to a fundamental view, at the end of last year, to do 2 things: one is to realign the staff to what we thought was a $1 billion-ish run rate business. And maybe, it's more. And we're not going to get ahead of ourselves. Obviously, it was more this quarter. But we don't think it's materially less than that, to be honest. At the same time, the second thing we did was to align all of our sales and trading businesses together. And with that come lots of operational synergies, risk management synergies, overall management, client coverage synergies with our SRM, our senior relationship management program. And I think that wasn't going to evidence itself in the days and weeks following the realignment. But we felt pretty confident in the months and years following it, it would. And maybe we're starting to see some of that. Thirdly, just on the particular mix of our business. Obviously, we're more credit-centric than macro, but we do have a very good FX business that benefited. You have seen a lot more volatility in rates. And clearly, the credit markets, as Jon said, recovered not just in the core FIC -- the Fixed Income business, but in commodities. So the combination of all of these things said that, yes, it's a good number this quarter. Are we shocked by it? Not really. We weren't nearly shocked when everybody else seemed to be when we were doing $500 million, $600 million. And that's -- we're not going to get ahead of it, we set a $1 billion run rate. And let's see how it plays out over not each individual quarter, but over the next couple of years."

And as you've heard us say in the past, we've been spending significant energy and dollars into investing in our digital platforms in Wealth Management. As you know, we hired Naureen Hassan earlier this year to run that effort for us. We think that the right business model and the winning hand here is a combination of advice in FAs with technology. We've been investing heavily in this area. We've had some good early progress with some of our mobile apps with some recognition and awards. But there are really 3 areas that we've been focused on. One is around data and analytics, so providing our clients with better data and analysis so they can make more informed and better decisions. Secondly, efficiencies around automation. That will be helpful not only from an expense standpoint, but also giving FAs and clients more time to be together and not focused on paperwork and doing other things like that. And then lastly, most importantly, is sort of how our clients interface with us. We have 3.5 million households in our footprint with many different investing needs, but also many different requirements and idiosyncratic wants and likes. And so we have been building out a broader platform in terms of how we interface with our clients, whether that's video, whether that's in person with their FA, whether that's mobile, whether that's text. And we have been doing that for quite some time. So we have been investing in this area. We have told you it's going to be important to the overall business.

I think that one has to take into account that the wealth management market in this country is actually extremely diverse. In our own book of business, only 2%, I think, of our client assets are in households with less than $100,000. We have nearly $800 billion in households with $10 million or more. So you've got to look at the segmentation. You've got to look at the complexity of the client needs, of which access through distinct technologies is a clear need, but it's by no means the only need for folks who've got $10 million, $20 million, $50 million. Portfolio allocation, superior product, access to our underwriting calendar, all of the other things which we bring to the party, including our intellectual capital through our research. So it's a very important development, the whole digital development in finance. In my view, it is the most important in the payment sector, followed by the consumer credit sector, followed by the wealth management sector.

March was more stable, a better backdrop for the businesses that we are in. And then that April and May looked a lot like March. What we saw in June was sort of a continuation of that trend. As we approached the Brexit referendum, we saw people start to realize the potential impact of this outcome. And we saw more risk management and hedging activity. And then for the couple of days right before and right after, we saw heightened volatility and significant volumes. I would tell you that, broadly speaking, 1 or 2 days does not make a quarter for us. It's a much more balanced business than that. Given also all the changes that we made, particularly around the oil merchanting business and some of the other actions, we would expect less volatility than we've seen in the past, but we're obviously not going to print $1 billion every quarter on the nose. So we're going to see fluctuations in that number. I wouldn't say that we over-earned. I would say that the volume helped for a day or 2, but again doesn't drive the overall performance of a quarter. And then we are -- we've been pleased with the results. I don't think that the changes that we made restricted our ability to earn. We weren't constrained in terms of the capacity or personnel.

In terms of the mix, what we've given historically around held for investment versus fair value held for sale, the held for sale fair value portfolio is down a little bit. It's about at 35%. That's obviously being driven by some of the sales that we've made in that portfolio. E&P, also a good story there, down to $3.5 billion from the $4.1 billion that we reported earlier. So we continue to make progress in reducing some of our exposures in that sector. Just as a proxy, last quarter, we took about $127 million allowance for loan loss.

Our results this quarter reflect solid perform",486,"Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I'll make a few brief introductory remarks, and then Jon will take you through the numbers. And of course, we both, as always, look forward to your questions. 
Our results this quarter reflect solid performance in an improved but obviously still relatively fragile environment. Our team had several objectives coming into the quarter, as follows: managing the uncertain macroeconomic environment, continuing the momentum we're building in Fixed Income while preserving stability in our other businesses, maintaining expense discipline and obtaining approval for our capital plan under CCAR. By and large, we met these objectives, and despite the overall lack of conviction in the market, we executed on our strategic plan and performed well in the areas of traditional strength. We saw continued stability and progress in our core businesses with each performing roughly in line with expectations given the environment. We made particular progress in Fixed Income & Commodities, where we generated approximately $1.3 billion in revenue, up significantly from the first quarter. Jon will take you through each of our businesses in a moment. 
On expenses, we remain focused on our cost discipline both tactically and through Project Streamline. We're now a simpler organization and therefore must be leaner and more efficient in our spend. We discussed initiatives that are currently underway last month at our financials conference and are pleased with Project Streamline's progress to date. 
Our ROE for the quarter was 8.3% and demonstrated progress towards that 2017 target. 
Finally, we received a nonobjection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan. We believe this decision reflects the changes we undertook as well as our business mix stability. The approval enables us to increase our dividend to $0.20 per quarter and a repurchase up to $3.5 billion in common stock over the next 12 months, commencing in the third quarter. 
CCAR's outcome reinforces our aim to steadily increase the return of capital to shareholders over time. And indeed, it marks the fourth consecutive year in which we have done so. We were also asked to resubmit our plan due to certain deficiencies that the Federal Reserve found in our capital planning process. We're working extremely hard to ensure a successful resubmission towards the end of this year. 
On the macro environment, a lot was going on. Britain's decision to leave the European Union created uncertainty that is likely to persist for some time as the market grapples with the political and economic paths forward. As we said publicly, we considered this outcome suboptimal, but it did, indeed, provide us with a live stress scenario as we endured record high volumes and spikes of volatility, our liquidity remained strong, our systems ran smoothly and our clients accessed the market quickly and in size. 
I'll now turn over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail and again look forward to your questions in a few minutes."

However, we continued to see macro uncertainty, and with it, periods of heightened volatility. Geopolitical events, including Brexit, have kept market participants on the sidelines as they wait for clearer trends to emerge. Despite this backdrop, Morgan Stanley delivered solid results. 
For the quarter, we reported revenues of $8.9 billion versus $7.8 billion in 1Q. Noninterest expenses for the first quarter were $6.4 billion versus $6.1 billion last quarter. The increase is primarily driven by increased compensation expense on higher revenues. 
Profit before taxes for the quarter was $2.5 billion versus $1.7 billion in 1Q '16, highlighting the operating leverage we have in the business model. 
Project Streamline remains on track. In mid-June, James highlighted some of the key initiatives that have been identified to meet our objective of reducing our cost base by $1 billion by 2017. These initiatives will continue to be carried out through the next 18 months, but substantial progress has already been made. 
We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence to optimize workforce costs. We have hired 250 employees with our objective of hiring 1,250 employees through the end of 2017. Offsetting this, headcount has come down in our metro, higher-cost locations. We are 50% complete with our objectives to close 4 North American data centers and are on schedule to close the remaining 2 by 2017. 
We continually seek ways to deploy technology to drive efficiencies and automation. To that end, we just rolled out a cloud-based procurement platform, which will drive future savings through more straight-through processing and payments and greater intelligence in purchasing decisions. We continue to show greater discipline around our nonessential travel and have achieved a 50% reduction through the first half of the year as compared to the first half of 2015. 
Turning to Institutional Securities. Revenues were $4.6 billion, up 23% quarter-on-quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, essentially flat to the first quarter. Streamline initiatives offset costs associated with rising revenues. 
Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion. Our ISG year-to-date compensation to net revenue ratio was 36%. We remain committed to our compensation ratio target of less than or equal to 37% we set out at the beginning of the year. 
In Investment Banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenues, up 12% sequentially. Year-to-date, we were #2 globally in announced M&A, completed M&A, IPOs and equity and equity-linked offerings. 
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $497 million, down 16% off of a strong 1Q. Dialogue and interest in strategic transactions remained strong, but below the 2015 pace. M&A announced volumes are running 20% to 25% below last year, and we would expect that to persist. 
Equity underwriting revenues were $266 million, up 66% versus 1Q. And debt underwriting revenues were $345 million, up 44% sequentially. Although we saw improvements in underwriting, activity remained below historical levels. As we have mentioned on past calls, we have a healthy pipeline of transactions waiting to be executed. Issuer confidence and investor appetite will be critical for the results in underwriting to improve. 
In equities, we remained in our leadership position and expect to be #1 globally with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 4% sequentially. Second quarter '16 was a strong quarter across products and regions as we continue to work with our clients through uncertain times. Cash equities was up sequentially. Derivatives remained robust. Prime brokerage continued to be a steady performer, and we improved the efficiency of our balance sheet. 
Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading revenues were $1.3 billion, up 49% versus the first quarter. Revenues improved sequentially across credit, macro and commodities businesses. Our credit businesses benefited from a tightening of spreads. In particular, securitized products performed well against this backdrop. 
In macro, we provided support to our clients leading up to and through the Brexit referendum, where prudent risk management contributed to higher revenues sequentially. Commodities benefited from better credit performance and market conditions, specifically a stabilization in energy credits, resulting in an increase in client activity. Fixed Income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $353 billion in the quarter. 
Other revenues were up versus first quarter, primarily driven by better credit performance for our held for investment and held for sale relationship loans. Lastly, average trading VaR for the second quarter was $46 million, flat to last quarter. VaR was generally range-bound over the quarter, inclusive of Brexit. 
Wealth Management performed well in the second quarter with revenues of $3.8 billion, up 4% sequentially. Even though we have not seen a pickup in retail engagement, this business continues to provide stability against an uncertain macro backdrop. 
Total client assets of $2 trillion increased 2%. Fee-based assets hit a new high of $820 billion. And flows in the quarter were $12 billion, up from $5.9 billion in the first quarter. 
Net interest income was essentially -- was flat sequentially, though up 12% year-over-year. Lending balances were up $3 billion quarter-over-quarter and $11 billion year-over-year, which has resulted in a significant increase in interest income. This growth was partially offset by an increase in amortization as a result of a pickup in mortgage prepayment fees as rates declined. 
Our bank NII forecast that we shared in May remains unchanged, and we are on pace with our bank growth target for 2016. 
Transactional revenues were $798 million this quarter, up 10% sequentially. This improvement was driven by mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans and not a rebound in activity. As mentioned before, transactional activity remained subdued. 
On expenses, compensation was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our compensation ratio decreased to 56.5%, which reflects the benefit of our strategy to grow noncompensable revenues. Non-compensation expenses were essentially flat to 1Q. We continue to invest in digital and our infrastructure to ensure our compliance with DOL. 
Our PBT margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 21.4% in 1Q '16. We remain confident we will hit the 23% to 25% pretax margin target we set for 2017 despite the slower-than-expected pace of future interest rate increases. 
In Investment Management, revenues were $583 million, up 22% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $517 million, essentially flat versus 1Q. AUM was also essentially flat at $406 billion, a continuation of the trend that we have seen over the last several quarters. 
Investment revenues in the quarter improved to $50 million versus a loss in 1Q '16, driven by improved performance across a number of funds, including private equity and real estate investments. Investment revenues remained volatile as global markets and asset prices adjust to the changing political landscape and growth dynamic. Overall, expenses were up 7% quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher compensation on investment gains. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $829 billion at June 30, up from the $807 billion at March 31. The spot increase was driven by a high level of activity at the very end of June, primarily due to Brexit, as we supported our clients. We have seen the balance sheet retreat from this high in the first few weeks of the third quarter. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III Advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $365 billion, down from $385 billion in the first quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 15.8% versus 14.6% in the first quarter. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.1%, up from 6% in Q1. As James mentioned, during the second quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 23 million shares, and our board declared a $0.20 dividend per share. 
Last night, we announced that we will redeem all of the issued and outstanding TruPS by August 18, 2016. The TruPS carry a blended cost of 6.2%. We received approval to redeem these securities in this year's CCAR. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 33.5%. Going forward, we continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%. 
After a difficult start to 2016, the markets improved in the second quarter. However, the world continues to experience significant geopolitical uncertainty, and with that, the potential for economic underperformance. The Brexit vote and upcoming U.S. elections have only added to a cloudy outlook. It is too early to predict how the second half will play out. On the one hand, the political uncertainty casts a negative shadow over the markets and will undoubtedly cause some corporations to pause over future CapEx and other expansion plans, and many investors, particularly individuals, remain cautious. On the other hand, the movement in currencies and the improvement in commodity and some equity prices is leading many clients to begin to position for what might be a volatile second half. Our pipelines remain healthy and our business is well positioned, but whether this translates into near-term business is an open question. As the coming months unfold, we will remain nimble where we see client opportunities while staying rigorous to our Project Streamline and other expense initiatives. 
With that, we will open up the line to questions."

And what we said is that we were going to -- the goal was to maintain our revenue footprint that we had, had on an absolute basis in the last couple of years. Year-to-date, our performance is at around $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion, so it's in line with that revenue footprint. We saw broad support and broad improvement across all the products, actually, in the second quarter. I highlighted SBG. Tightening spreads helped. Strong performance in agencies. FX was aided by the volatility we saw from Brexit. Commodities, clearly better credit performance. We had a much more stable backdrop. Oil prices going from $38 to $48 versus sort of the wild swings that we saw in the first quarter. So broadly, a very strong performance. It is only one quarter. In the first quarter, when people were talking about our performance, we warned that it was only one quarter. We made a lot of changes that we think will help this business, and this will take time, but we've been pleased with the progress that we've seen to date."

Listen, my view was that there was a general overreaction to the underperformance of FIC in sort of from the middle of last year through the first half of the first quarter. And I saw very little downside risk to the business. When we're running at $500 million, $600 million a quarter, I thought the downside risk was very small. The upside risk was actually quite high. And that's why we said we thought on a relative normalized basis, a $1 billion run rate a quarter was entirely reasonable. The headcount we took out at the end of the last year, actually many of our competitors have taken out headcount in dribs and drabs, so it wasn't remarkable against the context of what was going on in the market, we just did it at one point in time. And clearly, we were overstaffed at that point in time. And we came to a fundamental view, at the end of last year, to do 2 things: one is to realign the staff to what we thought was a $1 billion-ish run rate business. And maybe, it's more. And we're not going to get ahead of ourselves. Obviously, it was more this quarter. But we don't think it's materially less than that, to be honest. At the same time, the second thing we did was to align all of our sales and trading businesses together. And with that come lots of operational synergies, risk management synergies, overall management, client coverage synergies with our SRM, our senior relationship management program. And I think that wasn't going to evidence itself in the days and weeks following the realignment. But we felt pretty confident in the months and years following it, it would. And maybe we're starting to see some of that. Thirdly, just on the particular mix of our business. Obviously, we're more credit-centric than macro, but we do have a very good FX business that benefited. You have seen a lot more volatility in rates. And clearly, the credit markets, as Jon said, recovered not just in the core FIC -- the Fixed Income business, but in commodities. So the combination of all of these things said that, yes, it's a good number this quarter. Are we shocked by it? Not really. We weren't nearly shocked when everybody else seemed to be when we were doing $500 million, $600 million. And that's -- we're not going to get ahead of it, we set a $1 billion run rate. And let's see how it plays out over not each individual quarter, but over the next couple of years."

And as you've heard us say in the past, we've been spending significant energy and dollars into investing in our digital platforms in Wealth Management. As you know, we hired Naureen Hassan earlier this year to run that effort for us. We think that the right business model and the winning hand here is a combination of advice in FAs with technology. We've been investing heavily in this area. We've had some good early progress with some of our mobile apps with some recognition and awards. But there are really 3 areas that we've been focused on. One is around data and analytics, so providing our clients with better data and analysis so they can make more informed and better decisions. Secondly, efficiencies around automation. That will be helpful not only from an expense standpoint, but also giving FAs and clients more time to be together and not focused on paperwork and doing other things like that. And then lastly, most importantly, is sort of how our clients interface with us. We have 3.5 million households in our footprint with many different investing needs, but also many different requirements and idiosyncratic wants and likes. And so we have been building out a broader platform in terms of how we interface with our clients, whether that's video, whether that's in person with their FA, whether that's mobile, whether that's text. And we have been doing that for quite some time. So we have been investing in this area. We have told you it's going to be important to the overall business.

I think that one has to take into account that the wealth management market in this country is actually extremely diverse. In our own book of business, only 2%, I think, of our client assets are in households with less than $100,000. We have nearly $800 billion in households with $10 million or more. So you've got to look at the segmentation. You've got to look at the complexity of the client needs, of which access through distinct technologies is a clear need, but it's by no means the only need for folks who've got $10 million, $20 million, $50 million. Portfolio allocation, superior product, access to our underwriting calendar, all of the other things which we bring to the party, including our intellectual capital through our research. So it's a very important development, the whole digital development in finance. In my view, it is the most important in the payment sector, followed by the consumer credit sector, followed by the wealth management sector.

March was more stable, a better backdrop for the businesses that we are in. And then that April and May looked a lot like March. What we saw in June was sort of a continuation of that trend. As we approached the Brexit referendum, we saw people start to realize the potential impact of this outcome. And we saw more risk management and hedging activity. And then for the couple of days right before and right after, we saw heightened volatility and significant volumes. I would tell you that, broadly speaking, 1 or 2 days does not make a quarter for us. It's a much more balanced business than that. Given also all the changes that we made, particularly around the oil merchanting business and some of the other actions, we would expect less volatility than we've seen in the past, but we're obviously not going to print $1 billion every quarter on the nose. So we're going to see fluctuations in that number. I wouldn't say that we over-earned. I would say that the volume helped for a day or 2, but again doesn't drive the overall performance of a quarter. And then we are -- we've been pleased with the results. I don't think that the changes that we made restricted our ability to earn. We weren't constrained in terms of the capacity or personnel.

So Mike, you heard some of the comments in my script about some of the things that we're doing and the progress that we're making. I think the best way to look at it is both comp and noncomp. On the noncomp, if you look at year-to-date results, we're down about $350 million versus last year. A good chunk of that related to these Streamline initiatives and litigation, there is clearly a benefit, unfortunately, from a lower revenue number, but there's good progress in the noncomp side. On the comp side, also a reflection of revenues. But as you heard, the ISG comp ratio year-to-date at 36% versus, I think, it was 38% ex DVA last year year-to-date. So good discipline on the comp and good discipline on the expenses. And we're confident that we're going to be able to hit the $1 billion target."

The broad characteristics of that portfolio are generally the same, i.e., about 60% of that is to investment-grade counterparties, about 30% of that is funded. In terms of the mix, what we've given historically around held for investment versus fair value held for sale, the held for sale fair value portfolio is down a little bit. It's about at 35%. That's obviously being driven by some of the sales that we've made in that portfolio. E&P, also a good story there, down to $3.5 billion from the $4.1 billion that we reported earlier. So we continue to make progress in reducing some of our exposures in that sector. Just as a proxy, last quarter, we took about $127 million allowance for loan loss.

Thank you for joining us. After a challenging end to 2015, and frankly a difficult start to this year, Morgan Stanley is back on track and delivered solid results in the third quarter. The major strategic goals w",410,"Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. After a challenging end to 2015, and frankly a difficult start to this year, Morgan Stanley is back on track and delivered solid results in the third quarter. The major strategic goals we outlined are trending in the right direction. Wealth Management's pretax margin hit the lower end of our 23% to 25% range for next year. Fixed Income is on course for an annualized quarterly revenue run rate of $1 billion per quarter, and Project Streamline's progress is evident in our 73.3% efficiency ratio this quarter. The 9% to 11% ROE target for next year remains our focus. Traditional businesses of strength, namely Equities and Investment Banking, remain solid. Additionally, Investment Management rebounded from its underperformance a year ago, but more progress needs to be made. We're comfortable with our strategy and competitive positioning, but by no means are we complacent. We have much more work to do. 
On the business side, expense management program has to run its full course. Fixed Income needs to evidence continued consistency, and our Wealth Management business needs to adapt to ongoing changes, such as DoL and digital innovation. 
On the regular tree front, we need to successfully meet our obligations that include resubmitting our capital plan and addressing shortcomings in our recovery and resolution plan. Furthermore, we have to ensure we're prosecuting our business optimally, given the proposed inclusion of the GSIB buffer into CCAR and any other regulatory changes. 
The firm is well positioned to move past these challenges and then focus on growth opportunities. 
Finally, we must remain extremely vigilant about our collective actions and constantly reaffirm Morgan Stanley's core values, putting our clients first and doing the right thing are central to our culture. If we embrace these simple objectives every day at work and every time we face a decision, I am confident that the inevitable outcome of these efforts will be achieving our financial goals. 
Needless to say, we can never control for all the vagaries of market and geopolitical uncertainty, but our job is to remain nimble as circumstances warrant and mitigate risks when called upon. Our senior team is battle hardened, loyal and highly motivated to succeed. I'm proud of the way they're leading our employees through these ever-changing times, and I have every confidence they will continue to do so. 
I'll now ask Jon to discuss this specific quarter in much more detail."

The third quarter results demonstrated progress against the strategic objectives we outlined earlier this year. While slower summer markets generally impacted client activity and volumes, our business mix generated solid results. For the quarter, we reported firm revenues of $8.9 billion, unchanged versus the second quarter. PBT was $2.4 billion and EPS was $0.81, a sequential increase of 8%. The results yielded an 8.7% ROE. 
Before discussing the businesses' performance, I want to touch briefly on the progress we have made on Project Streamline. We remain on track to achieve our objective of reducing expenses by $1 billion by year-end 2017 on flat revenues. Year-to-date, non-compensation expenses have decreased by approximately $800 million or 10% versus the same period last year. While some of that benefit is related to lower revenues, the vast majority of the 200 expense initiatives identified internally are yielding results and will continue to be carried out through year-end 2017. 
We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence and have hired more than 650 employees in lower-cost locations. The vast majority of these hires have been offset by a corresponding reduction in the headcount in our core locations. We are progressing towards our target of hiring 1,250 employees in our centers of excellence through 2017. 
We have begun to recognize savings from shutting down the 2 North American data centers and are on target to close the remaining 2 next year. 
Further, last year's restructuring of Fixed Income Sales & Trading continues to be a tailwind for the overall non-compensation expense base. In addition to the meaningful divisional headcount reduction, we have also realized savings in operations and other support services. 
In addition to support service efficiencies, our Streamline targets were predicated on compensation savings and lower litigation spend. Year-to-date, our ISG compensation to net revenue ratio was 36% compared to 38% over the same period last year, excluding DVA. Litigation expenses have also decreased year-over-year. Our targets continue to assume that we will not see any new outsized litigation expenses or penalties. 
Our CCAR resubmission as well as potential future costs associated with Brexit will serve as headwinds to Streamline. The CCAR resubmission has demanded resources, both people and money, and will remain a medium-term expense. Despite these cross turns, we are on track to deliver the $1 billion reduction in expenses by year-end 2017. 
Now to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities franchise performed well in the third quarter. We showed leadership in our businesses of traditional strength: Equity Sales & Trading, advisory and IPOs, while continuing to make progress in Fixed Income Sales & Trading. 
ISG net revenues were $4.6 billion, essentially unchanged on a sequential basis. Non-compensation expenses were $1.5 billion for the quarter, up slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but down versus the prior year. Compensation expenses were $1.7 billion. And year-to-date, our ISG comp ratio is 36%. We remain disciplined on compensation and are committed to our target ratio of less than or equal to 37%. 
In Investment Banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenues, in line with our 2Q results. Year-to-date, we were #1 globally in IPOs and #2 in announced M&A, completed M&A and equity and equity-linked offerings. Pipelines are stable and markets are generally constructive, but as one would expect, the timing and pace of future deals will be a function on a market backdrop, issuer confidence and investor appetite. 
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $504 million, up 1% versus 2Q '16. M&A announced volumes are running approximately 35% below last year's heightened levels as lingering uncertainty and increased regulatory scrutiny have weighed on activity. However, the pipelines remain healthy, and clients are engaged and interested in discussing strategic transactions. 
Equity underwriting revenues were $236 million, down 11% versus 2Q. Debt underwriting revenues were $364 million, up 6% sequentially. Equity underwriting activity remains well below historical levels. We saw a slight pickup in IPO activity toward the end of the quarter, and we'll have to see if that trend continues. 
In equities, we expect to be #1 globally. Revenues were $1.9 billion, representing our best third quarter in recent history, with solid results across regions. Revenues were down 12% versus a strong second quarter, impacted by a lack of specific macro events, a muted underwriting calendar and light volumes that are traditionally seen over the summer months.
Third quarter results were driven by continued strength in derivatives as performance was aided by a number of meaningful corporate transactions, underscoring the collaboration and cooperation across our investment bank. Results were offset by a sequential decrease in cash revenues on lower volumes and lower prime brokerage revenues driven by seasonality. 
Fixed Income Sales and Trading had a solid quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, up 14% versus the second quarter. A more constructive backdrop in the last 2 quarters resulted in an improved trading environment. The benign credit environment, with tightening spreads broadly, and in Europe in particular following the Brexit vote, yielded stronger sequential performance in corporate credit. SPG also benefited from a favorable credit environment. And increased volumes and agency trading further benefited our micro businesses. 
In macro, we witnessed an increased level of client engagement in rates, largely attributable to divergent expectations around central bank policy. 
Fixed Income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $344 billion at September 30. Fixed Income revenues year-to-date are $3.6 billion. We remain comfortable with our objective of maintaining the revenue footprint we had over the last few years. This restructuring is a multiyear process, and we remain focused on supporting our clients and delivering results. 
Other revenues were up versus the second quarter, primarily driven by gains on our relationship and event held for sale loans as a result of an improved credit environment. 
Lastly, average trading VaR for the third quarter was $42 million, down versus $46 million last quarter and $53 million last year. The derisking of our balance sheet, as we continue to adjust the composition of our inventory, contributed to the reduction in VaR. 
Wealth Management performed very well and continued to provide stability in the third quarter. Net revenues were up 2% to $3.9 billion, which is a record for the business. The PBT margin was 23%. Despite retail investors remaining cautious, we have good momentum in this business. Total client assets increased 3% sequentially to a new high of $2.1 trillion. Fee-based assets increased 4% to $855 billion, which is a new high both in absolute terms and as a percent of total client assets. The increase included $13.5 billion in asset flows. These trends position us well for 2017. 
Asset Management revenues increased 2% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting positive flows and generally higher indices. Net interest income was up 7% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The sequential increase was attributable to both loan growth and lower amortization driven by a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds. Bank lending balances were up approximately $3.5 billion quarter-over-quarter and $11 billion year-over-year, on track to meet our lending goals. 
Transactional revenues of $791 million this quarter were largely unchanged from Q2, but down sequentially when excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans as client engagement remains subdued. Total expenses were essentially flat on the quarter. Non-comp expense were down 3%, reflecting continued execution of our expense initiatives, notwithstanding continued investment in our digital platforms and enhancements to our infrastructure to ensure compliance with DoL. 
Investment Management saw a stable asset management fees and less volatility in the investments line. Total net revenues were $552 million, down 5% quarter-over-quarter. AUM grew to $417 billion due to market appreciation and positive flows, primarily in our liquidity products as a result of money market reform. Asset management fees for the quarter were $508 million, essentially unchanged versus 2Q '15. Investment revenues in the quarter were $51 million, essentially unchanged versus last quarter, reflecting a more stable investing environment. Overall expenses were down slightly, 2% quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower non-compensation expenses. 
We currently have approximately $2.3 billion of investments in and relationships with legacy covered funds subject to the Volker rule across the firm. While we expect to request additional extensions for the overwhelming majority of these investments, we continue to consider various alternatives to be in compliance with the rule, including sales, redemptions and liquidations, where the amounts we ultimately realize on these  investments may be less than their current carrying value. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $814 billion on September 30, down from $829 billion on June 30. The spot decrease was primarily due to a redesign of our Wealth Management client suite -- excuse me, client cash sweep program in light of money market reform and a decrease in firm liquidity following Brexit. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $368 billion, essentially flat to the second quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 20 basis points to 15.9%. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was up approximately 10 basis points to 6.2%. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 41 million shares, and our board declared a $0.20 dividend per share. Our tax rate in the third quarter was 31.5%. And going forward, we continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%. 
We have good momentum in our business and have had -- have made demonstrable progress towards our 2017 9% to 11% ROE target. That said, we have more work to do. We must continue to execute on the plan we laid out at the beginning of the year, including the implementation of our bank strategy and focus on expense management. We also continue to invest in our businesses through digital offerings, electronic trading capabilities, preparation for DoL and additional regulatory conformance. We will continue to focus on the levers within our control, and we feel confident that our ROE target is achievable. Currently, markets are constructive, but both markets and investor sentiment will be impacted by some major events in the near-term horizon, including the upcoming U.S. election, the outcome of Fed policy action and the Italian referendum, to name a few. Closure around some of these risk events will be an important factor for investor conviction and corporate confidence. 
With that, we will open up the line to questions."

We've generated $3.6 billion of revenue year-to-date. So that puts us on track to maintain our revenue footprint that we saw over the last couple of years. I think the success that we've had have -- has boosted confidence, and the team continues to gel. But it is early. This is good results for the quarter, but we need to do this over multiple years, not multiple quarters. I think the leadership has started to gel and bring the sales and trading businesses together, consolidating, as you said, the risk management and some of the infrastructure support behind that. And we've seen some real learnings from that experience, and I think that's been a positive from a results perspective. But this quarter also benefited from just a good backdrop, particularly for our businesses around the credit and SPG line items. We saw tightening spreads, better environment in Europe on ECB buying, better distress trading volumes, better volumes on SPG. So a good backdrop and good performance against that."

It's obviously a marathon. We're trying to build a firm that's resilient for all times. We're trying to be ahead of whatever the regulatory requirements are that has been, as you and everybody else know, is a moving feast. We have the GSIB buffer coming into play. Obviously, there's going to be some netting against that. If I read the speeches right around the shape of the balance sheet growth and around whether one is held to buyback commitments for the 9 quarters. So we need to see the GSIB buffers. We took our buyback from 0 to 500 to $1 billion to $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion in the last several years. We took our dividend to $0.05 to $0.10 to $0.15 to $0.20 a quarter. So pretty significant progress. But you're right. We have a high-class problem. I mean, I was amused watching some of the pundits on TV the other day talking about ROE and how different it is from precrisis. And I was -- I wanted to yell at the screen, yes, well, that might have a little bit to do with the capital being a little different precrisis. We had $30 billion of capital precrisis. Our ROEs would be comfortably above 20% now if we were operating the business like that. But clearly, that would not be a good or appropriate operating model. So we're approaching -- I think we were at or near the top of the large banks in terms of payout ratio. I can't remember exactly, but I think it was in the high 80s or even 90% ratio. This year, we're continuing to accrete at a pretty sporty numbers, as you point out. And -- but we've got some wood to chop in between times. So we've got a resubmission on CCAR. Successful resubmission would dictate whether our current capital program remains intact. So that has all of our attention. And then the 2017 CCAR program is just around the corner. In April, I think the submission is. So if you got to have a problem in terms of returns in this business, I'd much rather be because you've got too much capital. That, I would argue, is our problem. Achieving 100% payout ratio is obviously a terrific position for us to target, and that's what we're targeting. And then we'll sort of take it from there. The business being a multiyear restructuring, I don't think any bank has wanted to try and get ahead of the capital regimes, given that all the rules have not been fully baked in. As Jon just said, we're dealing with the Volcker dispositions that will happen and whatever extensions we get from June 17. But obviously, we've got some dispositions going. We've got the GSIB buffer in action. The resolution plans are still working their way through. All the banks are resubmitting those. So there's a lot of moving parts. As a shareholder, frankly, I, as shareholder, take comfort from the fact that we have the capital that we have."

We're obviously did much better than probably anybody thought this quarter, and part of that is a function mix of our Fixed Income business with a more credit-dependent business. But that said, we have made real changes to this business. We did bring down the RWAs from $390 billion to about $125 billion. We did take out 25% of the total headcount cost and people in December of last year. And we are currently on track for the $1 billion run rate. In fact, we're a little above that. But again, we're not too focused on the quarter-to-quarter moves. And I think if -- the question underlying it is, ""Did team do something on the risk front, which was sort of further standard of deviations out from what we've typically been doing the last couple of years?"" I think the answer is clearly no. And we can -- Jon will take you through some more details if there's more to add to it. But this is a business which, as you know, and if you look at The Street's numbers, I think all of the banks are priced on the upside, right? There was a better macro environment. There was more volatility post Brexit. There was more volatility around rates because of the Fed -- multiple talking voices of the Fed and the credit markets firmed up. So if you're in the Fixed Income business, you're going to have a better quarter. We're in it. We had a better quarter. What I'm pleased about is we did it with 25% less people.

So we're actually running year-to-date below our revenue from 2015. And so therefore, the apples-to-apples comparison is a little more challenging.

The major strategic goals w",410,"Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. After a challenging end to 2015, and frankly a difficult start to this year, Morgan Stanley is back on track and delivered solid results in the third quarter. The major strategic goals we outlined are trending in the right direction. Wealth Management's pretax margin hit the lower end of our 23% to 25% range for next year. Fixed Income is on course for an annualized quarterly revenue run rate of $1 billion per quarter, and Project Streamline's progress is evident in our 73.3% efficiency ratio this quarter. The 9% to 11% ROE target for next year remains our focus. Traditional businesses of strength, namely Equities and Investment Banking, remain solid. Additionally, Investment Management rebounded from its underperformance a year ago, but more progress needs to be made. We're comfortable with our strategy and competitive positioning, but by no means are we complacent. We have much more work to do. 
On the business side, expense management program has to run its full course. Fixed Income needs to evidence continued consistency, and our Wealth Management business needs to adapt to ongoing changes, such as DoL and digital innovation. 
On the regular tree front, we need to successfully meet our obligations that include resubmitting our capital plan and addressing shortcomings in our recovery and resolution plan. Furthermore, we have to ensure we're prosecuting our business optimally, given the proposed inclusion of the GSIB buffer into CCAR and any other regulatory changes. 
The firm is well positioned to move past these challenges and then focus on growth opportunities. 
Finally, we must remain extremely vigilant about our collective actions and constantly reaffirm Morgan Stanley's core values, putting our clients first and doing the right thing are central to our culture. If we embrace these simple objectives every day at work and every time we face a decision, I am confident that the inevitable outcome of these efforts will be achieving our financial goals. 
Needless to say, we can never control for all the vagaries of market and geopolitical uncertainty, but our job is to remain nimble as circumstances warrant and mitigate risks when called upon. Our senior team is battle hardened, loyal and highly motivated to succeed. I'm proud of the way they're leading our employees through these ever-changing times, and I have every confidence they will continue to do so. 
I'll now ask Jon to discuss this specific quarter in much more detail."

The third quarter results demonstrated progress against the strategic objectives we outlined earlier this year. While slower summer markets generally impacted client activity and volumes, our business mix generated solid results. For the quarter, we reported firm revenues of $8.9 billion, unchanged versus the second quarter. PBT was $2.4 billion and EPS was $0.81, a sequential increase of 8%. The results yielded an 8.7% ROE. 
Before discussing the businesses' performance, I want to touch briefly on the progress we have made on Project Streamline. We remain on track to achieve our objective of reducing expenses by $1 billion by year-end 2017 on flat revenues. Year-to-date, non-compensation expenses have decreased by approximately $800 million or 10% versus the same period last year. While some of that benefit is related to lower revenues, the vast majority of the 200 expense initiatives identified internally are yielding results and will continue to be carried out through year-end 2017. 
We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence and have hired more than 650 employees in lower-cost locations. The vast majority of these hires have been offset by a corresponding reduction in the headcount in our core locations. We are progressing towards our target of hiring 1,250 employees in our centers of excellence through 2017. 
We have begun to recognize savings from shutting down the 2 North American data centers and are on target to close the remaining 2 next year. 
Further, last year's restructuring of Fixed Income Sales & Trading continues to be a tailwind for the overall non-compensation expense base. In addition to the meaningful divisional headcount reduction, we have also realized savings in operations and other support services. 
In addition to support service efficiencies, our Streamline targets were predicated on compensation savings and lower litigation spend. Year-to-date, our ISG compensation to net revenue ratio was 36% compared to 38% over the same period last year, excluding DVA. Litigation expenses have also decreased year-over-year. Our targets continue to assume that we will not see any new outsized litigation expenses or penalties. 
Our CCAR resubmission as well as potential future costs associated with Brexit will serve as headwinds to Streamline. The CCAR resubmission has demanded resources, both people and money, and will remain a medium-term expense. Despite these cross turns, we are on track to deliver the $1 billion reduction in expenses by year-end 2017. 
Now to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities franchise performed well in the third quarter. We showed leadership in our businesses of traditional strength: Equity Sales & Trading, advisory and IPOs, while continuing to make progress in Fixed Income Sales & Trading. 
ISG net revenues were $4.6 billion, essentially unchanged on a sequential basis. Non-compensation expenses were $1.5 billion for the quarter, up slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but down versus the prior year. Compensation expenses were $1.7 billion. And year-to-date, our ISG comp ratio is 36%. We remain disciplined on compensation and are committed to our target ratio of less than or equal to 37%. 
In Investment Banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenues, in line with our 2Q results. Year-to-date, we were #1 globally in IPOs and #2 in announced M&A, completed M&A and equity and equity-linked offerings. Pipelines are stable and markets are generally constructive, but as one would expect, the timing and pace of future deals will be a function on a market backdrop, issuer confidence and investor appetite. 
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $504 million, up 1% versus 2Q '16. M&A announced volumes are running approximately 35% below last year's heightened levels as lingering uncertainty and increased regulatory scrutiny have weighed on activity. However, the pipelines remain healthy, and clients are engaged and interested in discussing strategic transactions. 
Equity underwriting revenues were $236 million, down 11% versus 2Q. Debt underwriting revenues were $364 million, up 6% sequentially. Equity underwriting activity remains well below historical levels. We saw a slight pickup in IPO activity toward the end of the quarter, and we'll have to see if that trend continues. 
In equities, we expect to be #1 globally. Revenues were $1.9 billion, representing our best third quarter in recent history, with solid results across regions. Revenues were down 12% versus a strong second quarter, impacted by a lack of specific macro events, a muted underwriting calendar and light volumes that are traditionally seen over the summer months.
Third quarter results were driven by continued strength in derivatives as performance was aided by a number of meaningful corporate transactions, underscoring the collaboration and cooperation across our investment bank. Results were offset by a sequential decrease in cash revenues on lower volumes and lower prime brokerage revenues driven by seasonality. 
Fixed Income Sales and Trading had a solid quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, up 14% versus the second quarter. A more constructive backdrop in the last 2 quarters resulted in an improved trading environment. The benign credit environment, with tightening spreads broadly, and in Europe in particular following the Brexit vote, yielded stronger sequential performance in corporate credit. SPG also benefited from a favorable credit environment. And increased volumes and agency trading further benefited our micro businesses. 
In macro, we witnessed an increased level of client engagement in rates, largely attributable to divergent expectations around central bank policy. 
Fixed Income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $344 billion at September 30. Fixed Income revenues year-to-date are $3.6 billion. We remain comfortable with our objective of maintaining the revenue footprint we had over the last few years. This restructuring is a multiyear process, and we remain focused on supporting our clients and delivering results. 
Other revenues were up versus the second quarter, primarily driven by gains on our relationship and event held for sale loans as a result of an improved credit environment. 
Lastly, average trading VaR for the third quarter was $42 million, down versus $46 million last quarter and $53 million last year. The derisking of our balance sheet, as we continue to adjust the composition of our inventory, contributed to the reduction in VaR. 
Wealth Management performed very well and continued to provide stability in the third quarter. Net revenues were up 2% to $3.9 billion, which is a record for the business. The PBT margin was 23%. Despite retail investors remaining cautious, we have good momentum in this business. Total client assets increased 3% sequentially to a new high of $2.1 trillion. Fee-based assets increased 4% to $855 billion, which is a new high both in absolute terms and as a percent of total client assets. The increase included $13.5 billion in asset flows. These trends position us well for 2017. 
Asset Management revenues increased 2% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting positive flows and generally higher indices. Net interest income was up 7% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The sequential increase was attributable to both loan growth and lower amortization driven by a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds. Bank lending balances were up approximately $3.5 billion quarter-over-quarter and $11 billion year-over-year, on track to meet our lending goals. 
Transactional revenues of $791 million this quarter were largely unchanged from Q2, but down sequentially when excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans as client engagement remains subdued. Total expenses were essentially flat on the quarter. Non-comp expense were down 3%, reflecting continued execution of our expense initiatives, notwithstanding continued investment in our digital platforms and enhancements to our infrastructure to ensure compliance with DoL. 
Investment Management saw a stable asset management fees and less volatility in the investments line. Total net revenues were $552 million, down 5% quarter-over-quarter. AUM grew to $417 billion due to market appreciation and positive flows, primarily in our liquidity products as a result of money market reform. Asset management fees for the quarter were $508 million, essentially unchanged versus 2Q '15. Investment revenues in the quarter were $51 million, essentially unchanged versus last quarter, reflecting a more stable investing environment. Overall expenses were down slightly, 2% quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower non-compensation expenses. 
We currently have approximately $2.3 billion of investments in and relationships with legacy covered funds subject to the Volcker rule across the firm. While we expect to request additional extensions for the overwhelming majority of these investments, we continue to consider various alternatives to be in compliance with the rule, including sales, redemptions and liquidations, where the amounts we ultimately realize on these  investments may be less than their current carrying value. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $814 billion on September 30, down from $829 billion on June 30. The spot decrease was primarily due to a redesign of our Wealth Management client suite -- excuse me, client cash sweep program in light of money market reform and a decrease in firm liquidity following Brexit. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $368 billion, essentially flat to the second quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 20 basis points to 15.9%. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was up approximately 10 basis points to 6.2%. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 41 million shares, and our board declared a $0.20 dividend per share. Our tax rate in the third quarter was 31.5%. And going forward, we continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%. 
We have good momentum in our business and have had -- have made demonstrable progress towards our 2017 9% to 11% ROE target. That said, we have more work to do. We must continue to execute on the plan we laid out at the beginning of the year, including the implementation of our bank strategy and focus on expense management. We also continue to invest in our businesses through digital offerings, electronic trading capabilities, preparation for DoL and additional regulatory conformance. We will continue to focus on the levers within our control, and we feel confident that our ROE target is achievable. Currently, markets are constructive, but both markets and investor sentiment will be impacted by some major events in the near-term horizon, including the upcoming U.S. election, the outcome of Fed policy action and the Italian referendum, to name a few. Closure around some of these risk events will be an important factor for investor conviction and corporate confidence. 
With that, we will open up the line to questions."

We also said we wanted to maintain the revenue footprint while reducing the balance sheet, the capital, the expenses and the headcount in this business. We're 3 quarters into it, Brennan. We've generated $3.6 billion of revenue year-to-date. So that puts us on track to maintain our revenue footprint that we saw over the last couple of years. I think the success that we've had have -- has boosted confidence, and the team continues to gel. But it is early. This is good results for the quarter, but we need to do this over multiple years, not multiple quarters. I think the leadership has started to gel and bring the sales and trading businesses together, consolidating, as you said, the risk management and some of the infrastructure support behind that. And we've seen some real learnings from that experience, and I think that's been a positive from a results perspective. But this quarter also benefited from just a good backdrop, particularly for our businesses around the credit and SPG line items. We saw tightening spreads, better environment in Europe on ECB buying, better distress trading volumes, better volumes on SPG. So a good backdrop and good performance against that."

We had clients that were in prime funds that were going to go to a floating NAV and with the gates and so forth. We did make a change in sort of how we sweep deposits based on thresholds and client preference, first into BDP and then into government fund. So that had a slight decrease overall, but it did actually improve the liquidity of those deposits as uninsured went down and insured went up. But the BDP number is relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, so we haven't really seen any major change in behavior. And as I said before, it's still pretty subdued in terms of the investor sentiment."

On Volcker, it's $2.3 billion, which is why we highlighted that number. There's been some confusion around it.

It's obviously a marathon. We're trying to build a firm that's resilient for all times. We're trying to be ahead of whatever the regulatory requirements are that has been, as you and everybody else know, is a moving feast. We have the GSIB buffer coming into play. Obviously, there's going to be some netting against that. If I read the speeches right around the shape of the balance sheet growth and around whether one is held to buyback commitments for the 9 quarters. So we need to see the GSIB buffers. We took our buyback from 0 to 500 to $1 billion to $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion in the last several years. We took our dividend to $0.05 to $0.10 to $0.15 to $0.20 a quarter. So pretty significant progress. But you're right. We have a high-class problem. I mean, I was amused watching some of the pundits on TV the other day talking about ROE and how different it is from precrisis. And I was -- I wanted to yell at the screen, yes, well, that might have a little bit to do with the capital being a little different precrisis. We had $30 billion of capital precrisis. Our ROEs would be comfortably above 20% now if we were operating the business like that. But clearly, that would not be a good or appropriate operating model. So we're approaching -- I think we were at or near the top of the large banks in terms of payout ratio. I can't remember exactly, but I think it was in the high 80s or even 90% ratio. This year, we're continuing to accrete at a pretty sporty numbers, as you point out. And -- but we've got some wood to chop in between times. So we've got a resubmission on CCAR. Successful resubmission would dictate whether our current capital program remains intact. So that has all of our attention. And then the 2017 CCAR program is just around the corner. In April, I think the submission is. So if you got to have a problem in terms of returns in this business, I'd much rather be because you've got too much capital. That, I would argue, is our problem. Achieving 100% payout ratio is obviously a terrific position for us to target, and that's what we're targeting. And then we'll sort of take it from there. The business being a multiyear restructuring, I don't think any bank has wanted to try and get ahead of the capital regimes, given that all the rules have not been fully baked in. As Jon just said, we're dealing with the Volcker dispositions that will happen and whatever extensions we get from June 17. But obviously, we've got some dispositions going. We've got the GSIB buffer in action. The resolution plans are still working their way through. All the banks are resubmitting those. So there's a lot of moving parts. As a shareholder, frankly, I, as shareholder, take comfort from the fact that we have the capital that we have."

We said we're targeting $1 billion a quarter on annualized basis. We said there'd be volatility around that by the very notion -- very aspect of the markets. We're obviously did much better than probably anybody thought this quarter, and part of that is a function mix of our Fixed Income business with a more credit-dependent business. But that said, we have made real changes to this business. We did bring down the RWAs from $390 billion to about $125 billion. We did take out 25% of the total headcount cost and people in December of last year. And we are currently on track for the $1 billion run rate. In fact, we're a little above that. But again, we're not too focused on the quarter-to-quarter moves. And I think if -- the question underlying it is, ""Did team do something on the risk front, which was sort of further standard of deviations out from what we've typically been doing the last couple of years?"" I think the answer is clearly no. And we can -- Jon will take you through some more details if there's more to add to it. But this is a business which, as you know, and if you look at The Street's numbers, I think all of the banks are priced on the upside, right? There was a better macro environment. There was more volatility post Brexit. There was more volatility around rates because of the Fed -- multiple talking voices of the Fed and the credit markets firmed up. So if you're in the Fixed Income business, you're going to have a better quarter. We're in it. We had a better quarter. What I'm pleased about is we did it with 25% less people.

So we're actually running year-to-date below our revenue from 2015. And so therefore, the apples-to-apples comparison is a little more challenging.

Thank you for joining us. After a challenging end to 2015, and frankly, a difficult start to this year, Morgan Stanley is back on track and delivered solid results in the third quarter. The major strategic goals",408,"Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. After a challenging end to 2015, and frankly, a difficult start to this year, Morgan Stanley is back on track and delivered solid results in the third quarter. The major strategic goals we outlined are trending in the right direction. Wealth Management's pretax margin hit the lower end of our 23% to 25% range for next year. Fixed Income is on course for an annualized quarterly revenue run rate of $1 billion per quarter, and Project Streamline's progress is evident in our 73.3% efficiency ratio this quarter. The 9% to 11% ROE target for next year remains our focus. Traditional businesses of strength, namely Equities and Investment Banking, remain solid. Additionally, Investment Management rebounded from its underperformance a year ago, but more progress needs to be made. We're comfortable with our strategy and competitive positioning, but by no means are we complacent. We have much more work to do. 
On the business side, the expense management program has to run its full course. Fixed Income needs to evidence continued consistency, and our Wealth Management business needs to adapt to ongoing changes, such as DOL and digital innovation. 
On the regulatory front, we need to successfully meet our obligations that include resubmitting our capital plan and addressing shortcomings in our recovery and resolution plan. Furthermore, we have to ensure we're prosecuting our business optimally, given the proposed inclusion of the GSIB buffer into CCAR and any other regulatory changes. 
The firm is well-positioned to move past these challenges and then focus on growth opportunities. 
Finally, we must remain extremely vigilant about our collective actions and constantly reaffirm Morgan Stanley's core values. Putting our clients first and doing the right thing are central to our culture. If we embrace these simple objectives every day at work and every time we face a decision, I am confident that the inevitable outcome of these efforts will be achieving our financial goals. 
Needless to say, we can never control for all the vagaries of market and geopolitical uncertainty, but our job is to remain nimble as circumstances warrant and mitigate risk when called upon. Our senior team is battle-hardened, loyal and highly motivated to succeed. I'm proud of the way they're leading our employees through these ever-changing times, and I have every confidence they will continue to do so. 
I'll now ask Jon to discuss this specific quarter in much more detail."

The third quarter results demonstrated progress against the strategic objectives we outlined earlier this year. While slower summer markets generally impacted client activity and volumes, our business mix generated solid results. For the quarter, we reported firm revenues of $8.9 billion, unchanged versus the second quarter. PBT was $2.4 billion and EPS was $0.81, a sequential increase of 8%. The results yielded an 8.7% ROE. 
Before discussing the businesses' performance, I want to touch briefly on the progress we have made on Project Streamline. We remain on track to achieve our objective of reducing expenses by $1 billion by year-end 2017 on flat revenues. Year-to-date, non-compensation expenses have decreased by approximately $800 million or 10% versus the same period last year. While some of that benefit is related to lower revenues, the vast majority of the 200 expense initiatives identified internally are yielding results and will continue to be carried out through year-end 2017. 
We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence and have hired more than 650 employees in lower-cost locations. The vast majority of these hires have been offset by a corresponding reduction in the headcount in our core locations. We are progressing towards our target of hiring 1,250 employees in our centers of excellence through 2017. 
We have begun to recognize savings from shutting down the 2 North American data centers and are on target to close the remaining 2 next year. 
Further, last year's restructuring of Fixed Income Sales & Trading continues to be a tailwind for the overall non-compensation expense base. In addition to the meaningful divisional headcount reduction, we have also realized savings in operations and other support services. 
In addition to support service efficiencies, our Streamline targets were predicated on compensation savings and lower litigation spend. Year-to-date, our ISG compensation to net revenue ratio was 36% compared to 38% over the same period last year, excluding DVA. Litigation expenses have also decreased year-over-year. Our targets continue to assume that we will not see any new outsized litigation expenses or penalties. 
Our CCAR resubmission, as well as potential future costs associated with Brexit, will serve as headwinds to Streamline. The CCAR resubmission has demanded resources, both people and money, and will remain a medium-term expense. Despite these cross turns, we are on track to deliver the $1 billion reduction in expenses by year-end 2017. 
Now to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities franchise performed well in the third quarter. We showed leadership in our businesses of traditional strength: Equity Sales & Trading, advisory and IPOs, while continuing to make progress in Fixed Income Sales & Trading. 
ISG net revenues were $4.6 billion, essentially unchanged on a sequential basis. Non-compensation expenses were $1.5 billion for the quarter, up slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but down versus the prior year. Compensation expenses were $1.7 billion. And year-to-date, our ISG comp ratio is 36%. We remain disciplined on compensation and are committed to our target ratio of less than or equal to 37. 
In Investment Banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenues, in line with our 2Q results. Year-to-date, we were #1 globally in IPOs and #2 in announced M&A, completed M&A and equity and equity-linked offerings. Pipelines are stable and markets are generally constructive, but as one would expect, the timing and pace of future deals will be a function of the market backdrop, issuer confidence and investor appetite. 
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $504 million, up 1% versus 2Q '16. M&A announced volumes are running approximately 35% below last year's heightened levels, as lingering uncertainty and increased regulatory scrutiny have weighed on activity. However, the pipelines remain healthy, and clients are engaged and interested in discussing strategic transactions. 
Equity underwriting revenues were $236 million, down 11% versus 2Q. Debt underwriting revenues were $364 million, up 6% sequentially. Equity underwriting activity remains well below historical levels. We saw a slight pickup in IPO activity toward the end of the quarter, and we'll have to see if that trend continues. 
In Equities, we expect to be #1 globally. Revenues were $1.9 billion, representing our best third quarter in recent history, with solid results across regions. Revenues were down 12% versus a strong second quarter, impacted by a lack of specific macro events, a muted underwriting calendar and light volumes that are traditionally seen over the summer months.
Third quarter results were driven by continued strength in derivatives, as performance was aided by a number of meaningful corporate transactions, underscoring the collaboration and cooperation across our investment bank. Results were offset by a sequential decrease in cash revenues on lower volumes and lower prime brokerage revenues driven by seasonality. 
Fixed Income Sales & Trading had a solid quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, up 14% versus the second quarter. A more constructive backdrop in the last 2 quarters resulted in an improved trading environment. The benign credit environment, with tightening spreads broadly, and in Europe in particular following the Brexit vote, yielded stronger sequential performance in corporate credit. SPG also benefited from a favorable credit environment. And increased volumes and agency trading further benefited our micro businesses. 
In macro, we witnessed an increased level of client engagement and rates, largely attributable to divergent expectations around central bank policy. 
Fixed Income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $344 billion at September 30. Fixed Income revenues year-to-date are $3.6 billion. We remain comfortable with our objective of maintaining the revenue footprint we had over the last few years. This restructuring is a multiyear process, and we remain focused on supporting our clients and delivering results. 
Other revenues were up versus the second quarter, primarily driven by gains on our relationship and event held-for-sale loans as a result of an improved credit environment. 
Lastly, average trading VaR for the third quarter was $42 million, down versus $46 million last quarter and $53 million last year. The de-risking of our balance sheet, as we continue to adjust the composition of our inventory, contributed to the reduction in VaR. 
Wealth Management performed very well and continued to provide stability in the third quarter. Net revenues were up 2% to $3.9 billion, which is a record for the business. The PBT margin was 23%. Despite retail investors remaining cautious, we have good momentum in this business. Total client assets increased 3% sequentially to a new high of $2.1 trillion. Fee-based assets increased 4% to $855 billion, which is a new high, both in absolute terms and as a percent of total client assets. The increase included $13.5 billion in asset flows. These trends position us well for 2017. 
Asset Management revenues increased 2% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting positive flows and generally higher indices. Net interest income was up 7% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The sequential increase was attributable to both loan growth and lower amortization driven by a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds. Bank lending balances were up approximately $3.5 billion quarter-over-quarter and $11 billion year-over-year, on track to meet our lending goals. 
Transactional revenues of $791 million this quarter were largely unchanged from Q2, but down sequentially when excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans, as client engagement remains subdued. Total expenses were essentially flat on the quarter. Non-comp expense were down 3%, reflecting continued execution of our expense initiatives, notwithstanding continued investment in our digital platforms and enhancements to our infrastructure to ensure compliance with DOL. 
Investment Management saw stable asset management fees and less volatility in the investments line. Total net revenues were $552 million, down 5% quarter-over-quarter. AUM grew to $417 billion due to market appreciation and positive flows, primarily in our liquidity products as a result of money market reform. Asset Management fees for the quarter were $508 million, essentially unchanged versus 2Q '15. Investment revenues in the quarter were $51 million, essentially unchanged versus last quarter, reflecting a more stable investing environment. Overall expenses were down slightly, 2% quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower non-compensation expenses. 
We currently have approximately $2.3 billion of investments in and relationships with legacy covered funds subject to the Volcker rule across the firm. While we expect to request additional extensions for the overwhelming majority of these investments, we continue to consider various alternatives to be in compliance with the rule, including sales, redemptions and liquidations, where the amounts we ultimately realize on these  investments may be less than their current carrying values. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $814 billion on September 30, down from $829 billion on June 30. The spot decrease was primarily due to a redesign of our Wealth Management client suite -- excuse me, client cash sweep program in light of money market reform and a decrease in firm liquidity following Brexit. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $368 billion, essentially flat to the second quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 20 basis points to 15.9%. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was up approximately 10 basis points to 6.2%. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 41 million shares, and our board declared a $0.20 dividend per share. Our tax rate in the third quarter was 31.5%. And going forward, we continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%. 
We have good momentum in our business and have had -- have made demonstrable progress towards our 2017 9% to 11% ROE target. That said, we have more work to do. We must continue to execute on the plan we laid out at the beginning of the year, including the implementation of our bank strategy and focus on expense management. We also continue to invest in our businesses through digital offerings, electronic trading capabilities, preparation for DOL and additional regulatory conformance. We will continue to focus on the levers within our control, and we feel confident that our ROE target is achievable. Currently, markets are constructive, but both markets and investor sentiment will be impacted by some major events on the near-term horizon, including the upcoming U.S. election, the outcome of Fed policy action and the Italian referendum, to name a few. Closure around some of these risk events will be an important factor for investor conviction and corporate confidence. 
With that, we will open up the line to questions."

We also said we wanted to maintain the revenue footprint while reducing the balance sheet, the capital, the expenses and the headcount in this business. We're 3 quarters into it, Brennan. We've generated $3.6 billion of revenue year-to-date. So that puts us on track to maintain our revenue footprint that we saw over the last couple of years. I think the success that we've had have -- has boosted confidence, and the team continues to gel. But it is early. This is good results for the quarter, but we need to do this over multiple years, not multiple quarters. I think the leadership has started to gel and bring the sales and trading businesses together, consolidating, as you said, the risk management and some of the infrastructure support behind that. And we've seen some real learnings from that experience, and I think that's been a positive from a results perspective. But this quarter also benefited from just a good backdrop, particularly for our businesses around the credit and SPG line items. We saw tightening spreads, better environment in Europe on ECB buying, better distressed trading volumes, better volumes in SPG. So a good backdrop and good performance against that."

We're trying to be ahead of whatever the regulatory requirements are. That has been, as you and everybody else know, is a moving feast. We have the GSIB buffer coming into play. Obviously, there's going to be some netting against that. If I read the speeches right around the shape of the balance sheet growth and around whether one is held to buyback commitments for the 9 quarters. So we need to see the GSIB buffers. We took our buyback from 0 to 500 to $1 billion to $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion in the last several years. We took our dividend to $0.05 to $0.10 to $0.15 to $0.20 a quarter. So pretty significant progress. But you're right. We have a high-class problem. I mean, I was amused watching some of the pundits on TV the other day talking about ROE and how different it is from pre-crisis. And I was -- I wanted to yell at the screen, yes, well, that might have a little bit to do with the capital being a little different pre-crisis. We had $30 billion of capital pre-crisis. Our ROEs would be comfortably above 20% now if we were operating the business like that. But clearly, that would not be a good or appropriate operating model. So we're approaching -- I think we were at or near the top of the large banks in terms of payout ratio. I can't remember exactly, but I think it was in the high 80s or even 90% ratio. This year, we're continuing to accrete at pretty sporty numbers, as you point out. And -- but we've got some wood to chop in between times. So we've got a resubmission on CCAR. Successful resubmission would dictate whether our current capital program remains intact. So that has all of our attention. And then the 2017 CCAR program is just around the corner, in April, I think the submission is. So if you've got to have a problem in terms of returns in this business, I'd much rather be because you've got too much capital. That, I would argue, is our problem. Achieving 100% payout ratio is obviously a terrific position for us to target, and that's what we're targeting. And then we'll sort of take it from there. But this has been a multiyear restructuring. I don't think any bank has wanted to try and get ahead of the capital regimes, given that all of the rules have not been fully baked in. As Jon just said, we're dealing with the Volcker dispositions that will happen and whatever extensions we get from June '17. But obviously, we've got some dispositions going. We've got the GSIB buffer in action. The resolution plans are still working their way through. All the banks are resubmitting those. So there's a lot of moving parts. As a shareholder, frankly, I, as shareholder, take comfort from the fact that we have the capital that we have."

We said we're targeting $1 billion a quarter on annualized basis. We said there'd be volatility around that by the very notion -- very aspect of the markets. We're obviously did much better than probably anybody thought this quarter, and part of that is a function of the mix of our Fixed Income business, with a more credit-dependent business. But that said, we have made real changes to this business. We did bring down the RWAs from $390 billion to about $125 billion now. We did take out 25% of the total headcount cost and people in December of last year. And we are currently on track for the $1 billion run rate. In fact, a little above it. But again, we're not too focused on the quarter-to-quarter moves. And I think if the question underlying it is, ""Did the team do something on the risk front which was sort of further standard of deviations out from what we've typically been doing the last couple of years?"" I think the answer is clearly no. And we can -- Jon will take you through some more details if there's more to add to it. But this is a business which, as you know, and if you look at The Street's numbers, I think all of the banks are priced on the upside, right? There was a better macro environment. There was more volatility post Brexit. There was more volatility around rates because of the Fed -- multiple talking voices of the Fed and the credit markets firmed up. So if you're in the Fixed Income business, you're going to have a better quarter. We're in it. We had a better quarter. What I'm pleased about is we did it with 25% less people. Jon, you want to add anything?"

So we're actually running year-to-date below our revenue from 2015. And so therefore, the apples-to-apples comparison is a little more challenging. So I don't think you can do the math that you just did. The one thing I will say is that we are confident.

Thank you for joining us. After a challenging end to 2015, and frankly, a difficult start to this year, Morgan Stanley is back on track and delivered solid results in the third quarter. The major strategic goals",408,"Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. After a challenging end to 2015, and frankly, a difficult start to this year, Morgan Stanley is back on track and delivered solid results in the third quarter. The major strategic goals we outlined are trending in the right direction. Wealth Management's pretax margin hit the lower end of our 23% to 25% range for next year. Fixed Income is on course for an annualized quarterly revenue run rate of $1 billion per quarter, and Project Streamline's progress is evident in our 73.3% efficiency ratio this quarter. The 9% to 11% ROE target for next year remains our focus. Traditional businesses of strength, namely Equities and Investment Banking, remain solid. Additionally, Investment Management rebounded from its underperformance a year ago, but more progress needs to be made. We're comfortable with our strategy and competitive positioning, but by no means are we complacent. We have much more work to do. 
On the business side, the expense management program has to run its full course. Fixed Income needs to evidence continued consistency, and our Wealth Management business needs to adapt to ongoing changes, such as DOL and digital innovation. 
On the regulatory front, we need to successfully meet our obligations that include resubmitting our capital plan and addressing shortcomings in our recovery and resolution plan. Furthermore, we have to ensure we're prosecuting our business optimally, given the proposed inclusion of the GSIB buffer into CCAR and any other regulatory changes. 
The firm is well-positioned to move past these challenges and then focus on growth opportunities. 
Finally, we must remain extremely vigilant about our collective actions and constantly reaffirm Morgan Stanley's core values. Putting our clients first and doing the right thing are central to our culture. If we embrace these simple objectives every day at work and every time we face a decision, I am confident that the inevitable outcome of these efforts will be achieving our financial goals. 
Needless to say, we can never control for all the vagaries of market and geopolitical uncertainty, but our job is to remain nimble as circumstances warrant and mitigate risk when called upon. Our senior team is battle-hardened, loyal and highly motivated to succeed. I'm proud of the way they're leading our employees through these ever-changing times, and I have every confidence they will continue to do so. 
I'll now ask Jon to discuss this specific quarter in much more detail."

The third quarter results demonstrated progress against the strategic objectives we outlined earlier this year. While slower summer markets generally impacted client activity and volumes, our business mix generated solid results. For the quarter, we reported firm revenues of $8.9 billion, unchanged versus the second quarter. PBT was $2.4 billion and EPS was $0.81, a sequential increase of 8%. The results yielded an 8.7% ROE. 
Before discussing the businesses' performance, I want to touch briefly on the progress we have made on Project Streamline. We remain on track to achieve our objective of reducing expenses by $1 billion by year-end 2017 on flat revenues. Year-to-date, non-compensation expenses have decreased by approximately $800 million or 10% versus the same period last year. While some of that benefit is related to lower revenues, the vast majority of the 200 expense initiatives identified internally are yielding results and will continue to be carried out through year-end 2017. 
We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence and have hired more than 650 employees in lower-cost locations. The vast majority of these hires have been offset by a corresponding reduction in the headcount in our core locations. We are progressing towards our target of hiring 1,250 employees in our centers of excellence through 2017. 
We have begun to recognize savings from shutting down the 2 North American data centers and are on target to close the remaining 2 next year. 
Further, last year's restructuring of Fixed Income Sales & Trading continues to be a tailwind for the overall non-compensation expense base. In addition to the meaningful divisional headcount reduction, we have also realized savings in operations and other support services. 
In addition to support service efficiencies, our Streamline targets were predicated on compensation savings and lower litigation spend. Year-to-date, our ISG compensation to net revenue ratio was 36% compared to 38% over the same period last year, excluding DVA. Litigation expenses have also decreased year-over-year. Our targets continue to assume that we will not see any new outsized litigation expenses or penalties. 
Our CCAR resubmission, as well as potential future costs associated with Brexit, will serve as headwinds to Streamline. The CCAR resubmission has demanded resources, both people and money, and will remain a medium-term expense. Despite these cross turns, we are on track to deliver the $1 billion reduction in expenses by year-end 2017. 
Now to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities franchise performed well in the third quarter. We showed leadership in our businesses of traditional strength: Equity Sales & Trading, advisory and IPOs, while continuing to make progress in Fixed Income Sales & Trading. 
ISG net revenues were $4.6 billion, essentially unchanged on a sequential basis. Non-compensation expenses were $1.5 billion for the quarter, up slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but down versus the prior year. Compensation expenses were $1.7 billion. And year-to-date, our ISG comp ratio is 36%. We remain disciplined on compensation and are committed to our target ratio of less than or equal to 37%. 
In Investment Banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenues, in line with our 2Q results. Year-to-date, we were #1 globally in IPOs and #2 in announced M&A, completed M&A and equity and equity-linked offerings. Pipelines are stable and markets are generally constructive, but as one would expect, the timing and pace of future deals will be a function of the market backdrop, issuer confidence and investor appetite. 
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $504 million, up 1% versus 2Q '16. M&A announced volumes are running approximately 35% below last year's heightened levels, as lingering uncertainty and increased regulatory scrutiny have weighed on activity. However, the pipelines remain healthy, and clients are engaged and interested in discussing strategic transactions. 
Equity underwriting revenues were $236 million, down 11% versus 2Q. Debt underwriting revenues were $364 million, up 6% sequentially. Equity underwriting activity remains well below historical levels. We saw a slight pickup in IPO activity toward the end of the quarter, and we'll have to see if that trend continues. 
In Equities, we expect to be #1 globally. Revenues were $1.9 billion, representing our best third quarter in recent history, with solid results across regions. Revenues were down 12% versus a strong second quarter, impacted by a lack of specific macro events, a muted underwriting calendar and light volumes that are traditionally seen over the summer months.
Third quarter results were driven by continued strength in derivatives, as performance was aided by a number of meaningful corporate transactions, underscoring the collaboration and cooperation across our investment bank. Results were offset by a sequential decrease in cash revenues on lower volumes and lower prime brokerage revenues driven by seasonality. 
Fixed Income Sales & Trading had a solid quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, up 14% versus the second quarter. A more constructive backdrop in the last 2 quarters resulted in an improved trading environment. The benign credit environment, with tightening spreads broadly, and in Europe in particular following the Brexit vote, yielded stronger sequential performance in corporate credit. SPG also benefited from a favorable credit environment. And increased volumes and agency trading further benefited our micro businesses. 
In macro, we witnessed an increased level of client engagement and rates, largely attributable to divergent expectations around central bank policy. 
Fixed Income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $344 billion at September 30. Fixed Income revenues year-to-date are $3.6 billion. We remain comfortable with our objective of maintaining the revenue footprint we had over the last few years. This restructuring is a multiyear process, and we remain focused on supporting our clients and delivering results. 
Other revenues were up versus the second quarter, primarily driven by gains on our relationship and event held-for-sale loans as a result of an improved credit environment. 
Lastly, average trading VaR for the third quarter was $42 million, down versus $46 million last quarter and $53 million last year. The de-risking of our balance sheet, as we continue to adjust the composition of our inventory, contributed to the reduction in VaR. 
Wealth Management performed very well and continued to provide stability in the third quarter. Net revenues were up 2% to $3.9 billion, which is a record for the business. The PBT margin was 23%. Despite retail investors remaining cautious, we have good momentum in this business. Total client assets increased 3% sequentially to a new high of $2.1 trillion. Fee-based assets increased 4% to $855 billion, which is a new high, both in absolute terms and as a percent of total client assets. The increase included $13.5 billion in asset flows. These trends position us well for 2017. 
Asset Management revenues increased 2% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting positive flows and generally higher indices. Net interest income was up 7% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The sequential increase was attributable to both loan growth and lower amortization driven by a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds. Bank lending balances were up approximately $3.5 billion quarter-over-quarter and $11 billion year-over-year, on track to meet our lending goals. 
Transactional revenues of $791 million this quarter were largely unchanged from Q2, but down sequentially when excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans, as client engagement remains subdued. Total expenses were essentially flat on the quarter. Non-comp expense were down 3%, reflecting continued execution of our expense initiatives, notwithstanding continued investment in our digital platforms and enhancements to our infrastructure to ensure compliance with DOL. 
Investment Management saw stable asset management fees and less volatility in the investments line. Total net revenues were $552 million, down 5% quarter-over-quarter. AUM grew to $417 billion due to market appreciation and positive flows, primarily in our liquidity products as a result of money market reform. Asset Management fees for the quarter were $508 million, essentially unchanged versus 2Q '15. Investment revenues in the quarter were $51 million, essentially unchanged versus last quarter, reflecting a more stable investing environment. Overall expenses were down slightly, 2% quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower non-compensation expenses. 
We currently have approximately $2.3 billion of investments in and relationships with legacy covered funds subject to the Volcker rule across the firm. While we expect to request additional extensions for the overwhelming majority of these investments, we continue to consider various alternatives to be in compliance with the rule, including sales, redemptions and liquidations, where the amounts we ultimately realize on these  investments may be less than their current carrying values. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $814 billion on September 30, down from $829 billion on June 30. The spot decrease was primarily due to a redesign of our Wealth Management client suite -- excuse me, client cash sweep program in light of money market reform and a decrease in firm liquidity following Brexit. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $368 billion, essentially flat to the second quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 20 basis points to 15.9%. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was up approximately 10 basis points to 6.2%. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 41 million shares, and our board declared a $0.20 dividend per share. Our tax rate in the third quarter was 31.5%. And going forward, we continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%. 
We have good momentum in our business and have had -- have made demonstrable progress towards our 2017 9% to 11% ROE target. That said, we have more work to do. We must continue to execute on the plan we laid out at the beginning of the year, including the implementation of our bank strategy and focus on expense management. We also continue to invest in our businesses through digital offerings, electronic trading capabilities, preparation for DOL and additional regulatory conformance. We will continue to focus on the levers within our control, and we feel confident that our ROE target is achievable. Currently, markets are constructive, but both markets and investor sentiment will be impacted by some major events on the near-term horizon, including the upcoming U.S. election, the outcome of Fed policy action and the Italian referendum, to name a few. Closure around some of these risk events will be an important factor for investor conviction and corporate confidence. 
With that, we will open up the line to questions."

I think the success that we've had have -- has boosted confidence, and the team continues to gel. But it is early. This is good results for the quarter, but we need to do this over multiple years, not multiple quarters. I think the leadership has started to gel and bring the sales and trading businesses together, consolidating, as you said, the risk management and some of the infrastructure support behind that. And we've seen some real learnings from that experience, and I think that's been a positive from a results perspective. But this quarter also benefited from just a good backdrop, particularly for our businesses around the credit and SPG line items. We saw tightening spreads, better environment in Europe on ECB buying, better distressed trading volumes, better volumes in SPG. So a good backdrop and good performance against that."

We're trying to be ahead of whatever the regulatory requirements are. That has been, as you and everybody else know, is a moving feast. We have the GSIB buffer coming into play. Obviously, there's going to be some netting against that. If I read the speeches right around the shape of the balance sheet growth and around whether one is held to buyback commitments for the 9 quarters. So we need to see the GSIB buffers. We took our buyback from 0 to 500 to $1 billion to $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion in the last several years. We took our dividend to $0.05 to $0.10 to $0.15 to $0.20 a quarter. So pretty significant progress. But you're right. We have a high-class problem. I mean, I was amused watching some of the pundits on TV the other day talking about ROE and how different it is from pre-crisis. And I was -- I wanted to yell at the screen, yes, well, that might have a little bit to do with the capital being a little different pre-crisis. We had $30 billion of capital pre-crisis. Our ROEs would be comfortably above 20% now if we were operating the business like that. But clearly, that would not be a good or appropriate operating model. So we're approaching -- I think we were at or near the top of the large banks in terms of payout ratio. I can't remember exactly, but I think it was in the high 80s or even 90% ratio. This year, we're continuing to accrete at pretty sporty numbers, as you point out. And -- but we've got some wood to chop in between times. So we've got a resubmission on CCAR. Successful resubmission would dictate whether our current capital program remains intact. So that has all of our attention. And then the 2017 CCAR program is just around the corner, in April, I think the submission is. So if you've got to have a problem in terms of returns in this business, I'd much rather be because you've got too much capital. That, I would argue, is our problem. Achieving 100% payout ratio is obviously a terrific position for us to target, and that's what we're targeting. And then we'll sort of take it from there. But this has been a multiyear restructuring. I don't think any bank has wanted to try and get ahead of the capital regimes, given that all of the rules have not been fully baked in. As Jon just said, we're dealing with the Volcker dispositions that will happen and whatever extensions we get from June '17. But obviously, we've got some dispositions going. We've got the GSIB buffer in action. The resolution plans are still working their way through. All the banks are resubmitting those. So there's a lot of moving parts. As a shareholder, frankly, I, as shareholder, take comfort from the fact that we have the capital that we have."

We said we're targeting $1 billion a quarter on annualized basis. We said there'd be volatility around that by the very notion -- very aspect of the markets. We're obviously did much better than probably anybody thought this quarter, and part of that is a function of the mix of our Fixed Income business, with a more credit-dependent business. But that said, we have made real changes to this business. We did bring down the RWAs from $390 billion to about $125 billion now. We did take out 25% of the total headcount cost and people in December of last year. And we are currently on track for the $1 billion run rate. In fact, a little above it. But again, we're not too focused on the quarter-to-quarter moves. And I think if the question underlying it is, ""Did the team do something on the risk front which was sort of further standard of deviations out from what we've typically been doing the last couple of years?"" I think the answer is clearly no. And we can -- Jon will take you through some more details if there's more to add to it. But this is a business which, as you know, and if you look at The Street's numbers, I think all of the banks are priced on the upside, right? There was a better macro environment. There was more volatility post Brexit. There was more volatility around rates because of the Fed -- multiple talking voices of the Fed and the credit markets firmed up.

And we do issue equity to our employees as part of compensation, so we are accruing a little bit of equity. It was predicated on that sort of general math, that it would creep up, but nothing dramatic. And what we said in January, which I think is actually even more consistent now, with some of the comments around Governor Tarullo's speech about actually implementing those changes in 2018, is that's our current thinking for '16 and '17. And then we'll obviously analyze the new rules as part of '18 CCAR, see where the progress that we've made on the balance sheet and the Fixed Income restructuring and then make another assessment at that point."
