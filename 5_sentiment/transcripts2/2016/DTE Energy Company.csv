I'm going to use my time this morning to recap our performance in 2015 and to preview 2016. But in a nutshell, I am glad to be in a position to say that we had a very successful year in 2015, not only financially, but on many other props. And I feel we're well positioned for a similarly strong year in 2016, and we are off to a good start on that 1 month into things.
So moving on to Slide 4, I'm going to start by recapping our accomplishments in 2015, and I'll give you a quick energy policy update, and then I'm going to move on to long-term growth, then I'll turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to give you a bit more detail on our financials, and then we'll wrap up.
So I'm going to provide the 2015 recap within the context of our system of priorities that's laid out on Slide 5. And for those of you who followed us for a number of years know that we consistently work this system of priorities for the last half dozen years. And for those of you less familiar, I'm just going to give you a quick rounding, and then I'll move on with the summary. But system really starts on Slide 5 with employees, and I believe that it's hard to be an excellent or great company when you got employees who have mediocre energy, so we put a lot of time and focus on engagement and the energy and focus of our employees, believing that if we get that right, we can focus of those employees on customer satisfaction, doing great job for our customers and continuous improvement that we've focused on intensely and on growing the company. And if we do those3  things right, if we serve our customers well, manage our cost well and grow and connect that growth to the economic development of our communities then the prospects for constructive political and regulatory treatment are higher, then if you can combine constructive regulation with all to growth, reproduce great outcomes for you. And for us, that means consistent predictable 5% to 6% earnings growth combined with an attractive dividend and dividend growth founded on a strong balance sheet.
So Page 6 begins the recap of our accomplishments against that system of priorities this past year, and I'll start with the employees and say that for the third consecutive year, we earned Gallup, the Gallup organization's Great Workplace Award. That's given to a handful of companies worldwide each year, and we're the only utility company to ever receive it. We were, again, in the top 15% of their worldwide database, so that was very encouraging. We also achieved the best safety result in our company's history. The lowest social rate we ever had, we're now approaching the safest in industry level. That is our explicit goal. In fact, we had the safest January in the company history by a pretty wide margin recently as well. And the National Safety Council has us ranked in the top 3% of their 670 participating companies. So we're in the top 20 of their nearly 700 companies. 
Moving on to continuous improvement, I was really glad to see our customer outage minutes drop sharply this past year by 65%. That's been a key focus for us. We got some help from the weather, but we also had really strong underlying change in our performance. So that's a good thing. Our fossil fleet was top quartile in its reliability for the fourth consecutive year. We were nearing top decile in our gas leak and leak repair program, also an area we're very focused on. And I think importantly for you, our utility O&M costs were down year-over-year, and we remain below 2008 levels and near the very front of the industry in terms of O&M cost management. On the customer front, our electric company was top quartile for both residential and business. In fact, our residential was #2 in our peer group. DTE Gas ranked #1 in 2015 on business customer satisfaction and #2 in residential customer satisfaction. So when you look at the overall set of customer set of metrics, we had a strong year in 2015.
Moving on to Slide 7. On the political and regulatory front, I'd say we have the constructive outcome in our electric rate case that went final last year. We also filed late last year our first gas rate case in 4 years. We're entering the final stages of discussions on Michigan energy policy, and I'll talk more about that a little bit later, and we have now reached the point where our spend with Michigan suppliers has doubled since we started the program back in 2011. Nearly $1 billion spent with Michigan suppliers, up from $475 million back in 2011. That's an important program for us. On the growth and value front, we invested $2.4 billion. $2.1 billion of that was in our utilities, focused on infrastructure and reliability and continued investment in renewables. We also had significant investments, as I think you're aware, in our gas storage pipeline business around our Bluestone assets. And we also made significant progress on both the NEXUS Pipeline and expansions of the Millennium Pipeline, so significant capital to support future growth. 
Finally, on the financial front, operating EPS at $4.82. That compares to our guidance coming into the year of $4.60. It was our eighth consecutive year of delivering EPS at or above the top end of our original guidance. And in addition, we increased our dividend by nearly 60 -- by nearly 6% to $2.92 a share.
So based on that recap of 2015, I hope you can see why I said at the outset that we had a very successful year in 2015, not only financially but on many other fronts. And though I know it's natural for you to focus most heavily on our financial results, in the end, those financial results are closely tied to the fairness and the quality of our regulation. And in turn, the quality of our regulation is contingent on how well we do controlling our cost via continuous improvement and how well we serve our customers and how we invest in our communities. So staying focused on the whole spectrum of our priorities is really key to our long-term performance. 
Moving on to Slide 8, I'm now going to take a minute to update you on energy policy discussions in Michigan, and those are summarized at high level on Slide 9. As you're well aware, Michigan's been considering updates to its energy laws since last year. And the move update, the current legislation was tied to the need to remake Michigan's power generation fleet. And it focuses, the legislation focuses on provisions defining an integrated resource planning process to choose our future generation mix and on clarifying the role of renewables and energy efficiency in the future.
So late in 2015, a package of bills moved out of the House Energy Policy committee and early this year, the focus is moved to the Senate. Senator Mike Nofs, who's chair of the Senate energy committee is now leading the effort to define consensus legislation that will be supported by a strong coalition. And I have to say that Nofs is really well-suited to this role. He was a principal author of our state's 2008 energy legislation, and he is as knowledgeable and experienced as any legislator in the state in this area. So we continue to work closely with Senator Nofs to define and pass this legislation in the first half of the year, and we believe that's achievable.
As I said a minute ago, the goal of this legislation is to enable the transition depicted on Slide 10. Between 2015 and 2030, driven by the aging of our power plants and the fleet power plant, our generation fleet will transition from one dominated by coal-fired generation to one with a much heavier mix of gas and renewables. And we've begun to detail planning for this transition. As you expect, in fact some of our early investments will play out this year. We'll add 50 more megawatts of wind to our win production here in Michigan and will invest our first large-scale solar facility of 50 megawatt installation north of Detroit. I am sure you all saw that the Spring Park yesterday stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan. I must say that, that was a surprise to me. It's unusual to stay a regulation prior to litigation in the lower courts. People speculated about the possibility, but I don't know the law people consider it likely so. Some are surprised. We'll have to see how the legal challenge continues to evolve. A quick reaction with kind of 1 night to sleep on it is I'm not sure much will change for us, at least in the first half of the 15-year clean power plan implementation. and that's because we, and I think many in the industry, are dealing with -- during that period, with the replacement of very old, smaller and marginally economical plants, especially given gas prices now. We're dealing with those sorts of plans during that period. As you look to the latter half of the plan, as you get out in the later years 2025 to 2030, you do start to take on some of the larger facilities. So if it turned out that the Clean Power Plan were changed in some way, those years I think could be effective. But that said, there is a lot of water that needs to flow over this before we get too specific about the impacts of the state. It could range anywhere from the rule being stayed, litigated some refinements made in the clean power plant, moves ahead without much change and its impact two things that are more impactful than that so we just have to wait and see as it evolves.
So let's turn now to our update on long-term growth with its drivers, beginning with a recap on our 2015 results as well as our 2016 guidance and best laid out on Slide 12. So we finished with strong results in 2015 as you can see at the top left. Our initial guidance for last year was 4 60. We upped that guidance twice over the course of the year ultimately the 4 78 at our fall Analyst Day and in the end, we delivered 4 82. And as I said earlier, that's the eighth consecutive year in which we met or beaten the top end of our guidance. So we talked about 5% to 6% earnings per share growth. You can see on the overlap the top right that the actual growth in recent years has been about 6.5%. This growth has been driven by a portfolio of businesses that have worked altogether with steady growth from our 2 utilities and some growth upside from our non-utility businesses. For 2016, the midpoint of our guidance as you see at the top right is $4.93. I feel very good about our ability to deliver that result or exceed it as we always do. We entered 2016 with specific plans to address potential risks or uncertainties in our budgets and though I entered the year worried about super El Niño weather, January was pretty close to normal, and we are off to good start on the year. And as I sit here talking to you, it's cold and snowing outside, so February is not matching the worries entered the year with either to this point.
Moving on to the bottom of this slide, we increased our dividend in 2015 by 0.8%. And I have said consistently that it's our intention to grow our dividend as we grow earnings, and the oval at the bottom right shows that, that's been our pattern in recent years, and I expect that pattern to continue in 2016.
I'm going to turn now from a focus on 2015 and '16 to a focus on our longer-term growth and investments, and I'll begin that discussion on Slide 13. So the underpinning of our future growth is the investment profile that you see on this slide. And as you can see our investment level over the next 5 years will be up on the order of 30% versus the last 5 years. And as I'll describe over the next few minutes, this increased investment is playing out in nearly all of our business units in our electric and gas utilities to address aging infrastructure and reliability issues as well as the beginning of our generation fleet renewable and in our gas storage and pipeline's business to capitalize on the opportunity to move Marcellus and Utica gas, which are the highest quality gas reserves in the country to nearby markets via our Millennium and NEXUS assets.
Moving to Slide 14. Within our electric utility, investing in our distribution assets to address the aging infrastructure and improved reliability has emerged as a key area of focus for us. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, of the $18 billion we project we'll invest in our electric utility over the next decade, more than 1/3, $6.5 billion in our base case is targeted at our distribution infrastructure. And frankly, the underlying need is larger than that. And this focus really comes from listening to our customers, so we're approaching the top end of J.D. Powers Midwest customer satisfaction rankings the biggest gap between us and the top-ranked performer[indiscernible]
that improves reliability, and we're doing that by replacing aging infrastructure and addressing our circuits with lowest reliability. We're also seeing the need to redesign our distribution infrastructure to address growth in some of our areas. Many of our substations are now overloaded and need to be upgraded or replaced. We're moving to do this, for example, in Ann Arbor where both of the community and the university University are overwhelming our infrastructure there. And we're doing the same in downtown Detroit, so we have a new $600 million Red Wings Arena and multi-entertainment facility going in and probably over $1 billion of growth when you take into account everything that's happening around it. That is going to require a lot of electric infrastructure. We have a similar project underway to enable a new multi-$1 billion bridge between Detroit and Canada. It requires a lot of infrastructure investment. So these are the sorts of things that we're undertaking on the distribution front but as we undertake this investment were keeping a very close eye on affordability because our customers are asking for improved reliability, and we do need to renew our aging infrastructure, but we've got to maintain affordability and competitiveness while we do that. And so the next few slides show that we've done well on that front in recent years as well affordability front. On Slide 16, you can see that residential bills for both our gas and electric customers are down in recent years. The electric bills are down, principally due to continuous improvement work and reproductions even after our most recent rate case that finalized in December, our bills are below 2012 levels. We filed our next electric rate case just a little a while ago, a week or so ago. But even after the case plays out, bills will be flat to levels 5 years earlier. And our gas utility on the right-hand side, bills this year are down materially from levels in 2012, driven most doubly by gas prices. We also have a gas rate case in process that was filed last year, but we projected bills will still be 10% lower than 5 years earlier after that case is finalized in December.
With respect to our industrial customers, so you can see on Slide 17, there are rates below both the U.S. average and Great Lakes average. And 5 years ago, this wasn't the case we have made good progress in recent years, pushing to the left on this distribution. Our industrial rates have declined 22% since 2013, which have been really important for the competitiveness and economics of this group of customers.
So I'm going to turn now from our 2 utilities to an update of our gas storage and pipelines business, Slide 18 plays out the footprint of this business, and I want to focus on 2 portions of the footprint today. The Millennium Pipeline and Marcellus Shale, which is on the right-hand side of the slide along with the adjacent Bluestone assets. This area has been a source of significant growth in recent years and continues to see expansion opportunities so going to focus on that. In addition, I want to focus on the Nexus pipeline in yellow on the slide, which is positioned to play a similar role in the Utica Shale in the years ahead.
Moving on to Slide 19, I'm going to start with an update on the NEXUS Pipeline and I will start by saying that as things have emerged, NEXUS is arguably positioned to tap the best gas reserve geology in North America. The dry gas well results in the region directly adjacent to our NEXUS Pipeline are staggering. When industry observers rank shale plays, this region of the Utica shows up at the very front of the industry cost curve, highly competitive. And so as the gas industry rationalizes supply across basins, everything adjacent to the Utica will [indiscernible] and that as a result, we believe very strongly in the fundamentals that support this pipe.
Development of the NEXUS project continues to move along, so we completed our FERC filing late last year. The pipe is about 2/3 contracted. Significant portion of that volume is with utilities, including the Ontario operations of Spectra and Enbridge in late last year. The Ontario energy Board approved their offtake positions. We're also in what I characterized as advanced discussions with additional priorities interested in positions on the pipe. And importantly, we have signed interconnect agreements in northern Ohio which is the root of this pipe totaling 1.4 Bcf per day with gas LDCs power plants and industrial switching provide additional demand for NEXUS over time.
Now we are watching and managing dynamics in the E&P sector closely, but as I said earlier, we really do believe that as the sector rationalizes supply, the region served by this pipe is going to benefit. So bottom line, we and our partner, Spectra, continue to move this pipe forward, and 2016 will be an important year in its development.
With respect to our Millennium Pipeline, we continue to see strong interest and expansion. So we're pursuing a 200 million cubic foot a day expansion currently. We filed our FERC preapproval a couple of weeks ago and are projected in service is 2018 on that. That expansion is really to access higher-priced northeast markets rather than lower-priced southern markets. We're also building a lateral up of Millennium, the 8-mile Valley lateral, which should go into service later next year. Additionally, we're seeing interest and expanding the Lamb Nims from Northeast Utilities that serious interest and I believe our discussions with them will lead to additional millennium expansions down the road.
What all this means for earnings in the gas storage pipeline business is laid out on Slide 20. The last year was a big year for earnings growth in this business. Earnings grew by 30% year-over-year to $107 million in 2015. That growth was driven by our activities in the Marcellus tied to our Millennium Pipeline and the Bluestone assets. This year, the midpoint of our guidance is $110 million, so we're projecting some growth but slower growth, obviously, than last year after the big push-up, and that's really given the reduced activity level we see by E&P players. I would say that we're also looking carefully for investment or acquisition opportunities that stress in the E&P and MLP spaces might offer us. Longer-term, we do continue to target $170 million in earnings by 2020. And although the current E&P sector dynamics will cause a pause in drilling investment this year, we expect little or no impact long-term. The country needs drilling gas supplies, productions from existing wells decline 15% a year as we can't wait very long before the drilling has to resume and our pipes are in the right locations to benefit them grow as that occurs over the next 5 years. So everybody is watching what happens over the coming months. But as you look out beyond that, this country is going to have to drill a lot of natural gas wells fundamental supply and demand says that and the Marcellus counties that we're in and the Utica are the places the drilling dollars should go.
I'm going to wrap up my remarks with a few thoughts on our Power & Industrial business, and I'll turn things over to Peter. On Slide 21, our Power & Industrial business operates contracted assets of 66 sites across the countryin  3 business lines: Industrial Energy Services, renewable; and energy reduced emissions fuel or REF, for short. On slide 22, you see that this business had net earnings of $95 million in 2015, and the midpoint of our guidance for this year is also $95 million, so flat from 2015 'to 16. Two dynamics underlying this guidance. One of our assets that serves the steel industry rolled over its contract last year. You're probably aware the steel industry is at the cyclical downturn right now so our earnings from that asset declined but offsetting that dynamic is factored. We expect our earnings to grow. So $95 million for this year and longer term, consistent with what we communicated previously. Our 2020 earnings target is $105 million in this segment as our REF projects Sunset of nearly 2020s we intend to back fill with investments, which we're working actively and opportunities on the asset acquisition front.
And with that, Peter, I'm going to turn it over to you for our financial essay."

As you know, we take advantage of having give an update on my Detroit Tigers. Now the Super Bowl, overall, the focus can be the upcoming baseball as raining will be for the most improved team after all the off-season needs. I won't be making any predictions this year, just the same open for a playoff run. I know but the Tigers early to give you a financial update in your view of the 2015 earnings before we get to your questions starting on Slide 24. And as Gerry mentioned, the DTE Energy 2015 operating earnings came at $4.82 per share and on EPS segments including a reconciliation of GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 43 of the appendix. Slide 24 show the year-over-year operating earnings by segment. First, we're going to focus on the middle column, which shows 2015 results, let me start first with total earnings for the growth segments. Earnings growth segments were $848 million or 4.73 per share. This is an increase of $52 million or $0.25 per share over 2014. Our largest subsidiary, DTE Electric, earned $562 million or is up $34 million, driven by the implementation of new rates and return through more normal weather in 2015. I'll be going over the DTE electrics earnings results in more detail in the next slide, but let me continue on this page. DTE Gas 2015 earnings of $132 million were $8 million below 2014 earnings as we return to more normal weather in 2015 after one of the coldest winters on record in 2014. The weather impact was partially offset by a reinvestment in distribution and transmission assets in 2014. These were not repeated in 2015. Moving down the page, our gas towards pipeline segment had a very good year as Gerry Anderson indicated with operating earnings of $107 million, which is $25 million higher than 2014. This is a 30% increase in earnings and was driven by a higher volumes and a boost lateral in gathering assets. Earnings for our Industrial Projects were $95 million or up $5 million from 2014. This increase is driven by strong performance in our renewables business and REF, partially offset by lower earnings in steel. Earnings for Corporate & Other was negative $48 million in 2015 or $4 million lower than 2014, driven by higher interest expense. As I mentioned, total operating earnings for growth segments were $848 million or $4.73 per share, which is up 5.6% over the 2014 total growth segment EPS. To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, 2015 earnings were $50 [ph] million, which were down $50 million for 2014, driven by lower realized performance of our gas portfolio. Actually, our income had a great year economically. The contribution for 2015 was $54 million, which is doubling our targeted annual level of $20 million to $25 million. As a reminder, Slide 42 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation showing both economic and accounting performance. Turn the page on Slide 25. And as I indicated, I want to give you more detail on electric utility performance. DTE Electric's 2015 earnings were $562 million, which is $34 million higher than 2014. There were 3 significant drivers of this variance. First, the return to more normal weather. Recall, the summer of 2015, you recall the summer of 2014 was much colder than normal, while this summer was near-normal. Second, you rate implementation mid-year to support the capital spend to improve distribution and generation infrastructure. These rates were subsequently approved by the in December. The rate implementation is partially offset by the cost associated with these investments depreciation property taxes and interest. Then finally, we experienced lower storm activity in 2015. This is a significant decrease when compared to 2014. We saw multiple storms including a storm in September in '14 that impacted over 400,000 customers, which represented about [ph] 25% of our electric customers. This lower summer spend was partially offset by 2014 lean initiatives, which were not repeated in 2015. Although not as large of a variance, I did want to touch on year-over-year the sales volume was just down $6 million. We have provided on the Page 41 [ph] of the appendix more details of the sales volumes by customer class but first, let me start by saying the underlying economic indicators work our service territory in Michigan are solid customer class of increase in total in our residential and our commercial customer classes this reduction year-over-year sales was driven by lower volumes in our industrial segment due mainly to the weakness in the steel market. This impact was partially offset as syndicated by an uptick in commercial sales, and residential sales are relatively flat, driven by economic and customer growth but also by increased energy efficiency. And we continue to see the benefits of our energy efficiency program to help our customers reduce usage and help keep their average bills affordable.
Now I'd like to review 2015 earnings on Slide 26. As Gerry mentioned upfront, our guidance range for 2016 is $4.80 per share to $5.05 per share, providing a midpoint of $4.93 per share. The total earnings per share guidance is unchanged from our early outlook introduced at our Investor Day on September 2015. Earnings range segment have been defined and a equity issuance target is now reduced to $100 million, providing low vote lower total shares outstanding compared to 2016 guidance the 2015 actuals utility earnings are higher due to increased rate supporting our customer-related investments. Continue to strengthen our pipeline and gathering platforms drive the increase in the gas purge by plants plant including a full year contribution that took place in 2015. Our PNI earnings in the 2016 remain strong as increased REF earnings help offset the near-term reduction related to our steel industry assets. Overall, earnings per share of our growth segments are expected to increase from $4.73 in 2015 to $4.93 this year, giving us a year-over-year growth of 4.2%. But when you look back to the initial guidance of 15 to Michigan's 2016, the growth was 7%.
Moving on to Slide 27, I'd like to touch base on how bonus depreciation extension had impacted our plan. We expect the extension to provide $300 million to $400 million of favorable cash flow over the 5-year period. The pace of this range well under adjustments to our plan. We're now targeting a range of $200 million to $300 million of equity issuance for the 2016 to 2018 period, compared to our previous disclosure of $800 million, as you can see in the chart. As I mentioned our guidance page, we expect to issue about $100 million of this in 2016.
We mentioned many times the path that maintaining a strong balance sheet is a priority for us. If you turn to Slide 28, you can see key balance sheet metrics, which we target and that we also monitor FFO to debt leverage. This slide shows that the projected level for each metric, as you can see, we are in the targeted range for the next 3 years. 2015, we issued a modest amount of equity, actually needing less than 10% of equity. The strength of our balance sheet sets us up nicely as we enter a period of historical high capital spend.
Let me wrap it up on Slide 30, and then we can move to the Q&A with a summary. 2015 was a very good year, and we are well positioned to have a successful 2016. DTE has historically delivered growth targets, actually, exceeded our growth targets over the recent history. We provide a 6.5% annual EPS growth over the last 5 years. As you look, we continue to target operating EPS growth of 5% to 6% for our growth segments, and part our shareholder value creation is continue to grow our dividend in line with these earnings. We are a meaningful investment in our non-utility, which will drive continued growth in our segments, and we have significant utility investments in reliability and generation modernization provides affordable clean and reliable service our customers. The destructive regulatory environment we have in Michigan coupled with our focus and operational excellence and delivering high customer satisfaction provide a good foundation as we move into an area of replacing an operating outraging facility infrastructure. Now before I actually turn the call over to questions, I'd like to recognize Anastasia Minor. This is Anastasia Minor's last call, so we'll a shoutout to Anastacia. I know many of you received an email blast yesterday. I'm sure I'll hear from you when I'm on the road, but what I'd say we're leaving it. Anastacia's not leaving the company, a key member of our management team and moving to a different role, but we're leaving the job in good hands is moving into the role coming fresh from her gas utility controller assignment.

The legislation was targeted in 2 things. One is if are going to remake our generation infrastructure, we should have a good planning process for doing that, so the legislation focuses on an IRP process and having a process for a variety of parties can get there or in the water just talk about it the mix of generation should be. And I still think we need to do that. The second was really focused on fairness, which was around retail open access. If we're going to be investing in generation, everybody should participate economically in those investments. So that's a fairness question. But if you try to move from those 2 things, a good planning process in fairness to our earnings, there really isn't a link between the 2. We think the legislation is important to have a really well-defined and fair process for moving forward, but we're going to move on with a distribution investments and the power plant retirements and so forth either way, we really have 2. Some of these power plants are just old. I'll give you an example. We got 1 I can see from where we're doing on the call here that just had a major component trail year. That unit is not going to run, and we think it's highly likely and the reason is it's just old enough or marginal enough that we got to move on. And so we've got numerous assets in that sort of position where we really are evaluating just how much longer it makes sense to invest versus move on. And some of the plants that are from the 50s and 60s, it's time to move on. So what I said earlier, I don't see the early years of the Clean Power Plant, maybe the first half being effective much, that's why. Now when you move on into the later years closer to 2027, 2030, then you get to some of our larger somewhat newer assets, they could be effective, but I'll tell you, there's a lot to happen leaders allowed to happen between now and then, so there's continued action on Nox, mercury and other fronts, water, that will be thrown into the mix in terms of how we evaluate those plans in their lives. So I think it's really early to talk too much about what this steam might mean from our both our earnings and really for the Clean Power Plan because it's very possible that they'll send it down to have a couple of specific issues reconsidered or reconfigured, the EPA address those and then things move on. Or it could be more fundamental than that of that and we really don't know right now. Hopefully, I gave you some help in the way we're thinking about it."

I think we previously have talked and I mentioned earlier that, particularly in the distribution side of the electric utility, there's a lot of demand for investment there. So we've got the $6.5 billion in our base plan. I said that if you look at the fundamentals of the aging of that infrastructure and the reliability needs, the constraining factor is not how much demand there is for investment because a lot of investment is needed. So we're really metering that tied to customer affordability, and that has not changed since we talked about it at the Analyst Day in the fall. It's very much the same picture. On the midstream side, nothing has changed in terms of if you look out over the 5-year period, what we think is going to happen in the Marcellus and Utica regions and the amount of activity there. I mentioned the gas sector is very, very different from the power sector, put gas wells in the ground and a year later, the average decline is 15%. You've just got to continually drill in order to meet the growing demand for natural gas. And in doing that, I think one of the messages we've seen out of the stress in the E&P sector is that it needs to rationalize, and people are going to rationalize it to the very best drilling locations. And I'm not blowing smoke when I say that the Susquehanna County in the Marcellus in the area of the Utica that NEXUS serves are the very best dry gas geology in the country. And so your simple commonsense, you come back to stay, these are going to be very high-activity areas over the next 5 years. And so our NEXUS is a good project and the more development and expansion in Millennium tied to those factors. Now in the very near term this year, the E&P sector need to work some things on? Obviously. We're watching that closely. We're managing it, but I think long-term fundamentals, you get down the road for a number of years, this will be in the rearview mirror."

And then if you simply look at the base of capital expenditure last year and projected this year and the forward test year, it's a significant spend that we have underway, and we need a rate case to deal with that.

I'm going to use my time this morning to recap our performance in 2015 and to preview 2016. But in a nutshell, I am glad to be in a position to say that we had a very successful year in 2015, not only financially, but on many other fronts. And I feel we're well positioned for a similarly strong year in 2016, and we are off to a good start on that one month into things.
So moving on to Slide 4. I'm going to start by recapping our accomplishments in 2015, and I'll give you a quick energy policy update, and I'd move on to long-term growth, then I'll turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to give you a bit more detail on our financials, and then we'll wrap up.
So I'm going to provide the 2015 recap within the context of our system of priorities that's laid out on Slide 5. And of those of you who've followed us for a number of years know that we consistently work this system of priorities for the last half dozen years. And for those of you less familiar, I'll just give you a quick rounding, and then I'll move on to the summary. But system really starts on Slide 5 with employees, and I believe that it's hard to be an excellent or great company when you've got employees who have mediocre energy. So we put a lot of time and focus on engagement and the energy and focus of our employees, believing that if we get that right, we can focus those employees on top-decile customer satisfaction, doing great job for our customers on continuous improvement that we've focused on intensely and on growing the company. And if we do those 3 things right, if we serve our customers well, manage our costs well and grow and connect that growth to the economic development of our communities, then the prospects for constructive political and regulatory treatment are higher, and if you combine constructive regulation with healthy growth, reproduce great outcomes for you. And for us, that means consistent predictable 5% to 6% earnings growth combined with an attractive dividend and dividend growth founded on a strong balance sheet.
So Page 6 begins the recap of our accomplishments against that system of priorities this past year, and I'll start with the employees and say that for the third consecutive year, we earned Gallup, the Gallup organization's Great Workplace Award, that's given to a handful of companies worldwide each year, and we're the only utility company to ever receive it. We were, again, in the top 15% of their worldwide database, so that was very encouraging. We also achieved the best safety result in our company's history, the lowest OSHA rate we've ever had. We're now approaching the safest in industry level, and that is our explicit goal. In fact, we had the safest January in our company history by a pretty wide margin recently as well. And the National Safety Council has us ranked in the top 3% of their 670 participating companies, so that we're in the top 20 of their nearly 700 companies. 
Moving on to continuous improvement. I was really glad to see our customer outage minutes drop sharply this past year by 65%. That's been a key focus for us. We got some help from the weather, but we also had really strong underlying change in our performance. So that's a good thing. Our fossil fleet was top-quartile in its reliability for the fourth consecutive year. We're nearing top-decile in our gas leak and leak repair program, also an area we're very focused on. And I think importantly for you, our utility O&M costs were down year-over-year, and we remain below 2008 levels and near the very front of the industry in terms of O&M cost management. 
On the customer front, our electric company was top-quartile for both residential and business. In fact, our residential was #2 in our peer group. DTE Gas ranked #1 in 2015 on business customer satisfaction and #2 in residential customer satisfaction. So when you look at the overall set of customer-set metrics, we had a strong year in 2015.
Moving on to Slide 7. On the political and regulatory front, I'd say we had a constructive outcome in our electric rate case that went final late last year. And we also filed late last year our first gas rate case in 4 years. We're entering the final stages of discussions on Michigan energy policy, and I'll talk more about that a little bit later. And we have now reached the point where our spend with Michigan suppliers has doubled since we started the program back in 2011, nearly $1 billion spent with Michigan suppliers, up from $475 million back in 2011. That's an important program for us. On the growth and value front, we invested $2.4 billion. $2.1 billion of that was in our utilities, focused on infrastructure and reliability and continued investment in renewables. We also had significant investments, as I think you're aware, in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business around our Bluestone assets. And we also made significant progress on both the NEXUS Pipeline and expansions of the Millennium Pipeline, so significant capital to support future growth. 
Finally, on the financial front, operating EPS at $4.82. That compares to our guidance coming into the year of $4.60. It was our eighth consecutive year of delivering EPS at or above the top end of our original guidance. And in addition, we increased our dividend by nearly 60% -- by nearly 6% to $2.92 a share.
So based on that recap of 2015, I hope you can see why I said at the outset that we had a very successful year in 2015, not only financially but on many other fronts. And though I know it's natural for you to focus most heavily on our financial results, in the end, those financial results are closely tied to the fairness and the quality of our regulation. And in turn, the quality of our regulation is contingent on how well we do controlling our cost via continuous improvement and how well we serve our customers and how we invest in our communities. So staying focused on the whole spectrum of our priorities is really key to our long-term performance. 
Moving on to Slide 8, I'm now going to take a minute to update you on energy policy discussions in Michigan, and those are summarized at high level on Slide 9. As you're well aware, Michigan's been considering updates to its energy laws since last year. And the move to update the current legislation was tied to the need to remake Michigan's power generation fleet. And it focuses -- the legislation focuses on reforming our state's retail open access provisions, defining an integrated resource planning process to choose our future generation mix and on clarifying the role of renewables and energy efficiency in the future.
So late in 2015, a package of bills moved out of the House Energy Policy Committee, and early this year, the focus is moved to the Senate. Senator Mike Nofs, who's chair of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, is now leading the effort to define consensus legislation that will be supported by a strong coalition. And I have to say that Nofs is really well-suited to this role. He was a principal author of our state's 2008 energy legislation, and he is as knowledgeable and experienced as any legislator in the state in this area. So we continue to work closely with Senator Nofs to define and pass this legislation in the first half of the year, and we believe that's achievable.
As I said a minute ago, the goal of this legislation is to enable the transition depicted on Slide 10. Between 2015 and 2030, driven by the aging of our power plants and the Clean Power Plan, our generation fleet will transition from one dominated by coal-fired generation to one with a much heavier mix of gas and renewables. And we've begun the detailed planning for this transition, as you would expect. In fact, some of our early investments will play out this year. We'll add 50 more megawatts of wind to our wind production here in Michigan and we'll invest our first large-scale solar facility, a 50-megawatt installation north of Detroit. I 
am sure you all saw that the Supreme Court yesterday stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan. I must say that, that was a surprise to me. It's unusual to stay a regulation prior to litigation in the lower courts. People speculated about the possibility, but I don't know that a lot of people consider it likely, so somewhat of a surprise. We'll have to see how the legal challenge continues to evolve. 
A quick reaction with kind of one night to sleep on it is that I'm not sure much will change for us, at least in the first half of the 15-year Clean Power Plan implementation period, and that's because we, and I think many in the industry, are dealing with -- during that period, with the replacement of very old, smaller and marginally economical plants, especially given gas prices now. We're dealing with those sorts of plans during that period. But as you look to the latter half of the plan, as you get out in the later years, 2025 to 2030, you do start to take on some of the larger facilities. So if it turned out that the Clean Power Plan were changed in some way, those years, I think, could be affected. But that said, there is a lot of water that needs to flow over this dam before we get too specific about the impacts of the stay. It could range anywhere from the rule being stayed, litigated, some refinements made and the Clean Power Plan moves ahead without much change and its impact. Few things that are more impactful than that, so we just have to wait and see as it evolves.
Moving on to Slide 11, I'm going to turn now to an update on our long-term growth with its drivers, beginning with a recap of our 2015 results as well as our 2016 guidance, and that's laid out on Slide 12. 
So we finished with strong results in 2015, as you can see at the top left. Our initial guidance for last year was $4.60. We upped that guidance twice over the course of the year, ultimately, the $4.78 at our fall Analyst Day. And in the end, we delivered $4.82. And as I said earlier, that's the eighth consecutive year in which we've met or beaten the top end of our guidance. And so we talk about 5% to 6% earnings per share growth. You can see on the oval at the top right that our actual growth in recent years has been about 6.5%. This growth has been driven by our portfolio of businesses that have worked well together, with steady growth from our 2 utilities and some growth upside from our non-utility businesses. 
For 2016, the midpoint of our guidance, as you see at the top right, is $4.93. I feel very good about our ability to deliver that result or exceed it as we always do. We entered 2016 with specific plans to address potential risks or uncertainties in our budget, and though I entered the year worried about super El Niño weather, January was pretty close to normal, and we are off to a good start on the year. And as I sit here talking to you, it's cold and snowing outside, so February is not matching the worries I entered the year with either, to this point.
Moving on to the bottom of the slide, we increased our dividend in 2015 by 5.8%. And I have said consistently that it's our intention to grow our dividend as we grow earnings. And the oval at the bottom right shows that, that's been our pattern in recent years, and I expect that pattern to continue in 2016.
I'm going to turn now from a focus on 2015 and '16 to a focus on our longer-term growth and investments, and I'll begin that discussion on Slide 13. So the underpinning of our future growth is the investment profile that you see on this slide. And as you can see our investment level over the next 5 years will be up on the order of 30% versus the last 5 years. And as I'll describe over the next few minutes, this increased investment is playing out in nearly all of our business units, in our electric and gas utilities to address aging infrastructure and reliability issues as well as the beginning of our generation fleet renewal and in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business to capitalize on the opportunity to move Marcellus and Utica gas, which are the highest-quality gas reserves in the country to nearby markets via our Millennium and Bluestone and NEXUS assets. 
Moving to Slide 14. Within our electric utility, investing in our distribution assets to address aging infrastructure and improved reliability has emerged as a key area of focus for us. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, of the $18 billion we project we'll invest in our electric utility over the next decade, more than 1/3, $6.5 billion in our base case, is targeted at our distribution infrastructure. And frankly, the underlying need is larger than that. And this focus really comes from listening to our customers. So we're approaching the top end of J.D. Powers Midwest customer satisfaction rankings. The biggest gap between us and the top-ranked performer is in distribution reliability.
And so moving on to Slide 15, we are making significant investments in distribution infrastructure resilience that improves reliability, and we're doing that by replacing aging infrastructure and addressing our circuits with lowest reliability. We're also seeing the need to redesign our distribution infrastructure to address growth in some of our areas. Many of our sub-stations are now overloaded and need to be upgraded or replaced. We're moving to do this, for example, in Ann Arbor, where growth of both the community and the university are overwhelming our infrastructure there. And we're doing the same in downtown Detroit, so we have a new $600 million Red Wings Arena and multi-entertainment facility going in, and probably over $1 billion of growth when you take into account everything that's happening around it. That is going to require a lot of electric infrastructure. We have a similar project underway to enable a new multi-billion dollar bridge between Detroit and Canada, that requires a lot of infrastructure investment. So these are the sorts of things that we're undertaking on the distribution front, but as we undertake this investment agenda, we're keeping a very close eye on affordability because our customers are asking for improved reliability, and we do need to renew our aging infrastructure, but we've got to maintain affordability and competitiveness while we do that. 
And so the next few slides show that we've done well on that front in recent years as well, on the affordability front. So on Slide 16, you can see that residential bills for both our gas and electric customers are down in recent years. The electric bills are down, principally due to continuous improvement work and reproductions. Even after our most recent rate case that finalized in December, our bills are below 2012 levels. We filed our next electric rate case just a little a while ago, a week or so ago. But even after the case plays out, bills will be flat to levels 5 years earlier. And our gas utility, on the right-hand side, bills this year are down materially from levels in 2012, driven most heavily by gas prices. We also have a gas rate case in process that was filed last year, but we project that bills will still be 10% lower than 5 years earlier after that case is finalized in December.
With respect to our industrial customers, so you can see on Slide 17, there are rates that are below both the U.S. average and Great Lakes average. And 5 years ago, this wasn't the case, but we have made good progress in recent years, pushing to the left on this distribution. Our industrial rates have declined 22% since 2013, which have been really important for the competitiveness and economics of this group of customers.
I'm going to turn now from our 2 utilities to an update of our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, Slide 18 lays out the footprint of this business, and I want to focus on 2 portions of the footprint today. The Millennium Pipeline in Marcellus Shale, which you see on the right-hand side of the slide, along with the adjacent Bluestone assets. This area has been a source of significant growth in the recent years and continues to see expansion opportunities, so I'm going to focus on that. And in addition, I want to focus on the NEXUS pipeline, in yellow on the slide, which is positioned to play a similar role in the Utica Shale in the years ahead.
Moving on to Slide 19, I'm going to start with an update on the NEXUS Pipeline. And I'll start by saying that as things have emerged, NEXUS is arguably positioned to tap the best gas reserve geology in North America. The dry gas well results in the region directly adjacent to our NEXUS Pipeline are staggering. When industry observers rank shale plays, this region of the Utica shows up at the very front of the industry cost curve, highly competitive. And so as the gas industry rationalizes supply across basins, which it needs to do, suggests that the Utica will be a winner, and that investment will concentrate there. And as a result, we believe very strongly in the fundamentals that support this pipe.
Development of the NEXUS project continues to move along, so we completed our FERC filing late last year. The pipe is about 2/3 contracted. A significant portion of that volume is with utilities, including the Ontario operations of Spectra and Enbridge in late last year. The Ontario energy board approved their offtake positions. We're also in what I characterize as advanced discussions with additional counterparties interested in positions on the pipe. And importantly, we have signed interconnect agreements in northern Ohio, which is the root of this pipe, totaling 1.4 Bcf per day with gas LDCs, power plants and industrial, which should provide additional demand for NEXUS over time.
Now we are watching and managing dynamics in the E&P sector closely, but as I said earlier, we really do believe that as the sector rationalizes supply, the region served by this pipe is going to benefit. So bottom line, we and our partner, Spectra, continue to move this pipe forward, and 2016 will be an important year in its development.
With respect to our Millennium Pipeline, we continue to see strong interest and expansion. So we're pursuing a 200 million cubic foot a day expansion currently. We filed our FERC preapproval a couple of weeks ago and are projected in service is 2018 on that. That expansion is really to access higher-priced northeast markets rather than lower-priced southern markets. We're also building a lateral off of Millennium, the 8-mile Valley lateral, which should go into service later next year. Additionally, we're seeing interest in expanding Millenium from Northeast Utilities, that's serious interest. and I believe our discussions with them will lead to additional Millennium expansions down the road.
What all this means for earnings in the Gas Storage and Pipelines business is laid out on Slide 20. The last year was a big year for earnings growth in this business. Earnings grew by 30% year-over-year to $107 million in 2015. And that growth was driven by our activities in the Marcellus, tied to our Millennium Pipeline and the Bluestone assets. This year, the midpoint of our guidance is $110 million, so we're projecting some growth but slower growth, obviously, than last year after the big push-up, and that's really given the reduced activity level we see by E&P players. I would say that we're also looking carefully for investment or acquisition opportunities that stress in the E&P and MLP spaces might offer us. Longer term, we do continue to target $170 million in earnings by 2020. And although the current E&P sector dynamics will cause a pause in drilling investment this year, we expect little or no impact, long term. The country needs drilling gas supplies, productions from existing wells decline 15% a year, so we can't wait very long before the drilling has to resume and our pipes are in the right locations to benefit them grow as that occurs over the next 5 years. So everybody is watching what happens over the coming months. But as you look out beyond that, this country is going to have to drill a lot of natural gas wells. Fundamental supply and demand says that, and the Marcellus counties that we're in and the Utica are the places the drilling dollars should go.
I'm going to wrap up my remarks with a few thoughts on our Power & Industrial business, and then I'll turn things over to Peter. On Slide 21, our Power & Industrial business operates contracted assets at 66 sites across the country in  3 business lines: Industrial Energy Services; Renewable Energy; and Reduced Emissions Fuels or REF, for short. 
On slide 22, you see that this business line had earnings of $95 million in 2015, and the midpoint of our guidance for this year is also $95 million, so flat from 2015 'to 16. Two dynamics underlying this guidance. One of our assets that serves the steel industry rolled over its contract last year. You're probably aware, the steel industry is at a cyclical downturn right now, so our earnings from that asset declined. But offsetting that dynamic is the fact that we expect our REF earnings to grow. So $95 million for this year and longer term, consistent with what we've communicated previously, our 2020 earnings target is $105 million in this segment, as our REF projects sunset out nearly 2020s. We intend to backfill with investments in cogeneration, which we're working actively and opportunities on the asset acquisition front.
And with that, Peter, I'm going to turn it over to you for a financial update."

As most of you know, I like to take advantage of having the microphone on this earnings call to give you an update on my Detroit Tigers. And now with the Super Bowl over, all the focus can be on the upcoming baseball season. Spring training will be starting soon. I have high hopes for my hometown team. The Asia Tigers were ranked #1 by MLD.com for the most improved team after all the off-season moves. I won't be making any predictions this year. Let's just say I'm hoping a playoff run. 
Enough about the Tigers. I'd like give you a financial update and review of the 2015 earnings before we get to your questions, starting on Slide 24. And as Gerry mentioned, the DTE Energy 2015 operating earnings came in strong  $4.82 per share. For a detailed breakdown of the EPS by segments, including a reconciliation of GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 43 of the appendix. 
Slide 24 shows the year-over-year operating earnings by segment. First, we're going to focus on the middle column, which shows the 2015 results. Let me start first with the total earnings for the growth segments. Earnings for our growth segments were $848 million or $4.73 per share. This is an increase of $52 million or $0.25 per share over 2014. 
Our largest subsidiary, DTE Electric, earned $562 million or was up $34 million, driven by the implementation of new rates and a return to a more normal weather in 2015. I'll be going over the DT Electric's earnings results in more detail on the next slide, but let me continue on this page. DTE Gas 2015 earnings of $132 million were $8 million below 2014 earnings as we return to a more normal weather in 2015 after one of the coldest winters on record in 2014. The weather impact was partially offset by a reinvestment in distribution and transmission assets in 2014. These were not repeated in 2015. 
Moving down the page, our Gas Storage and Pipelines segment had a very good year, as Gerry Anderson indicated, with operating earnings of $107 million, which is $25 million higher than 2014. This is a 30% increase in earnings and was driven by a higher volumes in our Bluestone lateral and gathering assets. Earnings for our Power and Industrial projects were $95 million or up $5 million from 2014. This increase was driven by strong performance in our renewables business and REF, partially offset by lower earnings in steel. Earnings for Corporate & Other was negative $48 million in 2015 or $4 million lower than 2014, driven by higher interest expense. 
So as I mentioned, total operating earnings for our growth segments were $848 million or $4.73 per share, which is up 5.6% over the 2014 total growth segment EPS. To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, 2015 earnings were $15 million, which was down $50 million for 2014, driven by a lower realized performance in our gas portfolio. And so our trading company had a great year economically. The contribution for 2015 was $54 million, which is double our targeted annual level of $20 million to $25 million. As a reminder, Slide 42 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation, showing both economic and accounting performance. 
Let's turn the page to; Slide 25. And as I indicated, I wanted to give a little more detail on electric utility performance. DTE Electric's 2015 earnings were $562 million, which was $34 million higher than 2014. There were 3 significant drivers of this variance. First, the return to more normal weather. Recall, the summer of 2015, you recall the summer of 2014 was much colder than normal, while this summer was near-normal. 
Second, the new rate implementation mid-year to support the capital spend to improve distribution and generation infrastructure. These rates were subsequently approved by the NTSC in December. The rate implementation is partially offset by the costs associated with these investments depreciation property taxes and interest. 
And finally, we experienced lower storm activity in 2015. This is a significant decrease when compared to 2014. We saw multiple storms, including a storm in September in '14 that impacted over 400,000 customers, which represent about 25% of our electric customers. This lower summer spend was partially offset by 2014 lean initiatives, which were not repeated in 2015. Although not as large of a variance, I did want to touch on, year-over-year, the sales volume impact was just down $6 million. We have provided on the Page 41 of the appendix more details on the sales volumes by customer class but let me first start by saying that the underlying economic indicators were our service territory in Michigan are solid. Customer counts have increased in total, in our residential and our commercial customer classes. Now this reduction in year-over-year sales was driven by lower volumes in our industrial segment due mainly to the weakness in the steel market. Now this impact was partially offset, as indicated by an uptick in commercial sales, and residential sales were relatively flat, driven by economic and customer growth but also by increased energy efficiency. And we continue to see the benefits of our energy efficiency program to help our customers reduce usage and help keep their average bills affordable.
Now I'd like to review 2016 earnings on Slide 26. As Gerry mentioned upfront, our guidance range for 2016 is $4.80 per share to $5.05 per share, providing a midpoint of $4.93 per share. The total earnings per share guidance is unchanged from our early outlook introduced at our Investor Day on September 2015. Earnings ranges for each segment have been refined and our equity issuance target is now reduced to $100 million, providing lower total shares outstanding. Compare to 2016 guidance to 2015 actuals, utility earnings are higher due to increased rates supporting our customer-related investments. Continued strength in our pipeline and gathering platforms drive the increase in the Gas Storage and Pipelines, including a full-year contribution of the gathering bill that took place in 2015. Our P&I earnings into 2016 remain strong, as increased REF earnings help offset the near-term production related to our steel industry assets. Overall, earnings per share of our growth segments are expected to increase from $4.73 in 2015 to $4.93 this year, giving us a year-over-year growth of 4.2%. But when you look back to the initial guidance of '15 to initial guidance Michigan's 2016, the growth was 7%.
Moving on to Slide 27, I'd like to touch base on how bonus depreciation extension had impacted our plan. We expect the extension to provide $300 million to   $400  million of favorable cash flow over the 5-year period. So based on this change, as well as other adjustments to our plan, we're now targeting a range of $200 million to $300 million of equity issuance for the 2016 to 2018 period compared to our previous disclosure of $800 million, as you can see on the chart. And as I mentioned on our guidance page, we expect to issue about $100 million of this in 2016.
We've mentioned many times in past that maintaining a strong balance sheet is a priority for us. If you turn to Slide 28, you can see key balance sheet metrics, which we target and that we also monitor FFO to debt leverage. Now this slide shows that the projected level for each metric, and as you can see, we are in the targeted range for the next 3 years. 2015, we issued a modest amount of equity, actually needing less than 10% of our capital expenditures to be financed with equity. The strength of our balance sheet sets us up nicely as we enter a period of historical high capital spend.
Now let me wrap it up on Slide 30, and then we can move to the Q&A with a summary. 2015 was a very good year, and we are well positioned to have a successful 2016. DTE has historically delivered on its growth targets, and actually have exceeded our growth targets over the recent history. We provide a 6.5% annual EPS growth over the last 5 years. As we look forward, we continue to target operating EPS growth of 5% to 6% for our growth segments, and part our shareholder value creation is to continue to grow our dividend in line with these earnings. 
We have meaningful investments in our non-utility, which will drive continued growth in those segments. And we have significant utility investments in reliability and generation modernization that provides affordable clean and reliable service to our customers. The constructive regulatory environment we have in Michigan, coupled with our focus on operational excellence and delivering high customer satisfaction provide a good foundation as we move into an ear of replacing and upgrading our aging utility infrastructure. 
Now before I actually turn the call over to questions, I'd like to recognize Anastasia Minor. This is Anastasia Minor's last call, so a little shoutout to Anastasia. I know many of you have received an email blast yesterday, so I'm sure I'll hear from you when I'm on the road. But I'd like to say that we're leaving it -- actually, Anastasia is not leaving the company, she's a key member of our management team and moving into a different role, but we're leaving the job in good hands. Barb Tuckfied is moving into the role, coming fresh from her Gas Utility Controller assignment.

The legislation was targeted at 2 things. One is if we are going to remake our generation infrastructure, we should have a good planning process for doing that. So the legislation focuses on an IRP process and having a process where a variety of parties can get their oar in the water to talk about what the mix of generation should be. And I still think we need to do that. The second was really focused on fairness, which was around retail open access. If we're going to be investing in generation, everybody should participate economically in those investments. So that's a fairness question. But if you try to move from those 2 things, a good planning process and fairness, to our earnings, there really isn't a link between the 2. We think the legislation is important to have a really well defined and fair process for moving forward. But we're going to move on with the distribution investments and the power plant retirements and so forth, either way. We really have to. Some of these power plants are just old. I'll give you an example. We've got one I can see from where we're doing the call here, that just had a major component failure. That unit is not going to run, and we think it's highly likely. And the reason is it's just old enough or marginal enough that we've got to move on. And so we've got numerous assets in that sort of position where we really are evaluating just how much longer it makes sense to invest versus move on. And some of the plants that are from the 50s and 60s, it's time to move on. So what I said earlier, that I don't see the early years of the Clean Power Plan -- maybe the first half of it being affected much, that's why. Now when you move on into the later years, closer to 2027, 2030, then you start to get into some of our larger somewhat newer assets, they could be effective. But I'll tell you, there's a lot to happen between now and then. So there's continued action on NOx and mercury and other fronts, water, that will be thrown into the mix in terms of how we evaluate those plants and their life. So I think it's really early to talk too much about what this stay might mean from our -- both our earnings and really, for the Clean Power Plan because it's very possible that they'll send it down to have a couple of specific issues reconsidered or reconfigured. The EPA will address those and then things move on. Or it could be more fundamental than that, and we really don't know right now. So hopefully, that gave you some help in the way we're thinking about it."

So we've got the $6.5 billion in our base plan. I said that if you look at the fundamentals of the aging of that infrastructure and the reliability needs, the constraining factor is not how much demand there is for investment. There's a lot of investment needed. So we're really metering that tied to customer affordability, and that has not changed since we talked about it at the Analyst Day in the fall. It's very much the same picture. On the midstream side, nothing has changed in terms of if you look out over the 5-year period, what we think is going to happen in the Marcellus and Utica regions and the amount of activity there. I mentioned, the gas sector is very, very different from the power sector. Put gas wells in the ground and a year later, the average decline is 15%. So you've just got to continually drill in order to meet the growing demand for natural gas. And in doing that, I think one of the messages we've seen out of the stress in the E&P sector is it needs to rationalize, and people are going to rationalize it to the very best drilling locations. And I'm not blowing smoke when I say that the Susquehanna County in the Marcellus in the area of the Utica that NEXUS serves are the very best dry gas geology in the country. And so through simple common sense, you come back to say that these are going to be very high-activity areas over the next 5 years. And so our continued sense that NEXUS is a good project and that there'll be more development and expansion in the Millennium are tied to those factors. Now in the very near term, this year, does the E&P sector need to work some things out? Obviously. We're watching that closely. We're managing it. But I think long-term fundamentals, you get down the road for a number of years, this will be in the rearview mirror."

I'm going to use my time this morning to recap our performance in 2015 and to preview 2016. But in a nutshell, I am glad to be in a position to say that we had a very successful year in 2015, not only financially, but on many other fronts. And I feel we're well positioned for a similarly strong year in 2016, and we are off to a good start on that one month into things.
So moving on to Slide 4. I'm going to start by recapping our accomplishments in 2015, and I'll give you a quick energy policy update, and then move on to long-term growth, then I'll turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to give you a bit more detail on our financials, and then we'll wrap up.
So I'm going to provide the 2015 recap within the context of our system of priorities that's laid out on Slide 5. And those of you who've followed us for a number of years know that we consistently worked this system of priorities for the last half dozen years. And for those of you less familiar, I'll just give you a quick grounding, and then I'll move on to the summary. But system really starts on Slide 5 with employees, and a belief that it's hard to be an excellent or great company when you've got employees who have mediocre energy. So we put a lot of time and focus on engagement and the energy and focus of our employees, believing that if we get that right, we can focus those employees on top-decile customer satisfaction, doing a great job for our customers on continuous improvement that we focused on intensely and on growing the company. And if we do those 3 things right: if we serve our customers well, manage our costs well and grow and connect that growth to the economic development of our communities, then the prospects for constructive political and regulatory treatment are higher, and if you combine constructive regulation with healthy growth, reproduce great outcomes for you. And for us, that means consistent predictable 5% to 6% earnings growth combined with an attractive dividend and dividend growth founded on a strong balance sheet.
So Page 6 then begins the recap of our accomplishments against that system of priorities this past year, and I'll start with the employees and say that for the third consecutive year, we earned Gallup, the Gallup organization's Great Workplace Award, that's given to a handful of companies worldwide each year, and we're the only utility company to ever receive it. We were, again, in the top 15% of their worldwide database, so that was very encouraging. We also achieved the best safety result in our company's history, the lowest OSHA rate we've ever had. We're now approaching the safest in industry level, and that is our explicit goal. In fact, we had the safest January in our company history by a pretty wide margin recently as well. And the National Safety Council has us ranked in the top 3% of their 670 participating companies, so that we're in the top 20 of their nearly 700 companies. 
Moving on to continuous improvement. I was really glad to see our customer outage minutes drop sharply this past year by 65%. That's been a key focus for us. We got some help from the weather, but we also had really strong underlying change in our performance. So that's a good thing. Our fossil fleet was top-quartile in its reliability for the fourth consecutive year. We're nearing top-decile in our gas leak and leak repair program, also an area we're very focused on. And I think importantly for you, our utility O&M costs were down year-over-year, and we remain below 2008 levels and near the very front of the industry in terms of O&M cost management. 
On the customer front, our electric company was top-quartile for both residential and business. In fact, our residential was #2 in our peer group. DTE Gas ranked #1 in 2015 on business customer satisfaction and #2 in residential customer satisfaction. So when you look at the overall set of customer-set metrics, we had a strong year in 2015.
Moving on to Slide 7. On the political and regulatory front, I'd say we had a constructive outcome in our electric rate case that went final late last year. And we also filed late last year our first gas rate case in 4 years. We're entering the final stages of discussions on Michigan energy policy, and I'll talk more about that a little bit later. And we have now reached the point where our spend with Michigan suppliers has doubled since we started the program back in 2011, nearly $1 billion spent with Michigan suppliers, up from $475 million back in 2011. That's an important program for us. On the growth and value front, we invested $2.4 billion. $2.1 billion of that was in our utilities, focused on infrastructure and reliability and continued investment in renewables. We also had significant investments, as I think you're aware, in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business around our Bluestone assets. And we also made significant progress on both the NEXUS Pipeline and expansions of the Millennium Pipeline, so significant capital to support future growth. 
Finally, on the financial front, operating EPS at $4.82. That compares to our guidance coming into the year of $4.60. It was our eighth consecutive year of delivering EPS at or above the top end of our original guidance. And in addition, we increased our dividend by nearly 60% -- by nearly 6% to $2.92 a share.
So based on that recap of 2015, I hope you can see why I said at the outset that we had a very successful year in 2015, not only financially but on many other fronts. And though I know it's natural for you to focus most heavily on our financial results, in the end, those financial results are closely tied to the fairness and the quality of our regulation. And in turn, the quality of our regulation is contingent on how well we do controlling our cost via continuous improvement and how well we serve our customers and how we invest in our communities. So staying focused on the whole spectrum of our priorities is really key to our long-term performance. 
Moving on to Slide 8, I'm now going to take a minute to update you on energy policy discussions in Michigan, and those are summarized at high level on Slide 9. As you're well aware, Michigan's been considering updates to its energy laws since last year. And the move to update the current legislation was tied to the need to remake Michigan's power generation fleet. And it focuses -- the legislation focuses on reforming our state's retail open access provisions, defining an integrated resource planning process to choose our future generation mix and on clarifying the role of renewables and energy efficiency in the future.
So late in 2015, a package of bills moved out of the House Energy Policy Committee, and early this year, the focuses moved to the Senate. Senator Mike Nofs, who's chair of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, is now leading the effort to define consensus legislation that will be supported by a strong coalition. And I have to say that Nofs is really well-suited to this role. He was a principal author of our state's 2008 energy legislation, and he is as knowledgeable and experienced as any legislator in the state in this area. So we continue to work closely with Senator Nofs to define and pass this legislation in the first half of the year, and we believe that's achievable.
As I said a minute ago, the goal of this legislation is to enable the transition depicted on Slide 10. Between 2015 and 2030, driven by the aging of our power plants and the Clean Power Plan, our generation fleet will transition from one dominated by coal-fired generation to one with a much heavier mix of gas and renewables. And we've begun the detailed planning for this transition, as you would expect. In fact, some of our early investments will play out this year. We'll add 50 more megawatts of wind to our wind production here in Michigan and we'll invest our first large-scale solar facility, a 50-megawatt installation north of Detroit. I 
am sure you all saw that the Supreme Court yesterday stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan. I must say that, that was a surprise to me. It's unusual to stay a regulation prior to litigation in the lower courts. People speculated about the possibility, but I don't know that a lot of people considered it likely, so somewhat of a surprise. We'll have to see how the legal challenge continues to evolve. 
A quick reaction with kind of one night to sleep on it is that I'm not sure much will change for us, at least in the first half of the 15-year Clean Power Plan implementation period, and that's because we, and I think many in the industry, are dealing with -- during that period, with the replacement of very old, smaller and marginally economical plants, especially given gas prices now. We're dealing with those sorts of plans during that period. But as you look to the latter half of the plan, as you get out in the later years, 2025 to 2030, you do start to take on some of the larger facilities. So if it turned out that the Clean Power Plan were changed in some way, those years, I think, could be affected. But that said, there is a lot of water that needs to flow over this dam before we get too specific about the impacts of this stay. It could range anywhere from the rule being stayed, litigated, some refinements made and the Clean Power Plan moves ahead without much change and its impact. Few things that are more impactful than that, so we just have to wait and see as it evolves.
Moving on to Slide 11, I'm going to turn now to an update on our long-term growth and its drivers, beginning with a recap of our 2015 results as well as our 2016 guidance, and that's laid out on Slide 12. 
So we finished with strong results in 2015, as you can see at the top left. Our initial guidance for last year was $4.60. We upped that guidance twice over the course of the year, ultimately, to $4.78 at our fall Analyst Day. And in the end, we delivered $4.82. And as I said earlier, that's the eighth consecutive year in which we've met or beaten the top end of our guidance. And so we talk about 5% to 6% earnings per share growth. You can see in the oval at the top right that our actual growth in recent years has been about 6.5%. This growth has been driven by a portfolio of businesses that have worked well together, with steady growth from our 2 utilities and some growth upside from our non-utility businesses. 
For 2016, the midpoint of our guidance, as you see at the top right, is $4.93. I feel very good about our ability to deliver that result or exceed it. As we always do, we entered 2016 with specific plans to address potential risks or uncertainties in our budget, and though I entered the year worried about super El Niño weather, January was pretty close to normal, and we are off to a good start on the year. And as I sit here talking to you, it's cold and snowing outside, so February is not matching the worries I entered the year with either, to this point.
Moving on to the bottom of the slide, we increased our dividend in 2015 by 5.8%. And I have said consistently that it's our intention to grow our dividend as we grow earnings. And the oval at the bottom right shows that, that's been our pattern in recent years, and I expect that pattern to continue in 2016.
I'm going to turn now from a focus on 2015 and '16 to a focus on our longer-term growth and investments, and I'll begin that discussion on Slide 13. So the underpinning of our future growth is the investment profile that you see on this slide. And as you can see our investment level over the next 5 years will be up on the order of 30% versus the last 5 years. And as I'll describe over the next few minutes, this increased investment is playing out in nearly all of our business units, in our electric and gas utilities to address aging infrastructure and reliability issues as well as the beginning of our generation fleet renewal and in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business to capitalize on the opportunity to move Marcellus and Utica gas, which are the highest-quality gas reserves in the country, to nearby markets via our Millennium and Bluestone and NEXUS assets. 
Moving to Slide 14. Within our electric utility, investing in our distribution assets to address aging infrastructure and improved reliability has emerged as a key area of focus for us. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, of the $18 billion we project we'll invest in our electric utility over the next decade, more than 1/3, $6.5 billion in our base case, is targeted at our distribution infrastructure. And frankly, the underlying need is larger than that. And this focus really comes from listening to our customers. So we're approaching the top end of J.D. Powers Midwest customer satisfaction rankings. The biggest gap between us and the top-ranked performer is in distribution reliability.
And so moving on to Slide 15, we are making significant investments in distribution infrastructure resilience that improves reliability, and we're doing that by replacing aging infrastructure and addressing our circuits with lowest reliability. We're also seeing the need to redesign our distribution infrastructure to address growth in some of our areas. Many of our sub-stations are now overloaded and need to be upgraded or replaced. We're moving to do this, for example, in Ann Arbor, where growth of both the community and the university are overwhelming our infrastructure there. And we're doing the same in downtown Detroit, so we have a new $600 million Red Wings Arena and multi-entertainment facility going in, and probably over $1 billion of growth when you take into account everything that's happening around it. That is going to require a lot of electric infrastructure. We have a similar project underway to enable a new multi-billion dollar bridge between Detroit and Canada, that requires a lot of infrastructure investment. So these are the sorts of things that we're undertaking on the distribution front, but as we undertake this investment agenda, we're keeping a very close eye on affordability because our customers are asking for improved reliability, and we do need to renew our aging infrastructure, but we've got to maintain affordability and competitiveness while we do that. 
And so the next few slides show that we've done well on that front in recent years as well, on the affordability front. So on Slide 16, you can see that residential bills for both our gas and electric customers are down in recent years. The electric bills are down, principally due to continuous improvement work and reproductions. Even after our most recent rate case that finalized in December, our bills are below 2012 levels. We filed our next electric rate case just a little a while ago, a week or so ago. But even after that case plays out, bills will be flat to levels 5 years earlier. In our gas utility, on the right-hand side, bills this year are down materially from levels in 2012, driven most heavily by gas prices. We also have a gas rate case in process that was filed last year, but we project that bills will still be 10% lower than 5 years earlier after that case is finalized in December.
With respect to our industrial customers, so you can see on Slide 17, that our rates are below both the U.S. average and Great Lakes average. And 5 years ago, this wasn't the case, but we have made good progress in recent years in pushing to the left on this distribution. Our industrial rates have declined 22% since 2013, which have been really important for the competitiveness and economics of this group of customers.
I'm going to turn now from our 2 utilities to an update of our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, Slide 18 lays out the footprint of this business, and I want to focus on 2 portions of the footprint today. The Millennium Pipeline in Marcellus Shale, which you see on the right-hand side of the slide, along with the adjacent Bluestone assets. This area has been a source of significant growth in the recent years and continues to see expansion opportunities, so I want to focus on that. And in addition, I want to focus on the NEXUS pipeline, in yellow on the slide, which is positioned to play a similar role in the Utica Shale in the years ahead.
Moving on to Slide 19, I'm going to start with an update on the NEXUS Pipeline. And I'll start by saying that as things have emerged, NEXUS is arguably positioned to tap the best gas reserve geology in North America. The dry gas well results in the region directly adjacent to our NEXUS Pipeline are staggering. When industry observers rank shale plays, this region of the Utica shows up at the very front of the industry cost curve, highly competitive. And so as the gas industry rationalizes supply across basins, which it needs to do, everything suggests that the Utica will be a winner, and that investment will concentrate there. And as a result, we believe very strongly in the fundamentals that support this pipe.
Development of the NEXUS project continues to move along, so we completed our FERC filing late last year. The pipe is about 2/3 contracted. A significant portion of that volume is with utilities, including the Ontario operations of Spectra and Enbridge in late last year. The Ontario energy board approved their offtake positions. We're also in what I characterize as advanced discussions with additional counterparties interested in positions on the pipe. And importantly, we have signed interconnect agreements in northern Ohio, which is the root of this pipe, totaling 1.4 Bcf per day with gas LDCs, power plants and industrials, which should provide additional demand for NEXUS over time.
Now we are watching and managing dynamics in the E&P sector closely, but as I said earlier, we really do believe that as the sector rationalizes supply, the region served by this pipe is going to benefit. So bottom line, we and our partner, Spectra, continue to move this pipe forward, and 2016 will be an important year in its development.
With respect to our Millennium Pipeline, we continue to see strong interest in expansions. So we're pursuing a 200 million cubic foot a day expansion currently. We filed our FERC preapproval a couple of weeks ago and are projected in service is 2018 on that. That expansion is really to access higher-priced northeast markets rather than lower-priced southern markets. We're also building a lateral off of Millennium, the 8-mile Valley lateral, which should go into service next year. Additionally, we're seeing interest in expanding Millenium from Northeast Utilities, that's serious interest. And I believe our discussions with them will lead to additional Millennium expansions down the road.
What all this means for earnings in the Gas Storage and Pipelines business is laid out on Slide 20. So, last year was a big year for earnings growth in this business. Earnings grew by 30% year-over-year to $107 million in 2015. And that growth was driven by our activities in the Marcellus, tied to our Millennium Pipeline and the Bluestone assets. This year, the midpoint of our guidance is $110 million, so we're projecting some growth but slower growth, obviously, than last year after the big push-up, and that's really given the reduced activity level we see by E&P players. I would say that we're also looking carefully for investment or acquisition opportunities that stress in the E&P and MLP spaces might offer us. Longer term, we do continue to target $170 million in earnings by 2020. And although the current E&P sector dynamics will cause a pause in drilling investment this year, we expect little or no impact, long term. The country needs drilling gas supplies, productions from existing wells decline 15% a year, so you can't wait very long before the drilling has to resume and our pipes are in the right locations to benefit them grow as that occurs over the next 5 years. So everybody is watching what happens over the coming months. But as you look out beyond that, this country is going to have to drill a lot of natural gas wells. Fundamental supply and demand says that, and the Marcellus counties that we're in and the Utica are the places the drilling dollars should go.
I'm going to wrap up my remarks with a few thoughts on our Power & Industrial business, and then I'll turn things over to Peter. On Slide 21, our Power & Industrial business operates contracted assets at 66 sites across the country in  3 business lines: Industrial Energy Services; Renewable Energy; and Reduced Emissions Fuel or REF, for short. 
On slide 22, you see that this business line had earnings of $95 million in 2015, and the midpoint of our guidance for this year is also $95 million, so flat from 2015 to Õ16. Two dynamics underlie this guidance. One of our assets that serves the steel industry rolled over its contract last year. You're probably aware, the steel industry is in a cyclical downturn right now, so our earnings from that asset declined. But offsetting that dynamic is the fact that we expect our REF earnings to grow. So $95 million for this year and longer term, consistent with what we've communicated previously, our 2020 earnings target is $105 million in this segment, as our REF projects sunset out nearly 2020s. We intend to backfill with investments in cogeneration, which we're working actively and opportunities on the asset acquisition front.
And with that, Peter, I'm going to turn it over to you for a financial update."

As most of you know, I like to take advantage of having the microphone on this earnings call to give you an update on my Detroit Tigers.

As most of you know, I like to take advantage of having the microphone on this earnings call to give you an update on my Detroit Tigers. And now with the Super Bowl over, all the focus can be on the upcoming baseball season. Spring training will be starting soon. I have high hopes for my hometown team. Actually, the Tigers were ranked #1 by mlb.com for the most improved team after all the off-season moves. I won't be making any predictions this year. Let's just say I'm hoping a playoff run. 
Enough about the Tigers. I'd like give you a financial update and review of the 2015 earnings before we get to your questions, starting on Slide 24. And as Gerry mentioned, the DTE Energy 2015 operating earnings came in strong at  $4.82 per share. For a detailed breakdown of the EPS by segments, including a reconciliation of GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 43 of the appendix. 
Slide 24 shows the year-over-year operating earnings by segment. First, we're going to focus on the middle column, which shows the 2015 results. Let me start first with the total earnings for the growth segments. Earnings for our growth segments were $848 million or $4.73 per share. This is an increase of $52 million or $0.25 per share over 2014. 
Our largest subsidiary, DTE Electric, earned $562 million and was up $34 million, driven by the implementation of new rates and a return to a more normal weather in 2015. I'll be going over the DT Electric's earnings results in more detail on the next slide, but let me continue on this page. DTE Gas 2015 earnings of $132 million were $8 million below 2014 earnings as we return to a more normal weather in 2015 after one of the coldest winters on record in 2014. The weather impact was partially offset by a reinvestment in distribution and transmission assets in 2014. These were not repeated in 2015. 
Moving down the page, our Gas Storage and Pipelines segment had a very good year, as Gerry Anderson indicated, with operating earnings of $107 million, which is $25 million higher than 2014. This is a 30% increase in our earnings and was driven by a higher volumes in our Bluestone lateral and gathering assets. Earnings for our Power and Industrial projects were $95 million or up $5 million from 2014. This increase was driven by strong performance in our renewables business and REF, partially offset by lower earnings in steel. Earnings for Corporate & Other was negative $48 million in 2015 or $4 million lower than 2014, driven by higher interest expense. 
So as I mentioned, total operating earnings for our growth segments were $848 million or $4.73 per share, which is up 5.6% over the 2014 total growth segment EPS. To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, 2015 earnings were $15 million, which was down $15 million for 2014, driven by a lower realized performance in our gas portfolio. Actually, our trading company had a great year economically. The contribution for 2015 was $54 million, which is double our targeted annual level of $20 million to $25 million. As a reminder, Slide 42 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation, showing both economic and accounting performance. 
Let's turn the page to Slide 25. And as I indicated, I wanted to give a little more detail on electric utility performance. DTE Electric's 2015 earnings were $562 million, which was $34 million higher than 2014. There were 3 significant drivers of this variance. First, the return to more normal weather in  2015. Recall, the summer of 2014 was much colder than normal, while this summer was near-normal. 
Second, the new rate implementation mid-year to support the capital spend to improve distribution and generation infrastructure. These rates were subsequently approved by the NPSC [ph] in December. The rate implementation is partially offset by the costs associated with these investments, which as you know is the depreciation of property taxes and interest. 
And finally, we experienced lower storm activity in 2015. This is a significant decrease when compared to 2014. We saw multiple storms, including a storm in September in '14 that impacted over 400,000 customers, which represent about 20% of our electric customers. This lower summer spend was partially offset by 2014 lean initiatives, which were not repeated in 2015. Although not as large of a variance, I did want to touch on, year-over-year, the sales volume impact was just down $6 million. We have provided on the Page 41 of the appendix more details on the sales volumes by customer class but let me first start by saying that the underlying economic indicators were our service territory in Michigan [ph] are solid. Customer counts have increased in total, in our residential and our commercial customer classes. Now this reduction in year-over-year sales was driven by lower volumes in our industrial segment due mainly to the weakness in the steel market. Now this impact was partially offset, as indicated by an uptick in commercial sales, and residential sales were relatively flat, driven by economic and customer growth but also by increased energy efficiency. And we continue to see the benefits of our energy efficiency program to help our customers reduce usage and help keep their average bills affordable.
Now I'd like to review 2016 earnings on Slide 26. As Gerry mentioned upfront, our guidance range for 2016 is $4.80 per share to $5.05 per share, providing a midpoint of $4.93 per share. The total earnings per share guidance is unchanged from our early outlook introduced at our Investor Day on September 2015. Earnings ranges for each segment have been refined and our equity issuance target is now reduced to $100 million, providing lower total shares outstanding. Compare the 2016 guidance to 2015 actuals, utility earnings are higher due to increased rates supporting our customer-related investments. Continued strength in our pipeline and gathering platforms drive the increase in the Gas Storage and Pipelines, including a full-year contribution of the gathering bill that took place in 2015. Our P&I earnings into 2016 remain strong, as increased REF earnings help offset the near-term reduction related to our steel industry assets. Overall, earnings per share of our growth segments are expected to increase from $4.73 in 2015 to $4.93 this year, giving us a year-over-year growth of 4.2%. But when you look back to the initial guidance of '15 to initial guidance of 2016, the growth was 7%.
Moving on to Slide 27, I'd like to touch base on how bonus depreciation extension has impacted our plan. We expect the extension to provide $300 million to   $400  million of favorable cash flow over the 5-year period. So based on this change, as well as other adjustments to our plan, we're now targeting a range of $200 million to $300 million of equity issuance for the 2016 to 2018 period compared to our previous disclosure of $800 million, as you can see on the chart. And as I mentioned on our guidance page, we expect to issue about $100 million of this in 2016.
We've mentioned many times in past that maintaining a strong balance sheet is a priority for us. If you turn to Slide 28, you can see key balance sheet metrics, which we target and that we also monitor FFO to debt leverage. Now this slide shows the projected level for each metric, and as you can see, we are in the targeted range for the next 3 years. 2015, we issued a modest amount of equity, actually needing less than 10% of our capital expenditures to be financed with equity. The strength of our balance sheet sets us up nicely as we enter a period of historical high capital spend.
Now let me wrap it up on Slide 30, and then we can move to the Q&A, with a summary. 2015 was a very good year, and we are well positioned to have a successful 2016. DTE has historically delivered on its growth targets, we actually have exceeded our growth targets over the recent history. We provide a 6.5% annual EPS growth over the last 5 years. As we look forward, we continue to target operating EPS growth of 5% to 6% for our growth segments, and part our shareholder value creation is to continue to grow our dividend in line with these earnings. 
We have meaningful investments in our non-utility, which will drive continued growth in those segments. And we have significant utility investments in reliability and generation modernization that provides affordable clean and reliable service to our customers. The constructive regulatory environment we have in Michigan, coupled with our focus on operational excellence and delivering high customer satisfaction provide a good foundation as we move into an era of replacing and upgrading our aging utility infrastructure. 
Now before I actually turn the call over to questions, I'd like to recognize Anastasia Minor. This is Anastasia Minor's last call, so a little shoutout to Anastasia. I know many of you received an email blast yesterday, an announcement, so I'm sure I'll hear from you when I'm on the road. But I'd like to say that we're leaving it -- actually, Anastasia is not leaving the company, she's a key member of our management team and moving into a different role, but we're leaving the job in good hands. Barb Tuckfied is moving into the role, coming fresh from her Gas Utility Controller assignment.

One is if we are going to remake our generation",503,"I guess, I would say I don't think the implementation of the legislation, if you were to try to draw a direct link between that and earnings, there really isn't one. The legislation was targeted at 2 things. One is if we are going to remake our generation infrastructure, we should have a good planning process for doing that. So the legislation focuses on an IRP process and having a process where a variety of parties can get their oar in the water to talk about what the mix of generation should be. And I still think we need to do that. The second one was really focused on fairness, which was around retail open access. If we're going to be investing in generation, everybody should participate economically in those investments. So that's a fairness question. But if you try to move from those 2 things, a good planning process and fairness, to our earnings, there really isn't a link between the 2. We think the legislation is important to have a really well defined and fair process for moving forward. But we're going to move on with the distribution investments and the power plant retirements and so forth, either way. We really have to. Some of these power plants are just old. I'll give you an example. We've got one I can see from where we're doing the call here, that just had a major component failure. That unit is not going to run, and -- we think it's highly likely. And the reason is it's just old enough or marginal enough that we've got to move on. And so we've got numerous assets in that sort of position where we really are evaluating just how much longer it makes sense to invest versus move on. And some of the plants that are from the 50s and 60s, it's time to move on. So what I said earlier, that I don't see the early years of the Clean Power Plan -- maybe the first half of it being affected much, that's why. Now when you move out into the later years, closer to 2027, 2030, then you start to get into some of our larger somewhat newer assets, they could be effected. But I'll tell you, there's a lot to happen between now and then. So there's continued action on NOx and mercury and other fronts, water, that will be thrown into the mix in terms of how we evaluate those plants and their life. So I think it's really early to talk too much about what this stay might mean for our -- both our earnings and really, for the Clean Power Plan because it's very possible that they'll send it down to have a couple of specific issues reconsidered or reconfigured. The EPA will address those and then things move on. Or it could be more fundamental than that, and we really don't know right now. So hopefully, I gave you some help in the way we're thinking about it."

So we've got the $6.5 billion in our base plan. I said that if you look at the fundamentals of the aging of that infrastructure and the reliability needs, the constraining factor is not how much demand there is for investment. There's a lot of investment needed. So we're really metering that tied to customer affordability, and that has not changed since we talked about it at the Analyst Day in the fall. It's very much the same picture. On the midstream side, nothing has changed in terms of if you look out over the 5-year period, what we think is going to happen in the Marcellus and Utica regions and the amount of activity there. I mentioned, the gas sector is very, very different from the power sector. Put gas wells in the ground and a year later, the average decline is 15%. So you've just got to continually drill in order to meet the growing demand for natural gas. And in doing that, I think one of the messages we've seen out of the stress in the E&P sector is it needs to rationalize, and people are going to rationalize it to the very best drilling locations. And I'm not blowing smoke when I say that the Susquehanna County in the Marcellus in the area of the Utica that NEXUS serves are the very best dry gas geology in the country. And so through simple common sense, you come back to saying that these are going to be very high-activity areas over the next 5 years. And so our continued sense that NEXUS is a good project and that there'll be more development and expansion in the Millennium are tied to those factors. Now in the very near term, this year, does the E&P sector need to work some things out? Obviously. We're watching that closely. We're managing it. But I think long-term fundamentals, you get down the road for a number of years, this will be in the rearview mirror."

I'm going to use my time this morning to recap our performance in 2015 and to preview 2016. But in a nutshell, I am glad to be in a position to say that we had a very successful year in 2015, not only financially, but on many other fronts. And I feel we're well positioned for a similarly strong year in 2016, and we are off to a good start on that one month into things.
So moving on to Slide 4. I'm going to start by recapping our accomplishments in 2015, and I'll give you a quick energy policy update, and then move on to long-term growth, then I'll turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to give you a bit more detail on our financials, and then we'll wrap up.
So I'm going to provide the 2015 recap within the context of our system of priorities that's laid out on Slide 5. And those of you who've followed us for a number of years know that we consistently worked this system of priorities for the last half dozen years. And for those of you less familiar, I'll just give you a quick grounding, and then I'll move on to the summary. But system really starts on Slide 5 with employees, and a belief that it's hard to be an excellent or great company when you've got employees who have mediocre energy. So we put a lot of time and focus on engagement and the energy and focus of our employees, believing that if we get that right, we can focus those employees on top-decile customer satisfaction, doing a great job for our customers on continuous improvement that we focused on intensely and on growing the company. And if we do those 3 things right: if we serve our customers well, manage our costs well and grow and connect that growth to the economic development of our communities, then the prospects for constructive political and regulatory treatment are higher, and if you combine constructive regulation with healthy growth, reproduce great outcomes for you. And for us, that means consistent predictable 5% to 6% earnings growth combined with an attractive dividend and dividend growth founded on a strong balance sheet.
So Page 6 then begins the recap of our accomplishments against that system of priorities this past year, and I'll start with the employees and say that for the third consecutive year, we earned Gallup, the Gallup organization's Great Workplace Award, that's given to a handful of companies worldwide each year, and we're the only utility company to ever receive it. We were, again, in the top 15% of their worldwide database, so that was very encouraging. We also achieved the best safety result in our company's history, the lowest OSHA rate we've ever had. We're now approaching the safest in industry level, and that is our explicit goal. In fact, we had the safest January in our company history by a pretty wide margin recently as well. And the National Safety Council has us ranked in the top 3% of their 670 participating companies, so that we're in the top 20 of their nearly 700 companies. 
Moving on to continuous improvement. I was really glad to see our customer outage minutes drop sharply this past year by 65%. That's been a key focus for us. We got some help from the weather, but we also had really strong underlying change in our performance. So that's a good thing. Our fossil fleet was top-quartile in its reliability for the fourth consecutive year. We're nearing top-decile in our gas leak and leak repair program, also an area we're very focused on. And I think importantly for you, our utility O&M costs were down year-over-year, and we remain below 2008 levels and near the very front of the industry in terms of O&M cost management. 
On the customer front, our electric company was top-quartile for both residential and business. In fact, our residential was #2 in our peer group. DTE Gas ranked #1 in 2015 on business customer satisfaction and #2 in residential customer satisfaction. So when you look at the overall set of customer-set metrics, we had a strong year in 2015.
Moving on to Slide 7. On the political and regulatory front, I'd say we had a constructive outcome in our electric rate case that went final late last year. And we also filed late last year our first gas rate case in 4 years. We're entering the final stages of discussions on Michigan energy policy, and I'll talk more about that a little bit later. And we have now reached the point where our spend with Michigan suppliers has doubled since we started the program back in 2011, nearly $1 billion spent with Michigan suppliers, up from $475 million back in 2011. That's an important program for us. On the growth and value front, we invested $2.4 billion. $2.1 billion of that was in our utilities, focused on infrastructure and reliability and continued investment in renewables. We also had significant investments, as I think you're aware, in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business around our Bluestone assets. And we also made significant progress on both the NEXUS Pipeline and expansions of the Millennium Pipeline, so significant capital to support future growth. 
Finally, on the financial front, operating EPS at $4.82. That compares to our guidance coming into the year of $4.60. It was our eighth consecutive year of delivering EPS at or above the top end of our original guidance. And in addition, we increased our dividend by nearly 60% -- by nearly 6% to $2.92 a share.
So based on that recap of 2015, I hope you can see why I said at the outset that we had a very successful year in 2015, not only financially but on many other fronts. And though I know it's natural for you to focus most heavily on our financial results, in the end, those financial results are closely tied to the fairness and the quality of our regulation. And in turn, the quality of our regulation is contingent on how well we do controlling our cost via continuous improvement and how well we serve our customers and how we invest in our communities. So staying focused on the whole spectrum of our priorities is really key to our long-term performance. 
Moving on to Slide 8, I'm now going to take a minute to update you on energy policy discussions in Michigan, and those are summarized at high level on Slide 9. As you're well aware, Michigan's been considering updates to its energy laws since last year. And the move to update the current legislation was tied to the need to remake Michigan's power generation fleet. And it focuses -- the legislation focuses on reforming our state's retail open access provisions, defining an integrated resource planning process to choose our future generation mix and on clarifying the role of renewables and energy efficiency in the future.
So late in 2015, a package of bills moved out of the House Energy Policy Committee, and early this year, the focuses moved to the Senate. Senator Mike Nofs, who's chair of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, is now leading the effort to define consensus legislation that will be supported by a strong coalition. And I have to say that Nofs is really well-suited to this role. He was a principal author of our state's 2008 energy legislation, and he is as knowledgeable and experienced as any legislator in the state in this area. So we continue to work closely with Senator Nofs to define and pass this legislation in the first half of the year, and we believe that's achievable.
As I said a minute ago, the goal of this legislation is to enable the transition depicted on Slide 10. Between 2015 and 2030, driven by the aging of our power plants and the Clean Power Plan, our generation fleet will transition from one dominated by coal-fired generation to one with a much heavier mix of gas and renewables. And we've begun the detailed planning for this transition, as you would expect. In fact, some of our early investments will play out this year. We'll add 50 more megawatts of wind to our wind production here in Michigan and we'll invest our first large-scale solar facility, a 50-megawatt installation north of Detroit. I 
am sure you all saw that the Supreme Court yesterday stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan. I must say that, that was a surprise to me. It's unusual to stay a regulation prior to litigation in the lower courts. People speculated about the possibility, but I don't know that a lot of people considered it likely, so somewhat of a surprise. We'll have to see how the legal challenge continues to evolve. 
A quick reaction with kind of one night to sleep on it is that I'm not sure much will change for us, at least in the first half of the 15-year Clean Power Plan implementation period, and that's because we, and I think many in the industry, are dealing with -- during that period, with the replacement of very old, smaller and marginally economical plants, especially given gas prices now. We're dealing with those sorts of plans during that period. But as you look to the latter half of the plan, as you get out in the later years, 2025 to 2030, you do start to take on some of the larger facilities. So if it turned out that the Clean Power Plan were changed in some way, those years, I think, could be affected. But that said, there is a lot of water that needs to flow over this dam before we get too specific about the impacts of this stay. It could range anywhere from the rule being stayed, litigated, some refinements made and the Clean Power Plan moves ahead without much change and its impact. Few things that are more impactful than that, so we just have to wait and see as it evolves.
Moving on to Slide 11, I'm going to turn now to an update on our long-term growth and its drivers, beginning with a recap of our 2015 results as well as our 2016 guidance, and that's laid out on Slide 12. 
So we finished with strong results in 2015, as you can see at the top left. Our initial guidance for last year was $4.60. We upped that guidance twice over the course of the year, ultimately, to $4.78 at our fall Analyst Day. And in the end, we delivered $4.82. And as I said earlier, that's the eighth consecutive year in which we've met or beaten the top end of our guidance. And so we talk about 5% to 6% earnings per share growth. You can see in the oval at the top right that our actual growth in recent years has been about 6.5%. This growth has been driven by a portfolio of businesses that have worked well together, with steady growth from our 2 utilities and some growth upside from our non-utility businesses. 
For 2016, the midpoint of our guidance, as you see at the top right, is $4.93. I feel very good about our ability to deliver that result or exceed it. As we always do, we entered 2016 with specific plans to address potential risks or uncertainties in our budget, and though I entered the year worried about super El Niño weather, January was pretty close to normal, and we are off to a good start on the year. And as I sit here talking to you, it's cold and snowing outside, so February is not matching the worries I entered the year with either, to this point.
Moving on to the bottom of the slide, we increased our dividend in 2015 by 5.8%. And I have said consistently that it's our intention to grow our dividend as we grow earnings. And the oval at the bottom right shows that, that's been our pattern in recent years, and I expect that pattern to continue in 2016.
I'm going to turn now from a focus on 2015 and '16 to a focus on our longer-term growth and investments, and I'll begin that discussion on Slide 13. So the underpinning of our future growth is the investment profile that you see on this slide. And as you can see our investment level over the next 5 years will be up on the order of 30% versus the last 5 years. And as I'll describe over the next few minutes, this increased investment is playing out in nearly all of our business units, in our electric and gas utilities to address aging infrastructure and reliability issues as well as the beginning of our generation fleet renewal and in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business to capitalize on the opportunity to move Marcellus and Utica gas, which are the highest-quality gas reserves in the country, to nearby markets via our Millennium and Bluestone and NEXUS assets. 
Moving to Slide 14. Within our electric utility, investing in our distribution assets to address aging infrastructure and improved reliability has emerged as a key area of focus for us. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, of the $18 billion we project we'll invest in our electric utility over the next decade, more than 1/3, $6.5 billion in our base case, is targeted at our distribution infrastructure. And frankly, the underlying need is larger than that. And this focus really comes from listening to our customers. So we're approaching the top end of J.D. Powers Midwest customer satisfaction rankings. The biggest gap between us and the top-ranked performer is in distribution reliability.
And so moving on to Slide 15, we are making significant investments in distribution infrastructure resilience that improves reliability, and we're doing that by replacing aging infrastructure and addressing our circuits with lowest reliability. We're also seeing the need to redesign our distribution infrastructure to address growth in some of our areas. Many of our sub-stations are now overloaded and need to be upgraded or replaced. We're moving to do this, for example, in Ann Arbor, where growth of both the community and the university are overwhelming our infrastructure there. And we're doing the same in downtown Detroit, so we have a new $600 million Red Wings Arena and multi-entertainment facility going in, and probably over $1 billion of growth when you take into account everything that's happening around it. That is going to require a lot of electric infrastructure. We have a similar project underway to enable a new multi-billion dollar bridge between Detroit and Canada, that requires a lot of infrastructure investment. So these are the sorts of things that we're undertaking on the distribution front, but as we undertake this investment agenda, we're keeping a very close eye on affordability because our customers are asking for improved reliability, and we do need to renew our aging infrastructure, but we've got to maintain affordability and competitiveness while we do that. 
And so the next few slides show that we've done well on that front in recent years as well, on the affordability front. So on Slide 16, you can see that residential bills for both our gas and electric customers are down in recent years. The electric bills are down, principally due to continuous improvement work and reproductions. Even after our most recent rate case that finalized in December, our bills are below 2012 levels. We filed our next electric rate case just a little a while ago, a week or so ago. But even after that case plays out, bills will be flat to levels 5 years earlier. In our gas utility, on the right-hand side, bills this year are down materially from levels in 2012, driven most heavily by gas prices. We also have a gas rate case in process that was filed last year, but we project that bills will still be 10% lower than 5 years earlier after that case is finalized in December.
With respect to our industrial customers, so you can see on Slide 17, that our rates are below both the U.S. average and Great Lakes average. And 5 years ago, this wasn't the case, but we have made good progress in recent years in pushing to the left on this distribution. Our industrial rates have declined 22% since 2013, which have been really important for the competitiveness and economics of this group of customers.
I'm going to turn now from our 2 utilities to an update of our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, Slide 18 lays out the footprint of this business, and I want to focus on 2 portions of the footprint today. The Millennium Pipeline in Marcellus Shale, which you see on the right-hand side of the slide, along with the adjacent Bluestone assets. This area has been a source of significant growth in the recent years and continues to see expansion opportunities, so I want to focus on that. And in addition, I want to focus on the NEXUS pipeline, in yellow on the slide, which is positioned to play a similar role in the Utica Shale in the years ahead.
Moving on to Slide 19, I'm going to start with an update on the NEXUS Pipeline. And I'll start by saying that as things have emerged, NEXUS is arguably positioned to tap the best gas reserve geology in North America. The dry gas well results in the region directly adjacent to our NEXUS Pipeline are staggering. When industry observers rank shale plays, this region of the Utica shows up at the very front of the industry cost curve, highly competitive. And so as the gas industry rationalizes supply across basins, which it needs to do, everything suggests that the Utica will be a winner, and that investment will concentrate there. And as a result, we believe very strongly in the fundamentals that support this pipe.
Development of the NEXUS project continues to move along, so we completed our FERC filing late last year. The pipe is about 2/3 contracted. A significant portion of that volume is with utilities, including the Ontario operations of Spectra and Enbridge in late last year. The Ontario energy board approved their offtake positions. We're also in what I characterize as advanced discussions with additional counterparties interested in positions on the pipe. And importantly, we have signed interconnect agreements in northern Ohio, which is the root of this pipe, totaling 1.4 Bcf per day with gas LDCs, power plants and industrials, which should provide additional demand for NEXUS over time.
Now we are watching and managing dynamics in the E&P sector closely, but as I said earlier, we really do believe that as the sector rationalizes supply, the region served by this pipe is going to benefit. So bottom line, we and our partner, Spectra, continue to move this pipe forward, and 2016 will be an important year in its development.
With respect to our Millennium Pipeline, we continue to see strong interest in expansions. So we're pursuing a 200 million cubic foot a day expansion currently. We filed our FERC preapproval a couple of weeks ago and are projected in service is 2018 on that. That expansion is really to access higher-priced northeast markets rather than lower-priced southern markets. We're also building a lateral off of Millennium, the 8-mile Valley lateral, which should go into service next year. Additionally, we're seeing interest in expanding Millenium from Northeast Utilities, that's serious interest. And I believe our discussions with them will lead to additional Millennium expansions down the road.
What all this means for earnings in the Gas Storage and Pipelines business is laid out on Slide 20. So, last year was a big year for earnings growth in this business. Earnings grew by 30% year-over-year to $107 million in 2015. And that growth was driven by our activities in the Marcellus, tied to our Millennium Pipeline and the Bluestone assets. This year, the midpoint of our guidance is $110 million, so we're projecting some growth but slower growth, obviously, than last year after the big push-up, and that's really given the reduced activity level we see by E&P players. I would say that we're also looking carefully for investment or acquisition opportunities that stress in the E&P and MLP spaces might offer us. Longer term, we do continue to target $170 million in earnings by 2020. And although the current E&P sector dynamics will cause a pause in drilling investment this year, we expect little or no impact, long term. The country needs drilling gas supplies, productions from existing wells decline 15% a year, so you can't wait very long before the drilling has to resume and our pipes are in the right locations to benefit them grow as that occurs over the next 5 years. So everybody is watching what happens over the coming months. But as you look out beyond that, this country is going to have to drill a lot of natural gas wells. Fundamental supply and demand says that, and the Marcellus counties that we're in and the Utica are the places the drilling dollars should go.
I'm going to wrap up my remarks with a few thoughts on our Power & Industrial business, and then I'll turn things over to Peter. On Slide 21, our Power & Industrial business operates contracted assets at 66 sites across the country in  3 business lines: Industrial Energy Services; Renewable Energy; and Reduced Emissions Fuel or REF, for short. 
On slide 22, you see that this business line had earnings of $95 million in 2015, and the midpoint of our guidance for this year is also $95 million, so flat from 2015 to Õ16. Two dynamics underlie this guidance. One of our assets that serves the steel industry rolled over its contract last year. You're probably aware, the steel industry is in a cyclical downturn right now, so our earnings from that asset declined. But offsetting that dynamic is the fact that we expect our REF earnings to grow. So $95 million for this year and longer term, consistent with what we've communicated previously, our 2020 earnings target is $105 million in this segment, as our REF projects sunset out nearly 2020s. We intend to backfill with investments in cogeneration, which we're working actively and opportunities on the asset acquisition front.
And with that, Peter, I'm going to turn it over to you for a financial update."

As most of you know, I like to take advantage of having the microphone on this earnings call to give you an update on my Detroit Tigers. And now with the Super Bowl over, all the focus can be on the upcoming base",1620,"Thanks, Gerry, and good morning, everyone. As most of you know, I like to take advantage of having the microphone on this earnings call to give you an update on my Detroit Tigers. And now with the Super Bowl over, all the focus can be on the upcoming baseball season. Spring training will be starting soon. I have high hopes for my hometown team. Actually, the Tigers were ranked #1 by mlb.com for the most improved team after all the off-season moves. I won't be making any predictions this year. Let's just say I'm hoping a playoff run. 
Enough about the Tigers. I'd like give you a financial update and review of the 2015 earnings before we get to your questions, starting on Slide 24. And as Gerry mentioned, the DTE Energy 2015 operating earnings came in strong at  $4.82 per share. For a detailed breakdown of the EPS by segments, including a reconciliation of GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 43 of the appendix. 
Slide 24 shows the year-over-year operating earnings by segment. First, we're going to focus on the middle column, which shows the 2015 results. Let me start first with the total earnings for the growth segments. Earnings for our growth segments were $848 million or $4.73 per share. This is an increase of $52 million or $0.25 per share over 2014. 
Our largest subsidiary, DTE Electric, earned $562 million and was up $34 million, driven by the implementation of new rates and a return to a more normal weather in 2015. I'll be going over the DT Electric's earnings results in more detail on the next slide, but let me continue on this page. DTE Gas 2015 earnings of $132 million were $8 million below 2014 earnings as we return to a more normal weather in 2015 after one of the coldest winters on record in 2014. The weather impact was partially offset by a reinvestment in distribution and transmission assets in 2014. These were not repeated in 2015. 
Moving down the page, our Gas Storage and Pipelines segment had a very good year, as Gerry Anderson indicated, with operating earnings of $107 million, which is $25 million higher than 2014. This is a 30% increase in our earnings and was driven by a higher volumes in our Bluestone lateral and gathering assets. Earnings for our Power and Industrial projects were $95 million or up $5 million from 2014. This increase was driven by strong performance in our renewables business and REF, partially offset by lower earnings in steel. Earnings for Corporate & Other was negative $48 million in 2015 or $4 million lower than 2014, driven by higher interest expense. 
So as I mentioned, total operating earnings for our growth segments were $848 million or $4.73 per share, which is up 5.6% over the 2014 total growth segment EPS. To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, 2015 earnings were $15 million, which was down $15 million for 2014, driven by a lower realized performance in our gas portfolio. Actually, our trading company had a great year economically. The contribution for 2015 was $54 million, which is double our targeted annual level of $20 million to $25 million. As a reminder, Slide 42 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation, showing both economic and accounting performance. 
Let's turn the page to Slide 25. And as I indicated, I wanted to give a little more detail on electric utility performance. DTE Electric's 2015 earnings were $562 million, which was $34 million higher than 2014. There were 3 significant drivers of this variance. First, the return to more normal weather in  2015. Recall, the summer of 2014 was much colder than normal, while this summer was near-normal. 
Second, the new rate implementation mid-year to support the capital spend to improve distribution and generation infrastructure. These rates were subsequently approved by the MPSC in December. The rate implementation is partially offset by the costs associated with these investments, which as you know is the depreciation of property taxes and interest. 
And finally, we experienced lower storm activity in 2015. This is a significant decrease when compared to 2014. We saw multiple storms, including a storm in September in '14 that impacted over 400,000 customers, which represent about 20% of our electric customers. This lower summer spend was partially offset by 2014 lean initiatives, which were not repeated in 2015. Although not as large of a variance, I did want to touch on, year-over-year, the sales volume impact was just down $6 million. We have provided on the Page 41 of the appendix more details on the sales volumes by customer class but let me first start by saying that the underlying economic indicators were our service territory in Michigan [ph] are solid. Customer counts have increased in total, in our residential and our commercial customer classes. Now this reduction in year-over-year sales was driven by lower volumes in our industrial segment due mainly to the weakness in the steel market. Now this impact was partially offset, as indicated by an uptick in commercial sales, and residential sales were relatively flat, driven by economic and customer growth but also by increased energy efficiency. And we continue to see the benefits of our energy efficiency program to help our customers reduce usage and help keep their average bills affordable.
Now I'd like to review 2016 earnings on Slide 26. As Gerry mentioned upfront, our guidance range for 2016 is $4.80 per share to $5.05 per share, providing a midpoint of $4.93 per share. The total earnings per share guidance is unchanged from our early outlook introduced at our Investor Day on September 2015. Earnings ranges for each segment have been refined and our equity issuance target is now reduced to $100 million, providing lower total shares outstanding. Compare the 2016 guidance to 2015 actuals, utility earnings are higher due to increased rates supporting our customer-related investments. Continued strength in our pipeline and gathering platforms drive the increase in the Gas Storage and Pipelines, including a full-year contribution of the gathering bill that took place in 2015. Our P&I earnings into 2016 remain strong, as increased REF earnings help offset the near-term reduction related to our steel industry assets. Overall, earnings per share of our growth segments are expected to increase from $4.73 in 2015 to $4.93 this year, giving us a year-over-year growth of 4.2%. But when you look back to the initial guidance of '15 to initial guidance of 2016, the growth was 7%.
Moving on to Slide 27, I'd like to touch base on how bonus depreciation extension has impacted our plan. We expect the extension to provide $300 million to   $400  million of favorable cash flow over the 5-year period. So based on this change, as well as other adjustments to our plan, we're now targeting a range of $200 million to $300 million of equity issuance for the 2016 to 2018 period compared to our previous disclosure of $800 million, as you can see on the chart. And as I mentioned on our guidance page, we expect to issue about $100 million of this in 2016.
We've mentioned many times in past that maintaining a strong balance sheet is a priority for us. If you turn to Slide 28, you can see key balance sheet metrics, which we target and that we also monitor FFO to debt leverage. Now this slide shows the projected level for each metric, and as you can see, we are in the targeted range for the next 3 years. 2015, we issued a modest amount of equity, actually needing less than 10% of our capital expenditures to be financed with equity. The strength of our balance sheet sets us up nicely as we enter a period of historical high capital spend.
Now let me wrap it up on Slide 30, and then we can move to the Q&A, with a summary. 2015 was a very good year, and we are well positioned to have a successful 2016. DTE has historically delivered on its growth targets, we actually have exceeded our growth targets over the recent history. We provide a 6.5% annual EPS growth over the last 5 years. As we look forward, we continue to target operating EPS growth of 5% to 6% for our growth segments, and part our shareholder value creation is to continue to grow our dividend in line with these earnings. 
We have meaningful investments in our non-utility, which will drive continued growth in those segments. And we have significant utility investments in reliability and generation modernization that provides affordable clean and reliable service to our customers. The constructive regulatory environment we have in Michigan, coupled with our focus on operational excellence and delivering high customer satisfaction provide a good foundation as we move into an era of replacing and upgrading our aging utility infrastructure. 
Now before I actually turn the call over to questions, I'd like to recognize Anastasia Minor. This is Anastasia Minor's last call, so a little shoutout to Anastasia. I know many of you received an email blast yesterday, an announcement, so I'm sure I'll hear from you when I'm on the road. But I'd like to say that we're leaving it -- actually, Anastasia is not leaving the company, she's a key member of our management team and moving into a different role, but we're leaving the job in good hands. Barb Tuckfied is moving into the role, coming fresh from her Gas Utility Controller assignment.

So we're still very supportive, moving forward. Everything is on schedule from a FERC perspective. The feedback we're getting from FERC is that we've submitted a high-quality product.

The legislation was targeted at 2 things. One is if we are going to remake our generation infrastructure, we should have a good planning process for doing that. So the legislation focuses on an IRP process and having a process where a variety of parties can get their oar in the water to talk about what the mix of generation should be. And I still think we need to do that. The second one was really focused on fairness, which was around retail open access. If we're going to be investing in generation, everybody should participate economically in those investments. So that's a fairness question. But if you try to move from those 2 things, a good planning process and fairness, to our earnings, there really isn't a link between the 2. We think the legislation is important to have a really well defined and fair process for moving forward. But we're going to move on with the distribution investments and the power plant retirements and so forth, either way. We really have to. Some of these power plants are just old. I'll give you an example. We've got one I can see from where we're doing the call here, that just had a major component failure. That unit is not going to run, and -- we think it's highly likely. And the reason is it's just old enough or marginal enough that we've got to move on. And so we've got numerous assets in that sort of position where we really are evaluating just how much longer it makes sense to invest versus move on. And some of the plants that are from the 50s and 60s, it's time to move on. So what I said earlier, that I don't see the early years of the Clean Power Plan -- maybe the first half of it being affected much, that's why. Now when you move out into the later years, closer to 2027, 2030, then you start to get into some of our larger somewhat newer assets, they could be affected. But I'll tell you, there's a lot to happen between now and then. So there's continued action on NOx and mercury and other fronts, water, that will be thrown into the mix in terms of how we evaluate those plants and their life. So I think it's really early to talk too much about what this stay might mean for our -- both our earnings and really, for the Clean Power Plan because it's very possible that they'll send it down to have a couple of specific issues reconsidered or reconfigured. The EPA will address those and then things move on. Or it could be more fundamental than that, and we really don't know right now.

I think we previously have talked, and I mentioned earlier that, particularly in the distribution side of the electric utility, there's a lot of demand for investment there. So we've got the $6.5 billion in our base plan. I said that if you look at the fundamentals of the aging of that infrastructure and the reliability needs, the constraining factor is not how much demand there is for investment. There's a lot of investment needed. So we're really metering that tied to customer affordability, and that has not changed since we talked about it at the Analyst Day in the fall. It's very much the same picture. On the midstream side, nothing has changed in terms of if you look out over the 5-year period, what we think is going to happen in the Marcellus and Utica regions and the amount of activity there. I mentioned, the gas sector is very, very different from the power sector. Put gas wells in the ground and a year later, the average decline is 15%. So you've just got to continually drill in order to meet the growing demand for natural gas. And in doing that, I think one of the messages we've seen out of the stress in the E&P sector is it needs to rationalize, and people are going to rationalize it to the very best drilling locations. And I'm not blowing smoke when I say that the Susquehanna County in the Marcellus in the area of the Utica that NEXUS serves are the very best dry gas geology in the country. And so through simple common sense, you come back to saying that these are going to be very high-activity areas over the next 5 years. And so our continued sense that NEXUS is a good project and that there'll be more development and expansion in the Millennium are tied to those factors. Now in the very near term, this year, does the E&P sector need to work some things out? Obviously. We're watching that closely. We're managing it. But I think long-term fundamentals, you get down the road for a number of years, this will be in the rearview mirror."

I should take just a minute and recognize that this is Gerry Norcia's first time on this call as President and COO. Gerry was promoted into that position early in April. I think many of you know, Gerry or met him on visits, but Gerry, just a brief history, came in as President of our Gas Storage and Pipelines business and really helped to build that business, then took over as President of our Gas Utility, along with his role at GSP, most recently was President of our electric operations, and then as I mentioned, moved into his role as President and COO just about a month ago. 
Well, I'm going to start the discussion today with an overview of our results in the first quarter as well as a number of key developments at the company. Now I'll turn things over to Peter to give you a financial update and then we will wrap up and take your questions. 
So moving on to Slide 5. We continue to make good progress on a number of fronts. With 1 quarter behind us in 2016, I feel very good about our year-to-date financial results and our ability to deliver or exceed our full year guidance. 
Our energy legislation continues to move forward in Lansing. In fact, this is a key as it turns out, and I will describe that a minute. 
And our NEXUS gas pipeline project continue to move forward toward its 2017 in-service date, and I will give you an update on progress on that front in a few minutes as well. 
So concerning our financial performance, maybe on to Slide 6. As I mentioned, we're off to a very good start. We delivered first quarter operating earnings of $1.52, which I feel great about relative to our plan for the year. We came into 2016 expecting a warm winter. We're talking about that prior to the call. We started last July planning for El Niño, so we came into the year with a plan expecting a standard deviation or more warmer this winter. And it came, but we came out of the first quarter in great shape. So that'll work out fine. 
And given that, we're on track to deliver our earnings guidance in another year of earnings growth. And assuming that we do that, 2016 will be our 10th consecutive year of meeting or beating our earnings targets. 
As you know, we've also been growing our dividend in parallel with earnings, and we have every intention to continue that. And our balance sheet continues to be in great shape. In fact, back in February upgraded us. 
So bottom line, as we ahead into the second quarter, I feel great about our financial position. 
Moving on to Slide 7. As I said earlier, energy legislation continues to progress in Lansing. The current regulatory construct in Michigan was established by legislation passed back in 2008. And the key provisions of that legislation and our current construct are laid out at the top of the slide. And those provisions have and continue to serve state of Michigan very well. 
But in preparation for a significant investment in new generation in our state as we retire over assets, we've been working on an update to the 2008 legislation over the past year. 
And this week, Senator Mike Nofs, who's Chairman of the Center of Energy and Technology Committee, will introduce his substitute bills and take testimony from a range of key stakeholders. In fact, I'm going to be up in Lansing on Thursday testifying. 
The legislation that Senator Nofs fashioned has a number of key features, so it establishes firm capacity requirements for all electricity providers in Michigan, but in particular, establishes requirements for the first time for the retail open access suppliers or choice suppliers. That's a key reliability of provision as the state moves in to retiring and rebuilding generation. That 10% of the market needs to be planned for, and that's what the legislation is targeting. 
The legislation also sets up an IRP or Integrated Research Planning Process that will enable long-term resource planning and will establish a process for investment pre-approval. And then finally, the legislation establishes incentives for energy efficiency investment, and it enables decoupling related to energy efficiency and it makes possible for utilities to apply for broader decoupling to the Public Service Commission as well. 
So Senator Nofs expects to work these builds hard this week and the following week. And then we'll move them out of committee for a vote on the Senate floor where it feels the time is right for that. And then we expect that this legislation will become -- will move over to the House and become the basis for discussions and action there. 
So we also to continue to make progress on our NEXUS Pipeline project. And Slide 8 provides a summary update of that activity. As the left-hand side of the slide shows, NEXUS originates, and arguably, the best dry gas geology in the country in the Utica Shale, and then runs north and west across Northern Ohio where there are numerous opportunities to interconnect will LDC, power plant and industrial loads. 
And then the pipe heads north to interconnect with the vector pipeline in Michigan, which ties it to a very large gas storage complex in Michigan and in Ontario. And vector also enables it to serve LDCs in Ontario, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin and other Midwest states. 
So NEXUS remains on track to be placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2017. Couple of noteworthy first quarter accomplishments for NEXUS are listed on the right-hand side of the slide. As I mentioned, the pipe runs across Northern Ohio. And during the first quarter, we increased our interconnect agreements along that stretch from 1.4 Bcf per day to 1.75 Bcf per day, and these interconnect agreements represent great feature market activities for NEXUS, which is a 1.5 Bcf design pipe. 
We also ordered compressors for the pipe in the first quarter, so both the speed of the pipe and the compression for the project are on order. And finally, we continued to advance our work with a FERC, and that's going well. And we continue to expect our FERC notice of schedule here during the second quarter. 
So before I hand things over to Peter for a financial update, I want to summarize on Slide 9. So we have, for years, talked investors about delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings per share growth with higher reliability and consistency and pairing that with a healthy dividend growth. 
And on the right-hand side of the slide in the ovals, you can see that our actual EPS growth in recent years has been 6.5%, and we have grown the dividend that just above 5.5%. And given our start to 2016 in the first quarter, as I said earlier, I feel really good about our ability to continue that pattern over the course of this year. 
So that said, Peter, over to you."

I'll just start on Slide 11. And as Gerry mentioned, DTE Energy's operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.52 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $1.37 per share. Our detailed breakdown",1375,"Thanks, Gerry, and good morning to everyone. I'll just start on Slide 11. And as Gerry mentioned, DTE Energy's operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.52 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $1.37 per share. Our detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 29 of the appendix. 
This slide shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by segment. I will start at the top of the page with our 2 [ph] utilities. Important to remember that the first quarter last year was one of the coldest on record. In fact, February 2015 was the coldest February in the last 50 years. The first quarter of 2016, which are one of the warmest on record. So primarily driven by weather earnings were both electric and gas, utilities were down quarter-over-quarter. DTE Electric's earnings were $127 million for first quarter this year compared to $136 million last year. 
Along with weather, DTE Electric's earnings were lower due to the absence of the revenue decoupling mechanism amortization in 2016. This revenue decoupling amortization was part of our strategy to extend the time frame in between rate cases by 4 years. 
The amortization was offset by the implementation of new rates last July. A further breakdown of DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter results can be found in the appendix on Slide 21. 
For DTE Gas, earnings for the quarter were $87 million compared to $111 million last year. They stated earlier the significant change in weather was a primary driver of this experience. 
Gas Storage and Pipeline earnings were $30 million for the quarter, earnings for the quarter were up $3 million over last year due to higher pipeline and gathering earnings on protection that came on line after the first quarter of 2015. 
Storage earnings were also higher than last year due to lower maintenance expenses. 
Moving down to slide, earnings for our Power and Industrial Projects were $21 million for the quarter, down $12 million for the first quarter last year. This decrease is primarily driven by lower earnings in the steel sector. 
The seasonal variability lays the area up volumes and for the balance of the year, the area will help all set the steel sector decline. 
Earnings for Corporate & Other were negative $7 million for the first quarter 2016, $18 million favorable over last year due to our first quarter 2015 effective tax rate adjustment, which unbound during the rest of that year. 
So earnings for our growth segments for the first quarter were $258 million or $1.43 per share compared to $282 million or $1.58 per share last year. 
To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, the first quarter operating earnings were $16 million, up $4 million from the first quarter last year driven by stronger realized gas portfolio performance. 
Our trading company is off to another good start. Trading's economic contribution for the first quarter 2016 was $18 million. Slide 28 of the appendix continues the standard energy trading reconciliations strong both economic and accounting performance. 
We typically wait to the midyear earnings call to assess the trading company's range of accounting income contribution for the year. At that point, we'll have a good sense of how much accounting income will be to cover current year operating expenses. 
Let's move now to Slide 12. Slide 12 provides a quick overview of our capital expenditures through the first [ph] quarter of the year. Capital spending was lower than last year primarily due to the purchasing of a picking generating asset in 2015. Our CapEx guidance range remains at $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion for 2016. I'll go into more detail on some of our utility capital plans on the next 2 slides. 
Just like turn now to Slide 13 in our electric utility. One of the highlight -- one of the key areas of focus for our Electric Utility segment, which is improving customer-related distribution reliability. We're making significant investments in our distribution infrastructure to improve reliability and address growth in certain areas of our service territory. 
Over the next 10 years, we'll spent $6.5 billion replacing aging infrastructure and overloaded substations as well as consolidating assisting substations and adding technology and automation to provide greater visibility into the assistive for outage prevention and detection. 
As you see in the past, this 10-year investment of $6.5 billion of this distribution of infrastructure can increase up to an additional $4 billion of reliability investments. 
Customer affordability is at the forefront of our planning and will guide and determine how much total distribution of reliability investment we will do in this time frame. 
Now on Slide 14. This slide highlights the large component of our investment in DTE Gas. Expanded mains renewal program. Well, that $6 million over the next 5 years upgrading the gas system. Our plan to replace 4,000 miles of cast iron and unprotected main steel was accelerated to cut completion time in half from 50 years to 25 years. 
The MPSC approved the acceleration of the infrastructure production recovery mechanism at the end of last year. 
Upgrading the gas main system benefits our customers by reducing costs and leaks and ensuring the basic gas infrastructure in our service territory is there for future generations. 
As you can see from the previous 2 slides, our CapEx plan will address the needs of our customers and the aging infrastructure while being mindful of customer affordability. 
We've been consistent in our messaging over the last -- over the years that maintaining a strong balance sheet priority on Slide 15 provides a key balance sheet metrics we target and monitor, FFO to debt and leverage. The slide shows the projected level for each metric. 
Our near-term equity issuance plans are $200 million to $300 million over the next 3 years, and we continue to evaluate our equity needs for this year. 
As we discussed on our year-end call, the extension bonus depreciation provides $200 million to $400 million of favorable cash flow over the next 5 years, which help reduce our equity needs in the near term. 
The strength of our balance sheet sets us up nicely as we enter a period of incremental infrastructure improvements, and we're confident that our plans to maintain this balance sheet strength. 
Let me wrap up on Slide 17 and we can move to Q&A. With a strong first quarter, even with a good amount on favorable weather, we are confident that we will achieve our operating earnings guidance of $4.80 to $5.05 per share, which will extend the to 10th consecutive year as a meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. 
We're making significant utility infrastructure improvements and will continue to provide affordable and reliable service to our customers. We have meaningful investment opportunities at our Gas Pipeline segment with our investments in the Millennium and Bluestone and the NEXUS pipeline. And our Power Industrial segment, we have opportunities will bidding on-site cogeneration projects. 
So our board, we continue to target operating EPS of 5% to 6% for our gross [ph] segments. And part of our shareholder value equation is to continue to grow to our dividends in line with these earnings. We maintain our commitment to a strong balance sheet, which can provide future growth opportunities. 
Before I open up to the Q&A, I know many of you in the call have been waiting for my Detroit Tiger update, so I'd like to a quick update to my hometown Detroit Tigers because no DTE earnings call would be complete without it. 
At this year, definitely start out well for the Tigers, but recently, they've been having some problems with their pitching. The weather for this year was home opener came in Detroit was definitely favorable to our gas utility as it was one of the coldest home openers ever played in Comerica Park. Our fans brave the weather in Comerica Park to watch us beat the Yankess, which is our eighth consecutive home opening win, and that was a good day when we beat the Yankees. 
With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So Cynthia, we can open up the lines for questions."

Will they be in a position to move it before the summer recess, or like in 2008, will it come back after the summer recess and be active on them? In 2008, just having been part of that, I spent a couple of year in my life involved in that one. The way it played out is actually in that case,, the House finished action just prior to summer recess and then the Senate came back and acted right after the recess.

And you can only allow 15% decline before -- only allow that for so long before you need to get the backfill it.

We're expanding Bluestone and we're expanding Millennium. And I think the prospects we see are from more of that. So there's -- you were mentioning consolation of a pipeline. What we're seeing in the Northeast is a continued pull for gas. They have to have gas in power generation and the oil to gas conversions continue. So the demand for gas continues to be very, very strong, but there's a real resistance in New York and in other areas of the Northeast to new pipelines. I think that's what that's likely to do. In fact, New York called to sounded explicitly is biased towards expansions of existing pipes. So I think the likelihood of some of these resistance you're seeing is that owners of existing positions, including Millennium and Bluestone, will see people coming to them as the most credible and doable pads and expansion pads to market. So I just start by saying that I think what we're seeing evolving in the market is a positive for the asset position we have there. Bluestone and Millennium are attached to really good geology and there's resistance in the market to creating new outlets, altogether new outlets for that geology, which means the existing ones are going to have to expand. And then the long-term growth, NEXUS is an important part of that growth. But when we look out 5 years and ask what is the current dynamic in 2016 really mean for 2020, not much. The gas demand in 2020 is going to be what it's going to be. And power generation conversions are going to be underway. And so the geology is going to have the deliver and the pipes are going to have to deliver. Now I think that you could say in the short term did production get out in front of itself a bit with a lot of excitement in the market, the answer to that is obviously, yes. So there's an adjustment in the near term and it's changed the path to get to 2020. But the ultimate point that the market needs to achieve in 2020 hasn't changed for either production or delivery to pipes to meet demand. So we really don't see a lot of impact long term. All the path to get there as change from what it might have been."

But we are kind of calibrating how much of that we do based upon affordability because we've consistently said that companies that don't pay careful attention to that one, they're going through a big investment cycle end up losing. You just need to go through these cycles in a way where your customers feel their affordability is workable. So that's really what determines how much of the $10.5 billion we would spend versus the $6.5 billion.

I should take just a minute and recognize that this is Jerry Norcia's first time on this call as President and COO. Jerry was promoted into that position early in April. I think many of you know Gerry or met him on visits, but Jerry, just a brief history, came in as President of our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, and really helped to build that business, then took over as President of our Gas Utility, along with his role at GSP, most recently was President of our electric operations, and then as I mentioned, moved into his role as President and COO just about a month ago. 
Well, I am going to start the discussion today with an overview of our results in the first quarter as well as a number of key developments at the company. Then I'll turn things over to Peter to give you a financial update and then, we will wrap up and take your questions. 
So moving on to Slide 5. We continue to make good progress on a number of fronts. With 1 quarter behind us in 2016, I feel very good about our year-to-date financial results and our ability to deliver or exceed our full year guidance. 
Energy legislation continues to move forward in Lansing. In fact, this is a key week, as it turns out, and I will describe that in a minute. 
And our NEXUS gas pipeline project continue to move forward toward its 2017 in-service date. And I will give you an update on progress on that front in a few minutes as well. 
So concerning our financial performance, moving on to Slide 6. As I mentioned, we're off to a very good start. We delivered first quarter operating earnings of $1.52, which I feel great about relative to our plan for the year. We came into 2016 expecting a warm winter. We're talking about that prior to the call. We started last July planning for El Niño. So we came into the year with a plan expecting a standard deviation or more warmer this winter, and it came. But we came out of the first quarter in great shape. So that all worked out fine. And given that, we're on track to deliver our earnings guidance and another year of earnings growth. And assuming that we do that, 2016 will be our 10th consecutive year of meeting or beating our earnings targets. 
As you know, we've also been growing our dividend in parallel with earnings, and we have every intention to continue that. And our balance sheet continues to be in great shape. In fact, Fitch, back in February upgraded us. 
So bottom line, as we head into the second quarter, I feel great about our financial position. 
Moving on to Slide 7. As I said earlier, energy legislation continues to progress in Lansing. The current regulatory construct in Michigan was established by a legislation passed back in 2008. And the key provisions of that legislation and our current construct are laid out at the top of the slide. And those provisions have and continue to serve the State of Michigan very well. But in preparation for a significant investment in new generation assets in our state, as we retire older assets, we've been working on an update to the 2008 legislation over the past year. And this week, Senator Mike Nofs, who's Chairman of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, will introduce his substitute bills and take testimony from a range of key stakeholders. In fact, I'm going to be up in Lansing on Thursday testifying. The legislation that Senator Nofs has fashioned has a number of key features, so it establishes firm capacity requirements for all electricity providers in Michigan, but in particular, establishes requirements for the first time for the retail open access suppliers or choice suppliers. That's a key reliability provision as the state moves in to retiring and rebuilding generation. That 10% of the market needs to be planned for and that's what the legislation is targeting. 
The legislation also sets up an IRP, or Integrated Research Planning Process, that will enable long-term resource planning and will establish a process for investment preapproval. And then finally, the legislation establishes incentives for energy efficiency investment and it enables decoupling related to energy efficiency, and it makes possible for utilities to apply for broader decoupling to the Public Service Commission as well. 
So Senator Nofs expects to work these bills hard this week and the following week. And then we'll move them out of committee for a vote on the Senate floor when it feels the time is right for that. And then we expect that this legislation will become -- will move over to the House and become the basis for discussions and action there. 
So we also to continue to make progress on our NEXUS Pipeline project. And Slide 8 provides a summary update of that activity. As the left-hand side of the slide shows, NEXUS originates, and arguably the best dry gas geology in the country in the Utica Shale. And it then runs north and west across Northern Ohio where there are numerous opportunities to interconnect with  LDC, power plant and industrial loads. And then the pipe heads north to interconnect with the Vector pipeline in Michigan, which ties it to a very large gas storage complex in Michigan and in Ontario. And Vector also enables it to serve LDCs in Ontario, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin and other Midwest states. 
So NEXUS remains on track to be placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2017. Couple of noteworthy first quarter accomplishments for NEXUS are listed on the right-hand side of the slide. As I mentioned, the pipe runs across Northern Ohio. And during the first quarter, we increased our interconnect agreements along that stretch from 1.4 Bcf per day to 1.75 Bcf per day. And these interconnect agreements represent great future market activities for NEXUS, which is a 1.5 Bcf design pipe. 
We also ordered compressors for the pipe in the first quarter, so both the steel and the pipe and the compression for the project are on order. And finally, we continued to advance our work with FERC, and that's going well. And we continue to expect our FERC notice of schedule here during the second quarter. 
So before I hand things over to Peter for a financial update, I want to summarize on Slide 9. So we have, for years, talked investors about delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings per share growth with high reliability and consistency and pairing that with healthy dividend growth. And on the right-hand side of the slide, in the ovals, you can see that our actual EPS growth in recent years has been 6.5%. And we have grown the dividend at just above 5.5%. And given our start to 2016 in the first quarter, as I said earlier, I feel really good about our ability to continue that pattern over the course of this year. 
So that said, Peter, over to you."

For detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 29 of the appendix. 
This slide shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by segment. I will start at the top of the page with our 2 utilities. It's important to remember that the first quarter last year was one of the coldest on record. In fact, February of 2015 was the coldest February in the last 50 years. The first quarter of 2016 was actually one of the warmest on record. So primarily driven by weather, earnings for both electric and gas utilities were down quarter-over-quarter. DTE Electric's earnings were $127 million for first quarter this year compared to $136 million last year. Along with weather, DTE Electric's earnings were lower due to the absence of the revenue decoupling mechanism amortization in 2016. This revenue decoupling amortization was part of our strategy that extended the time frame in between rate cases by 4 years. The amortization was offset by the implementation of new rates last July. A further breakdown of DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter results can be found in the appendix on Slide 21. 
For DTE Gas, earnings for the quarter were $87 million compared to $111 million last year. As stated earlier, the significant change in weather was the primary driver of this variance. 
Gas Storage and Pipeline earnings were $30 million for the quarter. Earnings for the quarter were up $3 million over last year due to higher pipeline and gathering earnings from production that came online after the first quarter of 2015. Storage earnings were also higher than last year due to lower maintenance expenses. 
Moving down the slide. Earnings for our Power and Industrial Projects were $21 million for the quarter, down $12 million from the first quarter of last year. This decrease is primarily driven by lower earnings in the steel sector. The seasonal variability is related to the REF volumes and for the balance of the year, the REF will help offset the steel sector decline. 
Earnings for Corporate and Other were negative $7 million for this first quarter of 2016, $18 million favorable over last year due to our first quarter 2015 effective tax rate adjustment, which unwound during the rest of that year. 
So earnings for our Growth segments for the first quarter were $258 million or $1.43 per share compared to $282 million or $1.58 per share last year. 
To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, the first quarter operating earnings were $16 million, up $4 million from the first quarter of last year driven by stronger realized gas portfolio performance. Our trading company is off to another good start. Trading's economic contribution for the first quarter of 2016 was $18 million. Slide 28 of the appendix contains our standard energy trading reconciliations showing both economic and accounting performance. 
We typically wait till the midyear earnings call to assess the trading company's range of accounting income contribution for the year. At that point, we have a good sense of how much accounting income will be flowing through to cover the current year operating expenses. 
Let's move now to Slide 12. Slide 12 provides a quick overview of our capital expenditures through the first quarter of the year. Capital spending was lower than last year, primarily due to the purchasing of a peaking generating asset in 2015. Our CapEx guidance range remains at $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion for 2016. I'll go into more detail on some of our utility capital plans on the next 2 slides. 
Just like turn now to Slide 13. In our electric utility,one of the highlight -- one of the key areas of focus for our Electric Utility segment, which is improving customer-related distribution reliability. We're making significant investments in our distribution infrastructure to improve reliability and address growth on certain areas of our service territory. 
Over the next 10 years, we'll spend $6.5 billion replacing aging infrastructure and overloaded substations as well as consolidating assisting substations and adding technology and automation to provide greater visibility into the system for outage prevention and detection. 
As we said in the past, this 10-year investment of $6.5 billion of distribution infrastructure can increase up to an additional $4 billion of reliability investments. 
Customer affordability is at the forefront of our planning and will guide and determine how much total distribution in reliability investment we will do in this time frame. 
Now Slide 14. This slide highlights the large component of our investment at DTE Gas, expanded main renewal program. Well, that's $600 million over the next 5 years upgrading the gas system. Our plan to replace 4,000 miles of cast iron and unprotected main steel was accelerated to cut the completion time in half from 50 years to 25 years. The MPSC approved the acceleration of the infrastructure recovery mechanism at the end of last year. Upgrading the gas main system benefits our customers by reducing cost of leaks and assuring the basic gas infrastructure in our service territory is there for future generations. 
As you can see from the previous 2 slides, our CapEx plan will address the needs of our customers and the aging infrastructure while being mindful of customer affordability. 
We've been consistent in our messaging over the last -- over the years that maintaining a strong balance sheet is the priority. So Slide 15 provides a key balance sheet metrics we target and monitor, FFO to debt and leverage. This slide shows the projected level for each metric. 
Our near-term equity issuance plans are $200 million to $300 million over the next 3 years, and we continue to evaluate our equity needs for this year. As we discussed on our year-end call, extension of bonus depreciation provides $300 million to $400 million of favorable cash flow over the next 5 years, which help reduce our equity needs in the near term. 
The strength of our balance sheet sets us up nicely as we enter a period of incremental infrastructure improvements. And we're confident that our plans allow us to maintain this balance sheet strength. 
Let me wrap up on Slide 17, then we can move to Q&A. With a strong first quarter, even with a good amount of unfavorable weather, we are confident that we'll achieve our operating earnings guidance of $4.80 to $5.05 per share, which will extend our streak to 10 consecutive years on meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. We're making significant utility infrastructure improvements that will continue to provide affordable and reliable service to our customers. We have meaningful investment opportunities at our Gas Pipeline segment with our investments in Millennium, Bluestone and the NEXUS pipeline. In our Power and Industrial segment, we have opportunities with building on-site cogeneration projects. 
Going forward, we continue to target operating EPS of 5% to 6% for our growth segments. And part of our shareholder value equation is to continue to grow to our dividends in line with these earnings. We maintain our commitment to a strong balance sheet, which can provide future growth opportunities. 
Before I open up the Q&A, I know many of you in the call have been waiting for my Detroit Tiger update, so I'd like to a quick update to my hometown Detroit Tigers because no DTE earnings call would be complete without it. 
This year definitely started out well for the Tigers. But recently, they've been having some problems with their pitching. The weather for this year's home opener game in Detroit was definitely favorable to our gas utility as it was one of the coldest home openers ever played in Comerica Park. Our fans braved the weather and packed Comerica Park to watch us beat the Yankees, which is our eighth consecutive home opening win. And that was a good day when we beat the Yankees. 
With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So Cynthia, we can open up the lines for questions."

So no, we weren't talking about positioning our trading company. What we really did is just look at the odds the way the El Niño was setting up last summer that we would have a warm winter. And the odds are very high when you look across past the statistical data. So we all looked at ourselves and said, ""Look, if the odds are this high, we're just going to take it as a given and plan for it."" So we did go into our expenses. We went after additional productivity in the business, so we always look for productivity improvements, but we went for more than normal. And that was hard work to put the plan together, but it paid off. And we don't publish our plan or make public our plan, but I do feel really good about the way we exited the quarter in our growth business as relative to the plan we have for the year. And that's why you're hearing a confidential tone on our ability to play out and meet or exceed our guidance for the year. Trading, just comment on that, I mean, they had a really good first quarter.

And then we'll -- that legislation will be pushed back over to the House. Another question in the House is how quickly can it move there. Will they be in a position to move it before the summer recess or, like in 2008, will it come back after the summer recess and be acted on then? In 2008, just having been part of that, I spent kind of a year in my life involved in that one. The way it played out is actually in that case, the House finished action just prior to the summer recess, and then the Senate came back and acted right after the recess. So we'll wait and see it. But I think the hope would be that it will get out of the Senate and act on it in the House as well prior to the recess. But if that didn't happen, it could play out like 2008 did."

And we continue to be focused, as we kind of laid out in our 5-year plan, on understanding that the REF earnings roll off in the early 2020s that we would backfill those earnings with quality investments like the cogeneration.

And people keep concluding that drilling has pulled back with gas declines at 15% in the United States. And you can only allow 15% decline before -- only allow that for so long before you need to begin to backfill it. And the most obvious places for Southwestern and other people to begin drilling again is in the Northeast Marcellus and in Utica. And the well quality there is just so high. So our expectation is when we pushed up gas supplies in the country awfully hard in 2015, people are [indiscernible] but they're going to -- we're going to need to step back into it. When they do, we expect it to be in the areas we have exposure to."

The future, we've consistently said that we're trying to keep rate increases in the range of inflation, so around 3% as you work your way through one of these intense capital investment cycles. And that's going to require us to both measure the pace of capital investment, but also keep the focus on productivity and continuous improvement that we've had in order to do that. So you know what the blend of capital on O&M is. We got to keep the O&M -- our O&M in recent years, the increase has been 0. And when you can blend the 0 with the increase that come from capital, you can hold it to something reasonable. Now we can't commit the 0 in the future, but we've worked in the past very, very high to keep there, the future. That's unlikely. You can't continue that forever. But we'll work hard on C&I and we will continue to measure the pace of investment.

We're expanding Bluestone and we're expanding Millennium. And I think the prospects we see are from more of that. So there's -- you were mentioning cancelation of a pipeline. What we're seeing in the Northeast is a continued pull for gas. They have to have gas for power generation, and the oil to gas conversions continue. So the demand for gas continues to be very, very strong. But there's a real resistance in New York and in other areas of the Northeast to new pipelines. I think that's what that's likely to do. In fact, New York called this out explicitly, is biased towards expansions of existing pipes. So I think the likelihood of some of this resistance you're seeing is that owners of existing positions, including Millennium and Bluestone, will see people coming to them as the most credible and doable pads and expansion pads to market. So I'll just start by saying that I think what we're seeing evolving in the market is a positive for the asset position we have there. Bluestone and Millennium are attached to really good geology and there's resistance in the market to creating new outlets, altogether new outlets, for that geology, which means the existing ones are going to have to expand. And then the long-term growth, NEXUS is an important part of that growth. But when we look out 5 years and ask what is the current dynamic in 2016 really mean for 2020, not much. The gas demand in 2020 is going to be what it's going to be. And power generation conversions are going to be underway. And so the geology is going to have to deliver, the pipes are going to have to deliver. Now I think that you could say in the short term that production get out in front of itself a bit with a lot of excitement in the market. The answer to that is obviously yes. So there's an adjustment in the near term and it's changed the path to get to 2020. But the ultimate point that the market needs to achieve in 2020 hasn't changed for either production or delivery through pipes to meet demand. So we really don't see a lot of impact long term, although the path to get there has changed from what it might have been."

But we are kind of calibrating how much of that we do based upon affordability because we've consistently said that companies that don't pay careful attention to that one, they're going through a big investment cycle end up losing. You just need to go through these cycles in a way where your customers feel their affordability is workable.

I should take just a minute and recognize that this is Jerry Norcia's first time on this call as President and COO. Jerry was promoted into that position early in April. I think many of you know Jerry or met him on visits, but Jerry, just a brief history, came in as President of our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, and really helped to build that business, then took over as President of our Gas Utility, along with his role at GSP, most recently was President of our electric operations, and then as I mentioned, moved into his role as President and COO just about a month ago. 
Well, I am going to start the discussion today with an overview of our results in the first quarter as well as a number of key developments at the company. Then I'll turn things over to Peter to give you a financial update and then, we will wrap up and take your questions. 
So moving on to Slide 5. We continue to make good progress on a number of fronts. With 1 quarter behind us in 2016, I feel very good about our year-to-date financial results and our ability to deliver or exceed our full year guidance. 
Energy legislation continues to move forward in Lansing. In fact, this is a key week, as it turns out, and I will describe that in a minute. 
And our NEXUS gas pipeline project continued to move forward toward its 2017 in-service date. And I will give you an update on progress on that front in a few minutes as well. 
So concerning our financial performance, moving on to Slide 6. As I mentioned, we're off to a very good start. We delivered first quarter operating earnings of $1.52, which I feel great about relative to our plan for the year. We came into 2016 expecting a warm winter. We're talking about that prior to the call. We started last July planning for El Niño. So we came into the year with a plan expecting a standard deviation or more warmer this winter, and it came. But we came out of the first quarter in great shape. So that all worked out fine. And given that, we're on track to deliver our earnings guidance and another year of earnings growth. And assuming that we do that, 2016 will be our 10th consecutive year of meeting or beating our earnings targets. 
As you know, we've also been growing our dividend in parallel with earnings, and we have every intention to continue that. And our balance sheet continues to be in great shape. In fact, Fitch, back in February upgraded us. 
So bottom line, as we head into the second quarter, I feel great about our financial position. 
Moving on to Slide 7. As I said earlier, energy legislation continues to progress in Lansing. The current regulatory construct in Michigan was established by a legislation passed back in 2008. And the key provisions of that legislation and our current construct are laid out at the top of the slide. And those provisions have and continue to serve the State of Michigan very well. But in preparation for a significant investment in new generation assets in our state, as we retire older assets, we've been working on an update to the 2008 legislation over the past year. And this week, Senator Mike Nofs, who's Chairman of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, will introduce his substitute bills and take testimony from a range of key stakeholders. In fact, I'm going to be up in Lansing on Thursday testifying. The legislation that Senator Nofs has fashioned has a number of key features, so it establishes firm capacity requirements for all electricity providers in Michigan, but in particular, establishes requirements for the first time for the retail open access suppliers or choice suppliers. That's a key reliability provision as the state moves in to retiring and rebuilding generation. That 10% of the market needs to be planned for and that's what the legislation is targeting. 
The legislation also sets up an IRP, or Integrated Resource Planning Process, that will enable long-term resource planning and will establish a process for investment preapproval. And then finally, the legislation establishes incentives for energy efficiency investment and it enables decoupling related to energy efficiency, and it makes it possible for utilities to apply for broader decoupling to the Public Service Commission as well. 
So Senator Nofs expects to work these bills hard this week and the following week. And then we'll move them out of committee for a vote on the Senate floor when it feels the time is right for that. And then we expect that this legislation will become -- will move over to the House and become the basis for discussions and action there. 
So we also to continue to make progress on our NEXUS Pipeline project. And Slide 8 provides a summary update of that activity. As the left-hand side of the slide shows, NEXUS originates, and arguably the best dry gas geology in the country in the Utica Shale. And it then runs north and west across Northern Ohio where there are numerous opportunities to interconnect with  LDC, power plant and industrial loads. And then the pipe heads north to interconnect with the Vector pipeline in Michigan, which ties it to a very large gas storage complex in Michigan and in Ontario. And Vector also enables it to serve LDCs in Ontario, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin and other Midwest states. 
So NEXUS remains on track to be placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2017. Couple of noteworthy first quarter accomplishments for NEXUS are listed on the right-hand side of the slide. As I mentioned, the pipe runs across Northern Ohio. And during the first quarter, we increased our interconnect agreements along that stretch from 1.4 Bcf per day to 1.75 Bcf per day. And these interconnect agreements represent great future market activities for NEXUS, which is a 1.5 Bcf design pipe. 
We also ordered compressors for the pipe in the first quarter, so both the steel, the pipe, and the compression for the project are on order. And finally, we continued to advance our work with FERC, and that's going well. And we continue to expect our FERC notice of schedule here during the second quarter. 
So before I hand things over to Peter for a financial update, I want to summarize on Slide 9. So we have, for years, talked to investors about delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings per share growth with high reliability and consistency and pairing that with healthy dividend growth. And on the right-hand side of the slide, in the ovals, you can see that our actual EPS growth in recent years has been 6.5%. And we have grown the dividend at just above 5.5%. And given our start to 2016 in the first quarter, as I said earlier, I feel really good about our ability to continue that pattern over the course of this year. 
So that said, Peter, over to you."

I'll just start on Slide 11. And as Gerry mentioned, DTE Energy's operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.52 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $1.37 per share. For detailed breakdown",1376,"Thanks, Gerry, and good morning to everyone. I'll just start on Slide 11. And as Gerry mentioned, DTE Energy's operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.52 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $1.37 per share. For detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 29 of the appendix. 
This slide shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by segment. I will start at the top of the page with our 2 utilities. It's important to remember that the first quarter last year was one of the coldest on record. In fact, February of 2015 was the coldest February in the last 50 years. The first quarter of 2016 was actually one of the warmest on record. So primarily driven by weather, earnings for both electric and gas utilities were down quarter-over-quarter. DTE Electric's earnings were $127 million for first quarter this year compared to $136 million last year. Along with weather, DTE Electric's earnings were lower due to the absence of the revenue decoupling mechanism amortization in 2016. This revenue decoupling amortization was part of our strategy that extended the time frame in between rate cases by 4 years. The amortization was offset by the implementation of new rates last July. A further breakdown of DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter results can be found in the appendix on Slide 21. 
For DTE Gas, earnings for the quarter were $87 million compared to $111 million last year. As stated earlier, the significant change in weather was the primary driver of this variance. 
Gas Storage and Pipeline earnings were $30 million for the quarter. Earnings for the quarter were up $3 million over last year due to higher pipeline and gathering earnings from production that came online after the first quarter of 2015. Storage earnings were also higher than last year due to lower maintenance expenses. 
Moving down the slide. Earnings for our Power and Industrial Projects were $21 million for the quarter, down $12 million from the first quarter of last year. This decrease is primarily driven by lower earnings in the steel sector. The seasonal variability is related to the REF volumes and for the balance of the year, the REF will help offset the steel sector decline. 
Earnings for Corporate and Other were negative $7 million for this first quarter of 2016, $18 million favorable over last year due to our first quarter 2015 effective tax rate adjustment, which unwound during the rest of that year. 
So earnings for our Growth segments for the first quarter were $258 million or $1.43 per share compared to $282 million or $1.58 per share last year. 
To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, the first quarter operating earnings were $16 million, up $4 million from the first quarter of last year driven by stronger realized gas portfolio performance. Our trading company is off to another good start. Trading's economic contribution for the first quarter of 2016 was $18 million. Slide 28 of the appendix contains our standard energy trading reconciliations showing both economic and accounting performance. 
We typically wait till the midyear earnings call to assess the trading company's range of accounting income contribution for the year. At that point, we have a good sense of how much accounting income will be flowing through to cover the current year operating expenses. 
Let's move now to Slide 12. Slide 12 provides a quick overview of our capital expenditures through the first quarter of the year. Capital spending was lower than last year, primarily due to the purchasing of a peaking generating asset in 2015. Our CapEx guidance range remains at $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion for 2016. I'll go into more detail on some of our utility capital plans on the next 2 slides. 
Just like turn now to Slide 13. In our electric utility, I want to highlight one of the key areas of focus for our Electric Utility segment, which is improving customer-related distribution reliability. We're making significant investments in our distribution infrastructure to improve reliability and address growth on certain areas of our service territory. 
Over the next 10 years, we'll spend $6.5 billion replacing aging infrastructure and overloaded substations as well as consolidating assisting substations and adding technology and automation to provide greater visibility into the system for outage prevention and detection. 
As we said in the past, this 10-year investment of $6.5 billion of distribution infrastructure can increase up to an additional $4 billion of reliability investments. 
Customer affordability is at the forefront of our planning and will guide and determine how much total distribution in reliability investment we will do in this time frame. 
Now Slide 14. This slide highlights the large component of our investment at DTE Gas, expanded main renewal program. Well, that's $600 million over the next 5 years upgrading the gas system. Our plan to replace 4,000 miles of cast iron and unprotected main steel was accelerated to cut the completion time in half from 50 years to 25 years. The MPSC approved the acceleration of the infrastructure recovery mechanism at the end of last year. Upgrading the gas main system benefits our customers by reducing cost of leaks and assuring the basic gas infrastructure in our service territory is there for future generations. 
As you can see from the previous 2 slides, our CapEx plan will address the needs of our customers and the aging infrastructure while being mindful of customer affordability. 
We've been consistent in our messaging over the last -- over the years that maintaining a strong balance sheet is the priority. So Slide 15 provides a key balance sheet metrics we target and monitor, FFO to debt and leverage. This slide shows the projected level for each metric. 
Our near-term equity issuance plans are $200 million to $300 million over the next 3 years, and we continue to evaluate our equity needs for this year. As we discussed on our year-end call, extension of bonus depreciation provides $300 million to $400 million of favorable cash flow over the next 5 years, which help reduce our equity needs in the near term. 
The strength of our balance sheet sets us up nicely as we enter a period of incremental infrastructure improvements. And we're confident that our plans allow us to maintain this balance sheet strength. 
Let me wrap up on Slide 17, then we can move to Q&A. With a strong first quarter, even with a good amount of unfavorable weather, we are confident that we'll achieve our operating earnings guidance of $4.80 to $5.05 per share, which will extend our streak to 10 consecutive years on meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. We're making significant utility infrastructure improvements that will continue to provide affordable and reliable service to our customers. We have meaningful investment opportunities at our Gas Pipeline segment with our investments in Millennium, Bluestone and the NEXUS pipeline. In our Power and Industrial segment, we have opportunities with building on-site cogeneration projects. 
Going forward, we continue to target operating EPS of 5% to 6% for our growth segments. And part of our shareholder value equation is to continue to grow to our dividends in line with these earnings. We maintain our commitment to a strong balance sheet, which can provide future growth opportunities. 
Before I open up the Q&A, I know many of you in the call have been waiting for my Detroit Tiger update, so I'd like to a quick update to my hometown Detroit Tigers because no DTE earnings call would be complete without it. 
This year definitely started out well for the Tigers. But recently, they've been having some problems with their pitching. The weather for this year's home opener game in Detroit was definitely favorable to our gas utility as it was one of the coldest home openers ever played in Comerica Park. Our fans braved the weather and packed Comerica Park to watch us beat the Yankees, which is our eighth consecutive home opening win. And that was a good day when we beat the Yankees. 
With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So Cynthia, we can open up the lines for questions."

So no, we weren't talking about positioning our trading company. What we really did is just look at the odds the way the El Niño was setting up last summer that we would have a warm winter. And the odds are very high when you look across past the statistical data. So we all looked at ourselves and said, ""Look, if the odds are this high, we're just going to take it as a given and plan for it."" So we did go into our expenses. We went after additional productivity in the business, so we always look for productivity improvements, but we went for more than normal. And that was hard work to put the plan together, but it paid off. And we don't publish our plan or make public our plan, but I do feel really good about the way we exited the quarter in our growth business as relative to the plan we have for the year. And that's why you're hearing a confidential tone on our ability to play out and meet or exceed our guidance for the year. Trading, just comment on that, I mean, they had a really good first quarter.

Will they be in a position to move it before the summer recess or, like in 2008, will it come back after the summer recess and be acted on then? In 2008, just having been part of that, I spent kind of a year in my life involved in that one. The way it played out is actually in that case, the House finished action just prior to the summer recess, and then the Senate came back and acted right after the recess. So we'll wait and see.

So I think we'll have the opportunity to see that part of the P&I business return. That's certainly been our experience over the years in past ups and downs of steel. The most active area for investment, I think Peter mentioned, is cogeneration projects. We have a number of those that are under serious discussion with counterparties. So we'd expect that to be the place where we could put quality capital to work. And we continue to be focused, as we kind of laid out in our 5-year plan, on understanding that the REF earnings roll off in the early 2020s that we would backfill those earnings with quality investments like the cogeneration. And that's the plan for the company in terms of producing the 5% to 6% earnings through 2020 and beyond. So we've done a 10-year plan.

So when Jerry says we feel good, I think we've said it's consistent with the expected and is playing out in a way that supports the plan. And then you look down the road, you're beginning to see gas prices for early next year strengthen. I think they were $3-ish when we're talking about them yesterday. And people keep concluding that drilling has pulled back with gas declines at 15% in the United States. And you can only allow 15% decline before -- only allow that for so long before you need to begin to backfill it. And the most obvious places for Southwestern and other people to begin drilling again is in the Northeast Marcellus and in Utica. And the well quality there is still high. So our expectation is when we pushed up gas supplies in the country awfully hard in 2015, people are in a pause, but they're going to -- we're going to need to step back into it. When they do, we expect it to be in the areas we have exposure to."

The future, we've consistently said that we're trying to keep rate increases in the range of inflation, so around 3% as you work your way through one of these intense capital investment cycles. And that's going to require us to both measure the pace of capital investment, but also keep the focus on productivity and continuous improvement that we've had in order to do that. So you know what the blend of capital on O&M is. We got to keep the O&M -- our O&M in recent years, the increase has been 0. And when you can blend the 0 with the increase that come from capital, you can hold it to something reasonable. Now we can't commit the 0 in the future, but we've worked in the past very, very high to keep there, the future. That's unlikely. You can't continue that forever. But we'll work hard on C&I and we will continue to measure the pace of investment.

I think in terms of more long haul, we are in discussions with several parties to sign up for more long hauls.

We're expanding Bluestone and we're expanding Millennium. And I think the prospects we see are from more of that. So there's -- you were mentioning cancelation of a pipeline. What we're seeing in the Northeast is a continued pull for gas. They have to have gas for power generation, and the oil to gas conversions continue. So the demand for gas continues to be very, very strong. But there's a real resistance in New York and in other areas of the Northeast to new pipelines. I think that's what that's likely to do. In fact, New York called us out explicitly, is biased towards expansions of existing pipes. So I think the likelihood of some of this resistance you're seeing is that owners of existing positions, including Millennium and Bluestone, will see people coming to them as the most credible and doable pads and expansion pads to market. So I'll just start by saying that I think what we're seeing evolving in the market is a positive for the asset position we have there. Bluestone and Millennium are attached to really good geology and there's resistance in the market to creating new outlets, altogether new outlets, for that geology, which means the existing ones are going to have to expand. And then the long-term growth, NEXUS is an important part of that growth. But when we look out 5 years and ask what is the current dynamic in 2016 really mean for 2020, not much. The gas demand in 2020 is going to be what it's going to be. And power generation conversions are going to be underway. And so the geology is going to have to deliver it, the pipes are going to have to deliver it. Now I think that you could say in the short term ""Did production get out in front of itself a bit with a lot of excitement in the market?"" The answer to that is obviously yes. So there's an adjustment in the near term and it's changed the path to get to 2020. But the ultimate point that the market needs to achieve in 2020 hasn't changed for either production or delivery through pipes to meet demand. So we really don't see a lot of impact long term, although the path to get there has changed from what it might have been."

So in order for us to do more of that, to kind of work our way into that backlog, it would depend on us finding productivity opportunities or if there were things, for example, that evolved on the generation side that were -- required less capital, we could conceivably push some of this needed investment in. But we are kind of calibrating how much of that we do based upon affordability because we've consistently said that companies that don't pay careful attention to that when they're going through a big investment cycle end up losing. You just need to go through these cycles in a way where your customers feel their affordability is workable. So that's really what determines how much of the $10.5 billion we would spend versus the $6.5 billion. And you're right, if we can find either capital offsets or productivity offsets. Those are the things that will enable us to do more of that needed investment."

And then secondly, we secured the last 2 compressor expansions for Millennium through FERC as well as working with New York regulators. So I think what we're -- as Gerry described earlier, I think the regulators are pointing towards existing assets as ways to expand into a growing market. So as you know, we've got a Millennium Pipeline expansion where we've made a FERC refiling, and that's going well. We are in active conversations with regulators in Albany on that expansion and we feel that those conversations are going well.

I should take just a minute and recognize that this is Jerry Norcia's first time on this call as President and COO. Jerry was promoted into that position early in April. I think many of you know Jerry or met him on visits, but Jerry, just a brief history, came in as President of our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, and really helped to build that business, then took over as President of our Gas Utility, along with his role at GSP, most recently was President of our electric operations, and then as I mentioned, moved into his role as President and COO just about a month ago. 
Well, I am going to start the discussion today with an overview of our results in the first quarter as well as a number of key developments at the company. Then I'll turn things over to Peter to give you a financial update and then, we will wrap up and take your questions. 
So moving on to Slide 5. We continue to make good progress on a number of fronts. With 1 quarter behind us in 2016, I feel very good about our year-to-date financial results and our ability to deliver or exceed our full year guidance. 
Energy legislation continues to move forward in Lansing. In fact, this is a key week, as it turns out, and I will describe that in a minute. 
And our NEXUS gas pipeline project continued to move forward toward its 2017 in-service date. And I will give you an update on progress on that front in a few minutes as well. 
So concerning our financial performance, moving on to Slide 6. As I mentioned, we're off to a very good start. We delivered first quarter operating earnings of $1.52, which I feel great about relative to our plan for the year. We came into 2016 expecting a warm winter. We're talking about that prior to the call. We started last July planning for El Niño. So we came into the year with a plan expecting a standard deviation or more warmer this winter, and it came. But we came out of the first quarter in great shape. So that all worked out fine. And given that, we're on track to deliver our earnings guidance and another year of earnings growth. And assuming that we do that, 2016 will be our 10th consecutive year of meeting or beating our earnings targets. 
As you know, we've also been growing our dividend in parallel with earnings, and we have every intention to continue that. And our balance sheet continues to be in great shape. In fact, Fitch, back in February upgraded us. 
So bottom line, as we head into the second quarter, I feel great about our financial position. 
Moving on to Slide 7. As I said earlier, energy legislation continues to progress in Lansing. The current regulatory construct in Michigan was established by a legislation passed back in 2008. And the key provisions of that legislation and our current construct are laid out at the top of the slide. And those provisions have and continue to serve the State of Michigan very well. But in preparation for a significant investment in new generation assets in our state, as we retire older assets, we've been working on an update to the 2008 legislation over the past year. And this week, Senator Mike Nofs, who's Chairman of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, will introduce his substitute bills and take testimony from a range of key stakeholders. In fact, I'm going to be up in Lansing on Thursday testifying. The legislation that Senator Nofs has fashioned has a number of key features, so it establishes firm capacity requirements for all electricity providers in Michigan, but in particular, establishes requirements for the first time for the retail open access suppliers or choice suppliers. That's a key reliability provision as the state moves in to retiring and rebuilding generation. That 10% of the market needs to be planned for and that's what the legislation is targeting. 
The legislation also sets up an IRP, or Integrated Resource Planning Process, that will enable long-term resource planning and will establish a process for investment preapproval. And then finally, the legislation establishes incentives for energy efficiency investment and it enables decoupling related to energy efficiency, and it makes it possible for utilities to apply for broader decoupling to the Public Service Commission as well. 
So Senator Nofs expects to work these bills hard this week and the following week. And then we'll move them out of committee for a vote on the Senate floor when it feels the time is right for that. And then we expect that this legislation will become -- will move over to the House and become the basis for discussions and action there. 
So we also to continue to make progress on our NEXUS Pipeline project. And Slide 8 provides a summary update of that activity. As the left-hand side of the slide shows, NEXUS originates, and arguably the best dry gas geology in the country in the Utica Shale. And it then runs north and west across Northern Ohio where there are numerous opportunities to interconnect with  LDC, power plant and industrial loads. And then the pipe heads north to interconnect with the Vector pipeline in Michigan, which ties it to a very large gas storage complex in Michigan and in Ontario. And Vector also enables it to serve LDCs in Ontario, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin and other Midwest states. 
So NEXUS remains on track to be placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2017. Couple of noteworthy first quarter accomplishments for NEXUS are listed on the right-hand side of the slide. As I mentioned, the pipe runs across Northern Ohio. And during the first quarter, we increased our interconnect agreements along that stretch from 1.4 Bcf per day to 1.75 Bcf per day. And these interconnect agreements represent great future market activities for NEXUS, which is a 1.5 Bcf design pipe. 
We also ordered compressors for the pipe in the first quarter, so both the steel, the pipe, and the compression for the project are on order. And finally, we continued to advance our work with FERC, and that's going well. And we continue to expect our FERC notice of schedule here during the second quarter. 
So before I hand things over to Peter for a financial update, I want to summarize on Slide 9. So we have, for years, talked to investors about delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings per share growth with high reliability and consistency and pairing that with healthy dividend growth. And on the right-hand side of the slide, in the ovals, you can see that our actual EPS growth in recent years has been 6.5%. And we have grown the dividend at just above 5.5%. And given our start to 2016 in the first quarter, as I said earlier, I feel really good about our ability to continue that pattern over the course of this year. 
So that said, Peter, over to you."

For detailed breakdown",1376,"Thanks, Gerry, and good morning to everyone. I'll just start on Slide 11. And as Gerry mentioned, DTE Energy's operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.52 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $1.37 per share. For detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 29 of the appendix. 
This slide shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by segment. I will start at the top of the page with our 2 utilities. It's important to remember that the first quarter last year was one of the coldest on record. In fact, February of 2015 was the coldest February in the last 50 years. The first quarter of 2016 was actually one of the warmest on record. So primarily driven by weather, earnings for both electric and gas utilities were down quarter-over-quarter. DTE Electric's earnings were $127 million for first quarter this year compared to $136 million last year. Along with weather, DTE Electric's earnings were lower due to the absence of the revenue decoupling mechanism amortization in 2016. This revenue decoupling amortization was part of our strategy that extended the time frame in between rate cases by 4 years. The amortization was offset by the implementation of new rates last July. A further breakdown of DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter results can be found in the appendix on Slide 21. 
For DTE Gas, earnings for the quarter were $87 million compared to $111 million last year. As stated earlier, the significant change in weather was the primary driver of this variance. 
Gas Storage and Pipeline earnings were $30 million for the quarter. Earnings for the quarter were up $3 million over last year due to higher pipeline and gathering earnings from production that came online after the first quarter of 2015. Storage earnings were also higher than last year due to lower maintenance expenses. 
Moving down the slide. Earnings for our Power and Industrial Projects were $21 million for the quarter, down $12 million from the first quarter of last year. This decrease is primarily driven by lower earnings in the steel sector. The seasonal variability is related to the REF volumes and for the balance of the year, the REF will help offset the steel sector decline. 
Earnings for Corporate and Other were negative $7 million for this first quarter of 2016, $18 million favorable over last year due to our first quarter 2015 effective tax rate adjustment, which unwound during the rest of that year. 
So earnings for our Growth segments for the first quarter were $258 million or $1.43 per share compared to $282 million or $1.58 per share last year. 
To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, the first quarter operating earnings were $16 million, up $4 million from the first quarter of last year driven by stronger realized gas portfolio performance. Our trading company is off to another good start. Trading's economic contribution for the first quarter of 2016 was $18 million. Slide 28 of the appendix contains our standard energy trading reconciliations showing both economic and accounting performance. 
We typically wait till the midyear earnings call to assess the trading company's range of accounting income contribution for the year. At that point, we have a good sense of how much accounting income will be flowing through to cover the current year operating expenses. 
Let's move now to Slide 12. Slide 12 provides a quick overview of our capital expenditures through the first quarter of the year. Capital spending was lower than last year, primarily due to the purchasing of a peaking generating asset in 2015. Our CapEx guidance range remains at $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion for 2016. I'll go into more detail on some of our utility capital plans on the next 2 slides. 
Just like turn now to Slide 13. In our electric utility, I want to highlight one of the key areas of focus for our Electric Utility segment, which is improving customer-related distribution reliability. We're making significant investments in our distribution infrastructure to improve reliability and address growth on certain areas of our service territory. 
Over the next 10 years, we'll spend $6.5 billion replacing aging infrastructure and overloaded substations as well as consolidating assisting substations and adding technology and automation to provide greater visibility into the system for outage prevention and detection. 
As we said in the past, this 10-year investment of $6.5 billion of distribution infrastructure can increase up to an additional $4 billion of reliability investments. 
Customer affordability is at the forefront of our planning and will guide and determine how much total distribution in reliability investment we will do in this time frame. 
Now Slide 14. This slide highlights the large component of our investment at DTE Gas, expanded main renewal program. Well, that's $600 million over the next 5 years upgrading the gas system. Our plan to replace 4,000 miles of cast iron and unprotected main steel was accelerated to cut the completion time in half from 50 years to 25 years. The MPSC approved the acceleration of the infrastructure recovery mechanism at the end of last year. Upgrading the gas main system benefits our customers by reducing cost of leaks and assuring the basic gas infrastructure in our service territory is there for future generations. 
As you can see from the previous 2 slides, our CapEx plan will address the needs of our customers and the aging infrastructure while being mindful of customer affordability. 
We've been consistent in our messaging over the last -- over the years that maintaining a strong balance sheet is the priority. So Slide 15 provides a key balance sheet metrics we target and monitor, FFO to debt and leverage. This slide shows the projected level for each metric. 
Our near-term equity issuance plans are $200 million to $300 million over the next 3 years, and we continue to evaluate our equity needs for this year. As we discussed on our year-end call, extension of bonus depreciation provides $300 million to $400 million of favorable cash flow over the next 5 years, which help reduce our equity needs in the near term. 
The strength of our balance sheet sets us up nicely as we enter a period of incremental infrastructure improvements. And we're confident that our plans allow us to maintain this balance sheet strength. 
Let me wrap up on Slide 17, then we can move to Q&A. With a strong first quarter, even with a good amount of unfavorable weather, we are confident that we'll achieve our operating earnings guidance of $4.80 to $5.05 per share, which will extend our streak to 10 consecutive years on meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. We're making significant utility infrastructure improvements that will continue to provide affordable and reliable service to our customers. We have meaningful investment opportunities at our Gas Pipeline segment with our investments in Millennium, Bluestone and the NEXUS pipeline. In our Power and Industrial segment, we have opportunities with building on-site cogeneration projects. 
Going forward, we continue to target operating EPS of 5% to 6% for our growth segments. And part of our shareholder value equation is to continue to grow to our dividends in line with these earnings. We maintain our commitment to a strong balance sheet, which can provide future growth opportunities. 
Before I open up the Q&A, I know many of you in the call have been waiting for my Detroit Tiger update, so I'd like to a quick update to my hometown Detroit Tigers because no DTE earnings call would be complete without it. 
This year definitely started out well for the Tigers. But recently, they've been having some problems with their pitching. The weather for this year's home opener game in Detroit was definitely favorable to our gas utility as it was one of the coldest home openers ever played in Comerica Park. Our fans braved the weather and packed Comerica Park to watch us beat the Yankees, which is our eighth consecutive home opening win. And that was a good day when we beat the Yankees. 
With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So Cynthia, we can open up the lines for questions."

We went after additional productivity in the business, so we always look for productivity improvements, but we went for more than normal. And that was hard work to put the plan together, but it paid off. And we don't publish our plan or make public our plan, but I do feel really good about the way we exited the quarter in our growth business as relative to the plan we have for the year. And that's why you're hearing a confidential tone on our ability to play out and meet or exceed our guidance for the year. Trading, just comment on that, I mean, they had a really good first quarter. As Peter said, we usually wait until midyear to  kind of give you a better sense. So we'll, probably on our midyear call, update you on those earnings and then give you probably a conservative forecast of where we think trading will land through the year."

And then we'll -- that legislation will be pushed back over to the House. Another question in the House is how quickly can it move there. Will they be in a position to move it before the summer recess or, like in 2008, will it come back after the summer recess and be acted on then? In 2008, just having been part of that, I spent kind of a year in my life involved in that one. The way it played out is actually in that case, the House finished action just prior to the summer recess, and then the Senate came back and acted right after the recess. So we'll wait and see.

The most active area for investment, I think Peter mentioned, is cogeneration projects. We have a number of those that are under serious discussion with counterparties. So we'd expect that to be the place where we could put quality capital to work. And we continue to be focused, as we kind of laid out in our 5-year plan, on understanding that the REF earnings roll off in the early 2020s that we would backfill those earnings with quality investments like the cogeneration. And that's the plan for the company in terms of producing the 5% to 6% earnings through 2020 and beyond. So we've done a 10-year plan.

And you can only allow 15% decline before -- only allow that for so long before you need to begin to backfill it. And the most obvious places for Southwestern and other people to begin drilling again is in the Northeast Marcellus and in Utica. And the well quality there is still high.

We're expanding Bluestone and we're expanding Millennium. And I think the prospects we see are from more of that. So there's -- you were mentioning cancelation of a pipeline. What we're seeing in the Northeast is a continued pull for gas. They have to have gas for power generation, and the oil to gas conversions continue. So the demand for gas continues to be very, very strong. But there's a real resistance in New York and in other areas of the Northeast to new pipelines. I think that's what that's likely to do. In fact, New York called us out explicitly, is biased towards expansions of existing pipes. So I think the likelihood of some of this resistance you're seeing is that owners of existing positions, including Millennium and Bluestone, will see people coming to them as the most credible and doable pads and expansion pads to market. So I'll just start by saying that I think what we're seeing evolving in the market is a positive for the asset position we have there. Bluestone and Millennium are attached to really good geology and there's resistance in the market to creating new outlets, altogether new outlets, for that geology, which means the existing ones are going to have to expand. And then the long-term growth, NEXUS is an important part of that growth. But when we look out 5 years and ask what is the current dynamic in 2016 really mean for 2020, not much. The gas demand in 2020 is going to be what it's going to be. And power generation conversions are going to be underway. And so the geology is going to have to deliver it, the pipes are going to have to deliver it. Now I think that you could say in the short term ""Did production get out in front of itself a bit with a lot of excitement in the market?"" The answer to that is obviously yes. So there's an adjustment in the near term and it's changed the path to get to 2020. But the ultimate point that the market needs to achieve in 2020 hasn't changed for either production or delivery through pipes to meet demand. So we really don't see a lot of impact long term, although the path to get there has changed from what it might have been."

But we are kind of calibrating how much of that we do based upon affordability because we've consistently said that companies that don't pay careful attention to that when they're going through a big investment cycle end up losing. You just need to go through these cycles in a way where your customers feel their affordability is workable. So that's really what determines how much of the $10.5 billion we would spend versus the $6.5 billion. And you're right, if we can find either capital offsets or productivity offsets.

And then I'm going to turn things over to Peter for a financial update, then we'll wrap up and take some Q&A.
So moving on to Slide 5. We continue to make good progress on a number of fronts of this year. So with a successful first stamp of year under our belts, I feel really good about our year-to-date financial results. And based upon those strong results, we're increasing our operating earnings, we'll talk about a bit more about that in a minute. We also recently increased our dividend for the seventh consecutive year, which continues to be over 100-year history of issuing dividends at the company.
Rachel Eubanks [ph] was appointed by Governor Snyder to serve the remainder of John [indiscernible] 6-year term that expires about a year now -- a year from now, July 2, 2017. Her experience is in the area of finance, so it includes project finance, municipal bond refinancings, credit enhanced financing, variables and transactions and so forth. She also, over her career, has provided investment banking support on financial advisory and investment engagements for state government, government authorities, municipalities and nonprofit organizations. So as we look forward in Michigan to a really heavy period of investment and our infrastructure, I think that her understanding of finance will be a good complement to the skills of the current commissioners, we certainly will have somebody there who understands cash flows, balance sheet issues and so forth at the company that goes through a heavy investment period.
Thanks to the hard work of our employees. For the third consecutive year, DTE was ranked second and the Midwest by J.D. Power in overall electric residential customer satisfaction, that's in the large utility category. And this was our sixth consecutive year of being in the top quartile of that survey. We also achieved our best safety record in the company's history in the first 6 months, and that was by a wide margin, which I'm particularly proud of, I think it says something about where our employees heads are. And if we can keep this performance, we may just be the safest company in the industry this year. And earlier this year, we won our fourth consecutive Gallup place award, and our results placed us in the top 12% of the companies worldwide in terms of employee engagement.
On the NEXUS front, that pipeline continues to progress. The project reached another important regulatory milestone, which sets us up nicely. We can meet our [indiscernible] late next year, so I'll talk a bit more about NEXUS and those developments in a few minutes.
Now I'll move on to Slide 6, and give you some color on our second quarter financial results. So in the second quarter, we build upon what were really positive first quarter results. We delivered second quarter earnings per share of $0.98, which we're actually great about. As you know, we came into this year expecting warm weather. We planned for it and that play through in our first quarter results. And we, based in the first and second quarters, come out of the first half of the year, very well-positioned and we now have the potential to reinvest some of the weather-related favorability that may occur in the third quarter. We're seeing a hot July and there's a warm August projected as well. So given the strong results for the first half of year, we're increasing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.12, from $4.93 to $5.05. And given that, we now have a solid path to achieving our 10th consecutive year of meeting or beating our earnings targets.
We've also been growing our dividend, along with earnings, and we just recently increased the dividend by $0.16 a share and our balance sheet continue to be in great shape. So bottom line, I feel really good about our finance position as we head into the second half of 2016.
So moving on to Slide 7 for a little more color on earnings and dividends. We talked for years to investors about delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings per share growth and appearing that with healthy dividend growth. Now on the right-hand side of the slide in ovals, you can see that our actual earnings per share growth over the past 5 years or so, has been 6.5%. So really 1% above that 5% to 6%. And we have grown our dividends at 5% to 6% rate.
I also mentioned a minute ago that we're increasing guidance from a midpoint of 4 93 to 5 0 5.  Fundamentally, this is driven by a strong performance in our electric business and in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business as well as very solid first half in our Energy Trading operations. As I stated the minute ago and keeping with the commitment to growing dividends with earnings, we increased our dividend per share from $2.92 to $3.08, which was a 5.5% increase.
Now I'll move on to Slide 8 now and discuss the significant development related to our powerplant fleet that occurred in the second quarter. So in June, we announced closure plans for 8 coal-fired generating units. And this is announcement, combined with our decision to cease operation in 3 coal-fired plants, which happened in April, means that we will replace 11 aging coal-fired generation units at 3 sites, totaling 2.5 gigawatts on or before 2023. Much of this coal-based slow generation will be a replaced with natural gas generation, but we also intend to continue to invest in wind and solar to ensure we keep the mix in our portfolio that we want. This portion of what is a longer-term transition plan for our fleet will require about $3 billion investment.
By 2030, we'd expect to retire an additional gigawatt of coal-fired generation, which would bring total retirements to 3.5 gigawatts. And in doing that, our reliance on coal would decline by about 60%, and we'd expect to roughly double our current 10% renewable capacity and to use more gas fire generation in a base load role.
Obviously, emissions through 2030 will be down fundamentally as well. So CO2, we project, would be down about 40% versus 2005 levels and our conventional emissions would be down sharply as well.
Moving on to Slide 9. NEXUS continues to move forward and make good progress. So NEXUS received its schedule on May 17th of this year. The project also recently received a favorable draft environmental impact report or EIS, from the [indiscernible] . We expect the final EIS by the end of November and that would allow for a certificate of construction by the end of February of 2017, which would set us up nicely for the November and service date next year. We are progressing on a right-of-way acquisition and detailed engineering plans and we continue to work constructively with Ferc and other regulatory agencies.
In addition, in June, we received a letter of support for the NEXUS projects from the Michigan Agency for Energy, so the Michigan Agency fior Energy takes the lead on energy policy for the administration. We also received a letter support from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which is the state's primary economic development agency. In addition, a recent Michigan Public service commission staff brief our electric power cover a case, that's our fuel plus case, stated I quote, ""staff believes that DTE Electric NEXUS Pipeline project is reasonable as proposed in DTE Electric's application, it's testimony and this exhibits in this case."" So we are gratified to have staff weigh in and say, ""I think this project would benefit customers and benefit the state."" In addition, we had letters of support offered by both Senator Knobs and Representative Nesbit, they are the chairs in House energy committee so there's a lot of support in the state of Michigan for this pipeline moving forward.
So that we really believe in the fundamentals of this pipe, it serves arguably the best dry gas production geology and country. I can ask that geology directly to growing markets in Michigan and Ontario, and [indiscernible] pipeline connects into Chicago and Wisconsin as well. The pipe also connects directly to the largest collection of market area storage in the country in Michigan and in the Western Ontario. The pipe has 3 strong utility sponsors, and up to 1.75 BCF of signed interconnect agreements in Northern Ohio and the pipe remains on schedule even as many other by pipes serving the Utica region struggle with delays. And given this, we can do to think that NEXUS is going to be a valuable addition to our guest or pipeline portfolio.
And with that, I'm going to turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to cover our financial results in more detail. So Peter, over to you"
266598,374052653,1011852,"DTE Energy Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Gerry. Good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 11. Gerry mentioned DTE's operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.98 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $0.84 per share. For a detailed breakdown EPS by segm",1499,"Thanks, Gerry. Good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 11. Gerry mentioned DTE's operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.98 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $0.84 per share. For a detailed breakdown EPS by segment including a record solution to GAAP reported earnings, please refer to slide 24 and the appendix.
Slide 11 shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by segment. Starting at the top of with the 2 utilities. We experienced usually -- unusual weather this quarter, which gave a boost to both utilities. Now April was colder than normal while May and June were warmer than normal. [indiscernible] unusual weather in the quarter create a both heating and cooling load causing earnings to both utilities to be up quarter-over-quarter.
DTE Electric's earnings were $135 million for the second quarter this year compared to $111 million last year. I'm studying the weather in last year's rate case DTE Electric's earnings were lower due to the absence of a revenue decoupling mechanism amortization in 2016. You may recall, this revenue decoupling amortization was part of our strategy that extended the timeframe in between rate cases by 4 years. We've increased guidance in both segments given the warm weather through June. And for the breakdown DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter results can be found on Slide 19.
For DTE Gas earnings for the second quarter were up $13 million compared to a loss of $7 million last year. The [indiscernible] was due to cooler weather and April of this year, increased revenue related to our infrastructure replacement program and planned initiatives in response of the warm weather we experienced in the first quarter.
As we discussed in our first quarter call, we went into the year anticipating warmer-than-normal weather for the winter and we planned for it. With this advanced planning, we were able to stay on track to meet guidance.
Moving down the page, Gas Storage and Pipelines earnings were $35 million for the quarter. Earnings for the quarter were up $10 million over last year due to higher pipeline and gathering earnings from production that came online in the second half of 2015. We continue to see strength in the segment even in current conditions. We've adjusted the midpoint of guidance upwards with segments, which I'll discuss in a minute.
Moving further down the slide, earnings for our Power and Industrial Projects were $17 million for the quarter, down $1 million from the second quarter last year. This decrease is primarily driven by lower earnings in the fuel sector, offset by variable volumes from additional projects that came online in the fourth quarter of last year.
Earnings for cover and other were negative $23 million for the second quarter of this year, $10 million favorable over last year due to the timing off axis.
So earnings were $177 million for a gross segment for the second quarter or $0.98 per share compared to $134 million or $0.75 per share last year.
To round out our operating earnings, we indlude the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, the accounting earnings were 0, down $3 million from the second quarter last year, driven by lower realized power performance. Trading's economic contribution for the second quarter of 2016 was $12 million. Trading is having another stong economic year, actually $30 million year-to-date, economic contributions. A portion of the year-to-date economic performance would flow to the total year operating income results. I will talk more in a minute on the new guidance for our trading segment. By [ph] 22, the appendix campaign's our standard Energy Trading reconciliation, shown on both on economic and accounting performance.
Let me now turn to Slide 12 in the EPS guidance for the year. [indiscernible] as been mentioned at the start of the call based in our financial results in the first half of the year, we are increasing our midpoint of the 2016 EPS cents [ph] by $0.12 from $4.93 to $5.05 for DTE Energy. Our EPS guidance range for DTE Energy is now $4.91 to $5.19. And $4.85 to $5.08 for our growth segments. Our guidance increase for our gross segments is driven by strong start to the year at our DTE Electric and Gas, Storage and Pipeline segments. The warmer-than-normal continues with be the remainder of the summer. We will initiate and invest plan at our DTE Electric to put the incremental revenue in cash back in the customer-centric assets and activities.
For our GSP segment, the new drilling plans to Southwestern announced last week in the Blue storm region may provide outside to 2016 and set us up nicely for 2017. Operating earnings guidance for these segments increased from a midpoint of 5 92 to 5 97 at DTE Electric and $110 million to $113 million at our Gas, Storage and Pipeline segment.
As I just mentioned on our prior page, our DTE Energy business is off to a strong economic start. We have raised our earnings guidance from 0 to a range of $10 million to $20 million up for this year. Energy Trading is not part of our growth segment and we let the business be opportunistic versus setting the sign of operating earnings targets. So we conservatively set the original guidance at 0 then typically update earnings guidance as we said to result for the first 2 quarters and to recover our operating cost. Given the strong results in the first half of this year, we are increasing the guidance for Energy Trading, we'll give another balance of that in the third quarter based on economic results for the first 3 quarters.
Moving on to Slide 13. In addition, [indiscernible] earnings results for the year, our balance sheet remains strong and we'll continue to provide the foundation for our long term growth plans. This slide lays out a cash flow and CapEx to the first half of the year. Cash from operations was $1.3 billion. I saw a strong performance across several business units, which is driving the increase over the same period last year and puts us a little ahead of our plan this year. We invested $1 billion of CapEx to the second quarter. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business units.
DTE Electric's CapEx decreased was due to the timing of operational investment and lower new generation of spend with the acquisition of large gas back in the first quarter of 2015. The 9 [ph] utilities are higher than last year, driven by the timing of projects but particularly, our Gas, Storage and pipeline segment.
The fund is CapEx program and refinanced the [indiscernible] debt we have issued, $600 million of long-term debt financing this year. They've been consistent in our messaging that maintaining a strong balance sheet is the priority.
Slide 14 provides the key balance sheet metrics we target and monitor, which is FFO to debt and leverage. This slide shows the projected level for each metric.
Our 2016 financing plan is on track and we plan to issue up to $100 million of equity this year. However, given the strength of the cash flows we've experienced to date, we are looking at the possibility of differing equity issuance in the next 2 years. A 3-year projected equity needs remain at the $200 million to $300 million, which is just a small fraction of the total capital spend at the [indiscernible] timeframe.
Our disciplined approach to maintaining a strong balance sheet across the years has proven to be valuable. It sets up nicely as we enter a period of incremental infrastructure improvements and investment set of utilities and funding the growth plans that are non-utility businesses.
Let me wrap up on Slide 16 and then again move to questions and answers. We've had a very good quarter as well as the first half of the year. We were able to raise our EPS guidance, setting up nicely to send our streak to 10 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. This will be the seventh consecutive year that we've increased our dividends. This quarter, we announced [indiscernible] and retirements that will bring cleaner energy to our customers and considerable investments to our electric utility, maintaining a strong balance sheet will allow us to invest in the utilities and pursue growth opportunities at our non-utility businesses.
Before I open up the Q&A, our call will not be complete without a quick update on my hometown Detroit Tigers. Now this -- the good news is that we won 50 games so far this year. The bad news is that we bought about as many games as well. Justing [indiscernible] looking better recently as she won last night in Boston [indiscernible] need to heat up, of course, they have a chance. A lot of seasons left on remaining optimistic.
With that, I like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. Also Steffie, you can open lines up for questions"

And then I think everybody will last the election and see what the election dynamics mean for the Michigan legislator with the possibility that we would pick back up and pass legislation in the lane session at the end of the year. So legislation is going the pass this year would be in the line deck. Well, I guess, I'll keep in mind an approach that this is not so much a financial discussion. In fact, it's not a financial discussion, it really doesn't affect our 5-year plan, but it is an energy reliability discussion. And at some point or another, we need to get -- we need to be clear on who's building powerplants for 10% of the market. And right now, the answer is nobody.

And based upon those strong results, we're increasing our operating earnings per share guidance. We'll talk a bit about more of that -- more about that in a minute. We also recently increased our dividend for the seventh consecutive year, which continues the over 100-year history of issuing dividends at the company.
Rachael Eubanks was appointed by Governor Snyder to serve the remainder of John Quackenbush's 6-year term that expires about a year now -- a year from now, July 2, 2017. Her experience is in the area of finance, so it includes project finance, municipal bond refinancings, credit enhanced financing, variable and auction-rate transactions and so forth. She also, over her career, has provided investment banking support on financial advisory and investment engagements for state government, government authorities, municipalities and nonprofit organizations. So as we look forward in Michigan to a really heavy period of investment in our infrastructure, I think that her understanding of finance will be a good complement to the skills of the current commissioners. We certainly will have somebody there who understands cash flows, balance sheet issues and so forth as the company goes through a heavy investment period.
Thanks to the hard work of our employees, for the third consecutive year, DTE was ranked second in the Midwest by J.D. Power in overall electric residential customer satisfaction. That's in the large utility category. And this was our sixth consecutive year of being in the top quartile of that survey. We also achieved our best safety record in the company's history in the first 6 months, and that was by a wide margin, which I'm particularly proud of. I think it says something about where our employees' heads are. And if we can keep this performance, we may just be the safest company in the industry this year. And earlier this year, we won our fourth consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award, and our results placed us in the top 12% of companies worldwide in terms of employee engagement.
On the NEXUS front, that pipeline continues to progress. The project reached another important regulatory milestone, which sets us up nicely to meet our in-service date late next year. So I'll talk a bit more about NEXUS and those developments in a few minutes.
Now I'll move on to Slide 6 and give you some color on our second quarter financial results. So in the second quarter, we build upon what were really positive first quarter results. We delivered second quarter earnings per share of $0.98, which I feel great about. As you know, we came into this year expecting warm weather. We planned for it, and that played through in our first quarter results. And we, based on the first and second quarters, come out of the first half of the year very well positioned, and we now have the potential to reinvest some of the weather-related favorability that may occur in the third quarter. We're seeing a hot July, and there's a warm August projected as well. So given the strong results of the first half of the year, we're increasing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.12, from $4.93 to $5.05. And given that, we now have a solid path to achieving our 10th consecutive year of meeting or beating our earnings targets.
We've also been growing our dividend, along with earnings, and we just recently increased the dividend by $0.16 a share, and our balance sheet continues to be in great shape. So bottom line, I feel really good about our finance position as we head into the second half of 2016.
So moving on to Slide 7 for a little more color on earnings and dividend. We've talked for years to investors about delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings per share growth and then pairing that with healthy dividend growth. And on the right-hand side of the slide in the ovals, you can see that our actual earnings per share growth over the past 5 years or so has been 6.5%. So really 1% above that 5% to 6%. And we have grown our dividends at 5% to 6% rate.
I also mentioned a minute ago that we're increasing guidance from a midpoint of $4.93 to $5.05.  Fundamentally, this is driven by a strong performance in our electric business and in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business as well as a very solid first half in our Energy Trading operations. As I stated a minute ago and keeping with the commitment to grow dividends with earnings, we increased our dividend per share from $2.92 to $3.08, which was a 5.5% increase.
So I'm going to move on to Slide 8 now and discuss a significant development related to our powerplant fleet that occurred in the second quarter. So in June, we announced closure plans for 8 coal-fired generating units. And this announcement, combined with our decision to cease operation at 3 coal-fired plants, which happened in April, means that we will replace 11 aging coal-fired generation units at 3 sites, totaling 2.5 gigawatts on or before 2023. Much of this coal-based slow generation will be replaced with natural gas generation, but we also intend to continue to invest in wind and solar to ensure that we keep the mix in our portfolio that we want. This portion of what is a longer-term transition plan for our fleet will require about $3 billion of investment.
By 2030, we'd expect to retire an additional gigawatt of coal-fired generation, which would bring total retirements to 3.5 gigawatts. And in doing that, our reliance on coal would decline by about 60%, and we'd expect to roughly double our current 10% renewable capacity and to use more gas-fired generation in a base load role [ph].
Obviously, emissions through 2030 will be down fundamentally as well. So CO2, we project, would be down about 40% versus 2005 levels, and our conventional emissions would be down sharply as well.
Moving on to Slide 9. NEXUS continues to move forward and make good progress. So NEXUS received its FERC Notice of Schedule on May 17 of this year. The project also recently received a favorable draft environmental impact report, or EIS, from the FERC. We expect the final EIS by the end of November, and that would allow for a certificate of construction by the end of February of 2017, which would set us up nicely for the November in-service date next year. We're progressing on right-of-way acquisitions and detailed engineering plans, and we continue to work constructively with FERC and other regulatory agencies.
In addition, in June, we received a letter of support for the NEXUS project from the Michigan Agency for Energy, so the Michigan Agency for Energy takes the lead on energy policy for the administration. We also received a letter support from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which is the state's primary economic development agency. In addition, a recent Michigan Public Service Commission staff brief on our electric power cost recovery case, that's our fuel clause case, stated, and I quote, ""staff believes that DTE Electric's participation in the NEXUS Pipeline project is reasonable as proposed in DTE Electric's application, its testimony and its exhibits in this case."" So we were gratified to have staff weigh in saying they think this project would benefit customers and benefit the state. In addition, we had letters of support offered by both Senator Nofs and Representative Nesbitt. They are the chairs of the Senate and House energy committees. So there's a lot of support in the state of Michigan for this pipeline moving forward.
So look, we really believe in the fundamentals of this pipe. It serves arguably the best dry gas production geology in the country. It connects that geology directly to growing markets in Michigan and Ontario. And then via our Vector Pipeline, it connects into Chicago and Wisconsin as well. The pipe also connects directly to the largest collection of market area storage in the country in Michigan and in Western Ontario. The pipe has 3 strong utility sponsors and up to 1.75 BCF of signed interconnect agreements in Northern Ohio and the pipe remains on schedule even as many other by pipes serving the Utica region struggle with delays. And given this, we continue to think that NEXUS is going to be a valuable addition to our Gas Storage and Pipelines portfolio.
And with that, I am going to turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to cover our financial results in more details. Peter, over to you"
266598,374052653,1012496,"DTE Energy Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Gerry, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 11. Gerry mentioned DTE's operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.98 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $0.84 per share. For a detailed breakdown of EPS",1512,"Thanks, Gerry, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 11. Gerry mentioned DTE's operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.98 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $0.84 per share. For a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 24 in the appendix.
Slide 11 shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by segment. Starting at the top of the page with the 2 utilities, we experienced unusually -- unusual weather this quarter, which gave a boost to both utilities. April was colder than normal, while May and June were warmer than normal. And this unusual weather in the quarter created both heating and cooling load, causing earnings at both utilities to be up quarter-over-quarter.
DTE Electric's earnings were $135 million for the second quarter this year compared to $111 million last year. Studying the weather in last year's rate case, DTE Electric's earnings were lower due to the absence of the revenue decoupling mechanism amortization in 2016. As you may recall, this revenue decoupling amortization was part of our strategy that extended the time frame in between rate cases by 4 years. We have increased guidance for this segment given the warm weather through June. A further breakdown of DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter results can be found on Slide 19.
For DTE Gas, earnings for the second quarter were $13 million compared to a loss of $7 million last year. The variance was due to cooler weather in April of this year, increased revenue related to our infrastructure replacement program and planned initiatives in response of the warm weather we experienced in the first quarter.
As we discussed in our first quarter call, we went into the year anticipating warmer-than-normal weather for the winter, and we planned for it. With this advanced planning, we were able to stay on track to meet guidance.
Moving down the page, Gas Storage and Pipelines earnings were $35 million for the quarter. Earnings for the quarter were up $10 million over last year due to higher pipeline and gathering earnings from production that came online in the second half of 2015. We continue to see strength in this segment, even in current conditions. We have adjusted the midpoint of guidance upwards for this segment, which I will discuss in a minute.
Moving further down the slide, earnings for our Power and Industrial Projects were $17 million for the quarter, down $1 million from the second quarter last year. This decrease is primarily driven by lower earnings in the steel sector, offset by favorable REF volumes from additional projects that came online in the fourth quarter of last year.
Earnings for Corporate and Other were negative $23 million for the second quarter this year, $10 million favorable over last year due to the timing of taxes.
So earnings were $177 million for our growth segments for the second quarter or $0.98 per share compared to the $134 million or $0.75 per share last year.
To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, the accounting earnings were 0, down $3 million from the second quarter last year, driven by lower realized power performance. Trading's economic contribution for the second quarter of 2016 was $12 million. Trading is having another strong economic year, actually [ph] $30 million year-to-date economic contribution. A portion of the year-to-date economic performance will flow through the total year operating income results. I will talk more in a minute on the new guidance for our Trading segment. Slide 22 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation, showing both economic and accounting performance.
Let me now turn to Slide 12 and the EPS guidance for the year. As Gerry Anderson mentioned at the start of the call, based on our financial results in the first half of the year, we are increasing our midpoint of the 2016 EPS guidance by $0.12 from $4.93 to $5.05 for DTE Energy. Our EPS guidance range for DTE Energy is now $4.91 to $5.19 and $4.85 to $5.08 for our growth segments. Our guidance increase for our growth segments is driven by a strong start to the year at our DTE Electric and Gas Storage and Pipeline segments. If the warmer-than-normal weather continues through the remainder of the summer, we will initiate an invest plan at our DTE Electric to put the incremental revenue and cash back into customer-centric assets and activities.
For our GSP segment, the new drilling plans to Southwestern announced last week in the Bluestone region may provide upside to 2016 and sets us up nicely for 2017. Operating earnings guidance for these segments increased from a midpoint of $5.92 to $5.97 at DTE Electric and $110 million to $113 million at our Gas Storage and Pipeline segment.
As I just mentioned on the prior page, our DTE Energy business is off to a strong economic start. We have raised our earnings guidance from 0 to a range of $10 million to $20 million for this year. Energy Trading is not part of our growth segment, and we let the business be opportunistic versus setting a defined operating earnings targets. So we conservatively set the original guidance at 0, then typically update earnings guidance as we [indiscernible] the results for the first 2 quarters after we cover operating costs. Given the strong results in the first half this year, we are increasing the guidance for Energy Trading. We'll give another guidance update in the third quarter based on economic results for the first 3 quarters.
Moving on to Slide 13. In addition to solid earnings results for the year, our cash flow and balance sheet remains strong and will continue to provide the foundation for our long-term growth plans. This slide lays out our cash flow and CapEx through the first half of the year. Cash from operations was $1.3 billion. We saw strong performance across several business units, which is driving the increase over the same period last year and puts us a little ahead of our plan this year. We invested $1 billion of CapEx through the second quarter. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business unit.
DTE Electric's CapEx decrease was due to the timing of operational investment and lower new generation of spend with the acquisition of a large gas peaker back in the first quarter of 2015. The 9 [ph] utilities are higher than last year, driven by the timing of projects, particularly in our Gas Storage and Pipeline segment.
To fund this CapEx program and refinance maturing debt, we have issued $600 million in long-term debt financing this year. We've been consistent in our messaging over the years that maintaining a strong balance sheet is a priority.
Slide 14 provides the key balance sheet metrics we target and monitor, which is FFO to debt and leverage. This slide shows the projected level for each metric.
Our 2016 financing plan is on track. We plan to issue up to $100 million of equity this year. However, given the strong strength of the cash flows we have experienced to date, we are looking at the possibility of deferring equity issuance into the next 2 years. 3-year projected equity needs remain at the $200 million to $300 million, which is just a small fraction of the total capital spend over that time frame.
Our disciplined approach to maintaining a strong balance sheet across the years has proven to be valuable and sets us up nicely as we enter a period of incremental infrastructure improvements and investments at our utilities and funding the growth plans at our non-utility businesses.
Let me wrap up on Slide 16, and then can move to questions and answers. We've had a very good quarter as well as the first half of the year. We were able to raise our EPS guidance, setting us up nicely to send our streak to 10 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. This will be the seventh consecutive year that we've increased our dividend. This quarter, we announced coal plant retirements that will bring cleaner energy to our customers and considerable investment to our electric utility. Maintaining a strong balance sheet will allow us to invest in the utilities and pursue growth opportunities at our non-utility businesses.
Before I open up to Q&A, our call would not be complete without a quick update on my hometown Detroit Tigers. Now this -- the good news is that we won 50 games so far this year. The bad news is that we lost about as many games as well. Justin Verlander [ph] is looking better recently and actually won last night in Boston, but Miguel Cabrera [ph] [indiscernible] to heat up for us to have a chance. There's a lot of season left, so I'm remaining optimistic.
With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So Steffie, you can open lines up for questions."

I am going to start with an overview of our results in the second quarter as well as some key developments at the company over the past quarter. And then I'm going to turn things over to Peter for a financial update. Then we'll wrap up and take some Q&A.
So moving on to Slide 5. We continue to make good progress on a number of fronts this year. So with a successful first half of the year under our belts, I feel really good about our year-to-date financial results. And based upon those strong results, we're increasing our operating earnings per share guidance. We'll talk a bit about more of that -- more about that in a minute. We also recently increased our dividend for the seventh consecutive year, which continues the over 100-year history of issuing dividends at the company.
Rachael Eubanks was appointed by Governor Snyder to serve the remainder of John Quackenbush's 6-year term that expires about a year now -- a year from now, July 2, 2017. Her experience is in the area of finance, so it includes project finance, municipal bond refinancings, credit enhanced financing, variable and auction-rate transactions and so forth. She also, over her career, has provided investment banking support on financial advisory and investment engagements for state government, government authorities, municipalities and nonprofit organizations. So as we look forward in Michigan to a really heavy period of investment in our infrastructure, I think that her understanding of finance will be a good complement to the skills of the current commissioners. We certainly will have somebody there who understands cash flows, balance sheet issues and so forth as the company goes through a heavy investment period.
Thanks to the hard work of our employees, for the third consecutive year, DTE was ranked second in the Midwest by J.D. Power in overall electric residential customer satisfaction. That's in the large utility category. And this was our sixth consecutive year of being in the top quartile of that survey. We also achieved our best safety record in the company's history in the first 6 months, and that was by a wide margin, which I'm particularly proud of. I think it says something about where our employees' heads are. And if we can keep this performance, we may just be the safest company in the industry this year. And earlier this year, we won our fourth consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award, and our results placed us in the top 12% of companies worldwide in terms of employee engagement.
On the NEXUS front, that pipeline continues to progress. The project reached another important regulatory milestone, which sets us up nicely to meet our in-service date late next year. So I'll talk a bit more about NEXUS and those developments in a few minutes.
Now I'll move on to Slide 6 and give you some color on our second quarter's financial results. So in the second quarter, we build upon what were really positive first quarter results. We delivered second quarter earnings per share of $0.98, which I feel great about. As you know, we came into this year expecting warm weather. We planned for it, and that played through in our first quarter results. And we, based on the first and second quarters, come out of the first half of the year very well positioned, and we now have the potential to reinvest some of the weather-related favorability that may occur in the third quarter. We're seeing a hot July, and there's a warm August projected as well. So given the strong results of the first half of the year, we're increasing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.12, from $4.93 to $5.05. And given that, we now have a solid path to achieving our 10th consecutive year of meeting or beating our earnings targets.
We've also been growing our dividend, along with earnings, and we just recently increased the dividend by $0.16 a share, and our balance sheet continues to be in great shape. So bottom line, I feel really good about our finance position as we head into the second half of 2016.
So moving on to Slide 7 for a little more color on earnings and dividend. We've talked for years to investors about delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings per share growth and then pairing that with healthy dividend growth. And on the right-hand side of the slide in the ovals, you can see that our actual earnings per share growth over the past 5 years or so has been 6.5%. So really 1% above that 5% to 6%. And we have grown our dividends at 5% to 6% rate.
I also mentioned a minute ago that we're increasing guidance from a midpoint of $4.93 to $5.05.  Fundamentally, this is driven by a strong performance in our electric business and in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business as well as a very solid first half in our Energy Trading operations. As I stated a minute ago, and keeping with the commitment to grow dividends with earnings, we increased our dividend per share from $2.92 to $3.08, which was a 5.5% increase.
So I'm going to move on to Slide 8 now and discuss a significant development related to our power plant fleet that occurred in the second quarter. So in June, we announced closure plans for 8 coal-fired generating units. And this announcement, combined with our decision to cease operation at 3 coal-fired plants, which happened in April, means that we will replace 11 aging coal-fired generation units at 3 sites, totaling 2.5 gigawatts on or before 2023. Much of this coal-based slow generation will be replaced with natural gas generation, but we also intend to continue to invest in wind and solar to ensure that we keep the mix in our portfolio that we want. This portion of what is a longer-term transition plan for our fleet will require about $3 billion of investment.
By 2030, we'd expect to retire an additional gigawatt of coal-fired generation, which would bring total retirements to 3.5 gigawatts. And in doing that, our reliance on coal would decline by about 60%, and we'd expect to roughly double our current 10% renewable capacity and to use more gas-fired generation in a baseload role.
Obviously, emissions through 2030 will be down fundamentally as well. So CO2, we project, would be down about 40% versus 2005 levels, and our conventional emissions would be down sharply as well.
Moving on to Slide 9. NEXUS continues to move forward and make good progress. So NEXUS received its FERC Notice of Schedule on May 17 of this year. The project also recently received a favorable draft environmental impact report, or EIS, from the FERC. We expect the final EIS by the end of November, and that would allow for a certificate of construction by the end of February of 2017, which would set us up nicely for the November in-service date next year. We're progressing on right-of-way acquisitions and detailed engineering plans, and we continue to work constructively with FERC and other regulatory agencies.
In addition, in June, we received a letter of support for the NEXUS project from the Michigan Agency for Energy, so the Michigan Agency for Energy takes the lead on energy policy for the administration. We also received a letter of support from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which is the state's primary economic development agency. In addition, a recent Michigan Public Service Commission staff brief on our electric power cost recovery case, that's our fuel clause case, stated, and I quote, ""Staff believes that DTE Electric's participation in the NEXUS Pipeline project is reasonable as proposed in DTE Electric's application, its testimony and its exhibits in this case."" So we were gratified to have staff weigh in saying they think this project would benefit customers and benefit the state. In addition, we had letters of support offered by both Senator Nofs and Representative Nesbitt. They are the chairs of the Senate and House energy committees. So there's a lot of support in the state of Michigan for this pipeline moving forward.
So look, we really believe in the fundamentals of this pipe. It serves arguably the best dry gas production geology in the country. It connects that geology directly to growing markets in Michigan and Ontario. And then via our Vector Pipeline, it connects into Chicago and Wisconsin as well. The pipe also connects directly to the largest collection of market area storage in the country in Michigan and in Western Ontario. The pipe has 3 strong utility sponsors and up to 1.75 BCF of signed interconnect agreements in Northern Ohio and the pipe remains on schedule even as many other by pipes serving the Utica region struggle with delays. And given this, we continue to think that NEXUS is going to be a valuable addition to our Gas Storage and Pipelines portfolio.
And with that, I am going to turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to cover our financial results in more details. Peter, over to you"

I'd like to start with Slide 11. Gerry mentioned DTE's operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.98 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $0.84 per share. For a detailed breakdown of EPS",1510,"Thanks, Gerry, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 11. Gerry mentioned DTE's operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.98 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $0.84 per share. For a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 24 in the appendix.
Slide 11 shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by segment. Starting at the top of the page with the 2 utilities, we experienced unusually -- unusual weather this quarter, which gave a boost to both utilities. April was colder than normal, while May and June were warmer than normal. And this unusual weather in the quarter created both heating and cooling load, causing earnings at both utilities to be up quarter-over-quarter.
DTE Electric's earnings were $135 million for the second quarter this year compared to $111 million last year. Studying the weather in last year's rate case, DTE Electric's earnings were lower due to the absence of the revenue decoupling mechanism amortization in 2016. As you may recall, this revenue decoupling amortization was part of our strategy that extended the time frame in between rate cases by 4 years. We have increased guidance for this segment given the warm weather through June. A further breakdown of DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter results can be found on Slide 19.
For DTE Gas, earnings for the second quarter were $13 million compared to a loss of $7 million last year. The variance was due to cooler weather in April of this year, increased revenue related to our infrastructure replacement program and planned initiatives in response of the warm weather we experienced in the first quarter.
As we discussed in our first quarter call, we went into the year anticipating warmer-than-normal weather for the winter, and we planned for it. With this advanced planning, we were able to stay on track to meet guidance.
Moving down the page, Gas Storage and Pipelines earnings were $35 million for the quarter. Earnings for the quarter were up $10 million over last year due to higher pipeline and gathering earnings from production that came online in the second half of 2015. We continue to see strength in this segment, even in current conditions. We have adjusted the midpoint of guidance upwards for this segment, which I will discuss in a minute.
Moving further down the slide, earnings for our Power and Industrial Projects were $17 million for the quarter, down $1 million from the second quarter last year. This decrease is primarily driven by lower earnings in the steel sector, offset by favorable REF volumes from additional projects that came online in the fourth quarter of last year.
Earnings for Corporate and Other were negative $23 million for the second quarter this year, $10 million favorable over last year due to the timing of taxes.
So earnings were $177 million for our growth segments for the second quarter or $0.98 per share compared to the $134 million or $0.75 per share last year.
To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, the accounting earnings were 0, down $3 million from the second quarter last year, driven by lower realized power performance. Trading's economic contribution for the second quarter of 2016 was $12 million. Trading is having another strong economic year, actually $30 million year-to-date economic contribution. A portion of the year-to-date economic performance will flow through the total year operating income results. I will talk more in a minute on the new guidance for our Trading segment. Slide 22 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation, showing both economic and accounting performance.
Let me now turn to Slide 12 and the EPS guidance for the year. As Gerry Anderson mentioned at the start of the call, based on our financial results in the first half of the year, we are increasing our midpoint of the 2016 EPS guidance by $0.12 from $4.93 to $5.05 for DTE Energy. Our EPS guidance range for DTE Energy is now $4.91 to $5.19 and $4.85 to $5.08 for our growth segments. Our guidance increase for our growth segments is driven by a strong start to the year at our DTE Electric and Gas Storage and Pipeline segments. If the warmer-than-normal weather continues through the remainder of the summer, we will initiate an invest plan at our DTE Electric to put the incremental revenue and cash back into customer-centric assets and activities.
For our GSP segment, the new drilling plans to Southwestern announced last week in the Bluestone region may provide upside to 2016 and sets us up nicely for 2017. Operating earnings guidance for these segments increased from a midpoint of $5.92 to $5.97 at DTE Electric and $110 million to $113 million at our Gas Storage and Pipeline segment.
As I just mentioned on the prior page, our DTE Energy business is off to a strong economic start. We have raised our earnings guidance from 0 to a range of $10 million to $20 million for this year. Energy Trading is not part of our growth segment, and we let the business be opportunistic versus setting defined operating earnings targets. So we conservatively set the original guidance at 0, then typically update earnings guidance as we assess the results for the first 2 quarters after we cover operating costs. Given the strong results in the first half this year, we are increasing the guidance for Energy Trading. We'll give another guidance update in the third quarter based on economic results for the first 3 quarters.
Moving on to Slide 13. In addition to solid earnings results for the year, our cash flow and balance sheet remains strong and will continue to provide the foundation for our long-term growth plans. This slide lays out our cash flow and CapEx through the first half of the year. Cash from operations was $1.3 billion. We saw strong performance across several business units, which is driving the increase over the same period last year and puts us a little ahead of our plan this year. We invested $1 billion of CapEx through the second quarter. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business unit.
DTE Electric's CapEx decrease was due to the timing of operational investment and lower new generation of spend with the acquisition of a large gas peaker back in the first quarter of 2015. The non-utilities are higher than last year, driven by the timing of projects, particularly in our Gas Storage and Pipeline segment.
To fund this CapEx program and refinance maturing debt, we have issued $600 million in long-term debt financing this year. We've been consistent in our messaging over the years that maintaining a strong balance sheet is the priority.
Slide 14 provides the key balance sheet metrics we target and monitor, which is FFO to debt and leverage. This slide shows the projected level for each metric.
Our 2016 financing plan is on track. We plan to issue up to $100 million of equity this year. However, given the strong strength of the cash flows we have experienced to date, we are looking at the possibility of deferring equity issuance into the next 2 years. Our 3-year projected equity needs remain at the $200 million to $300 million, which is just a small fraction of the total capital spend over that time frame.
Our disciplined approach to maintaining a strong balance sheet across the years has proven to be valuable and sets us up nicely as we enter a period of incremental infrastructure improvements and investments at our utilities and funding the growth plans at our non-utility businesses.
Let me wrap up on Slide 16, and then we can move to questions and answers. We've had a very good quarter as well as the first half of the year. We were able to raise our EPS guidance, setting us up nicely to send our streak to 10 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. This will be the seventh consecutive year that we've increased our dividend. This quarter, we announced coal plant retirements that will bring cleaner energy to our customers and considerable investment to our electric utility. Maintaining a strong balance sheet will allow us to invest in the utilities and pursue growth opportunities at our non-utility businesses.
Before I open up to Q&A, our call would not be complete without a quick update on my hometown Detroit Tigers. Now this -- the good news is that we have won 50 games so far this year. The bad news is that we lost about as many games as well. Justin Verlander is looking better recently and actually won last night in Boston, but Miguel Cabrera's bat needs to heat up for us to have a chance. There's a lot of season left, so I'm remaining optimistic.
With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So Steffie, you can open lines up for questions."

I am going to start with an overview of our results in the second quarter as well as some key developments at the company over the past quarter. And then I'm going to turn things over to Peter for a financial update. Then we'll wrap up and take some Q&A.
So moving on to Slide 5. We continue to make good progress on a number of fronts this year. So with a successful first half of the year under our belts, I feel really good about our year-to-date financial results. And based upon those strong results, we're increasing our operating earnings per share guidance. We'll talk a bit about more of that -- more about that in a minute. We also recently increased our dividend for the seventh consecutive year, which continues the over 100-year history of issuing dividends at the company.
Rachael Eubanks was appointed by Governor Snyder to serve the remainder of John Quackenbush's 6-year term that expires about a year now -- a year from now, July 2, 2017. Her experience is in the area of finance, so it includes project finance, municipal bond refinancings, credit enhanced financing, variable and auction-rate transactions and so forth. She also, over her career, has provided investment banking support on financial advisory and investment engagements for state government, government authorities, municipalities and nonprofit organizations. So as we look forward in Michigan to a really heavy period of investment in our infrastructure, I think that her understanding of finance will be a good complement to the skills of the current commissioners. We certainly will have somebody there who understands cash flows, balance sheet issues and so forth as the company goes through a heavy investment period.
Thanks to the hard work of our employees, for the third consecutive year, DTE was ranked second in the Midwest by J.D. Power in overall electric residential customer satisfaction. That's in the large utility category. And this was our sixth consecutive year of being in the top quartile of that survey. We also achieved our best safety record in the company's history in the first 6 months, and that was by a wide margin, which I'm particularly proud of. I think it says something about where our employees' heads are. And if we can keep this performance, we may just be the safest company in the industry this year. And earlier this year, we won our fourth consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award, and our results placed us in the top 12% of companies worldwide in terms of employee engagement.
On the NEXUS front, that pipeline continues to progress. The project reached another important regulatory milestone, which sets us up nicely to meet our in-service date late next year. So I'll talk a bit more about NEXUS and those developments in a few minutes.
Now I'll move on to Slide 6 and give you some color on our second quarter's financial results. So in the second quarter, we build upon what were really positive first quarter results. We delivered second quarter earnings per share of $0.98, which I feel great about. As you know, we came into this year expecting warm weather. We planned for it, and that played through in our first quarter results. And we, based on the first and second quarters, come out of the first half of the year very well positioned, and we now have the potential to reinvest some of the weather-related favorability that may occur in the third quarter. We're seeing a hot July, and there's a warm August projected as well. So given the strong results of the first half of the year, we're increasing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.12, from $4.93 to $5.05. And given that, we now have a solid path to achieving our 10th consecutive year of meeting or beating our earnings targets.
We've also been growing our dividend, along with earnings, and we just recently increased the dividend by $0.16 a share, and our balance sheet continues to be in great shape. So bottom line, I feel really good about our finance position as we head into the second half of 2016.
So moving on to Slide 7 for a little more color on earnings and dividend. We've talked for years to investors about delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings per share growth and then pairing that with healthy dividend growth. And on the right-hand side of the slide in the ovals, you can see that our actual earnings per share growth over the past 5 years or so has been 6.5%. So really 1% above that 5% to 6%. And we have grown our dividends at 5% to 6% rate.
I also mentioned a minute ago that we're increasing guidance from a midpoint of $4.93 to $5.05.  Fundamentally, this is driven by a strong performance in our electric business and in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business as well as a very solid first half in our Energy Trading operations. As I stated a minute ago, and keeping with the commitment to grow dividends with earnings, we increased our dividend per share from $2.92 to $3.08, which was a 5.5% increase.
So I'm going to move on to Slide 8 now and discuss a significant development related to our power plant fleet that occurred in the second quarter. So in June, we announced closure plans for 8 coal-fired generating units. And this announcement, combined with our decision to cease operation at 3 coal-fired plants, which happened in April, means that we will replace 11 aging coal-fired generation units at 3 sites, totaling 2.5 gigawatts on or before 2023. Much of this coal-based slow generation will be replaced with natural gas generation, but we also intend to continue to invest in wind and solar to ensure that we keep the mix in our portfolio that we want. This portion of what is a longer-term transition plan for our fleet will require about $3 billion of investment.
By 2030, we'd expect to retire an additional gigawatt of coal-fired generation, which would bring total retirements to 3.5 gigawatts. And in doing that, our reliance on coal would decline by about 60%, and we'd expect to roughly double our current 10% renewable capacity and to use more gas-fired generation in a baseload role.
Obviously, emissions through 2030 will be down fundamentally as well. So CO2, we project, would be down about 40% versus 2005 levels, and our conventional emissions would be down sharply as well.
Moving on to Slide 9. NEXUS continues to move forward and make good progress. So NEXUS received its FERC Notice of Schedule on May 17 of this year. The project also recently received a favorable draft environmental impact report, or EIS, from the FERC. We expect the final EIS by the end of November, and that would allow for a certificate of construction by the end of February of 2017, which would set us up nicely for the November in-service date next year. We're progressing on right-of-way acquisitions and detailed engineering plans, and we continue to work constructively with FERC and other regulatory agencies.
In addition, in June, we received a letter of support for the NEXUS project from the Michigan Agency for Energy, so the Michigan Agency for Energy takes the lead on energy policy for the administration. We also received a letter of support from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which is the state's primary economic development agency. In addition, a recent Michigan Public Service Commission staff brief on our electric power cost recovery case, that's our fuel clause case, stated, and I quote, ""Staff believes that DTE Electric's participation in the NEXUS Pipeline project is reasonable as proposed in DTE Electric's application, its testimony and its exhibits in this case."" So we were gratified to have staff weigh in saying they think this project would benefit customers and benefit the state. In addition, we had letters of support offered by both Senator Nofs and Representative Nesbitt. They are the chairs of the Senate and House energy committees. So there's a lot of support in the state of Michigan for this pipeline moving forward.
So look, we really believe in the fundamentals of this pipe. It serves arguably the best dry gas production geology in the country. It connects that geology directly to growing markets in Michigan and Ontario. And then via our Vector Pipeline, it connects into Chicago and Wisconsin as well. The pipe also connects directly to the largest collection of market area storage in the country in Michigan and in Western Ontario. The pipe has 3 strong utility sponsors and up to 1.75 BCF of signed interconnect agreements in Northern Ohio and the pipe remains on schedule even as many other by pipes serving the Utica region struggle with delays. And given this, we continue to think that NEXUS is going to be a valuable addition to our Gas Storage and Pipelines portfolio.
And with that, I am going to turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to cover our financial results in more details. Peter, over to you"
266598,374052653,1012886,"DTE Energy Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Gerry, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 11. Gerry mentioned DTE's operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.98 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $0.84 per share. For a detailed breakdown of EPS",1510,"Thanks, Gerry, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 11. Gerry mentioned DTE's operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.98 per share. And for reference, reported earnings were $0.84 per share. For a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 24 in the appendix.
Slide 11 shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by segment. Starting at the top of the page with the 2 utilities, we experienced unusually -- unusual weather this quarter, which gave a boost to both utilities. April was colder than normal, while May and June were warmer than normal. And this unusual weather in the quarter created both heating and cooling load, causing earnings at both utilities to be up quarter-over-quarter.
DTE Electric's earnings were $135 million for the second quarter this year compared to $111 million last year. Studying the weather in last year's rate case, DTE Electric's earnings were lower due to the absence of the revenue decoupling mechanism amortization in 2016. As you may recall, this revenue decoupling amortization was part of our strategy that extended the time frame in between rate cases by 4 years. We have increased guidance for this segment given the warm weather through June. A further breakdown of DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter results can be found on Slide 19.
For DTE Gas, earnings for the second quarter were $13 million compared to a loss of $7 million last year. The variance was due to cooler weather in April of this year, increased revenue related to our infrastructure replacement program and planned initiatives in response of the warm weather we experienced in the first quarter.
As we discussed in our first quarter call, we went into the year anticipating warmer-than-normal weather for the winter, and we planned for it. With this advanced planning, we were able to stay on track to meet guidance.
Moving down the page, Gas Storage and Pipelines earnings were $35 million for the quarter. Earnings for the quarter were up $10 million over last year due to higher pipeline and gathering earnings from production that came online in the second half of 2015. We continue to see strength in this segment, even in current conditions. We have adjusted the midpoint of guidance upwards for this segment, which I will discuss in a minute.
Moving further down the slide, earnings for our Power and Industrial Projects were $17 million for the quarter, down $1 million from the second quarter last year. This decrease is primarily driven by lower earnings in the steel sector, offset by favorable REF volumes from additional projects that came online in the fourth quarter of last year.
Earnings for Corporate and Other were negative $23 million for the second quarter this year, $10 million favorable over last year due to the timing of taxes.
So earnings were $177 million for our growth segments for the second quarter or $0.98 per share compared to the $134 million or $0.75 per share last year.
To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, the accounting earnings were 0, down $3 million from the second quarter last year, driven by lower realized power performance. Trading's economic contribution for the second quarter of 2016 was $12 million. Trading is having another strong economic year, actually $30 million year-to-date economic contribution. A portion of the year-to-date economic performance will flow through the total year operating income results. I will talk more in a minute on the new guidance for our Trading segment. Slide 22 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation, showing both economic and accounting performance.
Let me now turn to Slide 12 and the EPS guidance for the year. As Gerry Anderson mentioned at the start of the call, based on our financial results in the first half of the year, we are increasing our midpoint of the 2016 EPS guidance by $0.12 from $4.93 to $5.05 for DTE Energy. Our EPS guidance range for DTE Energy is now $4.91 to $5.19 and $4.85 to $5.08 for our growth segments. Our guidance increase for our growth segments is driven by a strong start to the year at our DTE Electric and Gas Storage and Pipeline segments. If the warmer-than-normal weather continues through the remainder of the summer, we will initiate an invest plan at our DTE Electric to put the incremental revenue and cash back into customer-centric assets and activities.
For our GSP segment, the new drilling plans to Southwestern announced last week in the Bluestone region may provide upside to 2016 and sets us up nicely for 2017. Operating earnings guidance for these segments increased from a midpoint of $5.92 to $5.97 at DTE Electric and $110 million to $113 million at our Gas Storage and Pipeline segment.
As I just mentioned on the prior page, our DTE Energy business is off to a strong economic start. We have raised our earnings guidance from 0 to a range of $10 million to $20 million for this year. Energy Trading is not part of our growth segment, and we let the business be opportunistic versus setting defined operating earnings targets. So we conservatively set the original guidance at 0, then typically update earnings guidance as we assess the results for the first 2 quarters after we cover operating costs. Given the strong results in the first half this year, we are increasing the guidance for Energy Trading. We'll give another guidance update in the third quarter based on economic results for the first 3 quarters.
Moving on to Slide 13. In addition to solid earnings results for the year, our cash flow and balance sheet remains strong and will continue to provide the foundation for our long-term growth plans. This slide lays out our cash flow and CapEx through the first half of the year. Cash from operations was $1.3 billion. We saw strong performance across several business units, which is driving the increase over the same period last year and puts us a little ahead of our plan this year. We invested $1 billion of CapEx through the second quarter. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business unit.
DTE Electric's CapEx decrease was due to the timing of operational investment and lower new generation of spend with the acquisition of a large gas peaker back in the first quarter of 2015. The non-utilities are higher than last year, driven by the timing of projects, particularly in our Gas Storage and Pipeline segment.
To fund this CapEx program and refinance maturing debt, we have issued $600 million in long-term debt financing this year. We've been consistent in our messaging over the years that maintaining a strong balance sheet is the priority.
Slide 14 provides the key balance sheet metrics we target and monitor, which is FFO to debt and leverage. This slide shows the projected level for each metric.
Our 2016 financing plan is on track. We plan to issue up to $100 million of equity this year. However, given the strong strength of the cash flows we have experienced to date, we are looking at the possibility of deferring equity issuance into the next 2 years. Our 3-year projected equity needs remain at the $200 million to $300 million, which is just a small fraction of the total capital spend over that time frame.
Our disciplined approach to maintaining a strong balance sheet across the years has proven to be valuable and sets us up nicely as we enter a period of incremental infrastructure improvements and investments at our utilities and funding the growth plans at our non-utility businesses.
Let me wrap up on Slide 16, and then we can move to questions and answers. We've had a very good quarter as well as the first half of the year. We were able to raise our EPS guidance, setting us up nicely to send our streak to 10 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. This will be the seventh consecutive year that we've increased our dividend. This quarter, we announced coal plant retirements that will bring cleaner energy to our customers and considerable investment to our electric utility. Maintaining a strong balance sheet will allow us to invest in the utilities and pursue growth opportunities at our non-utility businesses.
Before I open up to Q&A, our call would not be complete without a quick update on my hometown Detroit Tigers. Now this -- the good news is that we have won 50 games so far this year. The bad news is that we lost about as many games as well. Justin Verlander is looking better recently and actually won last night in Boston, but Miguel Cabrera's bat needs to heat up for us to have a chance. There's a lot of season left, so I'm remaining optimistic.
With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So Steffie, you can open lines up for questions."

We really only we saw this year that we were the last American team to be eliminated from contention this year but I do like to congratulate 2 great Midwest from cities of Cleveland and Chicago for being on the world series. And as always, I look forward to a breaker season on next year. 
Now for an update on DTE, we are keeping today's call focused on the quarter and the current year, and as you can see, I'm the only participant here. We have other members of management team here for the Q&A session, and I will call out on them throughout the Q&A needed. And I will also be deferring questions on long-term growth and strategy to the EI conference which is only a few weeks away. Gerry Anderson will be providing our normal detailed business update at EEI. There, he will discuss our 2017 early outlook, our long-term growth plans as well as details about each of the business segments. So now I'd like to start on Slide 4.
As you know in September, we raised our operating EPS guidance for 2016. At that time, we increased the guidance midpoint $0.17 to a range of $5.09 to $5.35, from a range of $4.91 to $5.19. The guidance increases were driven by a lot of weather favorability at DTE Electric, favorability across all platforms at the gas pipeline business and a strong year-to-date economic performance at our trading company.
In the past, we've talked about our re-investment strategy, our holding favorability until we see the summer months play out. While this summer was the hottest we've had in the past 60 years, and we're able to reap out a lot of those revenues back into the system into aging infrastructure to improve customer liability.
We've invested in a nominal amount this quarter, we're stepping up our investment activity for the remainder of the year. Investments will primarily be in our infrastructure with the focus on improving immediate and lasting benefits to our customers. 
Another area where we are seeing great results this year is an safety. Now we always start every meeting with a discussion on our safety, and it's our #1 priority in the company. And I'm particularly pleased to announce that the year-to-date, our employees continue to have the best safety record in the company's history. 
And of course, we have had a major announcement in our gas storage and pipeline segment in the third quarter with the acquisition of our gas emission assets in the heart of the Southwest Marcellus and dry Utica basin. The transaction complements our existing midstream business, and provides a platform for new value creation and significant growth opportunities. I will be discussing the growth opportunities and their impacts in our business at EEI. 
Now I'd like to go over the third quarter earnings results on Slide 5. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $353 million or $1.96 per share. For reference, our reported earnings were $1.88 per share, and you can find the reconciliation with the third quarter report to operating earnings on Slide 17 of the appendix.  For the quarter, our growth segments operating segments were $343 million or $1.91 per share. 
Now starting with the segments, with DTE Electric, it was higher by $71 million. This quarter was as indicated when the warmest [ph] on record and drove much of this favorability. DTE Electric also a rate increase on August 1 as part of the ongoing rate case. This favorability was partially offset by increased expenses associated with the rate base growth. DTE Gas was higher by $7 million. This is primarily driven by gas, main line replacement surcharge and the storage and transport services. 
Our Power and Industrial Projects segments was higher by $3 million due primarily to higher REF earnings from additional location that came online in the fourth quarter of last year. These earnings were partially offset by lower earnings and our steel related assets. I'll cover [ph] another segment, came it at $8 [ph] million favorable versus last year. This variance was mainly due to timing of taxes. Again, overall, the growth segment results for the quarter were $343 million or $1.91 per share. 
Following with our energy trading segment, there are $10 million in operating earnings for the quarter and economic net income was $1 million. Please refer to Slide 15 of the appendix which shows the standard view of the Energy Trading reconciliation of both economic and operating performance. So overall, DTE had a very strong third quarter. 
With that, moving on to Slide 6. I'd like to provide an update on our 2016 earnings guidance. As I mentioned, we recently raised 2016 guidance and are confident that we will land somewhere between the midpoint and upper end of our guidance this year. Year-to-date results are solid and we are in good position to finish the year strong. You can see arrows next to each of the guidance numbers in akin where we think where the year may play out for each segment. The green arrows indicate achieving the higher end of guidance while the red arrows signifies the lower end. The positive signaling at DTE Electric is driven by additional weather experienced at September. We had a very warm September. Our corporate and Other segment is trending towards the lower end of guidance driven by our tax true-ups. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect Energy Trading to have accounting income that covers expenses which puts them at the high-end of the guidance range. 
Now moving on to Slide 7. In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continues to support a long-term growth. Based on year-to-date results, we are updating our cash flow and capital expenditure guidance, starting at the left side of the page, we're increasing cash from operations by $200 million due to the strong cash performance year-to-date. CapEx is increasing by $1.1 billion, which is primarily due to the recent acquisition of our gas midstream asset. We're also increasing our debt financing by $900 million, which was used in part for recent acquisition and also for general corporate users. 
Taking a closer look at CapEx on the right side of the page, we show capital expenditure by business units. We still expect to invest nearly $1.6 billion at the electric company and $430 million at the gas company. We have increased the nonutility guidance by $1.1 billion, the exchanges I mentioned capture the purpose of the gas midstream asset. This brings our total capital expenditures to nearly $3.8 billion for the year.
Now let's move on Slide 8 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong. We expect to end the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt due to the strong year-to-date earnings and cash flow, we will not be issuing equity in 2016. In early October, DTE issued $1 billion of senior notes and $675 million of mandatory convertible securities to support the midstream acquisition. As a reminder, the $675 million of mandatory convertible securities will convert to common equity in October of 2019. 
Lastly, we ended the quarter with very healthy liquidity position at $1.6 billion. Now wrapping up on Slide 9, I will summarize the quarter then open the line for questions. We've had another successful quarter and are in a great position to achieve our EPS guidance this year. We are looking to extend the street to 10 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. We are investing heavily in our utilities by upgrading or aging infrastructure, and we are executing on growth opportunities at our nonutility businesses, most notably, the gas storage and pipeline business where we recently added a new platform for future growth. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, which sets up nicely for future growth opportunities as we enter a period of significant investment and begin to transform our electric generation fleet. 
Before I open the line for questions, once again, I'd like to remind everyone that Gerry Anderson will be giving our formal business update presentation at the upcoming EEI conference on November 8, and we hope to see many of you at the conference.

It is going to be a challenge potentially, given the time frame left but I think given the focus and attention on that, there's still a chance that it will happen in the land dock session. We have had some public support recently. The Michigan State Chamber came out recently publicly to support this bill so I think that's a very positive movement as well. In terms of what has changed is that, this bill in particular, it's going to be a bipartisan bill. It is related to the state of Michigan, the energy reliability that's needed in the state of Michigan. So both parties need to be supportive and both parties know why they get the energy legislation passed. So recently, there is some discussion on the renewables side potentially for that mandate, clearly [indiscernible] 10% [ph] it could potentially go up to 15%. They'll help get some of the Democrats onboard as well and some of the refining, as I was mentioning even when I've been on the road, that some of it is -- getting the detailed road around the Retail Open Access and the capacity requirements related to that. So there is some finalization around that language. I know there is a new MISO tariff that may be out there as well that's going to help support and complement legislation as well."

Of course you know DTE earnings call, we complete without an update on retires so let me get that over with here. As it's disappointing to say that over the second straight season, retires did not make the postseason. We really only saw this year that we were the last American team to be eliminated from contention this year but I do like to congratulate 2 great Midwestern cities, Cleveland and Chicago for being in the World Series. And as always, I look forward to a breaker season next year. 
Now for an update on DTE, we're keeping today's call focused on the quarter and the current year, and as you can see, I'm the only participant here. We have other members of management team here for the Q&A session, and I will call on them throughout the Q&A if needed. And I will also be deferring questions on long-term growth and strategy to the EI Conference, which is only a few weeks away. Gerry Anderson will be providing our normal detailed business update at EEI. There, he will discuss our 2017 early outlook and long-term growth plans as well as details about each of the business segments. So now I'd like to start on Slide 4.
As you know in September, we raised our operating EPS guidance for 2016. At that time, we increased the guidance midpoint $0.17 to a range of $5.09 to $5.35 from a range of $4.91 to $5.19. The guidance increases were driven by a lot of weather favorability at DTE Electric, favorability across all platforms at the gas storage and pipeline business and a strong year-to-date economic performance at our trading company.
In the past, we've talked about our reinvestment strategy, holding favorability until we see the summer months play out. While this summer was the hottest we've had in the past 60 years, and we're able to reap out a lot of those revenues back into the system into aging infrastructure to improve customer liability.
We've invested a nominal amount this quarter. We're stepping up our reinvestment activity for the remainder of the year. Investments will primarily be in our infrastructure with a focus on improving immediate and lasting benefits to our customers. 
Another area where we are seeing great results this year is in safety. Now we always start every meeting with a discussion on safety and it's our #1 priority in the company. And I'm particularly pleased to announce that the year-to-date, our employees continue to have the best safety record in the company's history. 
And of course, we have had a major announcement in our gas storage and pipeline segment in the third quarter with the acquisition of a gas midstream assets in the heart of the Southwest Marcellus and dry Utica basin. The transaction complements our existing midstream business and provides a platform for new value creation and significant growth opportunities. I will be discussing the growth opportunities and their impacts on our business at EEI. 
Now I'd like to go over the third quarter earning results on Slide 5. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $353 million, or $1.96 per share. For reference, our reported earnings were $1.88 per share and you can find the reconciliation with the third quarter reported to operating earnings on Slide 17 of the appendix.  For the quarter, our growth segments operating earnings were $343 million, or $1.91 per share. 
Now starting with the segments, with DTE Electric, it was higher by $71 million. This quarter was as I indicated when the warmest on record and drove much of this favorability. DTE Electric also [indiscernible] a rate increase on August 1 as part of the ongoing rate case. This favorability was partially offset by increased expenses associated with the rate base growth. DTE Gas was higher by $7 million. This was primarily driven by gas, main line replacement surcharge and the storage and transport services. 
Our Power and Industrial Projects segments was higher by $3 million due primarily to higher REF earnings from additional location that came online in the fourth quarter of last year. These earnings were partially offset by lower earnings in our steel-related assets. Corporate and Other segment came in at $8 million favorable versus last year. This variance was mainly due to timing of taxes. Again, overall, the growth segment results for the quarter were $343 million, or $1.91 per share. 
Following with our Energy Trading segment, there were $10 million in operating earnings for the quarter and economic net income was $1 million. Please refer to Slide 15 of the appendix, which shows our standard view of the Energy Trading reconciliation of both economic and operating performance. So overall, DTE had a very strong third quarter. 
With that, moving on to Slide 6. I'd like to provide an update on our 2016 earnings guidance. As I mentioned, we recently raised 2016 guidance and are confident that we will land somewhere between the midpoint and upper end of our guidance this year. Year-to-date results are solid and we are in good position to finish the year strong. You can see arrows next to each of the guidance numbers in akin where we think the year may play out for each segment. The green arrows indicate achieving the higher end of guidance while the red arrows signifies the lower end. The positive signaling at DTE Electric is driven by additional weather experienced at September. We had a very warm September. Our corporate and Other segment is trending towards the lower end of guidance driven by our tax true-ups. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect Energy Trading to have accounting income that covers our expenses, which puts them at the high-end of the guidance range. 
Now moving on to Slide 7. In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continues to support a long-term growth. Based on year-to-date results, we are updating our cash flow and capital expenditure guidance, starting at the left side of the page, we're increasing cash from operations by $200 million due to the strong cash performance year-to-date. CapEx is increasing by $1.1 billion, which is primarily due to the recent acquisition of our gas midstream assets. We're also increasing our debt financing by $900 million, which was used in part for recent our acquisition and also for general corporate uses. 
Taking a closer look at CapEx on the right side of the page, we show capital expenditure by business units. We still expect to invest nearly $1.6 billion at the electric company and $430 million at the gas company. We have increased the nonutility guidance by $1.1 billion, the exchanges I mentioned capture the purchase of the gas midstream assets. This brings our total capital expenditures to nearly $3.8 billion for the year.
Now let's move on to Slide 8 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong. We expect to end the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. Due to the strong year-to-date earnings and cash flow, we will not be issuing equity in 2016. In early October, DTE issued $1 billion of senior notes and $675 million of mandatory convertible securities to support the midstream acquisition. As a reminder, the $675 million of mandatory convertible securities will convert to common equity in October of 2019. 
Lastly, we ended the quarter with very healthy liquidity position of $1.6 billion. Now wrapping up on Slide 9, I will summarize the quarter then open the line for questions. We've had another successful quarter and are in a great position to achieve our EPS guidance this year. We are looking to extend our street to 10 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. We are investing heavily in our utilities by upgrading our aging infrastructure, and we are executing on growth opportunities at our nonutility businesses, most notably, the gas storage and pipeline business, where we recently added a new platform for future growth. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, which sets up nicely for future growth opportunities as we enter a period of significant investment and begin to transform our electric generation fleet. 
Before I open the line for questions, once again, I'd like to remind everyone that Gerry Anderson will be giving our formal business update presentation at the upcoming EEI Conference on November 8, and we hope to see many of you at the conference. But if you can't make it in person, you can visit our Investor Relations website to listen in on the webcast. 
Now I'd like to open up for questions. So Tunisia, please open the line."

We have had some public support recently. The Michigan State Chamber came out publicly to support this bill so I think that's a very positive movement as well. In terms of what has changed is that, this bill in particular, is going to be a bipartisan bill. It is related to the state of Michigan, the energy reliability that's needed in the state of Michigan. So both parties need to be supportive and both parties want to get this energy legislation passed. So recently, there was some discussion on the renewable side potentially for that mandate, clearly, we're at 10%, potentially go up to 15%. That will help get some of the Democrats onboard as well and some of the refining, as I was mentioning even when I've been on the road, that some of it is -- getting the detailed road around the retail open access and the capacity requirements related to that. So there is some finalization around that language. I know there is a new MISO tariff that may be out there as well that's going to help support and complement legislation as well."

We are currently at the 2/3, and now we've been at the 2/3 for a little bit here. Some of that is with the E&P companies taking a pause with their balance sheets, but we're starting to get some express interest with the E&P companies.

So this was kind of a potential, how do we ensure some reliability and capacity in the state of Michigan. It does help complement legislation, so that will be 1 where we'll have the requirements for the retail open access providers and show what's your capacity plans. And with a lot of the local clearing requirements, they'll have to be in place given the fact that -- given the Peninsula state that we have, the limited amount of transmission, we need to have a lot of local generation. So this new tariff, if the ROA customers cannot get the capacity, they'll come to the utilities, and we've provided with a capacity surcharge. My understanding is MISO will be filing this new tariff with the FERC shortly potentially next month."

Really, the only solace here is that we were the last American team to be eliminated from contention this year, but I do like to congratulate 2 great Midwestern cities, Cleveland and Chicago, for being in the World Series. And as always, I'll look forward to a brighter season next year. 
Now for an update on DTE, we're keeping today's call focused on the quarter and the current year, and as you can see, I'm the only participant here. We have other members of management team here for the Q&A session, and I will call on them throughout the Q&A, if needed. And I will also be deferring questions on long-term growth and strategy to the EI Conference, which is only a few weeks away. Gerry Anderson will be providing our normal detailed business update at EEI. There, he will discuss our 2017 early outlook and long-term growth plans as well as details about each of the business segments. So now I'd like to start on Slide 4.
As you know in September, we raised our operating EPS guidance for 2016. At that time, we increased the guidance midpoint $0.17 to a range of $5.09 to $5.35 from a range of $4.91 to $5.19. The guidance increases were driven by a lot of weather favorability at DTE Electric, favorability across all platforms at the gas storage and pipeline business and a strong year-to-date economic performance at our trading company.
In the past, we've talked about our reinvestment strategy, holding favorability until we see the summer months play out. Well, this summer was the hottest we've had in the past 60 years, and we were able to reinvest a lot of those revenues back into the system into aging infrastructure to improve customer liability.
We've invested a nominal amount this quarter. We're stepping up our reinvestment activity for the remainder of the year. Investments will primarily be in our infrastructure, with a focus on improving immediate and lasting benefits to our customers. 
Another area where we are seeing great results this year is in safety. Now we always start every meeting with a discussion on safety and it's our #1 priority in the company. And I'm particularly pleased to announce that year-to-date, our employees continue to have the best safety record in the company's history. 
And of course, we have had a major announcement in our gas storage and pipeline segment in the third quarter with the acquisition of a gas midstream assets in the heart of the Southwest Marcellus and dry Utica basin. The transaction complements our existing midstream business and provides a platform for new value creation and significant growth opportunities. I will be discussing the growth opportunities and their impact on our business at EEI. 
Now I'd like to go over the third quarter earning results on Slide 5. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $353 million, or $1.96 per share. For reference, our reported earnings were $1.88 per share and you can find a reconciliation with the third quarter reported operating earnings on Slide 17 of the appendix. For the quarter, our growth segments operating earnings were $343 million, or $1.91 per share. 
Now starting with the segments, with DTE Electric, it was higher by $71 million. This quarter was, as I indicated, when the warmest on record and drove much of this favorability. DTE Electric also supplemented a rate increase on August 1 as part of the ongoing rate case. This favorability was partially offset by increased expenses associated with the rate base growth. DTE Gas was higher by $7 million. This was primarily driven by gas, main line replacement surcharge and the storage and transport services. 
Our Power and Industrial Projects segments was higher by $3 million due primarily to higher REF earnings from additional location that came online in the fourth quarter of last year. These earnings were partially offset by lower earnings in our steel-related assets. Our Corporate and Other segment came in at $8 million favorable versus last year. This variance was mainly due to timing of taxes. Again, overall, the growth segment results for the quarter were $343 million, or $1.91 per share. 
Following with our Energy Trading segment, there were $10 million in operating earnings for the quarter and economic net income was $1 million. Please refer to Slide 15 in the appendix, which shows our standard view of the Energy Trading reconciliation of both economic and operating performance. So overall, DTE had a very strong third quarter. 
With that, moving on to Slide 6. I'd like to provide an update on our 2016 earnings guidance. As I mentioned, we recently raised 2016 guidance and are confident that we will land somewhere between the midpoint and upper end of our guidance this year. Year-to-date results are solid, and we are in good position to finish the year strong. You can see arrows next to each of the guidance numbers indicating where we think the year may play out for each segment. The green arrows indicate achieving the higher end of guidance, while the red arrows signifies the lower end. The positive signaling at DTE Electric is driven by additional weather experienced at the end of September. We had a very warm September. Our corporate and Other segment is trending towards the lower end of guidance driven by our tax true-ups. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect Energy Trading to have accounting income that covers their expenses, which puts them at the high-end of the guidance range. 
Now moving on to Slide 7. In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continue to support a long-term growth. Based on year-to-date results, we are updating our cash flow and capital expenditure guidance. Starting at the left side of the page, we're increasing cash from operations by $200 million due to the strong cash performance year-to-date. CapEx is increasing by $1.1 billion, which is primarily due to the recent acquisition of our gas midstream assets. We're also increasing our debt financing by $900 million, which was used in part for a recent our acquisition and also for general corporate uses. 
Taking a closer look at CapEx, on the right side of the page, we show capital expenditure by business units. We still expect to invest nearly $1.6 billion at the electric company and $430 million at the gas company. We have increased the nonutility guidance by $1.1 billion. This exchange, as I mentioned, captured the purchase of the gas midstream assets. This brings our total capital expenditures to nearly $3.8 billion for the year.
Now let's move on to Slide 8, with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong. We expect to end the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. Due to the strong year-to-date earnings and cash flow, we will not be issuing equity in 2016. In early October, DTE issued $1 billion of senior notes and $675 million of mandatory convertible securities to support the midstream acquisition. As a reminder, the $675 million of mandatory convertible securities will convert to common equity in October of 2019. 
Lastly, we ended the quarter with a very healthy liquidity position of $1.6 billion. Now wrapping up on Slide 9, I will summarize the quarter, then open the line for questions. We've had another successful quarter and are in a great position to achieve our EPS guidance this year. We are looking to extend our streak to 10 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. We are investing heavily in our utilities by upgrading our aging infrastructure, and we are executing on growth opportunities at our nonutility businesses, most notably, the gas storage and pipeline business, where we recently added a new platform for future growth. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, which sets up nicely for future growth opportunities as we enter a period of significant investment and begin to transform our electric generation fleet. 
Before I open the line for questions, once again, I'd like to remind everyone that Gerry Anderson will be giving our formal business update presentation at the upcoming EEI Conference on November 8, and we hope to see many of you at the conference. But if you can't make it in person, you can visit our Investor Relations website to listen in on the webcast. 
Now I'd like to open up for questions. So, Tanisha, please open the line."

There's a lot of public communication that's happening out there. Senator Nofs has made this a priority for that. It is going to be a challenge potentially, given the time frame left. But I think given the focus and attention on that, there's still a chance it will happen in the lame-duck session. We have had some public support recently. The Michigan State Chamber came out publicly to support this bill so I think that's a very positive movement as well. In terms of what has changed is that, this bill in particular, is going to be a bipartisan bill. It is related to the state of Michigan, the energy reliability that's needed in the state of Michigan. So both parties need to be supportive and both parties want to get this energy legislation passed. So recently, there is some discussion on the renewable side potentially for that mandate,. Currently, we're at 10%. Potentially, it will go up to 15%. That will help get some of the Democrats onboard as well. And some of the refining, as I was mentioning even when I've been on the road, that some of it is -- getting the details right around the retail open access and the capacity requirements related to that, so there is some finalization around that language. I know there is a new MISO tariff that may be out there as well that's going to help support and complement legislation as well."

We have 1.75 of tap and interconnect agreements, and we expect to term some of those out, and that's how we're expecting to help build out the pipe. We are currently at the 2/3, and now we've been at the 2/3 for a little bit here. Some of that is with the E&P companies taking a pause with their balance sheets, but we're starting to get some express interest with the E&P companies. But I do expect a good portion of the remaining pipe being filled will be being filled potentially within that Ohio market. We expect to receive the final environmental impact next month, with the final certificate in the first quarter of 2017.

Of course, no DTE earnings call would be complete without an update on my Tigers, so let me get that over with here.

And as always, I'll look forward to a brighter season next year. 
Now for an update on DTE, we're keeping today's call focused on the quarter and the current year, and as you can see, I'm the only participant here. We have other members of management team here for the Q&A session, and I will call on them throughout the Q&A, if needed. And I will also be deferring questions on long-term growth and strategy to the EI Conference, which is only a few weeks away. Gerry Anderson will be providing our normal detailed business update at EEI. There, he will discuss our 2017 early outlook and long-term growth plans as well as details about each of the business segments. So now I'd like to start on Slide 4.
As you know in September, we raised our operating EPS guidance for 2016. At that time, we increased the guidance midpoint $0.17 to a range of $5.09 to $5.35 from a range of $4.91 to $5.19. The guidance increases were driven by a lot of weather favorability at DTE Electric, favorability across all platforms at the gas storage and pipeline business and a strong year-to-date economic performance at our trading company.
In the past, we've talked about our reinvestment strategy, holding favorability until we see the summer months play out. Well, this summer was the hottest we've had in the past 60 years, and we were able to reinvest a lot of those revenues back into the system into aging infrastructure to improve customer liability.
We've invested a nominal amount this quarter. We're stepping up our reinvestment activity for the remainder of the year. Investments will primarily be in our infrastructure, with a focus on improving immediate and lasting benefits to our customers. 
Another area where we are seeing great results this year is in safety. Now we always start every meeting with a discussion on safety and it's our #1 priority in the company. And I'm particularly pleased to announce that year-to-date, our employees continue to have the best safety record in the company's history. 
And of course, we have had a major announcement in our gas storage and pipeline segment in the third quarter with the acquisition of a gas midstream assets in the heart of the Southwest Marcellus and dry Utica basin. The transaction complements our existing midstream business and provides a platform for new value creation and significant growth opportunities. I will be discussing the growth opportunities and their impact on our business at EEI. 
Now I'd like to go over the third quarter earning results on Slide 5. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $353 million, or $1.96 per share. For reference, our reported earnings were $1.88 per share and you can find a reconciliation with the third quarter reported operating earnings on Slide 17 of the appendix. For the quarter, our growth segments operating earnings were $343 million, or $1.91 per share. 
Now starting with the segments, with DTE Electric, it was higher by $71 million. This quarter was, as I indicated, when the warmest on record and drove much of this favorability. DTE Electric also supplemented a rate increase on August 1 as part of the ongoing rate case. This favorability was partially offset by increased expenses associated with the rate base growth. DTE Gas was higher by $7 million. This was primarily driven by gas, main line replacement surcharge and the storage and transport services. 
Our Power and Industrial Projects segments was higher by $3 million due primarily to higher REF earnings from additional location that came online in the fourth quarter of last year. These earnings were partially offset by lower earnings in our steel-related assets. Our Corporate and Other segment came in at $8 million favorable versus last year. This variance was mainly due to timing of taxes. Again, overall, the growth segment results for the quarter were $343 million, or $1.91 per share. 
Following with our Energy Trading segment, there were $10 million in operating earnings for the quarter and economic net income was $1 million. Please refer to Slide 15 in the appendix, which shows our standard view of the Energy Trading reconciliation of both economic and operating performance. So overall, DTE had a very strong third quarter. 
With that, moving on to Slide 6. I'd like to provide an update on our 2016 earnings guidance. As I mentioned, we recently raised 2016 guidance and are confident that we will land somewhere between the midpoint and upper end of our guidance this year. Year-to-date results are solid, and we are in good position to finish the year strong. You can see arrows next to each of the guidance numbers indicating where we think the year may play out for each segment. The green arrows indicate achieving the higher end of guidance, while the red arrows signifies the lower end. The positive signaling at DTE Electric is driven by additional weather experienced at the end of September. We had a very warm September. Our corporate and Other segment is trending towards the lower end of guidance driven by our tax true-ups. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect Energy Trading to have accounting income that covers their expenses, which puts them at the high-end of the guidance range. 
Now moving on to Slide 7. In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continue to support a long-term growth. Based on year-to-date results, we are updating our cash flow and capital expenditure guidance. Starting at the left side of the page, we're increasing cash from operations by $200 million due to the strong cash performance year-to-date. CapEx is increasing by $1.1 billion, which is primarily due to the recent acquisition of our gas midstream assets. We're also increasing our debt financing by $900 million, which was used in part for a recent our acquisition and also for general corporate uses. 
Taking a closer look at CapEx, on the right side of the page, we show capital expenditure by business units. We still expect to invest nearly $1.6 billion at the electric company and $430 million at the gas company. We have increased the nonutility guidance by $1.1 billion. This exchange, as I mentioned, captured the purchase of the gas midstream assets. This brings our total capital expenditures to nearly $3.8 billion for the year.
Now let's move on to Slide 8, with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong. We expect to end the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. Due to the strong year-to-date earnings and cash flow, we will not be issuing equity in 2016. In early October, DTE issued $1 billion of senior notes and $675 million of mandatory convertible securities to support the midstream acquisition. As a reminder, the $675 million of mandatory convertible securities will convert to common equity in October of 2019. 
Lastly, we ended the quarter with a very healthy liquidity position of $1.6 billion. Now wrapping up on Slide 9, I will summarize the quarter, then open the line for questions. We've had another successful quarter and are in a great position to achieve our EPS guidance this year. We are looking to extend our streak to 10 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. We are investing heavily in our utilities by upgrading our aging infrastructure, and we are executing on growth opportunities at our nonutility businesses, most notably, the gas storage and pipeline business, where we recently added a new platform for future growth. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, which sets up nicely for future growth opportunities as we enter a period of significant investment and begin to transform our electric generation fleet. 
Before I open the line for questions, once again, I'd like to remind everyone that Gerry Anderson will be giving our formal business update presentation at the upcoming EEI Conference on November 8, and we hope to see many of you at the conference. But if you can't make it in person, you can visit our Investor Relations website to listen in on the webcast. 
Now I'd like to open up for questions. So Tanisha, please open the line."

But I think given the focus and attention on that, there's still a chance it will happen in the lame-duck session. We have had some public support recently. The Michigan State Chamber came out publicly to support this bill so I think that's a very positive movement as well. In terms of what has changed is that, this bill in particular, is going to be a bipartisan bill. It is related to the state of Michigan, the energy reliability that's needed in the state of Michigan. So both parties need to be supportive and both parties want to get this energy legislation passed. So recently, there is some discussion on the renewable side potentially for that mandate. Currently, we're at 10%. Potentially, it will go up to 15%. That will help get some of the Democrats onboard as well. And some of the refining, as I was mentioning even when I've been on the road, that some of it is -- getting the details right around the retail open access and the capacity requirements related to that, so there is some finalization around that language.

We have 1.75 of tap and interconnect agreements, and we expect to term some of those out, and that's how we're expecting to help build out the pipe. We are currently at the 2/3, and now we've been at the 2/3 for a little bit here. Some of that is with the E&P companies taking a pause with their balance sheets, but we're starting to get some express interest with the E&P companies.

It does help complement legislation, so that will be one where we'll have the requirements for the retail open access providers and show what's your capacity plans. And with a lot of the local clearing requirements, they'll have to be in place given the fact that -- given the Peninsula state that we have, the limited amount of transmission, we need to have a lot of local generation.

Of course, no DTE earnings call would be complete without an update on my Tigers, so let me get that over with here. As it's disappointing to say that for the second straight season, the Tigers did not make the postseason. Really, the only solace here is that we were the last American team to be eliminated from contention this year, but I do like to congratulate 2 great Midwestern cities, Cleveland and Chicago, for being in the World Series. And as always, I'll look forward to a brighter season next year. 
Now for an update on DTE. We're keeping today's call focused on the quarter and the current year, and as you can see, I'm the only participant here. We have other members of management team here for the Q&A session, and I will call on them throughout the Q&A if needed. And I will also be deferring questions on long-term growth and strategy to the EEI Conference, which is only a few weeks away. Gerry Anderson will be providing our normal detailed business update at EEI. There, he will discuss our 2017 early outlook and long-term growth plans as well as details about each of the business segments. 
So now I'd like to start on Slide 4. As you know in September, we raised our operating EPS guidance for 2016. At that time, we increased the guidance midpoint $0.17 to a range of $5.09 to $5.35 from a range of $4.91 to $5.19. The guidance increases were driven by a lot of weather favorability at DTE Electric, favorability across all platforms at the gas storage and pipeline business and a strong year-to-date economic performance at our trading company.
In the past, we've talked about our reinvestment strategy, holding favorability until we see the summer months play out. Well, this summer was the hottest we've had in the past 50 years, and we were able to reinvest a lot of those revenues back into the system into aging infrastructure to improve customer liability.
We invested a nominal amount this quarter. We're stepping up our reinvestment activity for the remainder of the year. Investments will primarily be in our infrastructure, with a focus on improving immediate and lasting benefits to our customers. 
Another area where we are seeing great results this year is in safety. Now we always start every meeting with a discussion on safety and it's our #1 priority in the company. And I'm particularly pleased to announce that year-to-date, our employees continue to have the best safety record in the company's history. 
And of course, we have had a major announcement in our gas storage and pipeline segment in the third quarter with the acquisition of a gas midstream assets in the heart of the Southwest Marcellus and dry Utica basin. The transaction complements our existing midstream business and provides a platform for new value creation and significant growth opportunities. I will be discussing the growth opportunities and their impact on our business at EEI. 
Now I'd like to go over the third quarter earning results on Slide 5. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $353 million or $1.96 per share. For reference, our reported earnings were $1.88 per share, and you can find a reconciliation with the third quarter reported operating earnings on Slide 17 of the appendix. For the quarter, our growth segments operating earnings were $343 million or $1.91 per share. 
Now starting with the segments. With DTE Electric, it was higher by $71 million. This quarter was, as I indicated, one of the warmest on record and drove much of this favorability. DTE Electric also supplemented a rate increase on August 1 as part of the ongoing rate case. This favorability was partially offset by increased expenses associated with the rate base growth. DTE Gas was higher by $7 million. This was primarily driven by gas, main line replacement surcharge and the storage and transport services. 
Our Power and Industrial Projects segments was higher by $3 million due primarily to higher REF earnings from additional location that came online in the fourth quarter of last year. These earnings were partially offset by lower earnings in our steel-related assets. Our Corporate and Other segment came in at $8 million favorable versus last year. This variance was mainly due to timing of taxes. Again, overall, the growth segment results for the quarter were $343 million, or $1.91 per share. 
Finally with our Energy Trading segment. There were $10 million in operating earnings for the quarter and economic net income was $1 million. Please refer to Slide 15 of the appendix, which shows our standard view of the Energy Trading reconciliation of both economic and operating performance. So overall, DTE had a very strong third quarter. 
With that, moving on to Slide 6. I'd like to provide an update on our 2016 earnings guidance. As I mentioned, we recently raised 2016 guidance and are confident that we will land somewhere between the midpoint and upper end of our guidance this year. Year-to-date results are solid, and we are in good position to finish the year strong. You can see arrows next to each of the guidance numbers indicating where we think the year may play out for each segment. The green arrows indicate achieving the higher end of guidance, while the red arrow signifies the lower end. The positive signaling at DTE Electric is driven by additional weather experienced at the end of September. We had a very warm September. Our corporate and Other segment is trending towards the lower end of guidance driven by our tax true-ups. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect Energy Trading to have accounting income that covers their expenses, which puts them at the high-end of the guidance range. 
Now moving on to Slide 7. In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continue to support a long-term growth. Based on year-to-date results, we are updating our cash flow and capital expenditure guidance. Starting at the left side of the page, we're increasing cash from operations by $200 million due to the strong cash performance year-to-date. CapEx is increasing by $1.1 billion, which is primarily due to the recent acquisition of our gas midstream assets. We're also increasing our debt financing by $900 million, which was used in part for a recent acquisition and also for general corporate uses. 
Taking a closer look at CapEx, on the right side of the page, we show capital expenditure by business units. We still expect to invest nearly $1.6 billion at the electric company and $430 million at the gas company. We have increased the nonutility guidance by $1.1 billion. This change, as I mentioned, captured the purchase of the gas midstream assets. This brings our total capital expenditures to nearly $3.8 billion for the year.
Now let's move on to Slide 8, with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong. We expect to end the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. Due to the strong year-to-date earnings and cash flow, we will not be issuing equity in 2016. In early October, DTE issued $1 billion of senior notes and $675 million of mandatory convertible securities to support the midstream acquisition. As a reminder, the $675 million of mandatory convertible securities will convert to common equity in October of 2019. 
Lastly, we ended the quarter with a very healthy liquidity position of $1.6 billion. Now wrapping up on Slide 9, I will summarize the quarter, then open the line for questions. We've had another successful quarter and are in a great position to achieve our EPS guidance this year. We are looking to extend our streak to 10 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. We are investing heavily in our utilities by upgrading our aging infrastructure, and we are executing on growth opportunities at our nonutility businesses, most notably, the gas storage and pipeline business, where we recently added a new platform for future growth. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, which sets up nicely for future growth opportunities as we enter a period of significant investment and begin to transform our electric generation fleet. 
Before I open the line for questions, once again, I'd like to remind everyone that Gerry Anderson will be giving our formal business update presentation at the upcoming EEI Conference on November 8, and we hope to see many of you at the conference. But if you can't make it in person, you can visit our Investor Relations website to listen in on the webcast. 
Now I'd like to open up for questions. So Tanisha, please open the line."

There's a lot of public communication that's happening out there. Senator Nofs has made this a priority for that. It is going to be a challenge potentially, given the time frame left. But I think given the focus and attention on that, there's still a chance it will happen in the lame-duck session. We have had some public support recently. The Michigan State Chamber came out publicly to support this bill so I think that's a very positive movement as well. In terms of what has changed is that, this bill in particular, is going to be a bipartisan bill. It is related to the state of Michigan, the energy reliability that's needed in the state of Michigan. So both parties need to be supportive and both parties want to get this energy legislation passed. So recently, there is some discussion on the renewable side potentially for that mandate. Currently, we're at 10%. Potentially, it will go up to 15%. That will help get some of the Democrats onboard as well. And some of the refining, as I was mentioning even when I've been on the road, that some of it is -- getting the details right around the retail open access and the capacity requirements related to that, so there is some finalization around that language. I know there is a new MISO tariff that may be out there as well that's going to help support and complement legislation as well."

We have 1.75 of tap and interconnect agreements, and we expect to term some of those out, and that's how we're expecting to help build out the pipe. We are currently at the 2/3, and now we've been at the 2/3 for a little bit here. Some of that is with the E&P companies taking a pause with their balance sheets, but we're starting to get some express interest with the E&P companies.

There is a great pipe in the regions that we want to be in, which is the Utica Marcellus. 40% of the gas in the country is going to be delivered from this region. It also fits within our footprint and potentially help support the NEXUS Pipeline. So at this point in time, we are looking at developing multiple pipe platforms, growth platforms, our NEXUS platform, and obviously, we'll be putting a lot of push and development on that. And then in this pipeline in particular, there's a lot of upside potential given the expansion opportunities here and some new greenfield around the pipe that has yet to be drilled and put into the pipes. I'd say it's -- we're going to be -- the focus will be on the development of this pipe. There may be some smaller bolt-on type of acquisitions potentially.
