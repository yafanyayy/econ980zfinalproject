Varian is reporting revenues and earnings above our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, while managing through some challenging conditions in our markets, and we're raising our earnings guidance for the year. In",912,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Varian is reporting revenues and earnings above our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, while managing through some challenging conditions in our markets, and we're raising our earnings guidance for the year. In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $0.99 per diluted share and $0.91 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Revenues of $757 million, up 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Soft orders in our Oncology Systems business the expected declines in Imaging Components orders and revenues and good news on the tax fronts with a permanent R&D tax credit and the suspension of the medical device excise tax. 
Focusing on operational highlights. In our Oncology business, gross orders totaled $533 million for the quarter, down 5% in dollars and down 1% in constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas for the quarter increased by 3% in both dollars and constant currency with the fastest growth in Latin America. Gross orders in North America rose by 2% in dollars and constant currency. In EMEA, gross orders declined by 14% in dollars and 5% in constant currency. Gross orders in APAC declined by 12% in dollars and 7% in constant currency with continued market contraction in Japan and a modest decline in China. 
Global markets have been weakened by ongoing political unrest, weak oil prices and economic uncertainty. In EMEA, for example, Russia announced further delays in its cancer plan. Germany scaled back investments, and the Middle East was negatively impacted by political unrest and falling oil prices. 
On a positive note, in EMEA we received an order from the U.K.'s National Health Service for our further 10 TrueBeam Systems during the quarter. The National Health System has now ordered more than 50 TrueBeams in the last few years for its cancer programs. Economic uncertainty was also a prime cause of weakness in Japan, which led to an overall orders decline in APAC. 
In China, gross orders declined slightly. As of the end of the first quarter, we continue to see hospitals in China aiming to invest in advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery systems for their cancer patients. We booked several orders for EDGE radiosurgery systems in China during the quarter. 
In the Americas, the multimillion-dollar Siemens replacement project in Argentina and a key Ministry of Health win in Chile drove the growth in Latin America, while North America continue to move forward with investments in our new product platforms to replace aging systems. 
We're focused on global market development through our access to care initiative, an educational program that seeks to bridge the gap between the growing need for modern radiotherapy treatment machines in developing countries and the lack of trained personnel to operate them. This program is already working in Africa and Vietnam, and we took steps during the quarter to initiate this program in India to an educational partnership with Apollo Hospitals Group. This program will train radiation technologists in India. 
We made good progress with our software business during the quarter. Licenses for RapidPlan, our tool for enhancing efficiency and quality and treatment planning, have tripled since the end of the fiscal year and are now installed at over 50 sites. Clinical networks, including a health care system in Victoria, Australia that took 4 licenses during the quarter, are rebuilding treatment capabilities around RapidPlan. 
Turning to our Oncology service business. Orders were up 1% in dollars, but up 6% in constant currency compared with a strong year-ago quarter. 
Let me turn now Imaging Components, where orders shrank by 22% to $127 million for the quarter, and revenues fell by 15% to $141 million. Beginning in the second half of last fiscal year, this business has been confronted with currency-related pricing pressures, weak market conditions for Security and Inspection Products and an in-sourcing at a major panel customer. These challenges, together with excess TrueBeam inventory at a key customer, contributed to the declines in this business during the quarter. Volumes for tubes were down in the quarter, while demand for our higher-margin dynamic fluoroscopic panels increased and led to a sequential improvement in the growth margin for Imaging Components. 
A recent acquisitions, MeVis and Claymount, gained momentum in the quarter and are performing well. As a reminder, we're aiming for about $50 million in revenue from these newly acquired businesses this fiscal year. 
Moving to protons. We made good progress with installations. During the quarter, we turned over the first room of the Maryland Proton Therapy Center for clinical commissioning, and first treatments are slated to begin next month. We have successfully extracted beams from the cyclotron at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where a patient treatments are scheduled to begin before the end of the year. Installation is also underway at the Paul Institute in Switzerland, and we are scheduled to begin installations at sites in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia later this year. 
Proton order activity was quiet in the quarter, but our prospects for booking several more systems this year continue to look good. 
Before I hand it over to Elisha, I'd like to say how proud I am that Varian has been honored for its commitment to sustainability by being included for the second year in a row on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations list, which compares to sustainability performance of some 4,600 companies globally. This was announced last week at the World Economic Forum in Dow's. 
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 7% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $55 million, bringing net orders for the company to $617 million. 
Now let me walk you through the P&L. First quarter revenues for the total company increased 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 5% gain in revenues during the quarter with a 9% gain in constant currency. There was a significant geographic mix shift towards international revenues, which grew 21% in dollars and 31% in constant currency versus a year-ago quarter, while North American revenues declined by about 10%. 
International business constituted 55% of total Oncology revenues in the quarter. Imaging Components posted a first quarter revenue decline of 15% with decreases in tubes, panels and Security and Inspection Products. 
Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of $27 million, up $18 million from the year-ago quarter as we continued to make progress on projects in backlog. 
The total company gross margin for the quarter was 41.1%, down as expected by a little more than 3 points. Oncology Systems gross margin also fell by about 3 points to 42.4% due to geographic and product mix shifts as well as minor currency effects. Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by about 1.5 points to 40.7% due largely to lower pricing and volumes. 
First quarter SG&A expenses were $124 million or 16% of revenue, an improvement of about 1 point as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. First quarter R&D expenses were $60 million or 8% of revenues, equal to the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue. First quarter operating earnings totaled $128 million or 17% of revenue, down about 2 points as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter and in line with our expectation for the quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $19 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 24.8%, down almost 4 points from the year-ago quarter due largely to the geographic mix of profits and the R&D tax credit that was reinstated in late December. We now expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased almost 4 million from the year-ago quarter to 97.8 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.99 for the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $953 million, debt of $728 million and stockholders equity of $1.6 billion. DSO at 99 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter due to a lower mix of Imaging Components business, a higher mix of proton business and the timing of collections in Oncology. 
First quarter cash flow from operations fell slightly from the year-ago period to $77 million. Primary uses of cash were $27 million for CapEx and $192 million for the repurchase of 2.4 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 7 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2016. 
Now back to Dow for the outlook."

So you sound a little bit may be more cautious on some of the European and given that the Middle East is in your European number on the Oncology side a little more cautious on Europe and APAC. Is that the right read here? And I guess, as I look back over the last several quarters, we've seen Oncology orders in both those markets in negative territory. I think 3 out of the last 4 quarters. Is that kind of where we should level set?

When you look at the last 12 months in Oncology in dollars, it's down 2%. In constant currency, it's up 4%. I mean, this first quarter is not the greatest growth that we've ever had. Our funnel remains very good, so we like what we see. The fourth quarter was huge for us in Europe. The constant currency and dollar growth in Europe was outstanding in Q4. So our Q4 was 12.5% constant currency growth last quarter. So maybe there was a little bit of quarter-over-quarter balancing going on. So I think the 12-month trailing is kind of what we're feeling right now. Clearly, we're reading the papers like everybody and some of the macroeconomic weakness in Europe is real. I mean, we did have a light Q1. But I think we're -- we still see markets growing in that low to mid-single-digit range at this point. We haven't seen anything that would pull us off that. Japan has been kind of the ongoing structural change in Japan. In China, we did have a win in the quarter that was protested. So I mean, we're very close to flat in China. Our funnel remains very good in China. So I think Japan is probably going to be kind of more of same. That's been a pretty consistent story the last few quarters. But I do think China will come back that order that was protested was a fairly large order. So is that within our numbers, then China would have been great. But anyway, I mean, those are the kinds of things that happen around the quarter. I'd say over the long haul, looking at the last 12 months, we haven't seen anything that would, at this point, pull us off a market growth number in that kind of 3 to 5 range."

Since you guided back in October, the euro's kind of worked a little bit more against you, I think a little bit to a stronger dollar against the euro since you guided some of the emerging market currency is still going the wrong way. So as I look at the dime raised to guidance here, how much was med tech tax in R&D driving that dime raise? How much kind of in the guidance number is coming from those 2 things? How much of an incremental currency headwind with there, if any, included in your guidance? And then maybe how are you think about the core underlying business?

So I'm wondering if you can share with us whether that trend continued this quarter, first of all, and what the drivers share might be outside of FX because you've kind of actually had a nice mix shift in revenue towards the U.S. up until this quarter.

For the year, we still think Oncology is right in that 43% range. So holding in line with our long-term expectations.

But there was this nice external validation of that last quarter with the global task force on the utilization of radiation Oncology published in the Lancet journal that called for [ph] thousands more machines. Basically, 2.5x the installed base that we have today and really asking international organizations to help countries develop cancer plans.

I was guessing it was going to be international. And I was curious, Elisha, if you could talk about the growth rates of service and software for 2015 kind of between international and U.S. and how that's going to change in '16 really trying to understand what this business can look like if we did get into a lower unit kind of environment. And it goes to my second question around the guidance of revenue. Seems like you're putting a lot in the fourth quarter, if I'm reading you right about pull in revenue out of the third quarter, Elisha, in the second quarter. So I'm just curious, where does that come from? Is that more Oncology or proton or X-ray?

We still have a little bit quarter-over-quarter impact in this second fiscal quarter that we're currently in. But as we -- assuming currency stay where they are today, that impact gets reduced significantly if we go into Q3 and Q4. And so obviously, we expect the dollar growth rates are going to be higher in the second half of the year. The other thing that we anniversary-ed that was huge last year is the pricing impact on particularly the flat panel business. And all of the declines that we saw there, which again, were laid in second quarter and really large in Q3 and Q4. So our hope is that we're going to get a little more linear in our Oncology business as we go through this fiscal year. And if you look at the guidance for the first half versus the full year, it's right around at the midpoint, 45% of the year, and that is very common with historical performance, having about 45% of our EPS in the first half."

311907,320073825,921929,"Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon, and welcome. Varian is reporting revenues and earnings above our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 while managing through some challenging conditions in our markets, and we're raising our earnings guidance for the year. In",913,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Varian is reporting revenues and earnings above our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 while managing through some challenging conditions in our markets, and we're raising our earnings guidance for the year. In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $0.99 per diluted share and $0.91 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Revenues of $757 million, up 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Soft orders in our Oncology Systems business, the expected declines in Imaging Components orders and revenues, and good news on the tax fronts with a permanent R&D tax credit and the suspension of the medical device excise tax. 
Focusing on operational highlights. In our Oncology business, gross orders totaled $533 million for the quarter, down 5% in dollars and down 1% in constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas for the quarter increased by 3% in both dollars and constant currency with the fastest growth in Latin America. Gross orders in North America rose by 2% in dollars and constant currency. In EMEA, gross orders declined by 14% in dollars and 5% in constant currency. Gross orders in APAC declined by 12% in dollars and 7% in constant currency with continued market contraction in Japan and a modest decline in China. 
Global markets have been weakened by ongoing political unrest, weak oil prices and economic uncertainty. In EMEA, for example, Russia announced further delays in its cancer plan. Germany scaled back investments, and the Middle East was negatively impacted by political unrest and falling oil prices. 
On a positive note, in EMEA, we received an order from the U.K.'s National Health Service for a further 10 TrueBeam Systems during the quarter. The National Health System has now ordered more than 50 TrueBeams in the last few years for its cancer programs. Economic uncertainty was also a prime cause of weakness in Japan, which led to an overall orders decline in APAC. 
In China, gross orders declined slightly. As of the end of the first quarter, we continue to see hospitals in China aiming to invest in advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery systems for their cancer patients. We booked several orders for EDGE radiosurgery systems in China during the quarter. 
In the Americas, the multimillion-dollar Siemens replacement project in Argentina and a key Ministry of Health win in Chile drove the growth in Latin America while North America continued to move forward with investments in our new product platforms to replace aging systems. 
We're focused on global market development through our access to care initiative, an educational program that seeks to bridge the gap between the growing need for modern radiotherapy treatment machines in developing countries and the lack of trained personnel to operate them. This program is already working in Africa and Vietnam, and we took steps during the quarter to initiate this program in India to an educational partnership with Apollo Hospitals group. This program will train radiation technologists in India. 
We made good progress with our software business during the quarter. Licenses for RapidPlan, our tool for enhancing efficiency and quality in treatment planning, have tripled since the end of the fiscal year and are now installed at over 50 sites. Clinical networks, including a health care system in Victoria, Australia that took 4 licenses during the quarter, are rebuilding treatment capabilities around RapidPlan. 
Turning to our Oncology service business. Orders were up 1% in dollars but up 6% in constant currency compared with a strong year-ago quarter. 
Let me turn now to Imaging Components, where orders shrank by 22% to $127 million for the quarter, and revenues fell by 15% to $141 million. Beginning in the second half of last fiscal year, this business has been confronted with currency-related pricing pressures, weak market conditions for Security and Inspection Products and an in-sourcing at a major panel customer. These challenges, together with excess tube inventory at a key customer, contributed to the declines in this business during the quarter. Volumes for tubes were down in the quarter, while demand for our higher-margin dynamic fluoroscopic panels increased and led to a sequential improvement in the growth margin for Imaging Components. 
Our recent acquisitions, MeVis and Claymount, gained momentum in the quarter and are performing well. As a reminder, we're aiming for about $50 million in revenue from these newly acquired businesses this fiscal year. 
Moving to protons. We made good progress with installations. During the quarter, we turned over the first room of the Maryland Proton Therapy Center for clinical commissioning, and first treatments are slated to begin next month. We have successfully extracted beams from the cyclotron at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where patient treatments are scheduled to begin before the end of the year. Installation is also underway at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, and we are scheduled to begin installations at sites in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia later this year. 
Proton order activity was quiet in the quarter, but our prospects for booking several more systems this year continue to look good. 
Before I hand it over to Elisha, I'd like to say how proud I am that Varian has been honored for its commitment to sustainability by being included for the second year in a row on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations list, which compares the sustainability performance of some 4,600 companies globally. This was announced last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos. 
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 7% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $55 million, bringing net orders for the company to $617 million. 
Now let me walk you through the P&L. First quarter revenues for the total company increased 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 5% gain in revenues during the quarter with a 9% gain in constant currency. There was a significant geographic mix shift towards international revenues, which grew 21% in dollars and 31% in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter, while North American revenues declined by about 10%. 
International business constituted 55% of total Oncology revenues in the quarter. Imaging Components posted a first quarter revenue decline of 15% with decreases in tubes, panels and Security and Inspection Products. 
Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of $27 million, up $18 million from the year-ago quarter as we continue to make progress on projects in backlog. 
The total company gross margin for the quarter was 41.1%, down as expected by a little more than 3 points. Oncology Systems gross margin also fell by about 3 points to 42.4% due to geographic and product mix shifts as well as minor currency effects. Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by about 1.5 points to 40.7% due largely to lower pricing and volumes. 
First quarter SG&A expenses were $124 million or 16% of revenue, an improvement of about 1 point as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. First quarter R&D expenses were $60 million or 8% of revenues, equal to the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue. First quarter operating earnings totaled $128 million or 17% of revenue, down about 2 points as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter and in line with our expectation for the quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $19 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 24.8%, down almost 4 points from the year-ago quarter due largely to the geographic mix of profits and the R&D tax credit that was reinstated in late December. We now expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased almost 4 million from the year-ago quarter to 97.8 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.99 for the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $953 million, debt of $728 million and stockholders equity of $1.6 billion. DSO at 99 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter due to a lower mix of Imaging Components business, a higher mix of proton business and the timing of collections in Oncology. 
First quarter cash flow from operations fell slightly from the year-ago period to $77 million. Primary uses of cash were $27 million for CapEx and $192 million for the repurchase of 2.4 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 7 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2016. 
Now back to Dow for the outlook."

So you sound a little bit maybe more cautious on some of the European and, given that the Middle East is in your European number on the Oncology side, a little more cautious on Europe and APAC. Is that the right read here? And I guess, as I look back over the last several quarters, we've seen Oncology orders in both those markets in negative territory, I think, 3 out of the last 4 quarters. Is that kind of where we should level set? I know you don't guide to orders, but just given your comments and kind of the last several quarter trendline, is that kind of where we should be still hanging out with our thoughts for the year?"

When you look at the last 12 months in Oncology in dollars, it's down 2%. In constant currency, it's up 4%. I mean this first quarter is not the greatest growth that we've ever had. Our funnel remains very good, so we like what we see. The fourth quarter was huge for us in Europe. Constant currency and dollar growth in Europe was outstanding in Q4. So our Q4 was 12.5% constant currency growth last quarter. So maybe there was a little bit of quarter-over-quarter balancing going on. So I think the 12-month trailing is kind of what we're feeling right now. Clearly, we're reading the papers like everybody and some of the macroeconomic weakness in Europe is real. I mean we did have a light Q1. But I think we're -- we still see markets growing in that low- to mid-single-digit range at this point. We haven't seen anything that would pull us off that. Japan has been kind of the ongoing structural change in Japan. In China, we did have a win in the quarter that was protested. So I mean we're very close to flat in China. Our funnel remains very good in China. I mean I think Japan is probably going to be kind of more of same. That's been a pretty consistent story the last few quarters. But I do think China will come back. That order that was protested was a fairly large order. So if that was in our numbers, then China would have been great. But anyway, I mean, those are the kinds of things that happen around the quarter. I'd say over the long haul, looking at the last 12 months, we haven't seen anything that would, at this point, pull us off of market growth number in that kind of 3 to 5 range."

Since you guided back in October, the euro's kind of worked a little bit more against you, I think a little bit a stronger dollar against the euro since you guided some of the emerging market currency is still going the wrong way. So as I look at the $0.10 raised to guidance here, how much was med tech tax in R&D driving that $0.10 raise? How much is kind of in the guidance number is coming from those 2 things? How much of an incremental currency headwind was there, if any, included in your guidance? And then maybe how are you thinking about the core underlying business? So just trying to bucket kind of those 3 areas on what contributed to the dime change in guidance."

Little bit on share repurchase was a little bit more than we historically done but in line with that 1 million to 2 million shares per quarter. I think your next question's going to be why aren't you giving me that $0.05? And I'm still a little black and blue after Q4, frankly. And when we missed on that revenue number, it's very early in the year. And I think this just had to do with some timing. And I think Oncology did a fantastic job and probably pulled a little bit revenue forward from Q2 and Q3 to make sure we didn't have a repeat performance. But for the year, we -- it still looks good with the revenue guidance and the EPS from where we stand today. Currency, from when I last guided, has been relatively stable. I mean it may have hurt us, I don't know, I think I was at $1.12 versus $1.09. But again, we built some of that into the range for the guidance when we give it."

I don't know, it's about 36% in fiscal '14 down to 31% in fiscal '15. And that's just, obviously, just the product side. So I'm wondering if you can share with us whether that trend continued this quarter, first of all, and what the driver share might be outside of FX because you've kind of actually had a nice mix shift in revenue towards the U.S. up until this quarter. And -- so I'm wondering why product margins in Oncology would be down as much as they were."

So we fully anticipated we were going to have margin declines in Oncology and for the total company, and I think that was reflected in the guidance that we gave last quarter. So for the year, I still expect, even with the -- we still had some currency impact in Q1. We'll have a little bit in Q2 and then it should anniversary. For the year, we still think Oncology is right in that 43% range, so holding in line with our long-term expectations. I would point out service was a bigger proportion in the year-ago quarter, and that is one of our highest-margin product lines. So that impacted it as well. But I think Oncology is performing well at this point."

The panel pricing declines should anniversary in the second half, and we're still absorbing the loss of major -- of a major customer that went in-sourcing on flat panel. That's probably not going to -- that's happening every quarter to us and it probably doesn't anniversary until Q4-ish. Toshiba's volume. The good news is most of that business is a service business. So that is going to continue to need to be replaced, but their ongoing forward production with the uncertainty around their sale and kind of who picks it up, et cetera, we might see a little bit of a volume adjustment there. As I did say in the script, they do have some inventory that they're working through as they kind of manage through this whole thing. The good news is the MeVis and Claymount acquisitions seem to be performing for us. So we're looking for a return to growth, I think, consistent with what we said before in 2017 and 2018."

And now if you look back when economic times were bad, we weathered those storms pretty well. It's not to say that we might see something in our orders if the economy really turns south. But there was this nice external validation of that last quarter with the global task force on the utilization of radiation Oncology published in the Lancet journal that called for thousands more machines. Basically, 2.5x the installed base that we have today and really asking international organizations to help countries develop cancer plans. So especially outside of U.S., a huge focus on utilizing radiation therapy for cancer. I think one of our big challenges, I mentioned in the script there, is making sure the people side of that comes along with it because we've got to have the people to be able to do the work. But I think as you look at the long term health of the Oncology business, the franchise is in as good a product position as we've ever had. And I think the market remains in the long term, very, very solid. Now on the Imaging business, we're clearly going through a big storm right now. And we still like the fundamentals of the business.

If you could kind of breakout how much of it is maybe just software only. And then particularly, I'm interested in trying to figure out the opportunity of this. And I was guessing it was going to be international. And I was curious, Elisha, if you could talk about the growth rates of service and software for 2015 kind of between international and U.S. and how that's going to change in '16. Really trying to understand what this business can look like if we did get into a lower unit kind of environment. And it goes to my second question around the guidance of revenue. Seems like you're putting a lot in the fourth quarter, if I'm reading you right, about pull in revenue out of the third quarter, Elisha, in the second quarter. So I'm just curious, where does that come from? Is it more Oncology or proton or X-ray?

We're looking out at the full year. We are confident from where we sit today. I think you're correct that more growth is going to come in the second half. But the reason for that is we anniversary-ed 2 really big effects of last year. The first being FX will still have a little bit of quarter-over-quarter impact in this second fiscal quarter that we're currently in. But as we -- assuming currency stay where they are today, that impact gets reduced significantly if we go into Q3 and Q4. And so obviously, we expect the dollar growth rates are going to be higher in the second half of the year. The other thing that we anniversary-ed that was huge last year is the pricing impact on particularly the flat panel business. And all of the declines that we saw there, which again, were late in second quarter and really large in Q3 and Q4. So our hope is that we're going to get a little more linear in our Oncology business as we go through this fiscal year. And if you look at the guidance for the first half versus the full year, it's right around at the midpoint, 45% of the year, and that is very common with historical performance, having about 45% of our EPS in the first half."

311907,320073825,921975,"Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon, and welcome. Varian is reporting revenues and earnings above our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 while managing through some challenging conditions in our markets, and we're raising our earnings guidance for the year. In",913,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Varian is reporting revenues and earnings above our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 while managing through some challenging conditions in our markets, and we're raising our earnings guidance for the year. In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $0.99 per diluted share and $0.91 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Revenues of $757 million, up 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Soft orders in our Oncology Systems business, the expected declines in Imaging Components orders and revenues, and good news on the tax fronts with a permanent R&D tax credit and the suspension of the medical device excise tax. 
Focusing on operational highlights. In our Oncology business, gross orders totaled $533 million for the quarter, down 5% in dollars and down 1% in constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas for the quarter increased by 3% in both dollars and constant currency with the fastest growth in Latin America. Gross orders in North America rose by 2% in dollars and constant currency. In EMEA, gross orders declined by 14% in dollars and 5% in constant currency. Gross orders in APAC declined by 12% in dollars and 7% in constant currency with continued market contraction in Japan and a modest decline in China. 
Global markets have been weakened by ongoing political unrest, weak oil prices and economic uncertainty. In EMEA, for example, Russia announced further delays in its cancer plan. Germany scaled back investments, and the Middle East was negatively impacted by political unrest and falling oil prices. 
On a positive note, in EMEA, we received an order from the U.K.'s National Health Service for a further 10 TrueBeam Systems during the quarter. The National Health System has now ordered more than 50 TrueBeams in the last few years for its cancer programs. Economic uncertainty was also a prime cause of weakness in Japan, which led to an overall orders decline in APAC. 
In China, gross orders declined slightly. As of the end of the first quarter, we continue to see hospitals in China aiming to invest in advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery systems for their cancer patients. We booked several orders for EDGE radiosurgery systems in China during the quarter. 
In the Americas, the multimillion-dollar Siemens replacement project in Argentina and a key Ministry of Health win in Chile drove the growth in Latin America while North America continued to move forward with investments in our new product platforms to replace aging systems. 
We're focused on global market development through our access to care initiative, an educational program that seeks to bridge the gap between the growing need for modern radiotherapy treatment machines in developing countries and the lack of trained personnel to operate them. This program is already working in Africa and Vietnam, and we took steps during the quarter to initiate this program in India to an educational partnership with Apollo Hospitals group. This program will train radiation technologists in India. 
We made good progress with our software business during the quarter. Licenses for RapidPlan, our tool for enhancing efficiency and quality in treatment planning, have tripled since the end of the fiscal year and are now installed at over 50 sites. Clinical networks, including a health care system in Victoria, Australia that took 4 licenses during the quarter, are rebuilding treatment capabilities around RapidPlan. 
Turning to our Oncology service business. Orders were up 1% in dollars but up 6% in constant currency compared with a strong year-ago quarter. 
Let me turn now to Imaging Components, where orders shrank by 22% to $127 million for the quarter, and revenues fell by 15% to $141 million. Beginning in the second half of last fiscal year, this business has been confronted with currency-related pricing pressures, weak market conditions for Security and Inspection Products and an in-sourcing at a major panel customer. These challenges, together with excess tube inventory at a key customer, contributed to the declines in this business during the quarter. Volumes for tubes were down in the quarter, while demand for our higher-margin dynamic fluoroscopic panels increased and led to a sequential improvement in the growth margin for Imaging Components. 
Our recent acquisitions, MeVis and Claymount, gained momentum in the quarter and are performing well. As a reminder, we're aiming for about $50 million in revenue from these newly acquired businesses this fiscal year. 
Moving to protons. We made good progress with installations. During the quarter, we turned over the first room of the Maryland Proton Therapy Center for clinical commissioning, and first treatments are slated to begin next month. We have successfully extracted beam from the cyclotron at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where patient treatments are scheduled to begin before the end of the year. Installation is also underway at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, and we are scheduled to begin installations at sites in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia later this year. 
Proton order activity was quiet in the quarter, but our prospects for booking several more systems this year continue to look good. 
Before I hand it over to Elisha, I'd like to say how proud I am that Varian has been honored for its commitment to sustainability by being included for the second year in a row on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations list, which compares the sustainability performance of some 4,600 companies globally. This was announced last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos. 
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 7% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $55 million, bringing net orders for the company to $617 million. 
Now let me walk you through the P&L. First quarter revenues for the total company increased 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 5% gain in revenues during the quarter with a 9% gain in constant currency. There was a significant geographic mix shift towards international revenues, which grew 21% in dollars and 31% in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter, while North American revenues declined by about 10%. 
International business constituted 55% of total Oncology revenues in the quarter. Imaging Components posted a first quarter revenue decline of 15% with decreases in tubes, panels and Security and Inspection Products. 
Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of $27 million, up $18 million from the year-ago quarter as we continue to make progress on projects in backlog. 
The total company gross margin for the quarter was 41.1%, down as expected by a little more than 3 points. Oncology Systems gross margin also fell by about 3 points to 42.4% due to geographic and product mix shifts as well as minor currency effects. Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by about 1.5 points to 40.7% due largely to lower pricing and volumes. 
First quarter SG&A expenses were $124 million or 16% of revenue, an improvement of about 1 point as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. First quarter R&D expenses were $60 million or 8% of revenues, equal to the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue. First quarter operating earnings totaled $128 million or 17% of revenue, down about 2 points as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter and in line with our expectation for the quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $19 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 24.8%, down almost 4 points from the year-ago quarter due largely to the geographic mix of profits and the R&D tax credit that was reinstated in late December. We now expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased almost 4 million from the year-ago quarter to 97.8 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.99 for the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $953 million, debt of $728 million and stockholders’ equity of $1.6 billion. DSO at 99 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter due to a lower mix of Imaging Components business, a higher mix of proton business and the timing of collections in Oncology. 
First quarter cash flow from operations fell slightly from the year-ago period to $77 million. Primary uses of cash were $27 million for CapEx and $192 million for the repurchase of 2.4 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 7 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2016. 
Now back to Dow for the outlook."

So you sound a little bit maybe more cautious on some of the European and, given that the Middle East is in your European number on the Oncology side, a little more cautious on Europe and APAC. Is that the right read here? And I guess, as I look back over the last several quarters, we've seen Oncology orders in both those markets in negative territory, I think, 3 out of the last 4 quarters. Is that kind of where we should level set? I know you don't guide to orders, but just given your comments and kind of the last several quarter trendline, is that kind of where we should be still hanging out with our thoughts for the year?"

When you look at the last 12 months in Oncology in dollars, it's down 2%. In constant currency, it's up 4%. I mean this first quarter is not the greatest growth that we've ever had. Our funnel remains very good, so we like what we see. The fourth quarter was huge for us in Europe. Constant currency and dollar growth in Europe was outstanding in Q4. So our Q4 was 12.5% constant currency growth last quarter. So maybe there was a little bit of quarter-over-quarter balancing going on. So I think the 12-month trailing is kind of what we're feeling right now. Clearly, we're reading the papers like everybody and some of the macroeconomic weakness in Europe is real. I mean we did have a light Q1. But I think we're -- we still see markets growing in that low- to mid-single-digit range at this point. We haven't seen anything that would pull us off that. Japan has been kind of the ongoing structural change in Japan. In China, we did have a win in the quarter that was protested. So I mean we were very close to flat in China. Our funnel remains very good in China. I mean I think Japan is probably going to be kind of more of same. That's been a pretty consistent story the last few quarters. But I do think China will come back. The order that was protested was a fairly large order. So if that was in our numbers, then China would have been great. But anyway, I mean, those are the kinds of things that happen around the quarter. I'd say over the long haul, looking at the last 12 months, we haven't seen anything that would, at this point, pull us off of market growth number in that kind of 3 to 5 range."

Since you guided back in October, the euro's kind of worked a little bit more against you, I think a little bit a stronger dollar against the euro since you guided some of the emerging market currency is still going the wrong way. So as I look at the $0.10 raise to guidance here, how much was med tech tax and R&D driving that $0.10 raise? How much is kind of in the guidance number is coming from those 2 things? How much of an incremental currency headwind was there, if any, included in your guidance? And then maybe how are you thinking about the core underlying business? So just trying to bucket kind of those 3 areas on what contributed to the dime change in guidance."

Little bit on share repurchase, was a little bit more than we historically done but in line with that 1 million to 2 million shares per quarter. I think your next question's going to be why aren't you giving me that $0.05? And I'm still a little black and blue after Q4, frankly. And when we missed on that revenue number, it's very early in the year. And I think this just had to do with some timing. And I think Oncology did a fantastic job and probably pulled a little bit revenue forward from Q2 and Q3 to make sure we didn't have a repeat performance. But for the year, we -- it still looks good with the revenue guidance and the EPS from where we stand today. 
Currency, from when I last guided, has been relatively stable. I mean it may have hurt us, I don't know, I think I was at $1.12 versus $1.09. But again, we built some of that into the range for the guidance when we give it."

I don't know, it's about 36% in fiscal '14 down to 31% in fiscal '15. And that's just, obviously, just the product side. So I'm wondering if you can share with us whether that trend continued this quarter, first of all, and what the drivers here might be outside of FX because you've kind of actually had a nice mix shift in revenue towards the U.S. up until this quarter. And so I'm wondering why product margins in Oncology would be down as much as they were."

So we fully anticipated we were going to have margin declines in Oncology and for the total company, and I think that was reflected in the guidance that we gave last quarter. So for the year, I still expect, even with the -- we still had some currency impact in Q1. We'll have a little bit in Q2 and then it should anniversary. For the year, we still think Oncology is right in that 43% range, so holding in line with our long-term expectations. I would point out service was a bigger proportion in the year-ago quarter, and that is one of our highest-margin product lines. So that impacted it as well. But I think Oncology is performing well at this point."

The panel pricing declines should anniversary in the second half, and we're still absorbing the loss of major -- of a major customer that went in-sourcing on flat panel. That's probably not going to -- that's happening every quarter to us and it probably doesn't anniversary until Q4-ish. Toshiba's volume. The good news is most of that business is a service business. So that is going to continue to need to be replaced, but their ongoing forward production with the uncertainty around their sale and kind of who picks it up, et cetera, we might see a little bit of a volume adjustment there. As I did say in the script, they do have some inventory that they're working through as they kind of manage through this whole thing. The good news is the MeVis and Claymount acquisitions seem to be performing for us. So we're looking for a return to growth, I think, consistent with what we said before in 2017 and 2018."

And now if you look back when economic times were bad, we've weathered those storms pretty well. It's not to say that we might see something in our orders if the economy really turns south. But there was this nice external validation of that last quarter with the global task force on the utilization of radiation oncology published in the Lancet journal that called for thousands more machines. Basically, 2.5x the installed base that we have today and really asking international organizations to help countries develop cancer plans. So especially outside of the U.S., a huge focus on utilizing radiation therapy for cancer. I think one of our big challenges, I mentioned in the script there, is making sure the people side of that comes along with it because we've got to have the people to be able to do the work. But I think as you look at the long term health of the Oncology business, the franchise is in as good a product position as we've ever had. And I think the market remains in the long term, very, very solid. Now on the Imaging business, we're clearly going through a big storm right now. And we still like the fundamentals of the business.

If you could kind of break out how much of it is maybe just software only. And then particularly, I'm interested in trying to figure out the opportunity of this. And I was guessing it was going to be international. And I was curious, Elisha, if you could talk about the growth rates of service and software for 2015 kind of between international and U.S. and how that's going to change in '16. Really trying to understand what this business can look like if we did get into a lower unit kind of environment. 
And it goes to my second question around the guidance of revenue. Seems like you're putting a lot in the fourth quarter, if I'm reading you right, about pull in revenue out of the third quarter, Elisha, in the second quarter.

The first being FX will still have a little bit of quarter-over-quarter impact in this second fiscal quarter that we're currently in. But as we -- assuming currencies stay where they are today, that impact gets reduced significantly as we go into Q3 and Q4. And so obviously, we expect the dollar growth rates are going to be higher in the second half of the year. The other thing that we anniversary that was huge last year is the pricing impact on particularly the flat panel business. And all of the declines that we saw there, which again, were late in second quarter and really large in Q3 and Q4. So our hope is that we're going to get a little more linear in our Oncology business as we go through this fiscal year.

Varian is reporting revenues and earnings above our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 while managing through some challenging conditions in our markets, and we're raising our earnings guidance for the year. In",913,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Varian is reporting revenues and earnings above our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 while managing through some challenging conditions in our markets, and we're raising our earnings guidance for the year. In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $0.99 per diluted share and $0.91 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Revenues of $757 million, up 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Soft orders in our Oncology Systems business, the expected declines in Imaging Components orders and revenues, and good news on the tax fronts with a permanent R&D tax credit and the suspension of the medical device excise tax. 
Focusing on operational highlights. In our Oncology business, gross orders totaled $533 million for the quarter, down 5% in dollars and down 1% in constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas for the quarter increased by 3% in both dollars and constant currency with the fastest growth in Latin America. Gross orders in North America rose by 2% in dollars and constant currency. In EMEA, gross orders declined by 14% in dollars and 5% in constant currency. Gross orders in APAC declined by 12% in dollars and 7% in constant currency with continued market contraction in Japan and a modest decline in China. 
Global markets have been weakened by ongoing political unrest, weak oil prices and economic uncertainty. In EMEA, for example, Russia announced further delays in its cancer plan. Germany scaled back investments, and the Middle East was negatively impacted by political unrest and falling oil prices. 
On a positive note, in EMEA, we received an order from the U.K.'s National Health Service for a further 10 TrueBeam Systems during the quarter. The National Health System has now ordered more than 50 TrueBeams in the last few years for its cancer programs. Economic uncertainty was also a prime cause of weakness in Japan, which led to an overall orders decline in APAC. 
In China, gross orders declined slightly. As of the end of the first quarter, we continue to see hospitals in China aiming to invest in advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery systems for their cancer patients. We booked several orders for EDGE radiosurgery systems in China during the quarter. 
In the Americas, the multimillion-dollar Siemens replacement project in Argentina and a key Ministry of Health win in Chile drove the growth in Latin America while North America continued to move forward with investments in our new product platforms to replace aging systems. 
We're focused on global market development through our access to care initiative, an educational program that seeks to bridge the gap between the growing need for modern radiotherapy treatment machines in developing countries and the lack of trained personnel to operate them. This program is already working in Africa and Vietnam, and we took steps during the quarter to initiate this program in India to an educational partnership with Apollo Hospitals group. This program will train radiation technologists in India. 
We made good progress with our software business during the quarter. Licenses for RapidPlan, our tool for enhancing efficiency and quality in treatment planning, have tripled since the end of the fiscal year and are now installed at over 50 sites. Clinical networks, including a health care system in Victoria, Australia that took 4 licenses during the quarter, are rebuilding treatment capabilities around RapidPlan. 
Turning to our Oncology service business. Orders were up 1% in dollars but up 6% in constant currency compared with a strong year-ago quarter. 
Let me turn now to Imaging Components, where orders shrank by 22% to $127 million for the quarter, and revenues fell by 15% to $141 million. Beginning in the second half of last fiscal year, this business has been confronted with currency-related pricing pressures, weak market conditions for Security and Inspection Products and an in-sourcing at a major panel customer. These challenges, together with excess tube inventory at a key customer, contributed to the declines in this business during the quarter. Volumes for tubes were down in the quarter, while demand for our higher-margin dynamic fluoroscopic panels increased and led to a sequential improvement in the growth margin for Imaging Components. 
Our recent acquisitions, MeVis and Claymount, gained momentum in the quarter and are performing well. As a reminder, we're aiming for about $50 million in revenue from these newly acquired businesses this fiscal year. 
Moving to protons. We made good progress with installations. During the quarter, we turned over the first room of the Maryland Proton Therapy Center for clinical commissioning, and first treatments are slated to begin next month. We have successfully extracted beam from the cyclotron at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where patient treatments are scheduled to begin before the end of the year. Installation is also underway at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, and we are scheduled to begin installations at sites in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia later this year. 
Proton order activity was quiet in the quarter, but our prospects for booking several more systems this year continue to look good. 
Before I hand it over to Elisha, I'd like to say how proud I am that Varian has been honored for its commitment to sustainability by being included for the second year in a row on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations list, which compares the sustainability performance of some 4,600 companies globally. This was announced last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos. 
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 7% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $55 million, bringing net orders for the company to $617 million. 
Now let me walk you through the P&L. First quarter revenues for the total company increased 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 5% gain in revenues during the quarter with a 9% gain in constant currency. There was a significant geographic mix shift towards international revenues, which grew 21% in dollars and 31% in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter, while North American revenues declined by about 10%. 
International business constituted 55% of total Oncology revenues in the quarter. Imaging Components posted a first quarter revenue decline of 15% with decreases in tubes, panels and Security and Inspection Products. 
Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of $27 million, up $18 million from the year-ago quarter as we continue to make progress on projects in backlog. 
The total company gross margin for the quarter was 41.1%, down as expected by a little more than 3 points. Oncology Systems gross margin also fell by about 3 points to 42.4% due to geographic and product mix shifts as well as minor currency effects. Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by about 1.5 points to 40.7% due largely to lower pricing and volumes. 
First quarter SG&A expenses were $124 million or 16% of revenue, an improvement of about 1 point as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. First quarter R&D expenses were $60 million or 8% of revenues, equal to the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue. First quarter operating earnings totaled $128 million or 17% of revenue, down about 2 points as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter and in line with our expectation for the quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $19 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 24.8%, down almost 4 points from the year-ago quarter due largely to the geographic mix of profits and the R&D tax credit that was reinstated in late December. We now expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased almost 4 million from the year-ago quarter to 97.8 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.99 for the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $953 million, debt of $728 million and stockholders’ equity of $1.6 billion. DSO at 99 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter due to a lower mix of Imaging Components business, a higher mix of proton business and the timing of collections in Oncology. 
First quarter cash flow from operations fell slightly from the year-ago period to $77 million. Primary uses of cash were $27 million for CapEx and $192 million for the repurchase of 2.4 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 7 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2016. 
Now back to Dow for the outlook."

Is that the right read here? And I guess, as I look back over the last several quarters, we've seen Oncology orders in both those markets in negative territory, I think, 3 out of the last 4 quarters.

When you look at the last 12 months in Oncology in dollars, it's down 2%. In constant currency, it's up 4%. I mean this first quarter is not the greatest growth that we've ever had. Our funnel remains very good, so we like what we see. The fourth quarter was huge for us in Europe. Constant currency and dollar growth in Europe was outstanding in Q4. So our Q4 was 12.5% constant currency growth last quarter. So maybe there was a little bit of quarter-over-quarter balancing going on. So I think the 12-month trailing is kind of what we're feeling right now. Clearly, we're reading the papers like everybody and some of the macroeconomic weakness in Europe is real. I mean we did have a light Q1. But I think we're -- we still see markets growing in that low- to mid-single-digit range at this point. We haven't seen anything that would pull us off that. Japan has been kind of the ongoing structural change in Japan. In China, we did have a win in the quarter that was protested. So I mean we were very close to flat in China. Our funnel remains very good in China. I mean I think Japan is probably going to be kind of more of same. That's been a pretty consistent story the last few quarters. But I do think China will come back. The order that was protested was a fairly large order. So if that was in our numbers, then China would have been great. But anyway, I mean, those are the kinds of things that happen around the quarter. I'd say over the long haul, looking at the last 12 months, we haven't seen anything that would, at this point, pull us off of market growth number in that kind of 3 to 5 range."

So as I look at the $0.10 raise to guidance here, how much was med tech tax and R&D driving that $0.10 raise? How much is kind of in the guidance number is coming from those 2 things? How much of an incremental currency headwind was there, if any, included in your guidance? And then maybe how are you thinking about the core underlying business?

I think your next question's going to be why aren't you giving me that $0.05? And I'm still a little black and blue after Q4, frankly. And when we missed on that revenue number, it's very early in the year. And I think this just had to do with some timing. And I think Oncology did a fantastic job and probably pulled a little bit revenue forward from Q2 and Q3 to make sure we didn't have a repeat performance. But for the year, we -- it still looks good with the revenue guidance and the EPS from where we stand today. 
Currency, from when I last guided, has been relatively stable. I mean it may have hurt us, I don't know, I think I was at $1.12 versus $1.09. But again, we built some of that into the range for the guidance when we give it."

So I'm wondering if you can share with us whether that trend continued this quarter, first of all, and what the drivers here might be outside of FX because you've kind of actually had a nice mix shift in revenue towards the U.S. up until this quarter.

So for the year, I still expect, even with the -- we still had some currency impact in Q1. We'll have a little bit in Q2 and then it should anniversary. For the year, we still think Oncology is right in that 43% range, so holding in line with our long-term expectations.

Number one, I'm wondering if you're reiterating kind of the guidance you laid out for the fiscal year, which I think was about flat or so on imaging revenues.

Otherwise, I think it's very much consistent with what we guided a quarter ago. The challenges continue. The Security and Inspection business has stabilized -- stabilizing, clearly, at the lower revenue levels. The panel pricing declines should anniversary in the second half, and we're still absorbing the loss of major -- of a major customer that went in-sourcing on flat panel. That's probably not going to -- that's happening every quarter to us and it probably doesn't anniversary until Q4-ish. Toshiba's volume. The good news is most of that business is a service business. So that is going to continue to need to be replaced, but their ongoing forward production with the uncertainty around their sale and kind of who picks it up, et cetera, we might see a little bit of a volume adjustment there. As I did say in the script, they do have some inventory that they're working through as they kind of manage through this whole thing. The good news is the MeVis and Claymount acquisitions seem to be performing for us. So we're looking for a return to growth, I think, consistent with what we said before in 2017 and 2018."

And now if you look back when economic times were bad, we've weathered those storms pretty well. It's not to say that we might see something in our orders if the economy really turns south. But there was this nice external validation of that last quarter with the global task force on the utilization of radiation oncology published in the Lancet journal that called for thousands more machines. Basically, 2.5x the installed base that we have today and really asking international organizations to help countries develop cancer plans. So especially outside of the U.S., a huge focus on utilizing radiation therapy for cancer. I think one of our big challenges, I mentioned in the script there, is making sure the people side of that comes along with it because we've got to have the people to be able to do the work. But I think as you look at the long term health of the Oncology business, the franchise is in as good a product position as we've ever had.

Seems like you're putting a lot in the fourth quarter, if I'm reading you right, about pull in revenue out of the third quarter, Elisha, in the second quarter.

The first being FX will still have a little bit of quarter-over-quarter impact in this second fiscal quarter that we're currently in. But as we -- assuming currencies stay where they are today, that impact gets reduced significantly as we go into Q3 and Q4. And so obviously, we expect the dollar growth rates are going to be higher in the second half of the year. The other thing that we anniversary that was huge last year is the pricing impact on particularly the flat panel business. And all of the declines that we saw there, which again, were late in second quarter and really large in Q3 and Q4. So our hope is that we're going to get a little more linear in our Oncology business as we go through this fiscal year.

Varian is reporting solid results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 with time order growth in our oncology business, promising progress in our Particle Therapy business and expected weakness in our Imaging Components b",911,"Good afternoon and welcome. Varian is reporting solid results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 with time order growth in our oncology business, promising progress in our Particle Therapy business and expected weakness in our Imaging Components business.
In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $1.09 per diluted share and $1.01 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Revenue of $759 million equaled to the year-ago quarter in dollars and up 2% in constant currency. Strong orders in our oncology business with growth and strategic wins in all 3 geographies, expected order and revenue declines in Imaging Components and good momentum in our Particle Therapy business with growing customer interest in our single [indiscernible] system.
Focusing on operational highlights. In our oncology business, gross orders totaled $618 million for the quarter, up 6% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas for the quarter increased by 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency with 7% growth in North America, offsetting a decline in Latin America.
In EMEA, gross orders were up 19% in dollars and 23% in constant currency helped by big wins in India and the Middle East. Gross orders in APAC rose 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency driven by robust growth in China.
Oncology experienced healthy global demand in the quarter with higher unit orders as well as gains in our service and software businesses.
Looking at each of the regions in more detail. Our gross order growth in North America was driven in part by demand for newer products, particularly our VitalBeam accelerator as well as our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software for improving clinical efficiency.
As you know, North America is largely a replacement market and in this quarter, we generated orders to replace several hardware and software products from competitors as well as our own units. As usual, there were some big wins in the quarter including a major order from Andy Anderson for 6 TrueBeam systems. We also won a couple of large deals in Canada.
Orders in Latin America declined significantly from the year-ago quarter as results of political uncertainty in Brazil and political purchasing decisions.
During the quarter, we broke ground on a new 50,000 square foot facility in Brazil that will be used for training and product demos as well as product assembly and warehousing. This summer, we expect to complete the first few installations of the 80[ph] machines, aided by Brazil's Ministry of Health in 2014.
Turning to EMEA. We had a very good quarter with several sizable, the largest of these came in India where we received a multi-site order from the Apollo Hospital Group for 12 high-end linear accelerators and 10 5[ph] brachytherapy systems. We also booked several orders in the Middle East, including systems for 4 new sites in Turkey.
We had a terrific quarter China where more than 75% of the Varian linear accelerators ordered in the quarter were for new treatment [indiscernible]. Elsewhere in APAC, Japan remains slow, but appeared to be stabilizing.
We also had a key win at a large hospital in Indonesia that we believe will position us for further growth in that important market.
We're pleased with the progress in [indiscernible] software business during the quarter. Customer interest in RapidPlan continued to grow and it is now installed at nearly 170 sites around the world.
We also received multiple orders in the quarter for InSightive Analytics, bringing total orders in this introduction earlier in this fiscal year to 80.
We had another nice win at the Christy Hospital in Manchester, England, which ordered several software products, including Eclipse treatment planning for protons and our Velocity product that uses images to track tumor responses to treatment.
Turning to our Oncology Service business. Gross orders were up 11% in dollars and 12% in constant currency, with the help of higher capture rates, particularly in North America and China.
Looking now at Imaging Components second quarter performance versus the year-ago quarter, orders fell by 12% to $138 million and revenue fell by 8% to $144 million, largely in line with our expectations. Beginning in the second half of last fiscal year, this business has been confronted with currency-related pricing pressures, weak market conditions for security and inspection products, in-sourcing by a large panel customers and uncertainties related to the sale of a major tube[ph] customer. We believe we have largely absorbed these challenges from the last 4 quarters, and we feel that the business is beginning to stabilize at these levels.
Our MeVis and new Claymount businesses performed well in the quarter and we continue to believe [indiscernible] across China. With a growing number of imaging equipment manufacturers in China, this is going to be an important growth area for our components business.
In our Particle Therapy business, we continue to make good progress with installations and recorded $31 million in revenue during the quarter. It was great to see patient treatments commence as the Proton Therapy Center in February. We are proud to collaborate with the center to bring our advanced cancer fighting technology to patients in that region.
In the quarter, we successfully extracted beam from the [indiscernible] and Cincinnati Children's Hospital where patient treatments are scheduled to begin before the end of the year. We are also scheduled to begin installing equipment at sites in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia later this year.
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 6% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $51[ph] million bringing net orders for the company to $707 million. Second quarter revenues for the total company were about equal with the year-ago period in dollars and up 2% in constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were up 1% in dollars and up 4% in constant currency.
Oncology posted a 1% decline in revenues and a 1% gain in constant currency during the second quarter. Imaging Components posted a second quarter revenue decline of 8% with decreases in tubes, panels and Security and Inspection Products, partially offset by revenues from our new Claymount and MeVis businesses.
Our Particle Therapy business posted second quarter revenues of $31 million, more than double the year-ago period as we continue to make progress on projects and backlogs.
The total company gross margin for the quarter was 42%, down as expected by have 0.05 point due to lower volumes at Imaging Components and a higher mix of Proton business. For the first half, total company gross margin was 41.6%, down almost 2 points from the year-ago period.
Oncology Systems second quarter gross margin improved 73 basis points to 43.7% due to product mix shift toward software and service, variable cost productivity and suspension of the medical device excise tax.
Imaging Components second quarter gross margin fell by a little more than 2 points to 41.4% due largely from lower volumes.
Second quarter SG&A expenses were $112 million or 15% of revenue and our [indiscernible] were $62 million or about 8% of revenue, each equal as a percentage of revenue to the year-ago quarter. For the first half, SG&A expenses were 16%[ph] of revenue and R&D was 8% of revenue, both also equal to the year-ago period.
Second quarter operating earnings totaled $145 million or 19.1% of revenue, down about 1 point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter and in line with our expectations. For the first half, operating margin is 18%[ph] of revenue was down about 1.5 points from the year-ago period.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $20 million for the second quarter and $38 million for the first half. The effective tax rate was 28.1%, virtually equal to the year-ago quarter. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year.
Fully diluted shares outstanding of 96.2 million were almost 5 million lower than a year-ago quarter due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.09 for the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $961 million, debt of $794 million and software order equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 109 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter due to a lower mix of Imaging Components business, a higher mix of Proton business, more extended payment terms and lower collections for Oncology Systems.
Second quarter cash flow from operations was $32 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations for the first half to $109 million. Primary uses of cash were $19 million for CapEx and $57 million for the repurchase of 725,000 shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 6 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends to calendar year 2016.
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

I think the way the guys are using that a lot, the guys in the field are using it [indiscernible]. So often versus our competitors, it starts out in the canal waters from a pricing point of view. And what we really want to do is we want to differentiate the TrueBeam and had so many, many significant advantages over everything else that's out there. And we've trained very hard on that. I think there's good discipline around it and we're seeing that in our numbers. From a product cost point of view, the team has also done a really great job getting the product cost out. So it's given us some flexibility to do that. So the margin dollars, margin percent at these price points are still pretty good. So we like that part of it. The -- I'd say, it might be a little bit ahead of our expectations in terms of its impact in the U.S., we thought we're having a little bit bigger impact outside of the U.S. And our team is just playing that through. So we do think we'll see some upside from the product outside of the U.S. It takes a little longer to train and the get into budget cycles and things like that. But it is -- for this market, in particular where we have an old install base that's looking to trade up and [indiscernible] chances are they're not depreciating the old asset anymore. It's been through its depreciation cycle. And they're looking how can they swap out that old stuff and get something new and competitive at a good price point that's just worked out very, very well.

Varian is reporting solid results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 with strong order growth in our Oncology business, promising progress in our Particle Therapy business and expected weakness in our Imaging Component",944,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Varian is reporting solid results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 with strong order growth in our Oncology business, promising progress in our Particle Therapy business and expected weakness in our Imaging Components business.
In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $1.09 per diluted share and $1.01 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Revenue of $759 million equal to the year-ago quarter in dollars and up 2% in constant currency. Strong orders in our Oncology business with growth and strategic wins in all 3 geographies, expected order and revenue declines in Imaging Components and good momentum in our Particle Therapy business with growing customer interest in our single-room system.
Focusing on operational highlights. In our Oncology business, gross orders totaled $618 million for the quarter, up 6% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas for the quarter increased by 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency, with 7% growth in North America, offsetting a decline in Latin America.
In EMEA, gross orders were up 19% in dollars and 23% in constant currency helped by big wins in India and the Middle East. Gross orders in APAC rose 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency, driven by robust growth in China.
Oncology experienced healthy global demand in the quarter with higher unit orders as well as gains in our service and software businesses.
Looking at each of the regions in more detail. Our gross order growth in North America was driven in part by demand for newer products, particularly our VitalBeam accelerator as well as our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software for improving clinical efficiency.
As you know, North America is largely a replacement market and in this quarter, we generated orders to replace several hardware and software products from competitors as well as our own units. As usual, there were some big wins in the quarter including a major order from MD Anderson for 6 TrueBeam systems. We also won a couple of large deals in Canada.
Orders in Latin America declined significantly from the year-ago quarter, as results of political uncertainty in Brazil and volatile currencies that slowed purchasing decisions.
During the quarter, we broke ground on a new 50,000 square foot facility in Brazil that will be used for training and product demos as well as product assembly and warehousing. This summer, we expect to complete the first few installations of the 80 machines handed by Brazil's Ministry of Health in 2014.
Turning to EMEA. We had a very good quarter with several sizable orders. The largest of these came in India where we received a multi-site order from the Apollo Hospital Group for 12 high-end linear accelerators and 5 brachytherapy systems. We also booked several orders in the Middle East, including systems for 4 new sites in Turkey.
We had a terrific quarter in China where more than 75% of the Varian linear accelerators ordered in the quarter were for new treatment vaults. Elsewhere in APAC, Japan remained slow, but appeared to be stabilizing.
We also had a key win at a large teaching hospital in Indonesia that we believe will position us for further growth in that important market.
We're pleased with the progress made in our software business during the quarter. Customer interest in RapidPlan continued to grow, and it is now installed at nearly 170 sites around the world.
We also received multiple orders in the quarter for InSightive Analytics, bringing total orders since its introduction earlier this fiscal year to 80.
We had another nice win at the Christie Hospital in Manchester, England, which ordered several software products, including Eclipse Treatment Planning for protons and our Velocity product that uses images to track tumor responses to treatment.
Turning to our Oncology Service business. Gross orders were up 11% in dollars and 12% in constant currency, with the help of higher capture rates, particularly in North America and China.
Looking now at Imaging Components' second quarter performance versus the year-ago quarter, orders fell by 12% to $138 million and revenue fell by 8% to $144 million, largely in line with our expectations. Beginning in the second half of last fiscal year, this business has been confronted with currency-related pricing pressures, weak market conditions for security and inspection products, in-sourcing by a large panel customer and uncertainties related to the sale of a major tube customer. We believe we have largely absorbed these challenges from the last 4 quarters, and we feel that the business is beginning to stabilize at these new levels.
Our new MeVis and Claymount businesses performed well in the quarter, and we continue to believe they will generate about $50 million in revenue this fiscal year. During the quarter, we opened a regional service center near Shanghai to support local x-ray equipment manufacturers across China. With the growing number of imaging equipment manufacturers in China, this is going to be an important growth area for our components business.
In our Particle Therapy business, we continued to make good progress with installations and recorded $31 million in revenue during the quarter. It was great to see patient treatments commence at the Maryland Proton Therapy Center in February. We are proud to collaborate with the center to bring our advanced cancer fighting technology to patients in that region.
In the quarter, we successfully extracted beam from the Cyclotron and Cincinnati Children's Hospital where patient treatments are scheduled to begin before the end of the year. We are also scheduled to begin installing equipment at sites in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia later this year.
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 6% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $51 million bringing net orders for the company to $707 million. Second quarter revenues for the total company were about equal with the year-ago period in dollars and up 2% in constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were up 1% in dollars and up 4% in constant currency.
Oncology posted a 1% decline in revenues and a 1% gain in constant currency during the second quarter. Imaging Components posted a second quarter revenue decline of 8%, with decreases in tubes, panels and Security and Inspection Products, partially offset by revenues from our new Claymount and MeVis businesses.
Our Particle Therapy business posted second quarter revenues of $31 million, more than double the year-ago period, as we continue to make progress on projects in backlog.
The total company gross margin for the quarter was 42%, down as expected by 0.5 point due to lower volumes in Imaging Components and a higher mix of Proton business. For the first half, total company gross margin was 41.6%, down almost 2 points from the year-ago period.
Oncology Systems second quarter gross margin improved 73 basis points to 43.7% due to product mix shift towards software and service, variable cost productivity and suspension of the medical device excise tax.
Imaging Components second quarter gross margin fell by a little more than 2 points to 41.4%, due largely to lower volumes.
Second quarter SG&A expenses were $112 million or 15% of revenue and R&D expenses were $62 million or about 8% of revenue, each equal as a percentage of revenue to the year-ago quarter. For the first half, SG&A expenses were 16% of revenue, and R&D was 8% of revenue, both also equal to the year-ago period.
Second quarter operating earnings totaled $145 million or 19.1% of revenue, down about 1 point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter and in line with our expectations. For the first half, operating margin at 18% of revenue was down about 1.5 points from the year-ago period.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $20 million for the second quarter and $38 million for the first half. The effective tax rate was 28.1%, virtually equal to the year-ago quarter. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year.
Fully diluted shares outstanding of 96.2 million were almost 5 million lower than the year-ago quarter due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.09 for the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $961 million, debt of $794 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 109 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter due to a lower mix of Imaging Components business, a higher mix of Proton business, more extended payment terms and slower collections for Oncology Systems.
Second quarter cash flow from operations was $32 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations for the first half to $109 million. Primary uses of cash were $19 million for CapEx and $57 million through the repurchase of 725,000 shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 6 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends to calendar year 2016.
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

That market's been kind of a little bit down with people dealing with oil price impact on federal budgets, health care budgets. But that was nice to kind of see that come back. We had a very nice win in the U.K. And then I'd say, all across Europe, we had a very good mix of product, a little bit richer hardware mix and very good engagement of our software business in Europe. So I'd say, we're not going to do 20% every quarter, that's probably a little bit too much to ask. As it comes to the total, when you look at the overall market, last 12 months, our estimate is that it's 12 months constant currency growth rate at about 5%.

And that's -- we're seeing a rich in mix on there. I think the other thing at both the high end and the mid-tier of the market is we've got the best total cost of ownership and the best throughput of anybody else out there. So that might be some of Accuray's problems is, I don't know. But I think we are extremely competitive, but the total cost of ownership, especially when you look at our throughput advantages, we're far and away the most efficient product out there in terms of throughput and reliability. And we also have -- we've been focused very, very much the last few years on Net Promoter Score. And we believe -- when we measure this through independent groups, we believe that we've got a significant lead in customer service.

So that takes some pressure off. And in oncology, we're going to see a more linear year. Last year Q3, actually sequentially was down for oncology. You're not going to see that for our expectations this quarter. So what you're seeing is really some fluctuations, mostly in our PT business. So if I look at Q3 guidance, oncology should do high single digit. We're going to have our Imaging Components somewhere around the mid-single digit. But we get a significant drop off in our Proton business because we booked Maryland in the year-ago period. So that's why you get to a 0% flat revenue. If you get into Q4, it's exactly the opposite, and our Proton business is going to grow significantly just based on the projects and the timing of revenue recognition and the percentage of completion. So those are a few of the things that are different versus a year-ago period."

And we've trained very hard on that. I think there's good discipline around it and we're seeing that in our numbers. From a product cost point of view, the team has also done a really great job getting the product cost out. So it's given us some flexibility to do that. So the margin dollars, margin percent at these price points are still pretty good. So we like that part of it. The -- I'd say, we're -- it might be a little bit ahead of our expectations in terms of its impact in the U.S. We thought we'd have a little bit bigger impact outside of the U.S. And our team is just playing in that, true. So we do think we'll see some upside from the product outside of the U.S. It typically takes us a little longer to train and get it into budget cycles and things like that. But it is -- for this market, in particular where we have an old install base that's looking to trade up and how can they --  chances are, they're not depreciating the old asset anymore. It's been through its depreciation cycle. And they're looking to how can they swap out that old stuff and get something new and competitive at a good price point that's just worked out very, very well.

Varian is reporting solid results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 with strong order growth in our Oncology business, promising progress in our Particle Therapy business and expected weakness in our Imaging Component",944,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Varian is reporting solid results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 with strong order growth in our Oncology business, promising progress in our Particle Therapy business and expected weakness in our Imaging Components business.
In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $1.09 per diluted share and $1.01 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Revenue of $759 million equal to the year-ago quarter in dollars and up 2% in constant currency. Strong orders in our Oncology business with growth and strategic wins in all 3 geographies, expected order and revenue declines in Imaging Components and good momentum in our Particle Therapy business with growing customer interest in our single-room system.
Focusing on operational highlights. In our Oncology business, gross orders totaled $618 million for the quarter, up 6% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas for the quarter increased by 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency, with 7% growth in North America, offsetting a decline in Latin America.
In EMEA, gross orders were up 19% in dollars and 23% in constant currency helped by big wins in India and the Middle East. Gross orders in APAC rose 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency, driven by robust growth in China.
Oncology experienced healthy global demand in the quarter with higher unit orders as well as gains in our service and software businesses.
Looking at each of the regions in more detail. Our gross order growth in North America was driven in part by demand for newer products, particularly our VitalBeam accelerator as well as our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software for improving clinical efficiency.
As you know, North America is largely a replacement market and in this quarter, we generated orders to replace several hardware and software products from competitors as well as our own units. As usual, there were some big wins in the quarter including a major order from MD Anderson for 6 TrueBeam systems. We also won a couple of large deals in Canada.
Orders in Latin America declined significantly from the year-ago quarter, as results of political uncertainty in Brazil and volatile currencies that slowed purchasing decisions.
During the quarter, we broke ground on a new 50,000 square foot facility in Brazil that will be used for training and product demos as well as product assembly and warehousing. This summer, we expect to complete the first few installations of the 80 machines tended by Brazil's Ministry of Health in 2014.
Turning to EMEA. We had a very good quarter with several sizable orders. The largest of these came in India where we received a multi-site order from the Apollo Hospital Group for 12 high-end linear accelerators and 5 brachytherapy systems. We also booked several orders in the Middle East, including systems for 4 new sites in Turkey.
We had a terrific quarter in China where more than 75% of the Varian linear accelerators ordered in the quarter were for new treatment vaults. Elsewhere in APAC, Japan remained slow, but appeared to be stabilizing.
We also had a key win at a large teaching hospital in Indonesia that we believe will position us for further growth in that important market.
We're pleased with the progress made in our software business during the quarter. Customer interest in RapidPlan continued to grow, and it is now installed at nearly 170 sites around the world.
We also received multiple orders in the quarter for InSightive Analytics, bringing total orders since its introduction earlier this fiscal year to 80.
We had another nice win at the Christie Hospital in Manchester, England, which ordered several software products, including Eclipse Treatment Planning for protons and our Velocity product that uses images to track tumor responses to treatment.
Turning to our Oncology Service business. Gross orders were up 11% in dollars and 12% in constant currency, with the help of higher capture rates, particularly in North America and China.
Looking now at Imaging Components' second quarter performance versus the year-ago quarter, orders fell by 12% to $138 million and revenue fell by 8% to $144 million, largely in line with our expectations. Beginning in the second half of last fiscal year, this business has been confronted with currency-related pricing pressures, weak market conditions for security and inspection products, in-sourcing by a large panel customer and uncertainties related to the sale of a major tube customer. We believe we have largely absorbed these challenges from the last 4 quarters, and we feel that the business is beginning to stabilize at these new levels.
Our new MeVis and Claymount businesses performed well in the quarter, and we continue to believe they will generate about $50 million in revenue this fiscal year. During the quarter, we opened a regional service center near Shanghai to support local x-ray equipment manufacturers across China. With the growing number of imaging equipment manufacturers in China, this is going to be an important growth area for our components business.
In our Particle Therapy business, we continued to make good progress with installations and recorded $31 million in revenue during the quarter. It was great to see patient treatments commence at the Maryland Proton Therapy Center in February. We are proud to collaborate with the center to bring our advanced cancer fighting technology to patients in that region.
In the quarter, we successfully extracted beam from the Cyclotron and Cincinnati Children's Hospital where patient treatments are scheduled to begin before the end of the year. We are also scheduled to begin installing equipment at sites in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia later this year.
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 6% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $51 million bringing net orders for the company to $707 million. Second quarter revenues for the total company were about equal with the year-ago period in dollars and up 2% in constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were up 1% in dollars and up 4% in constant currency.
Oncology posted a 1% decline in revenues and a 1% gain in constant currency during the second quarter. Imaging Components posted a second quarter revenue decline of 8%, with decreases in tubes, panels and Security and Inspection Products, partially offset by revenues from our new Claymount and MeVis businesses.
Our Particle Therapy business posted second quarter revenues of $31 million, more than double the year-ago period, as we continue to make progress on projects in backlog.
The total company gross margin for the quarter was 42%, down as expected by 0.5 point due to lower volumes in Imaging Components and a higher mix of Proton business. For the first half, total company gross margin was 41.6%, down almost 2 points from the year-ago period.
Oncology Systems second quarter gross margin improved 73 basis points to 43.7% due to product mix shift towards software and service, variable cost productivity and suspension of the medical device excise tax.
Imaging Components second quarter gross margin fell by a little more than 2 points to 41.4%, due largely to lower volumes.
Second quarter SG&A expenses were $112 million or 15% of revenue and R&D expenses were $62 million or about 8% of revenue, each equal as a percentage of revenue to the year-ago quarter. For the first half, SG&A expenses were 16% of revenue, and R&D was 8% of revenue, both also equal to the year-ago period.
Second quarter operating earnings totaled $145 million or 19.1% of revenue, down about 1 point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter and in line with our expectations. For the first half, operating margin at 18% of revenue was down about 1.5 points from the year-ago period.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $20 million for the second quarter and $38 million for the first half. The effective tax rate was 28.1%, virtually equal to the year-ago quarter. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year.
Fully diluted shares outstanding of 96.2 million were almost 5 million lower than the year-ago quarter due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.09 for this quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $961 million, debt of $794 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 109 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter due to a lower mix of Imaging Components business, a higher mix of Proton business, more extended payment terms and slower collections for Oncology Systems.
Second quarter cash flow from operations was $32 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations for the first half to $109 million. Primary uses of cash were $19 million for CapEx and $57 million through the repurchase of 725,000 shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 6 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2016.
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

You're not going to see that for our expectations this quarter. So what you're seeing is really some fluctuations, mostly in our PT business. So if I look at Q3 guidance, oncology should do high single digit. We're going to have our Imaging Components somewhere around the mid-single digit. But we get a significant drop off in our Proton business because we booked Maryland in the year-ago period. So that's why you get to a 0% flat revenue. If you get into Q4, it's exactly the opposite, and our Proton business is going to grow significantly just based on the projects and the timing of revenue recognition and the percentage of completion.

I think the way the guys are using it a lot, the guys and girls in the field are using it. It's really to sell up. So often versus our competitors, it starts out in the canal water from a pricing point of view.

I think there's good discipline around it and we're seeing that in our numbers. From a product cost point of view, the team has also done a really great job getting the product cost out. So it's given us some flexibility to do that. So the margin dollars, margin percent at these price points are still pretty good. So we like that part of it. The -- I'd say, we're -- it might be a little bit ahead of our expectations in terms of its impact in the U.S. We thought we'd have a little bit bigger impact outside of the U.S. And our team is just playing in that, true. So we do think we'll see some upside from the product outside of the U.S. It typically takes us a little longer to train and get it into budget cycles and things like that. But it is -- for this market, in particular where we have an old install base that's looking to trade up and how can they --  chances are, they're not depreciating the old asset anymore. It's been through its depreciation cycle. And they're looking to how can they swap out that old stuff and get something new and competitive at a good price point that's just worked out very, very well. I think the proof is in the pudding.

Varian is reporting solid results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 with strong order growth in our Oncology business, promising progress in our Particle Therapy business and expected weakness in our Imaging Component",944,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Varian is reporting solid results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 with strong order growth in our Oncology business, promising progress in our Particle Therapy business and expected weakness in our Imaging Components business.
In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $1.09 per diluted share and $1.01 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Revenue of $759 million equal to the year-ago quarter in dollars and up 2% in constant currency. Strong orders in our Oncology business with growth and strategic wins in all 3 geographies, expected order and revenue declines in Imaging Components and good momentum in our Particle Therapy business with growing customer interest in our single-room system.
Focusing on operational highlights. In our Oncology business, gross orders totaled $618 million for the quarter, up 6% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas for the quarter increased by 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency, with 7% growth in North America, offsetting a decline in Latin America.
In EMEA, gross orders were up 19% in dollars and 23% in constant currency helped by big wins in India and the Middle East. Gross orders in APAC rose 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency, driven by robust growth in China.
Oncology experienced healthy global demand in the quarter with higher unit orders as well as gains in our service and software businesses.
Looking at each of the regions in more detail. Our gross order growth in North America was driven in part by demand for newer products, particularly our VitalBeam accelerator as well as our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software for improving clinical efficiency.
As you know, North America is largely a replacement market and in this quarter, we generated orders to replace several hardware and software products from competitors as well as our own units. As usual, there were some big wins in the quarter including a major order from MD Anderson for 6 TrueBeam systems. We also won a couple of large deals in Canada.
Orders in Latin America declined significantly from the year-ago quarter, as results of political uncertainty in Brazil and volatile currencies that slowed purchasing decisions.
During the quarter, we broke ground on a new 50,000 square foot facility in Brazil that will be used for training and product demos as well as product assembly and warehousing. This summer, we expect to complete the first few installations of the 80 machines tended by Brazil's Ministry of Health in 2014.
Turning to EMEA. We had a very good quarter with several sizable orders. The largest of these came in India where we received a multi-site order from the Apollo Hospital Group for 12 high-end linear accelerators and 5 brachytherapy systems. We also booked several orders in the Middle East, including systems for 4 new sites in Turkey.
We had a terrific quarter in China where more than 75% of the Varian linear accelerators ordered in the quarter were for new treatment vaults. Elsewhere in APAC, Japan remained slow, but appeared to be stabilizing.
We also had a key win at a large teaching hospital in Indonesia that we believe will position us for further growth in that important market.
We're pleased with the progress made in our software business during the quarter. Customer interest in RapidPlan continued to grow, and it is now installed at nearly 170 sites around the world.
We also received multiple orders in the quarter for InSightive Analytics, bringing total orders since its introduction earlier this fiscal year to 80.
We had another nice win at the Christie Hospital in Manchester, England, which ordered several software products, including Eclipse Treatment Planning for protons and our Velocity product that uses images to track tumor responses to treatment.
Turning to our Oncology Service business. Gross orders were up 11% in dollars and 12% in constant currency, with the help of higher capture rates, particularly in North America and China.
Looking now at Imaging Components' second quarter performance versus the year-ago quarter, orders fell by 12% to $138 million and revenue fell by 8% to $144 million, largely in line with our expectations. Beginning in the second half of last fiscal year, this business has been confronted with currency-related pricing pressures, weak market conditions for security and inspection products, in-sourcing by a large panel customer and uncertainties related to the sale of a major tube customer. We believe we have largely absorbed these challenges from the last 4 quarters, and we feel that the business is beginning to stabilize at these new levels.
Our new MeVis and Claymount businesses performed well in the quarter, and we continue to believe they will generate about $50 million in revenue this fiscal year. During the quarter, we opened a regional service center near Shanghai to support local x-ray equipment manufacturers across China. With the growing number of imaging equipment manufacturers in China, this is going to be an important growth area for our components business.
In our Particle Therapy business, we continued to make good progress with installations and recorded $31 million in revenue during the quarter. It was great to see patient treatments commence at the Maryland Proton Therapy Center in February. We are proud to collaborate with the center to bring our advanced cancer fighting technology to patients in that region.
In the quarter, we successfully extracted beam from the Cyclotron and Cincinnati Children's Hospital where patient treatments are scheduled to begin before the end of the year. We are also scheduled to begin installing equipment at sites in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia later this year.
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 6% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $51 million bringing net orders for the company to $707 million. Second quarter revenues for the total company were about equal with the year-ago period in dollars and up 2% in constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were up 1% in dollars and up 4% in constant currency.
Oncology posted a 1% decline in revenues and a 1% gain in constant currency during the second quarter. Imaging Components posted a second quarter revenue decline of 8%, with decreases in tubes, panels and Security and Inspection Products, partially offset by revenues from our new Claymount and MeVis businesses.
Our Particle Therapy business posted second quarter revenues of $31 million, more than double the year-ago period, as we continue to make progress on projects in backlog.
The total company gross margin for the quarter was 42%, down as expected by 0.5 point due to lower volumes in Imaging Components and a higher mix of Proton business. For the first half, total company gross margin was 41.6%, down almost 2 points from the year-ago period.
Oncology Systems second quarter gross margin improved 73 basis points to 43.7% due to product mix shift towards software and service, variable cost productivity and suspension of the medical device excise tax.
Imaging Components second quarter gross margin fell by a little more than 2 points to 41.4%, due largely to lower volumes.
Second quarter SG&A expenses were $112 million or 15% of revenue and R&D expenses were $62 million or about 8% of revenue, each equal as a percentage of revenue to the year-ago quarter. For the first half, SG&A expenses were 16% of revenue, and R&D was 8% of revenue, both also equal to the year-ago period.
Second quarter operating earnings totaled $145 million or 19.1% of revenue, down about 1 point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter and in line with our expectations. For the first half, operating margin at 18% of revenue was down about 1.5 points from the year-ago period.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $20 million for the second quarter and $38 million for the first half. The effective tax rate was 28.1%, virtually equal to the year-ago quarter. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year.
Fully diluted shares outstanding of 96.2 million were almost 5 million lower than the year-ago quarter due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.09 for this quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $961 million, debt of $794 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 109 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter due to a lower mix of Imaging Components business, a higher mix of Proton business, more extended payment terms and slower collections for Oncology Systems.
Second quarter cash flow from operations was $32 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations for the first half to $109 million. Primary uses of cash were $19 million for CapEx and $57 million through the repurchase of 725,000 shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 6 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2016.
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

Including the results of the second quarter, we continue to believe that total company non-GAAP earnings will be in the range of $4.55 to $4.65 per diluted share for fiscal year 2016. With expectations of a slower-than-anticipated recovery in our Imaging Components business due to high inventory levels at a major customer, we now believe revenues for fiscal year 2016 will increase by about 3% over fiscal year 2015.
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we expect non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $1.16 to $1.20 per diluted share. We expect third quarter revenues to be about equal to the year-ago period with growth in our core businesses offset by a decline in our Proton business versus the year-ago quarter when we booked the big University of Maryland project.

So that might be some of Accuray's problems is, I don't know. But I think we are extremely competitive at the total cost of ownership, especially when you look at our throughput advantages, we have far and away the most efficient product out there in terms of throughput and reliability. And we also have -- we've been focused very, very much the last few years on Net Promoter Score. And we believe -- when we measure this through independent groups, we believe that we've got a significant lead in customer service. And then you add that with our -- the VitalBeam launch that I just talked about. Our Eclipse and ARIA product lines recently both won the best-in-class award. So we've that for a while in Eclipse. This was the first time for us in our ARIA oncology information system product. So I just think the strength of the product line is very, very good. On top of that, some of the vision that we shared at ASTRO around both our future around hardware and software is capturing the imagination of our customers for even better, stereotactic body radiation therapy and data analytics."

You're not going to see that for our expectations this quarter. So what you're seeing is really some fluctuations, mostly in our PT business. So if I look at Q3 guidance, oncology should do high single digit. We're going to have our Imaging Components somewhere around the mid-single digit. But we get a significant drop off in our Proton business because we booked Maryland in the year-ago period. So that's why you get to a 0% flat revenue. If you get into Q4, it's exactly the opposite, and our Proton business is going to grow significantly just based on the projects and the timing of revenue recognition and the percentage of completion.

I think the way the guys are using it a lot, the guys and girls in the field are using it. It's really to sell up. So often versus our competitors, it starts out in the canal water from a pricing point of view.

I think there's good discipline around it and we're seeing that in our numbers. From a product cost point of view, the team has also done a really great job getting the product cost out. So it's given us some flexibility to do that. So the margin dollars, margin percent at these price points are still pretty good. So we like that part of it. The -- I'd say, we're -- it might be a little bit ahead of our expectations in terms of its impact in the U.S. We thought we'd have a little bit bigger impact outside of the U.S. And our team is just playing in that, true. So we do think we'll see some upside from the product outside of the U.S. It typically takes us a little longer to train and get it into budget cycles and things like that. But it is -- for this market, in particular where we have an old install base that's looking to trade up and how can they -- chances are, they're not depreciating the old asset anymore. It's been through its depreciation cycle. And they're looking to how can they swap out that old stuff and get something new and competitive at a good price point that's just worked out very, very well. I think the proof is in the pudding.

Varian is reporting solid results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, a strong growth order and revenue growth in our Oncology Systems and Imaging Components businesses, together with substantial improvements in gross a",1048,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Varian is reporting solid results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, a strong growth order and revenue growth in our Oncology Systems and Imaging Components businesses, together with substantial improvements in gross and operating margins for both. In summary, the company is reporting GAAP net earnings of $1.04 per diluted share and $1.22 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. Revenues of $789 million, up 1% versus the year-ago quarter and nearly 4 point improvement in the company's overall gross margin and in order for new -- for a new multi-room proton installation in China, our first proton order there. 
Focusing on operational highlights. Our Oncology business generated third quarter gross orders of $676 million, up 6% in both dollars and constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas rose by 8% during the quarter with 15% growth in North America, more than offsetting a greater than 40% decline in Latin America. Here today, gross order growth in North America is 8%, driven by a more stable reimbursement environment and in this replacement market, a transition to more advanced clinically efficient systems. 
Gross orders in APAC increased 19% in dollars and 17% in constant currency during the quarter, driven by robust growth in China and Australia. In EMEA, gross orders declined 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency reflecting weakness in Western European markets. Looking at each of the regions in more detail. Our growth in North America was driven by demand for our TrueBeam platform, including EDGE radiosurgery systems and our software offerings. Among the highlights of North America were several large multi system orders from consolidated networks as well as competitive takeouts. 
Order activity in Latin America continued to be weak due to macroeconomic factors. During the quarter, we shipped the first units for the large tender conducted by Brazil's Ministry of Health, a couple of years ago. Turning to APAC. The group placed the largest Varian ever in Australia for 10 tubing systems, 7 of which are going to new sites along with the full complement of our information management and treatment planning software. The headwinds were several new accelerator installation in China where we saw good orders growth. We also saw strong demand for our EDGE radiosurgery system in this market where we continue to be the share leader. 
Elsewhere in APAC. We made good progress in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. Business was stable in Japan where we saw good service growth. Turning to EMEA. Healthy growth, order growth in emerging markets, including Iran, Russia, Ethiopia and Libya was offset by weakness in Western Europe. Our third quarter business in Africa was outstanding with more than $25 million in gross orders. Among other wins, we saw Ethiopia order its first modern linear accelerators for cancer treatment. 
I'm pleased to report that overall, unit order volumes was up in the quarter and year-to-date and that average pricing is stable, for winning with clinically efficient advanced technology that makes quality cancer care affordable and accessible. This was requested during the quarter and strong orders to our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software. We booked our 500th order for RapidPlan, which is a game changer that enables clinics to improve the speed and quality of care for their patients. As of this quarter, treatment plans are now being shared among clinics through our ongoing onco peer Web portal. 
As you all know, CMS has announced modest adjustments to reimbursement for 2017 for both hospitals and freestanding clinics. We don't expect for reimbursement to have a material impact on the radiation oncology markets in the U.S. next year. Following the topic of reimbursement. CMS did move forward with policies that will incentivize the adoption of digital X-ray imaging systems in place of film and computed radiography systems, and this should help support growth in our Imaging Components business. 
Speaking of Imaging Components. The business returned to growth during the quarter. Orders grew by 13% to $138 million and revenues rose by 9% to $147 million, improvement in margins were driven by productivity gains and a favorable product mix. Our 2 business saw good growth in the quarter. We recently celebrated the 40th year of our relationship with the Sheba medical systems and look forward to continuing this relationship when they become part of Canon. 
Our recently acquired software and X-ray accessory businesses also helped to drive growth. Touching on the industrial imaging business orders for security products are up in the quarter but we continue to have a cautious outlook in the face of ongoing customer consolidation. We continue to focus on generating growth in nondestructive testing and inspection. Let me update you on our progress towards the separation of the Imaging Components business into a new, independent publicly-traded company via tax-free distribution Varian stockholders. 
As you probably saw in the press release issued last week, the name of the new company will be Varik Imaging Corporation. We are now making good progress from the development of detailed plans and activities needed to execute the separation. We're on track to file an initial Form 10 with the SEC in the next several weeks and we are currently on schedule to complete the separation at the end of calendar year. We continue to be excited about the prospects of creating 2 great companies. 
Turning now to our Particle Therapy business. We booked an order during the quarter for a multi-room probing installation at the new medical in China. This is China's first government-funded proton facility. Installation is waiting to take place in late 2017 with patient treatments scheduled to begin in late 2018. Our installation at Cincinnati Children's Hospital is on track with the first patient treatments scheduled to commence later this summer. We've now successfully commissioned the third room at the Merrill Lynch Proton Therapy Center and installations are underway in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia. 
In total, we have 13 proton projects generating revenue. As you probably saw from our 8-K filing with the SEC at the end of June, we sold our $73 million senior loan for the New York Proton Therapy Center to Deutsche Bank, freeing up capital to help finance other proton projects. The proton sales funnel continues to look good. 
And now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 5% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter, totaled $51 million bringing net orders for the company to $814 million. Third quarter revenues for the total company were $789 million, up 1% in dollars and even with the year-ago period in constant currency. Year-to-date, total company revenues were $2.3 billion, up 1% in dollars and up 3% in constant currency. Oncology posted a revenue gain of 8% both in dollars and in constant currency, driven by strength in our high-end equipment as well as our software and service businesses. Imaging Components posted a third-quarter revenue gain of 9%, driven by our newly acquired X-ray accessories business as well as higher tube sales. 
Our Particle Therapy business [indiscernible] third quarter revenue of $37 million, down from the year-ago period when we booked $91 million of revenues, including a substantial amount for the proton installation at the University of Maryland. Total company gross margin for the quarter was 43.9%, up by nearly 4 points with significant contribution from both Oncology and Imaging Components. Oncology Systems third quarter gross margin improved by more than 4 points to 46% with the help of a larger mix of TrueBeam's and software as well as productivity gains. Imaging Components third quarter gross margin also rose by more than 4 points to 42.9% due largely to factory productivity gains and favorable product mix.
R&D expenses were $65 million or 8% of revenue, equal as a percentage of revenue to the year-ago period. On a GAAP basis, third quarter SG&A expenses were $151 million or 19% of revenue. We had about $22 million of unusual expenses in SG&A for items, including ongoing patent litigation and the recently announced initiative to separate the Imaging Components business into a new publicly-traded company. Excluding these items, SG&A expenses on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter were $129 million or 16% of revenue. 
GAAP operating earnings for the quarter were 16.5% of revenue and 19.5% of revenue on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting our solid gross margin performance in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization totaled $18 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 25.1%, up 3 points from the year-ago quarter when we benefited from the favorable geographic mix of profits and tax loss carryforwards associated with the Proton business. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year. Fully diluted shares outstanding were $95.4 million, more than $5 million lower than the year-ago quarter due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.04 for the quarter on a GAAP basis and was $1.22 on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $836 million, debt of $701 million and stockholders equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 101 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter, but improved sequentially from the second quarter. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $95 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations year-to-date to $204 million. Primary uses of cash were $126 million for the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock, $95 million to reduce debt and $15 million for capital expenditure. At the end of the quarter, we had 4.8 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends to calendar year 2016. 
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

So we feel very good about kind of where that is. North America has certainly been the driver. And you're right, North America did get a high this quarter, but it is kind of a sustained trend that we're seeing, which is good. We did have a couple of multi-system orders, including one with HCA. We also had very strong demand, as I mentioned in the call, for software products. And VitalBeam, I think a little more than half of our VitalBeams have been sold in the Americas. So that VitalBeam has been part of the story. But I think the overall story though is TrueBeam. When you clearly look at what's going on, TrueBeam is what's driving both the Americas growth and the global growth, both in orders and in revenues. I mean some on the revenue side, Elisha talked about this on the revenue side, we had very good tubing mix on the quarter as some of the margin uptick. But it's -- from a kind of a market perspective. No, the U.S. is a replacement market, that's true. As I said on the call, we are seeing people trade-out aggressively to try to get new capability especially for advanced radiosurgery and body radiosurgery. I think reimbursement may have been a small factor, certainly not over last year, but having that be calm in the quarter, kind of short of -- short things up a little bit, and I think from a high level, that's kind of the story. From the market share point of view, we think we gained a little bit of share. But most of this is market."

But I guess, the reason -- when I look at your comments of the installed base, right, kind of 1% to 2% you guys have done better on the share front, that's showing up in the North America region from an orders perspective, right? But how much more software can you keep selling into the installed base, right? Or am I thinking about this the right way? Because I feel like having some clarity on that has a lot of implications on how people look at the company."

But the software is still very significant upside for us. And what I'm liking is we're getting very good customer response on the software products. I -- a decade ago, the shipping software it works, I don't love it. Now we're getting hey, that's what I likely to do. It's making me for productive in the workplace. I can do better care and take care of patients better. And you've had some external validation out of this with our class, the wind that's kind of the partner of radiation oncology class rate this #1 in treatment planning and in oncology information system. So we like that. So those were RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics are 2 examples. We do have -- in the 7,500 units win installed base, and that installed base, we also have 3,400, 3,500 software installation. So those are opportunities for us to take.

Varian is reporting solid results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, with strong growth order and revenue growth in our Oncology Systems and Imaging Components businesses, together with substantial improvements in gros",1055,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Varian is reporting solid results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, with strong growth order and revenue growth in our Oncology Systems and Imaging Components businesses, together with substantial improvements in gross and operating margins for both. 
In summary, the company is reporting GAAP net earnings of $1.04 per diluted share and $1.22 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis; revenues of $789 million, up 1% versus the year-ago quarter; a nearly 4-point improvement in the company's overall gross margin; and an order for new -- for a new multiroom proton installation in China, our first proton order there. 
Focusing on operational highlights. Our Oncology business generated third quarter gross orders of $676 million, up 6% in both dollars and constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas rose by 8% during the quarter with 15% growth in North America more than offsetting a greater than 40% decline in Latin America. 
Year-to-date gross order growth in North America is 8%, driven by a more stable reimbursement environment and, in this replacement market, a transition to more advanced clinically efficient systems. 
Gross orders in APAC increased 19% in dollars and 17% in constant currency during the quarter, driven by robust growth in China and Australia. 
In EMEA, gross orders declined 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency, reflecting weakness in Western European markets. 
Looking at each of the regions in more detail. Our growth in North America was driven by demand for our TrueBeam platform, including EDGE radiosurgery systems and our software offerings. Among the highlights for North America were several large multi-system orders from consolidated networks as well as competitive takeouts. 
Order activity in Latin America continued to be weak due to macroeconomic factors. During the quarter, we shipped the first units for the large tender conducted by Brazil's Ministry of Health a couple of years ago. 
Turning to APAC. The Icon Group placed the largest Varian order ever in Australia for 10 TrueBeam systems, 7 of which are going to new sites along with the full complement of our information management and treatment planning software. We had wins for several new accelerator installations in China, where we saw good orders growth. We also saw strong demand for our EDGE radiosurgery system in this market, where we continue to be the share leader. 
Elsewhere in APAC, we made good progress in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. Business was stable in Japan, where we saw good service growth. 
Turning to EMEA. Healthy gross order growth in emerging markets, including Iran, Russia, Ethiopia [indiscernible] and Libya was offset by weakness in Western Europe. Our third quarter business in Africa was outstanding with more than $25 million in gross orders. Among other wins, we saw Ethiopia order its first modern linear accelerators for cancer treatment. 
I'm pleased to report that overall unit order volumes was up in the quarter and year-to-date and that average pricing is stable. We're winning with clinically efficient advanced technology that makes quality cancer care affordable and accessible. This was reflected during the quarter, and strong orders to our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software. We booked our 500th order for RapidPlan, which is a game changer that enables clinics to improve the speed and quality of care for their patients. As of this quarter, treatment plans are now being shared among clinics through our ongoing OncoPeer web portal. 
As you all know, CMS has announced modest adjustments to reimbursement for 2017 for both hospitals and free-standing clinics. We don't expect for reimbursement to have a material impact on the radiation oncology markets in the U.S. next year. 
Following the topic of reimbursement, CMS did move forward with policies that will incentivize the adoption of digital X-ray imaging systems in place of film and computed radiography systems, and this should help to support growth in our Imaging Components business. 
Speaking of Imaging Components, the business returned to growth during the quarter. Orders grew by 13% to $138 million, and revenues rose by 9% to $147 million. Improvements in margins were driven by productivity gains and a favorable product mix. Our 2 business saw good growth in the quarter. We recently celebrated the 40th year of our relationship with Toshiba Medical Systems and look forward to continuing this relationship when they become part of Canon. 
Our recently acquired software and X-ray accessories businesses also helped to drive growth. 
Touching on the Industrial Imaging business, orders for security products were up in the quarter but we continue to have a cautious outlook in the face of ongoing customer consolidation. We continue to focus on generating growth in nondestructive testing and inspection. 
Let me update you on our progress towards the separation of the Imaging Components business into a new, independent publicly traded company via tax-free distribution to Varian stockholders. 
As you probably saw in the press release issued last week, the name of the new company will be Varex Imaging Corporation. We are now making good progress in the development of detailed plans and activities needed to execute the separation. We're on track to file an initial Form 10 with the SEC in the next several weeks, and we are currently on schedule to complete the separation at the end of the calendar year. We continue to be excited about the prospects of creating 2 great companies. 
Turning now to our Particle Therapy business. We booked an order during the quarter for a multiroom probing installation at the new Hefei medical center in China. This is China's first government-funded proton facility. Installation is waiting to take place in late 2017 with patient treatments scheduled to begin in late 2018. 
Our installation at Cincinnati Children's Hospital is on track with the first patient treatments scheduled to commence later this summer. 
We have now successfully commissioned the third room at the Maryland Proton Therapy (sic) [Treatment] Center, and installations are underway in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia. In total, we have 13 proton projects generating revenue. 
As you probably saw from our 8-K filing with the SEC at the end of June, we sold our $73 million senior loan for the New York Proton Therapy Center to Deutsche Bank, freeing up capital to help finance other proton projects. The proton sales funnel continues to look good. 
And now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 5% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $51 million, bringing net orders for the company to $814 million. 
Third quarter revenues for the total company were $789 million, up 1% in dollars and even with the year-ago period in constant currency. Year-to-date, total company revenues were $2.3 billion, up 1% in dollars and up 3% in constant currency. Oncology posted a revenue gain of 8%, both in dollars and in constant currency, driven by strength in our high-end equipment as well as our software and service businesses. 
Imaging Components posted a third-quarter revenue gain of 9%, driven by our newly acquired X-ray accessories business as well as higher tube sales. 
Our Particle Therapy business posted third-quarter revenue of $37 million, down from the year-ago period, when we booked $91 million of revenues, including a substantial amount for the ProBeam installation at the University of Maryland. 
Total company gross margin for the quarter was 43.9%, up by nearly 4 points with significant contributions from both Oncology and Imaging Components. Oncology System's third quarter gross margin improved by more than 4 points to 46% with the help of a larger mix of TrueBeams and software as well as productivity gains. 
Imaging Components' third-quarter gross margin also rose by more than 4 points to 42.9% due largely to factory productivity gains and favorable product mix.  R&D expenses were $65 million, or 8% of revenue, equal as a percentage of revenue to the year-ago quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, third quarter SG&A expenses, the $151 million or 19% of revenue, we had about $22 million of unusual expenses in SG&A for items, including ongoing patent litigation and the recently announced initiative to separate the Imaging Components business into a new publicly traded company. Excluding these items, SG&A expenses on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter were $129 million or 16% of revenue. 
GAAP operating earnings for the quarter were 16.5% of revenues and 19.5% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting our solid gross margin performance in the quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $18 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 25.1%, up 3 points from the year-ago quarter, when we benefited from the favorable geographic mix of profits and tax loss carryforwards associated with the proton business. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding were $95.4 million, more than $5 million lower than the year-ago quarter due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.04 for the quarter on a GAAP basis and was $1.22 on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $836 million, debt of $701 million and stockholder's equity of $1.7 billion. 
DSO at 101 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter but improved sequentially from the second quarter. 
Third quarter cash flow from operations was $95 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations year-to-date to $204 million. Primary uses of cash were $126 million for the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock, $95 million to reduce debt and $15 million for capital expenditure. At the end of the quarter, we had 4.8 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends to calendar year 2016. 
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

So we feel very good about kind of where that is. North America has certainly been the driver. And you're right, North America did get a high this quarter, but it is kind of a sustained trend that we're seeing, which is good. We did have a couple of multi-system orders, including one with HCA. We also had very strong demand, as I mentioned in the call, for software products. 
And VitalBeam, I think a little more than half of our VitalBeams have been sold in the Americas. So that's -- VitalBeam has been part of the story, but I think the overall story, though, is TrueBeam. 
When you clearly look at what's going on, TrueBeam is what's driving both the Americas growth and the global growth, both in orders and revenues. I mean, some of the -- on revenue side, Elisha will talk about this later, but on the revenue side, we had very good TrueBeam mix on the quarter as some of the margin uptick, but it's -- from a kind of a market perspective, the U.S., it is a replacement market. That's true. As I said in the call, we are seeing people trade out aggressively to try to get new capability, especially for advanced radiosurgery and body radiosurgery. 
I think reimbursement may have been a small factor, certainly not over last year, but having that be calm in the quarter, kind of short of have short up -- short things up a little bit. I think from a high level, that's kind of the story. And I think -- the other thing I was going to mention is from the market share point of view, we think we've gained a little bit of share, but most of this is market."

So can you speak to what trends here are seen in China and if you're seeing a similar pickup in activity in the radiation Oncology market in China?"

We had very strong demand, especially for high-end products, which, our EDGE products, as I mentioned on the call on the script, was very good. 
One of the things that we really like about the demand we're seeing is it is almost 90% new valves. It's -- so obviously, that's going to drive our long-term service business and software upgrade opportunities, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So these are new valves going in. They're happening on schedule. We are seeing significant tender activity. We do continue to see some protests of that activity. It doesn't change that much who wins. It just kind of lengthens the process. And they're also -- I mean, coming back to our previous question. In China, there is a large Siemens installed base opportunity. That's one of the geographies where they did the best, frankly because of their price position as much as anything else. And so I think over the next couple of years, we'll see maybe that installed base change out a little more aggressively. So that's going to be one to watch. 
The other thing to watch in China, we've got this -- the Hefei proton order, as I mentioned. We've -- we see a reasonable funnel of proton activity in China. So maybe this Hefei order will stimulate some proton growth in China."

We've got, inside of analytics, what have we sold? 250? 200-ish? We've got 7,300 to go. So we're in the top half of the first inning. Sorry, baseball analogy to my global friends. But we're -- the software is still -- has very significant upside for us. And what I'm liking is we're getting very good customer response on the software products. I -- a decade ago, ship me [ph] software and it works but I don't love it. Now we're getting, hey, if it does what I like it to do. It's making me for productive in the workplace. I can do better care and take care of patients better. And we've had some external validation out of this with our class, the wind that's kind of the gardener of radiation oncology class rate. It is #1 in treatment planning and in oncology information system. So we like that. 
So those were RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics are 2 examples. We do have -- in the 7,500 units linac installed base. In that installed base, we also have 3,400, 3,500 software installations. So those are opportunities for us to take rapid -- that's the low-hanging fruit of the RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics opportunity.

With history, if anything, a lot of them tend to be -- they want to be clinically advanced and they want to be very productive, cost-efficient. And sometimes, it takes a little bit longer to convince them. But once they're convinced, they tend to move faster because they've got the clinical data or the productivity data to make their business case. And they may take a little bit longer to convince them, but once they're convinced, they -- I -- one of the examples I've used historically on this is RapidArc with Kaiser. 
It took us a while to convince them that RapidArc was really clinically advantageous and was going to give them a productivity pop. Once they were convinced, Kaiser nor its outfit, every hospital within a year. It was just, bang. They really moved. And I think that's typical from what we see from these kind of customers.

Varian is reporting solid results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, with strong gross order and revenue growth in our Oncology Systems and Imaging Components businesses, together with substantial improvements in gross",1057,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Varian is reporting solid results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, with strong gross order and revenue growth in our Oncology Systems and Imaging Components businesses, together with substantial improvements in gross and operating margins for both. 
In summary, the company is reporting GAAP net earnings of $1.04 per diluted share and $1.22 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis; revenues of $789 million, up 1% versus the year-ago quarter; a nearly 4-point improvement in the company's overall gross margin; and an order for new -- for a new multiroom proton installation in China, our first proton order there. 
Focusing on operational highlights. Our Oncology business generated third quarter gross orders of $676 million, up 6% in both dollars and constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas rose by 8% during the quarter with 15% growth in North America more than offsetting a greater than 40% decline in Latin America. 
Year-to-date gross order growth in North America is 8%, driven by a more stable reimbursement environment and, in this replacement market, a transition to more advanced clinically efficient systems. 
Gross orders in APAC increased 19% in dollars and 17% in constant currency during the quarter, driven by robust growth in China and Australia. 
In EMEA, gross orders declined 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency, reflecting weakness in Western European markets. 
Looking at each of the regions in more detail. Our growth in North America was driven by demand for our TrueBeam platform, including EDGE radiosurgery systems and our software offerings. Among the highlights for North America were several large multi-system orders from consolidated networks as well as competitive takeouts. 
Order activity in Latin America continued to be weak due to macroeconomic factors. During the quarter, we shipped the first units for the large tender conducted by Brazil's Ministry of Health a couple of years ago. 
Turning to APAC. The Icon Group placed the largest Varian order ever in Australia for 10 TrueBeam systems, 7 of which are going to new sites along with the full complement of our information management and treatment planning software. We had wins for several new accelerator installations in China, where we saw good orders growth. We also saw strong demand for our EDGE radiosurgery system in this market, where we continue to be the share leader. 
Elsewhere in APAC, we made good progress in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. Business was stable in Japan, where we saw good service growth. 
Turning to EMEA. Healthy gross order growth in emerging markets, including Iran, Russia, Ethiopia Burkina Faso and Libya was offset by weakness in Western Europe. Our third quarter business in Africa was outstanding, with more than $25 million in gross orders. Among other wins, we saw Ethiopia order its first modern linear accelerators for cancer treatment. 
I'm pleased to report that overall unit order volumes were up in the quarter and year-to-date and that average pricing is stable. We're winning with clinically efficient advanced technology that makes quality cancer care affordable and accessible. This was reflected during the quarter, in strong orders for our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software. We booked our 500th order for RapidPlan, which is a game changer that enables clinics to improve the speed and quality of care for their patients. As of this quarter, treatment plans are now being shared among clinics through our ongoing OncoPeer web portal. 
As you all know, CMS has announced modest adjustments to reimbursement for 2017 for both hospitals and free-standing clinics. We don't expect for reimbursement to have a material impact on the radiation oncology markets in the U.S. next year. 
Following the topic of reimbursement, CMS did move forward with policies that will incentivize the adoption of digital X-ray imaging systems in place of film and computed radiography systems, and this should help to support growth in our Imaging Components business. 
Speaking of Imaging Components, the business returned to growth during the quarter. Orders grew by 13% to $138 million, and revenues rose by 9% to $147 million. Improvements in margins were driven by productivity gains and a favorable product mix. Our tube business saw good growth in the quarter. We recently celebrated the 40th year of our relationship with Toshiba Medical Systems and look forward to continuing this relationship when they become part of Canon. 
Our recently acquired software and X-ray accessories businesses also helped to drive growth. 
Touching on the Industrial Imaging business, orders for security products were up in the quarter but we continue to have a cautious outlook in the face of ongoing customer consolidation. We continue to focus on generating growth in nondestructive testing and inspection. 
Let me update you on our progress towards the separation of the Imaging Components business into a new, independent publicly traded company via tax-free distribution to Varian stockholders. 
As you probably saw in the press release issued last week, the name of the new company will be Varex Imaging Corporation. We are now making good progress in the development of detailed plans and activities needed to execute the separation. We're on track to file an initial Form 10 with the SEC in the next several weeks, and we are currently on schedule to complete the separation at the end of the calendar year. We continue to be excited about the prospects of creating 2 great companies. 
Turning now to our Particle Therapy business. We booked an order during the quarter for a multiroom probing installation at the new Hefei medical center in China. This is China's first government-funded proton facility. Installation is slated to take place in late 2017 with patient treatments scheduled to begin in late 2018. 
Our installation at Cincinnati Children's Hospital is on track with the first patient treatments scheduled to commence later this summer. 
We have now successfully commissioned the third room at the Maryland Proton Therapy (sic -- Treatment) Center, and installations are underway in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia. In total, we have 13 proton projects generating revenue. 
As you probably saw from our 8-K filing with the SEC at the end of June, we sold our $73 million senior loan for the New York Proton Therapy Center to Deutsche Bank, freeing up capital to help finance other proton projects. The proton sales funnel continues to look good. 
And now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 5% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $51 million, bringing net orders for the company to $814 million. 
Third quarter revenues for the total company were $789 million, up 1% in dollars and even with the year-ago period in constant currency. Year-to-date, total company revenues were $2.3 billion, up 1% in dollars and up 3% in constant currency. Oncology posted a revenue gain of 8%, both in dollars and in constant currency, driven by strength in our high-end equipment as well as our software and service businesses. 
Imaging Components posted a third-quarter revenue gain of 9%, driven by our newly acquired X-ray accessories business as well as higher tube sales. 
Our Particle Therapy business posted third-quarter revenue of $37 million, down from the year-ago period, when we booked $91 million of revenues, including a substantial amount for the ProBeam installation at the University of Maryland. 
Total company gross margin for the quarter was 43.9%, up by nearly 4 points with significant contributions from both Oncology and Imaging Components. Oncology Systems' third quarter gross margin improved by more than 4 points to 46% with the help of a larger mix of TrueBeams and software as well as productivity gains. 
Imaging Components' third-quarter gross margin also rose by more than 4 points to 42.9% due largely to factory productivity gains and favorable product mix. R&D expenses were $65 million, or 8% of revenue, equal as a percentage of revenue to the year-ago quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, third quarter SG&A expenses were $151 million or 19% of revenue, we had about $22 million of unusual expenses in SG&A for items, including ongoing patent litigation and the recently announced initiative to separate the Imaging Components business into a new publicly traded company. Excluding these items, SG&A expenses on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter were $129 million or 16% of revenue. 
GAAP operating earnings for the quarter were 16.5% of revenues and 19.5% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting our solid gross margin performance in the quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $18 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 25.1%, up 3 points from the year-ago quarter, when we benefited from a favorable geographic mix of profits and tax loss carryforwards associated with the proton business. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding were $95.4 million, more than $5 million lower than the year-ago quarter due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.04 for the quarter on a GAAP basis and was $1.22 on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $836 million, debt of $701 million and stockholder's equity of $1.7 billion. 
DSO at 101 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter but improved sequentially from the second quarter. 
Third quarter cash flow from operations was $95 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations year-to-date to $204 million. Primary uses of cash were $126 million for the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock, $95 million to reduce debt and $15 million for capital expenditure. At the end of the quarter, we had 4.8 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends to calendar year 2016. 
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

So we feel very good about kind of where that is. North America has certainly been the driver. And you're right, North America did hit a high this quarter, but it is kind of a sustained trend that we're seeing, which is good. We did have a couple of multi-system orders, including one with HCA. We also had very strong demand, as I mentioned in the call, for software products. 
And VitalBeam, I think a little more than half of our VitalBeams have been sold in the Americas. So that's -- VitalBeam has been part of the story, but I think the overall story, though, is TrueBeam. 
When you clearly look at what's going on, TrueBeam is what's driving both the Americas growth and the global growth, both in orders and revenues. I mean, some of the -- on the revenue side, Elisha will talk about this later, but on the revenue side, we had very good TrueBeam mix on the quarter, that's some of the margin uptick, but it's -- from a kind of a market perspective, the U.S. is a replacement market. That's true. As I said in the call, we are seeing people trade out aggressively to try to get new capability, especially for advanced radiosurgery and body radiosurgery. 
I think reimbursement may have been a small factor -- certainly not over last year, but having that be calm in the quarter, kind of shored up -- shored things up a little bit. I think from a high level, that's kind of the story. And I think -- the other thing I was going to mention is from the market share point of view, we think we've gained a little bit of share, but most of this is market."

We had very strong demand, especially for high-end products, which, our EDGE products, as I mentioned on the call on the script, was very good. 
One of the things that we really like about the demand we're seeing is it is almost 90% new socket. It's -- so obviously, that's going to drive our long-term service business and software upgrade opportunities, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So these are new socket going in. They're happening on schedule. We are seeing significant tender activity. We do continue to see some protests of that activity. It doesn't change that much who wins. It just kind of lengthens the process. And they're also -- I mean, coming back to our previous question. In China, there is a large Siemens installed base opportunity. That's one of the geographies where they did the best, frankly because of their price position as much as anything else. And so I think over the next couple of years, we'll see maybe that installed base change out a little more aggressively. So that's going to be one to watch. 
The other thing to watch in China, we've got this  Hefei proton order, as I mentioned. We've -- we see a reasonable funnel of proton activity in China. So maybe this Hefei order will stimulate some proton growth in China."

I -- a decade ago, ""Oh, you ship me software and it works but I don't love it."" Now we're getting, ""Hey, if it does what I like it to do. It's making me for productive in the workplace. I can do better care and take care of patients better."" And we've had some external validation out of this with our class -- the Wynn [ph], which is kind of the Gartner of radiation oncology -- Class rate is #1 in treatment planning and in oncology information systems, so we like that. 
So those were -- RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics are 2 examples. We do have -- in the 7,500 units linac installed base. In that installed base, we also have 3,400, 3,500 software installations.

With history, if anything, a lot of them tend to be -- they want to be clinically advanced and they want to be very productive, cost-efficient. And sometimes, it takes a little bit longer to convince them.

And they may take a little bit longer to convince them, but once they're convinced, they -- I -- one of the examples I've used historically on this is RapidArc with Kaiser. 
It took us a while to convince them that RapidArc was really clinically advantageous and was going to give them a productivity pop. Once they were convinced, Kaiser and Orrick outfit every hospital one year. It was just, bang. They really moved. And I think that's typical from what we see from these kind of customers.

Focusing on operational highlights. Our Oncology business generated third quarter gross orders of $676 million, up 6% in both dollars and constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas rose by 8% during the quarter with 15% growth in North America more than offsetting a greater than 40% decline in Latin America. 
Year-to-date gross order growth in North America is 8%, driven by a more stable reimbursement environment and, in this replacement market, a transition to more advanced clinically efficient systems. 
Gross orders in APAC increased 19% in dollars and 17% in constant currency during the quarter, driven by robust growth in China and Australia. 
In EMEA, gross orders declined 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency, reflecting weakness in Western European markets. 
Looking at each of the regions in more detail. Our growth in North America was driven by demand for our TrueBeam platform, including EDGE radiosurgery systems and our software offerings. Among the highlights for North America were several large multi-system orders from consolidated networks as well as competitive takeouts. 
Order activity in Latin America continued to be weak due to macroeconomic factors. During the quarter, we shipped the first units for the large tender conducted by Brazil's Ministry of Health a couple of years ago. 
Turning to APAC. The Icon Group placed the largest Varian order ever in Australia for 10 TrueBeam systems, 7 of which are going to new sites along with the full complement of our information management and treatment planning software. We had wins for several new accelerator installations in China, where we saw good orders growth. We also saw strong demand for our EDGE radiosurgery system in this market, where we continue to be the share leader. 
Elsewhere in APAC, we made good progress in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. Business was stable in Japan, where we saw good service growth. 
Turning to EMEA. Healthy gross order growth in emerging markets, including Iran, Russia, Ethiopia Burkina Faso and Libya was offset by weakness in Western Europe. Our third quarter business in Africa was outstanding, with more than $25 million in gross orders. Among other wins, we saw Ethiopia order its first modern linear accelerators for cancer treatment. 
I'm pleased to report that overall unit order volumes were up in the quarter and year-to-date and that average pricing is stable. We're winning with clinically efficient advanced technology that makes quality cancer care affordable and accessible. This was reflected during the quarter, in strong orders for our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software. We booked our 500th order for RapidPlan, which is a game changer that enables clinics to improve the speed and quality of care for their patients. As of this quarter, treatment plans are now being shared among clinics through our ongoing OncoPeer web portal. 
As you all know, CMS has announced modest adjustments to reimbursement for 2017 for both hospitals and free-standing clinics. We don't expect for reimbursement to have a material impact on the radiation oncology markets in the U.S. next year. 
Following the topic of reimbursement, CMS did move forward with policies that will incentivize the adoption of digital X-ray imaging systems in place of film and computed radiography systems, and this should help to support growth in our Imaging Components business. 
Speaking of Imaging Components, the business returned to growth during the quarter. Orders grew by 13% to $138 million, and revenues rose by 9% to $147 million. Improvements in margins were driven by productivity gains and a favorable product mix. Our tube business saw good growth in the quarter. We recently celebrated the 40th year of our relationship with Toshiba Medical Systems and look forward to continuing this relationship when they become part of Canon. 
Our recently acquired software and X-ray accessories businesses also helped to drive growth. 
Touching on the Industrial Imaging business, orders for security products were up in the quarter but we continue to have a cautious outlook in the face of ongoing customer consolidation. We continue to focus on generating growth in nondestructive testing and inspection. 
Let me update you on our progress towards the separation of the Imaging Components business into a new, independent publicly traded company via tax-free distribution to Varian stockholders. 
As you probably saw in the press release issued last week, the name of the new company will be Varex Imaging Corporation. We are now making good progress in the development of detailed plans and activities needed to execute the separation. We're on track to file an initial Form 10 with the SEC in the next several weeks, and we are currently on schedule to complete the separation at the end of the calendar year. We continue to be excited about the prospects of creating 2 great companies. 
Turning now to our Particle Therapy business. We booked an order during the quarter for a multiroom probing installation at the new Hefei medical center in China. This is China's first government-funded proton facility. Installation is slated to take place in late 2017 with patient treatments scheduled to begin in late 2018. 
Our installation at Cincinnati Children's Hospital is on track with the first patient treatments scheduled to commence later this summer. 
We have now successfully commissioned the third room at the Maryland Proton Therapy (sic -- Treatment) Center, and installations are underway in Holland, Russia and Saudi Arabia. In total, we have 13 proton projects generating revenue. 
As you probably saw from our 8-K filing with the SEC at the end of June, we sold our $73 million senior loan for the New York Proton Therapy Center to Deutsche Bank, freeing up capital to help finance other proton projects. The proton sales funnel continues to look good. 
And now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 5% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $51 million, bringing net orders for the company to $814 million. 
Third quarter revenues for the total company were $789 million, up 1% in dollars and even with the year-ago period in constant currency. Year-to-date, total company revenues were $2.3 billion, up 1% in dollars and up 3% in constant currency. Oncology posted a revenue gain of 8%, both in dollars and in constant currency, driven by strength in our high-end equipment as well as our software and service businesses. 
Imaging Components posted a third-quarter revenue gain of 9%, driven by our newly acquired X-ray accessories business as well as higher tube sales. 
Our Particle Therapy business posted third-quarter revenue of $37 million, down from the year-ago period, when we booked $91 million of revenues, including a substantial amount for the ProBeam installation at the University of Maryland. 
Total company gross margin for the quarter was 43.9%, up by nearly 4 points with significant contributions from both Oncology and Imaging Components. Oncology Systems' third quarter gross margin improved by more than 4 points to 46% with the help of a larger mix of TrueBeams and software as well as productivity gains. 
Imaging Components' third-quarter gross margin also rose by more than 4 points to 42.9% due largely to factory productivity gains and favorable product mix. R&D expenses were $65 million, or 8% of revenue, equal as a percentage of revenue to the year-ago quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, third quarter SG&A expenses were $151 million or 19% of revenue, we had about $22 million of unusual expenses in SG&A for items, including ongoing patent litigation and the recently announced initiative to separate the Imaging Components business into a new publicly traded company. Excluding these items, SG&A expenses on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter were $129 million or 16% of revenue. 
GAAP operating earnings for the quarter were 16.5% of revenues and 19.5% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting our solid gross margin performance in the quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $18 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 25.1%, up 3 points from the year-ago quarter, when we benefited from a favorable geographic mix of profits and tax loss carryforwards associated with the proton business. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be about 26% to 27% for the year. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding were $95.4 million, more than $5 million lower than the year-ago quarter due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.04 for the quarter on a GAAP basis and was $1.22 on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $836 million, debt of $701 million and stockholder's equity of $1.7 billion. 
DSO at 101 days was up significantly from the year-ago quarter but improved sequentially from the second quarter. 
Third quarter cash flow from operations was $95 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations year-to-date to $204 million. Primary uses of cash were $126 million for the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock, $95 million to reduce debt and $15 million for capital expenditure. At the end of the quarter, we had 4.8 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends to calendar year 2016. 
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

So we feel very good about kind of where that is. North America has certainly been the driver. And you're right, North America did hit a high this quarter, but it is kind of a sustained trend that we're seeing, which is good. We did have a couple of multi-system orders, including one with HCA. We also had very strong demand, as I mentioned in the call, for software products. 
And VitalBeam, I think a little more than half of our VitalBeams have been sold in the Americas. So that's -- VitalBeam has been part of the story, but I think the overall story, though, is TrueBeam. 
When you clearly look at what's going on, TrueBeam is what's driving both the Americas growth and the global growth, both in orders and revenues. I mean, some of the -- on the revenue side, Elisha will talk about this later, but on the revenue side, we had very good TrueBeam mix on the quarter, that's some of the margin uptick, but it's -- from a kind of a market perspective, the U.S. is a replacement market. That's true. As I said in the call, we are seeing people trade out aggressively to try to get new capability, especially for advanced radiosurgery and body radiosurgery. 
I think reimbursement may have been a small factor -- certainly not over last year, but having that be calm in the quarter, kind of shored up -- shored things up a little bit. I think from a high level, that's kind of the story. And I think -- the other thing I was going to mention is from the market share point of view, we think we've gained a little bit of share, but most of this is market."

One of the things that we really like about the demand we're seeing is it is almost 90% new socket. It's -- so obviously, that's going to drive our long-term service business and software upgrade opportunities, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So these are new socket going in. They're happening on schedule. We are seeing significant tender activity. We do continue to see some protests of that activity. It doesn't change that much who wins. It just kind of lengthens the process. And they're also -- I mean, coming back to our previous question. In China, there is a large Siemens installed base opportunity. That's one of the geographies where they did the best, frankly because of their price position as much as anything else. And so I think over the next couple of years, we'll see maybe that installed base change out a little more aggressively. So that's going to be one to watch.

It took us a while to convince them that RapidArc was really clinically advantageous and was going to give them a productivity pop.

Orders in the Oncology and pro",1519,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Our company finished fiscal year 2016 on a positive note, with healthy fourth quarter growth in revenues and significant margin improvement in both our Oncology and Imaging Components businesses. Orders in the Oncology and proton businesses, on the other hand, were down during the quarter versus tough year-ago comparisons in which we had record-setting Oncology growth in Western Europe and in our proton business. 
To summarize, our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2016 we are reporting GAAP net earnings of $1.24 per diluted share, up from $0.99 in the year-ago quarter; non-GAAP net earnings of $1.38 per diluted share, up more than 30% from $1.04 in year-ago quarter; a decline in Oncology orders due to weakness in Western Europe; revenues of $912 million, up 12% in dollars and up 11% in constant currency; and gains of about 4 percentage points in our gross margin, with significant improvements in both our major businesses. 
Focusing on Oncology operations. Orders totaled $897 million for the fourth quarter, down 2% in dollars and down 4% in constant currency versus a strong year-ago quarter. Orders for the year totaled $2.7 billion, up 1% from the prior year and up 2% in constant currency. 
Fourth quarter orders in the Americas grew by 4% in dollars, an increase by 3% in constant currency for the year. Orders in the Americas were up 4% in both dollars and constant currency. 
In North America, orders fell by 2% in the fourth quarter but grew by 5% for the year, ahead of our expectations for this market. 
Fourth quarter Oncology orders in APAC rose by 8% in dollars and fell by 1% in constant currency. For the full year, APAC orders rose by 5% in dollars and by 3% in constant currency. 
In EMEA, Oncology orders declined by 17% in dollars and in constant currency, principally because of weakness in Western Europe, where we had exceptionally strong growth in the year-ago quarter when we set a record by booking orders for more than 100 accelerators. 
For the year, orders in EMEA were down 6% in dollars and down 4% in constant currency, driven by weakness in Western Europe. 
Comparing revenues on a trailing 12-month basis, we believe we gained market share versus our primary competition. Our average selling price rose with the help of a higher mix of TrueBeam and VitalBeam orders. We generated solid order growth during the quarter in emerging markets, including Brazil, Africa and in the Middle East. 
In Brazil, we booked nearly $30 million of new business, including a big win at Grupo Oncoclínicas, where we will be installing 13 TrueBeam and VitalBeam accelerators as well as software to support clinical operations. These will be the first VitalBeam accelerators installed in Latin America. 
Colombia was also a strong contributor to robust order growth in the quarter. Total orders in Latin America exceeded $60 million during the quarter, up more than 70% from the prior year period. 
Other emerging markets contributing to Oncology orders during the quarter included Africa, with about $20 million; and the Middle East, where we booked more than $40 million. As an example of progress, we received a $14 million order for 8 accelerators at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. 
In APAC emerging markets, we generated healthy order growth in Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines. Developed markets, particularly Japan, also contributed to the order growth in this region. Meanwhile, orders in Greater China were down from the year-ago period in part because of continuing tender protest. While we are anniversary-ing the effects of these multiple orders, and while we are retaining the book of the business that we've won, we estimate that orders in China in the fiscal year could have been more than $15 million higher without this protest activity. 
Turning to North America. We established a significant new 3-year strategic agreement with McKesson Specialty Health to supply its U.S. oncology and vantage cancer treatment networks with equipment, software and services. In the first phase, we will be equipping centers with 7 TrueBeam and 5 VitalBeam accelerators. We also will be working to establish interoperability with Varian's information management and McKesson's iKnowMed G2 clinical oncology software. We see an opportunity here to support these networks with more of our Eclipse, ARIA, Velocity and new 360 Oncology software. 
Overall, we had a very good year in North America, where we had in excess of $130 million in takeouts of more than 40 accelerators and nearly 100 software installations from competitors. 
As you know, we've just returned from ASTRO in Boston. It was a great show for us, with some 900 attendees at our users meeting, numerous customers from emerging markets and very positive response to several major new products that we'll be bringing to market this year. 
We introduced 360 Oncology, a first-of-its-kind software tool that enables clinicians on tumor boards to more effectively coordinate patient care among the numerous specialists involved in cancer treatment. This software also provides patients with a clearer picture of how the many elements involving -- involved in treating their cancer fit together. Customer response is enthusiastic, and we believe we have a winning product on our hands. 
We also showed our progress in the development of our HyperArc technology for automating and simplifying the delivery of stereotactic radiosurgery, with more compact dose distribution and better protection of surrounding healthy tissue. We're aiming to introduce this important upgrade to our TrueBeam and EDGE platforms this year, beginning with a module for treating head and neck cancers. 
Oncology administrators are also very interested in our initiative, in which we will be enhancing the security embedded within Varian software systems. We believe we have a leading position in the development of this important new capability, and we expect it could generate an additional $80 million in revenues by the end of fiscal year 2018. 
We have continued to see a very positive market response to our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software products that help to improve the speed, quality and cost efficiency of treatments. We've taken more than 650 orders for RapidPlan since its launch and more than 135 orders for our InSightive software. 
Touching on the service business. Global revenues rose by 7% during the quarter, with gains in all geographies. 
Turning now to our Particle Therapy business. We generated $38 million in orders during the fourth quarter, bringing total orders for the year to $104 million. Orders were down significantly from fiscal 2015 when we had a total of 6 system orders, including an $87 million order for our probing system at the University of Maryland. 
Revenues from 14 ongoing projects grew nicely, reaching $68 million in the fourth quarter and bringing total revenues for the year to $163 million, including about $10 million in annual service revenues. 
During the fourth quarter, we booked our first single-room ProBeam Compact order, marking an important milestone for the business. This new system will be installed at the Advanced Medicine Training Centre in Singapore, where Varian will also provide its Eclipse treatment planning system. We also have a 10-year agreement to service this system. 
Also during the quarter, the U.K.'s University College London Hospital placed an order for a fourth treatment gantry at the proton therapy center that is currently under construction. 
Earlier this month, treatments commenced using our ProBeam system at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, making it the fifth Varian-equipped proton center to treat clinically. At this point, the proton sales funnel looks healthy, and I'm pleased by the progress we are making. 
  
Let me turn now to Imaging Components. Recovery in this business continued in the fourth quarter. Orders grew by 2% to $168 million in the fourth quarter, resulting in 7% orders growth for the last 6 months. Orders for the year totaled $571 million, down 6% from the prior year because of first half headwinds, including significant purchasing slowdowns at 2 major customers. Revenues were up 7% for the fourth quarter and down 2% for the year. 
Our MeVis and Claymount acquisitions as well as successful efforts to develop business with new customers contributed to Imaging Components' order and revenue growth during the quarter. Great cost control as well as a favorable product mix in tubes and flat panel imaging detectors and higher volumes in our security and inspection line enabled the Imaging business to achieve the significant gain in its gross margin for the quarter. 
Looking at operational highlights for the whole year. The Imaging Components business introduced 20 new products, completed 140,000 square foot expansion of its manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, opened a new facility in China to service growing customer base there, successfully integrated and mobilized its MeVis and Claymount acquisitions, added 12 new customers to offset slower purchasing from established customers and exceeded its profit targets. We're proud of this performance, and we expect Imaging Components to be a great company that delivers solid returns when it separates from Varian and has established as Varex Imaging, an independent publicly traded company. Work on the separation continues to go smoothly. 
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

Dow has already covered gross orders, so let me start with backlog. We ended the quarter at $3.5 billion, down 1% from the year-ago period, with a gain in Oncology offset by declines in our Particle Therapy and Imaging Components backlogs. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $47 million, bringing net orders for the company to $1.1 million. 
Fourth quarter revenues for the total company were $912 million, up 12% in dollars and up 11% in constant currency. For the year, total company revenues were $3.2 billion, up 4% in dollars and up 5% in constant currency. 
Oncology posted a fourth quarter revenue gain, up 7% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. For the year, Oncology revenues increased 5% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. 
Imaging Components posted a fourth quarter revenue gain of 7%, driven by our recently acquired X-ray accessories businesses as well as security and inspection products. Including the challenges in the first half, Imaging Components revenues declined 2% for the full year. 
Our Particle Therapy business posted fourth quarter revenues of $68 million, bringing total revenues for the year to $163 million, a 13% increase from the prior year. 
The total company gross margin for the quarter was 42.7%, up by nearly 4 points, with significant contributions from both Oncology and Imaging Components. 
Oncology Systems fourth quarter gross margin improved by about 5 points to 45.3%, with the help of favorable product and geographic mix shifts as well as product cost reductions. For the year, Oncology Systems gross margin improved by almost 2 points to 44.5%. 
Imaging Components fourth quarter gross margin rose by about 3 points to 42.1% due largely to favorable product mix, high volumes in tube and security products and lower warranty cost. For the year, Imaging Components gross margin improved by about 1 point to 41.9%. 
R&D expenses were $66 million or 7% of revenue, down 1 point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. For the year, R&D expenses were $254 million or equal with the prior year as a percentage of revenue at 8%.
On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $152 million or 17% of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $134 million or 15% of revenue. 
The $19 million in non-GAAP adjustments, primarily related to the planned separation of the Imaging Components business, ongoing patent litigation and amortization of intangibles. 
Operating earnings for the quarter were 18.6% of revenues on a GAAP basis and 20.7% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting our solid gross margin performance in the quarter. 
For the year, our operating earnings were 17.1% of revenues on a GAAP basis and up 50 basis points from the prior year to 19.1% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $24 million for the fourth quarter and $80 million for the year. The fourth quarter effective tax rate is 31.1%, up from the year-ago quarter due to an unfavorable geographic mix of profits. For the year, the effective tax rate was 27.6%. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 94.5 million, down almost 5 million shares from the year-ago period due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Fourth quarter diluted EPS was $1.24 for the quarter on a GAAP basis and $1.38 on a non-GAAP basis. For the year, diluted EPS was $4.19 on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted EPS rose 9% to $4.68. 
 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $844 million, debt of $667 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. 
DSO at 93 days was up from the year-ago quarter, but improved sequentially from the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $152 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations for the year to $356 million. Primary uses of cash were $87 million for the repurchase of about 1 million shares of stock, $43 million to reduce debt and $20 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the quarter, we had 3.8 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization. 
Before I turn it over to Dow, as you may have seen in the release issued before this call, I intend to retire from Varian in fiscal year 2017. I will remain in my current role as CFO until a replacement is found and a smooth transition has been completed. I will also continue leading the separation of our Imaging Components business. We have a tremendous finance team that will perform to this transition to a new CFO without missing a beat. It has been an honor to serve all of Varian's investors and analysts over the past 17.5 years, and it's been a privilege to be part of a tremendous growth story that has seen Varian become a global power in the fight against cancer. 
Thank you for being part of the story with me. And now here's Dow."

I've been fortunate to have Elisha on our management team. I'm confident that we'll make a smooth transition. 
Turning now to guidance. We believe that for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, non-GAAP earnings for the total company, including the Imaging Components business and ramp-up costs for its separation, will be in the range of $1.03 to $1.07 per diluted share, and revenues will increase by about 1% to 2%. 
As we announced earlier, we will not give earnings guidance for the full fiscal year until after we have completed the separation of the Imaging Components business. 
For the full fiscal year 2017, we expect that Varian revenues, excluding the Imaging Components business, will rise by 3% to 4%. We expect that Imaging Components revenues for the full fiscal year 2017 will also rise by 3% to 4%. 
We're now ready for your questions."

And I think that slowed down collections in the first half, and we are continuing to feel that effect. Although we're making good progress, collections in Q3 and Q4 were very strong, but as we move into FY '17, absolutely, AR collections is going to be a big focus for the entire team. Little bit of it has to do with more extended terms. In a 0 interest-rate environment, we can continue to win high-margin business by offering terms. And then some of it also, both inventory and AR, up in the proton business as we continue to grow that business. And with percentage of completion accounting, it gets a little funky in proton because a lot of times we're taking revenue and creating an AR under the percentage of completion long before the builds are actually due by the customer. But it will be a big focus as we move into this year."

Now when you look at some of the capabilities, the interesting thing when you talk about HyperArc, it's HyperArc's available on every one of those TrueBeams. So this is kind of our first real -- we've had some other smaller upgrades to that we've offered on TrueBeam, like some imaging improvements and some other things over the last few years. But the HyperArc for some of the stereotactic radiosurgery applications that Dr. talked about at ASTRO will be available on the EDGE and TrueBeam only. So very excited about that. I think that the probably drive some of the other installed base to trade out to TrueBeam as well. So very encouraged about that. We're, I'd say, when you look at the past quarter, Americas was almost virtually 100% TrueBeam, VitalBeam, might have been 1 or 2 that weren't, but pretty much everything in the Americas -- North America for sure was TrueBeam VitalBeam. In rest of the -- and I'd say of those in terms of the capabilities that they had in the fourth quarter, maybe half-ish had SRS SBRT capability. When you look at the installed base, big opportunity there. Most of them do not have that capability. And so I think this bodes well for us next year in 2 ways. One, it's an upgrade opportunity; and two, it's going to help us on pricing on TrueBeam. It's going to -- we're going to be able to maintain or grow price on TrueBeam, and I think that's a little bit of the -- we're doing very well on the cost side. We're just margin rate improvement coming from. We're doing very well on the cost side, the operational team's done a fabulous job getting cost down on TrueBeam.

So for example, in prostate cancer, over the last half dozen years, we've lost little bit of shared robotic surgery. But I think now I still start to go hypofractionation, we get a lot of those patients back. The results are as good or better than surgery, and that's well documented. And then as well, I think the other big opportunity from a clinical growth perspective here is metastatic disease, this capability really enables a very precise dose deposition. And we think that there are, in the U.S. alone, 300,000 patients that we could have opportunity to go after with this capability and bring some new folks into the radiation therapy paradigm.

Software, we had very good year in treatment planning. We talked about that in the script with all the RapidPlan orders. I think this next year, with the improvements that we have in our InSightive Analytics and with our 360 Oncology product, that can be very exciting. We're curious little bit to see how that goes because the 360 Oncology is going to be cloud-based, so the financial impact is going to be a little more back-end loaded as we accumulate sites due to billing and click the orders on that basis. I think it's going to be a little -- it is a little bit of a transition as we go kind of from a annual license model to a software-as-a-service model. So having said that, one of the really cool things about the 360 Oncology product is it can play not just in ARIA Varian sites, it can play in every radiation oncology site in the world. And just really a great opportunity for us to get some penetration insights that we don't have today."

Orders in the Oncology and pro",1519,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Our company finished fiscal year 2016 on a positive note, with healthy fourth quarter growth in revenues and significant margin improvement in both our Oncology and Imaging Components businesses. Orders in the Oncology and proton businesses, on the other hand, were down during the quarter versus tough year-ago comparisons in which we had record-setting Oncology growth in Western Europe and in our proton business. 
To summarize, our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2016 we are reporting GAAP net earnings of $1.24 per diluted share, up from $0.99 in the year-ago quarter; non-GAAP net earnings of $1.38 per diluted share, up more than 30% from $1.04 in year-ago quarter; a decline in Oncology orders due to weakness in Western Europe; revenues of $912 million, up 12% in dollars and up 11% in constant currency; and gains of about 4 percentage points in our gross margin, with significant improvements in both our major businesses. 
Focusing on Oncology operations. Orders totaled $897 million for the fourth quarter, down 2% in dollars and down 4% in constant currency versus a strong year-ago quarter. Orders for the year totaled $2.7 billion, up 1% from the prior year and up 2% in constant currency. 
Fourth quarter orders in the Americas grew by 4% in dollars, an increase by 3% in constant currency for the year. Orders in the Americas were up 4% in both dollars and constant currency. 
In North America, orders fell by 2% in the fourth quarter but grew by 5% for the year, ahead of our expectations for this market. 
Fourth quarter Oncology orders in APAC rose by 8% in dollars and fell by 1% in constant currency. For the full year, APAC orders rose by 5% in dollars and by 3% in constant currency. 
In EMEA, Oncology orders declined by 17% in dollars and in constant currency, principally because of weakness in Western Europe, where we had exceptionally strong growth in the year-ago quarter when we set a record by booking orders for more than 100 accelerators. 
For the year, orders in EMEA were down 6% in dollars and down 4% in constant currency, driven by weakness in Western Europe. 
Comparing revenues on a trailing 12-month basis, we believe we gained market share versus our primary competition. Our average selling price rose with the help of a higher mix of TrueBeam and VitalBeam orders. We generated solid order growth during the quarter in emerging markets, including Brazil, Africa and in the Middle East. 
In Brazil, we booked nearly $30 million of new business, including a big win at Grupo Oncoclínicas, where we will be installing 13 TrueBeam and VitalBeam accelerators as well as software to support clinical operations. These will be the first VitalBeam accelerators installed in Latin America. 
Colombia was also a strong contributor to robust order growth in the quarter. Total orders in Latin America exceeded $60 million during the quarter, up more than 70% from the prior year period. 
Other emerging markets contributing to Oncology orders during the quarter included Africa, with about $20 million; and the Middle East, where we booked more than $40 million. As an example of progress, we received a $14 million order for 8 accelerators at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. 
In APAC emerging markets, we generated healthy order growth in Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines. Developed markets, particularly Japan, also contributed to the order growth in this region. Meanwhile, orders in Greater China were down from the year-ago period in part because of continuing tender protest. While we are anniversary-ing the effects of these multiple orders, and while we are retaining the book of the business that we've won, we estimate that orders in China in the fiscal year could have been more than $15 million higher without this protest activity. 
Turning to North America. We established a significant new 3-year strategic agreement with McKesson Specialty Health to supply its U.S. oncology and vantage cancer treatment networks with equipment, software and services. In the first phase, we will be equipping centers with 7 TrueBeam and 5 VitalBeam accelerators. We also will be working to establish interoperability with Varian's information management and McKesson's iKnowMed G2 clinical oncology software. We see an opportunity here to support these networks with more of our Eclipse, ARIA, Velocity and new 360 Oncology software. 
Overall, we had a very good year in North America, where we had in excess of $130 million in takeouts of more than 40 accelerators and nearly 100 software installations from competitors. 
As you know, we've just returned from ASTRO in Boston. It was a great show for us, with some 900 attendees at our users meeting, numerous customers from emerging markets and very positive response to several major new products that we'll be bringing to market this year. 
We introduced 360 Oncology, a first-of-its-kind software tool that enables clinicians on tumor boards to more effectively coordinate patient care among the numerous specialists involved in cancer treatment. This software also provides patients with a clearer picture of how the many elements involving -- involved in treating their cancer fit together. Customer response is enthusiastic, and we believe we have a winning product on our hands. 
We also showed our progress in the development of our HyperArc technology for automating and simplifying the delivery of stereotactic radiosurgery, with more compact dose distribution and better protection of surrounding healthy tissue. We're aiming to introduce this important upgrade to our TrueBeam and EDGE platforms this year, beginning with a module for treating head and neck cancers. 
Oncology administrators are also very interested in our initiative, in which we will be enhancing the security embedded within Varian software systems. We believe we have a leading position in the development of this important new capability, and we expect it could generate an additional $80 million in revenues by the end of fiscal year 2018. 
We have continued to see a very positive market response to our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software products that help to improve the speed, quality and cost efficiency of treatments. We've taken more than 650 orders for RapidPlan since its launch and more than 135 orders for our InSightive software. 
Touching on the service business. Global revenues rose by 7% during the quarter, with gains in all geographies. 
Turning now to our Particle Therapy business. We generated $38 million in orders during the fourth quarter, bringing total orders for the year to $104 million. Orders were down significantly from fiscal 2015 when we had a total of 6 system orders, including an $87 million order for our ProBeam system at the University of Maryland. 
Revenues from 14 ongoing projects grew nicely, reaching $68 million in the fourth quarter and bringing total revenues for the year to $163 million, including about $10 million in annual service revenues. 
During the fourth quarter, we booked our first single-room ProBeam Compact order, marking an important milestone for the business. This new system will be installed at the Advanced Medicine Training Centre in Singapore, where Varian will also provide its Eclipse treatment planning system. We also have a 10-year agreement to service this system. 
Also during the quarter, the U.K.'s University College London Hospital placed an order for a fourth treatment gantry at the proton therapy center that is currently under construction. 
Earlier this month, treatments commenced using our ProBeam system at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, making it the fifth Varian-equipped proton center to treat clinically. At this point, the proton sales funnel looks healthy, and I'm pleased by the progress we are making. 
  
Let me turn now to Imaging Components. Recovery in this business continued in the fourth quarter. Orders grew by 2% to $168 million in the fourth quarter, resulting in 7% orders growth for the last 6 months. Orders for the year totaled $571 million, down 6% from the prior year because of first half headwinds, including significant purchasing slowdowns at 2 major customers. Revenues were up 7% for the fourth quarter and down 2% for the year. 
Our MeVis and Claymount acquisitions as well as successful efforts to develop business with new customers contributed to Imaging Components' order and revenue growth during the quarter. Great cost control as well as a favorable product mix in tubes and flat panel imaging detectors and higher volumes in our security and inspection line enabled the Imaging business to achieve the significant gain in its gross margin for the quarter. 
Looking at operational highlights for the whole year. The Imaging Components business introduced 20 new products, completed 140,000 square foot expansion of its manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, opened a new facility in China to service growing customer base there, successfully integrated and mobilized its MeVis and Claymount acquisitions, added 12 new customers to offset slower purchasing from established customers and exceeded its profit targets. We're proud of this performance, and we expect Imaging Components to be a great company that delivers solid returns when it separates from Varian and has established as Varex Imaging, an independent publicly traded company. Work on the separation continues to go smoothly. 
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

We ended the quarter at $3.5 billion, down 1% from the year-ago period, with a gain in Oncology offset by declines in our Particle Therapy and Imaging Components backlogs. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $47 million, bringing net orders for the company to $1.1 million. 
Fourth quarter revenues for the total company were $912 million, up 12% in dollars and up 11% in constant currency. For the year, total company revenues were $3.2 billion, up 4% in dollars and up 5% in constant currency. 
Oncology posted a fourth quarter revenue gain, up 7% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. For the year, Oncology revenues increased 5% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. 
Imaging Components posted a fourth quarter revenue gain of 7%, driven by our recently acquired X-ray accessories businesses as well as security and inspection products. Including the challenges in the first half, Imaging Components revenues declined 2% for the full year. 
Our Particle Therapy business posted fourth quarter revenues of $68 million, bringing total revenues for the year to $163 million, a 13% increase from the prior year. 
The total company gross margin for the quarter was 42.7%, up by nearly 4 points, with significant contributions from both Oncology and Imaging Components. 
Oncology Systems fourth quarter gross margin improved by about 5 points to 45.3%, with the help of favorable product and geographic mix shifts as well as product cost reductions. For the year, Oncology Systems gross margin improved by almost 2 points to 44.5%. 
Imaging Components fourth quarter gross margin rose by about 3 points to 42.1% due largely to favorable product mix, high volumes in tube and security products and lower warranty cost. For the year, Imaging Components gross margin improved by about 1 point to 41.9%. 
R&D expenses were $66 million or 7% of revenue, down 1 point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. For the year, R&D expenses were $254 million or equal with the prior year as a percentage of revenue at 8%.
On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $152 million or 17% of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $134 million or 15% of revenue. 
The $19 million in non-GAAP adjustments, primarily related to the planned separation of the Imaging Components business, ongoing patent litigation and amortization of intangibles. 
Operating earnings for the quarter were 18.6% of revenues on a GAAP basis and 20.7% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting our solid gross margin performance in the quarter. 
For the year, our operating earnings were 17.1% of revenues on a GAAP basis and up 50 basis points from the prior year to 19.1% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $24 million for the fourth quarter and $80 million for the year. The fourth quarter effective tax rate is 31.1%, up from the year-ago quarter due to an unfavorable geographic mix of profits. For the year, the effective tax rate was 27.6%. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 94.5 million, down almost 5 million shares from the year-ago period due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Fourth quarter diluted EPS was $1.24 for the quarter on a GAAP basis and $1.38 on a non-GAAP basis. For the year, diluted EPS was $4.19 on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted EPS rose 9% to $4.68. 
 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $844 million, debt of $667 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. 
DSO at 93 days was up from the year-ago quarter, but improved sequentially from the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $152 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations for the year to $356 million. Primary uses of cash were $87 million for the repurchase of about 1 million shares of stock, $43 million to reduce debt and $20 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the quarter, we had 3.8 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization. 
Before I turn it over to Dow, as you may have seen in the release issued before this call, I intend to retire from Varian in fiscal year 2017. I will remain in my current role as CFO until a replacement is found and a smooth transition has been completed. I will also continue leading the separation of our Imaging Components business. We have a tremendous finance team that will perform to this transition to a new CFO without missing a beat. It has been an honor to serve all of Varian's investors and analysts over the past 17.5 years, and it's been a privilege to be part of a tremendous growth story that has seen Varian become a global power in the fight against cancer.

I've been fortunate to have Elisha on our management team. I'm confident that we'll make a smooth transition. 
Turning now to guidance. We believe that for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, non-GAAP earnings for the total company, including the Imaging Components business and ramp-up costs for its separation, will be in the range of $1.03 to $1.07 per diluted share, and revenues will increase by about 1% to 2%. 
As we announced earlier, we will not give earnings guidance for the full fiscal year until after we have completed the separation of the Imaging Components business. 
For the full fiscal year 2017, we expect that Varian revenues, excluding the Imaging Components business, will rise by 3% to 4%. We expect that Imaging Components revenues for the full fiscal year 2017 will also rise by 3% to 4%. 
We're now ready for your questions."

And as we've been talking all through this fiscal year, early in the year, we moved our collections staff. We had a sales force IT implementation. And I think that slowed down collections in the first half, and we are continuing to feel that effect. Although we're making good progress, collections in Q3 and Q4 were very strong, but as we move into FY '17, absolutely, AR collections is going to be a big focus for the entire team. Little bit of it has to do with more extended terms. In a 0 interest-rate environment, we can continue to win high-margin business by offering terms. And then some of it also, both inventory and AR, up in the proton business as we continue to grow that business. And with percentage of completion accounting, it gets a little funky in proton because a lot of times we're taking revenue and creating an AR under the percentage of completion long before the builds are actually due by the customer. But it will be a big focus as we move into this year."

But I need to stress, that also includes $0.01 to $0.02 of costs that we're building in the Imaging Components business today to prepare them for the spin. So for an example, they've hired a CIO.

The $20 million of dis-synergies, I have to say we are well under way of looking for cost-reduction opportunities, and we are absolutely committed to having $10 million of that out at a run rate by the end of fiscal year '17 and the additional $10 million out by FY '18. So lots of work already going on, on that. I will tell you that most of those dis-synergies for Varian are offset because we will have a lower tax rate because Varex has a 35%, 36% tax rate. And so unfortunately, for my colleague, Clarence, here, his tax rate is going up versus the Varian average. But Varian's tax rate will come down a point or 2, and that largely offsets the dis-synergies in year 1 and 2."

Again, Oncology's gross margin will be between 44%, 45%. Imaging Components in the low 40s, so it looks closer to an 18% operating margin. And again, Vijay, that does include -- I want to make sure everyone understands. It includes some duplicative costs in Varex as we're hiring people to gear up for this spin. We cannot take those costs out to be non-GAAP, and it's between $0.01 and $0.02 in Q1 for those duplicative costs."

And it's really in relation to Dr. Khuntia's sort of presentation at ASTRO, the opportunity for SRS/SBRT going forward over the next 10 to 15 years. I'm just trying to get a sense of what percentage of the base can migrate to having stereotactic capabilities in the next few years? And then I have a follow-up on software and margins."

I'd say from a very high level, we've got about 1,500 TrueBeams in the installed base of, call it, 7,500 machines. Now when you look at some of the capabilities, the interesting thing when you talk about HyperArc, HyperArc's available on every one of those TrueBeams. So this is the kind of our first real -- we've had some other smaller upgrades that we've offered on TrueBeam, like some imaging improvements and just some other things over the last few years. But the HyperArc for some of the stereotactic radiosurgery applications that Dr. Khuntia talked about at ASTRO will be available on the EDGE and TrueBeam only. So we're very excited about that. I think that will probably drive some of the other installed base to trade out to TrueBeam as well. So we're very encouraged about that. We're, I'd say, when you look at the past quarter, Americas was almost virtually 100% TrueBeam/VitalBeam. There might have been 1 or 2 that weren't, but pretty much everything in the Americas -- well, North America for sure, was TrueBeam/VitalBeam. In rest of the -- and I'd say of those, in terms of the capabilities that they had in the fourth quarter, maybe half-ish had SRS/SBRT capability. When you look at the installed base, a big opportunity there. Most of them do not have that capability. And so I think this bodes well for us next year in 2 ways. One, it's an upgrade opportunity; and two, it's going to help us on pricing on TrueBeam. It's going to  -- we're going to be able to maintain or grow price on TrueBeam, and I think that's a little bit of the -- we're doing very well on the cost side, where is this margin rate improvement coming from? We're doing very well on the cost side. The operational team has done a fabulous job getting cost down on TrueBeam. But then as well, we're seeing a really nice mix of these advanced capabilities that are giving us some price support on the pricing side."

Having said that, clinicians are going to want to make sure there's a really responsible clinical comparison done. So our customers are sensitive about that. I think one of the exciting things to us is in some applications, hypofractionation -- the hypofractionation trend is going to bring more patients back to us. So for example, in prostate cancer, over the last half dozen years, we've lost a little bit of share in [ph] robotic surgery. But I think now as those start to go hypofractionation, we get those -- a lot of those patients back. The results are as good or better than surgery, and that's well documented. And then as well, I think the other big opportunity from a clinical growth perspective here is metastatic disease. This capability really enables a very precise dose deposition. And we think that there are, in the U.S. alone, 300,000 patients that we could have opportunity to go after with this capability and bring some new folks into the radiation therapy paradigm.

Software, we had very good year in treatment planning. We talked about that in the script with all the RapidPlan orders. I think this next year, with the improvement that we have in our InSightive Analytics and with our 360 Oncology product, it can be very exciting. We're curious a little bit to see how that goes because the 360 Oncology is going to be cloud-based, so the financial impact is going to be a little more back-end loaded as we accumulate sites, do to billing and click the orders on that basis. I think it's going to be a little -- it is a little bit of a transition as we go kind of from an annual license model to a software-as-a-service model.

Orders in the Oncology and pro",1519,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Our company finished fiscal year 2016 on a positive note, with healthy fourth quarter growth in revenues and significant margin improvement in both our Oncology and Imaging Components businesses. Orders in the Oncology and proton businesses, on the other hand, were down during the quarter versus tough year-ago comparisons in which we had record-setting Oncology growth in Western Europe and in our proton business. 
To summarize, our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2016 we are reporting GAAP net earnings of $1.24 per diluted share, up from $0.99 in the year-ago quarter; non-GAAP net earnings of $1.38 per diluted share, up more than 30% from $1.04 in year-ago quarter; a decline in Oncology orders due to weakness in Western Europe; revenues of $912 million, up 12% in dollars and up 11% in constant currency; and gains of about 4 percentage points in our gross margin, with significant improvements in both our major businesses. 
Focusing on Oncology operations. Orders totaled $897 million for the fourth quarter, down 2% in dollars and down 4% in constant currency versus a strong year-ago quarter. Orders for the year totaled $2.7 billion, up 1% from the prior year and up 2% in constant currency. 
Fourth quarter orders in the Americas grew by 4% in dollars, an increase by 3% in constant currency for the year. Orders in the Americas were up 4% in both dollars and constant currency. 
In North America, orders fell by 2% in the fourth quarter but grew by 5% for the year, ahead of our expectations for this market. 
Fourth quarter Oncology orders in APAC rose by 8% in dollars and fell by 1% in constant currency. For the full year, APAC orders rose by 5% in dollars and by 3% in constant currency. 
In EMEA, Oncology orders declined by 17% in dollars and in constant currency, principally because of weakness in Western Europe, where we had exceptionally strong growth in the year-ago quarter when we set a record by booking orders for more than 100 accelerators. 
For the year, orders in EMEA were down 6% in dollars and down 4% in constant currency, driven by weakness in Western Europe. 
Comparing revenues on a trailing 12-month basis, we believe we gained market share versus our primary competition. Our average selling price rose with the help of a higher mix of TrueBeam and VitalBeam orders. We generated solid order growth during the quarter in emerging markets, including Brazil, Africa and in the Middle East. 
In Brazil, we booked nearly $30 million of new business, including a big win at Grupo Oncoclínicas, where we will be installing 13 TrueBeam and VitalBeam accelerators as well as software to support clinical operations. These will be the first VitalBeam accelerators installed in Latin America. 
Colombia was also a strong contributor to robust order growth in the quarter. Total orders in Latin America exceeded $60 million during the quarter, up more than 70% from the prior year period. 
Other emerging markets contributing to Oncology orders during the quarter included Africa, with about $20 million; and the Middle East, where we booked more than $40 million. As an example of progress, we received a $14 million order for 8 accelerators at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. 
In APAC emerging markets, we generated healthy order growth in Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines. Developed markets, particularly Japan, also contributed to the order growth in this region. Meanwhile, orders in Greater China were down from the year-ago period in part because of continuing tender protest. While we are anniversarying the effects of these multiple orders, and while we are retaining the bulk of the business that we've won, we estimate that orders in China in the fiscal year could have been more than $15 million higher without this protest activity. 
Turning to North America. We established a significant new 3-year strategic agreement with McKesson Specialty Health to supply its U.S. oncology and vantage cancer treatment networks with equipment, software and services. In the first phase, we will be equipping centers with 7 TrueBeam and 5 VitalBeam accelerators. We also will be working to establish interoperability with Varian's information management and McKesson's iKnowMed G2 clinical oncology software. We see an opportunity here to support these networks with more of our Eclipse, ARIA, Velocity and new 360 Oncology software. 
Overall, we had a very good year in North America, where we had in excess of $130 million in takeouts of more than 40 accelerators and nearly 100 software installations from competitors. 
As you know, we've just returned from ASTRO in Boston. It was a great show for us, with some 900 attendees at our users meeting, numerous customers from emerging markets and very positive response to several major new products that we'll be bringing to market this year. 
We introduced 360 Oncology, a first-of-its-kind software tool that enables clinicians on tumor boards to more effectively coordinate patient care among the numerous specialists involved in cancer treatment. This software also provides patients with a clearer picture of how the many elements involving -- involved in treating their cancer fit together. Customer response is enthusiastic, and we believe we have a winning product on our hands. 
We also showed our progress in the development of our HyperArc technology for automating and simplifying the delivery of stereotactic radiosurgery, with more compact dose distribution and better protection of surrounding healthy tissue. We're aiming to introduce this important upgrade to our TrueBeam and EDGE platforms this year, beginning with a module for treating head and neck cancers. 
Oncology administrators are also very interested in our initiative, in which we will be enhancing the security embedded within Varian software systems. We believe we have a leading position in the development of this important new capability, and we expect it could generate an additional $80 million in revenues by the end of fiscal year 2018. 
We have continued to see a very positive market response to our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software products that help to improve the speed, quality and cost efficiency of treatments. We've taken more than 650 orders for RapidPlan since its launch and more than 135 orders for our InSightive software. 
Touching on the service business, global revenues rose by 7% during the quarter, with gains in all geographies. 
Turning now to our Particle Therapy business, we generated $38 million in orders during the fourth quarter, bringing total orders for the year to $104 million. Orders were down significantly from fiscal 2015 when we had a total of 6 system orders, including an $87 million order for our ProBeam system at the University of Maryland. 
Revenues from 14 ongoing projects grew nicely, reaching $68 million in the fourth quarter and bringing total revenues for the year to $163 million, including about $10 million in annual service revenues. 
During the fourth quarter, we booked our first single-room ProBeam Compact order, marking an important milestone for the business. This new system will be installed at the Advanced Medicine Training Centre in Singapore, where Varian will also provide its Eclipse treatment planning system. We also have a 10-year agreement to service this system. 
Also during the quarter, the U.K.'s University College London Hospital placed an order for a fourth treatment gantry at the proton therapy center that is currently under construction. 
Earlier this month, treatments commenced using our ProBeam system at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, making it the fifth Varian-equipped proton center to treat clinically. At this point, the proton sales funnel looks healthy, and I'm pleased by the progress we are making. 
  
Let me turn now to Imaging Components. Recovery in this business continued in the fourth quarter. Orders grew by 2% to $168 million in the fourth quarter, resulting in 7% orders growth for the last 6 months. Orders for the year totaled $571 million, down 6% from the prior year because of first half headwinds, including significant purchasing slowdowns at 2 major customers. Revenues were up 7% for the fourth quarter and down 2% for the year. 
Our MeVis and Claymount acquisitions as well as successful efforts to develop business with new customers contributed to Imaging Components' order and revenue growth during the quarter. Great cost control as well as a favorable product mix in tubes and flat panel imaging detectors and higher volumes in our security and inspection line enabled the Imaging business to achieve the significant gain in its gross margin for the quarter. 
Looking at operational highlights for the whole year. The Imaging Components business introduced 20 new products, completed 140,000 square foot expansion of its manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, opened a new facility in China to service growing customer base there, successfully integrated and mobilized its MeVis and Claymount acquisitions, added 12 new customers to offset slower purchasing from established customers and exceeded its profit targets. We're proud of this performance, and we expect Imaging Components to be a great company that delivers solid returns when it separates from Varian and has established as Varex Imaging, an independent publicly traded company. Work on the separation continues to go smoothly. 
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

Dow has already covered gross orders, so let me start with backlog. We ended the quarter at $3.5 billion, down 1% from the year-ago period, with a gain in Oncology offset by declines in our Particle Therapy and Imaging Components backlogs. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $47 million, bringing net orders for the company to $1.1 million. 
Fourth quarter revenues for the total company were $912 million, up 12% in dollars and up 11% in constant currency. For the year, total company revenues were $3.2 billion, up 4% in dollars and up 5% in constant currency. 
Oncology posted a fourth quarter revenue gain, up 7% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. For the year, Oncology revenues increased 5% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. 
Imaging Components posted a fourth quarter revenue gain of 7%, driven by our recently acquired X-ray accessories businesses as well as security and inspection products. Including the challenges in the first half, Imaging Components revenues declined 2% for the full year. 
Our Particle Therapy business posted fourth quarter revenues of $68 million, bringing total revenues for the year to $163 million, a 13% increase from the prior year. 
The total company gross margin for the quarter was 42.7%, up by nearly 4 points, with significant contributions from both Oncology and Imaging Components. 
Oncology Systems fourth quarter gross margin improved by about 5 points to 45.3%, with the help of favorable product and geographic mix shifts as well as product cost reductions. For the year, Oncology Systems gross margin improved by almost 2 points to 44.5%. 
Imaging Components fourth quarter gross margin rose by about 3 points to 42.1% due largely to favorable product mix, high volumes in tube and security products and lower warranty cost. For the year, Imaging Components gross margin improved by about 1 point to 41.9%. 
R&D expenses were $66 million or 7% of revenue, down 1 point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. For the year, R&D expenses were $254 million or equal with the prior year as a percentage of revenue at 8%.
On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $152 million or 17% of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $134 million or 15% of revenue. 
The $19 million in non-GAAP adjustments, primarily related to the planned separation of the Imaging Components business, ongoing patent litigation and amortization of intangibles. 
Operating earnings for the quarter were 18.6% of revenues on a GAAP basis and 20.7% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting our solid gross margin performance in the quarter. 
For the year, our operating earnings were 17.1% of revenues on a GAAP basis and up 50 basis points from the prior year to 19.1% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $24 million for the fourth quarter and $80 million for the year. The fourth quarter effective tax rate is 31.1%, up from the year-ago quarter due to an unfavorable geographic mix of profits. For the year, the effective tax rate was 27.6%. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 94.5 million, down almost 5 million shares from the year-ago period due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Fourth quarter diluted EPS was $1.24 for the quarter on a GAAP basis and $1.38 on a non-GAAP basis. For the year, diluted EPS was $4.19 on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted EPS rose 9% to $4.68. 
 
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $844 million, debt of $667 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. 
DSO at 93 days was up from the year-ago quarter, but improved sequentially from the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $152 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations for the year to $356 million. Primary uses of cash were $87 million for the repurchase of about 1 million shares of stock, $43 million to reduce debt and $20 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the quarter, we had 3.8 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization. 
Before I turn it over to Dow, as you may have seen in the release issued before this call, I intend to retire from Varian in fiscal year 2017. I will remain in my current role as CFO until a replacement is found and a smooth transition has been completed. I will also continue leading the separation of our Imaging Components business. We have a tremendous finance team that will perform to this transition to a new CFO without missing a beat. It has been an honor to serve all of Varian's investors and analysts over the past 17.5 years, and it's been a privilege to be part of a tremendous growth story that has seen Varian become a global power in the fight against cancer. 
Thank you for being part of the story with me. And now here's Dow."

I've been fortunate to have Elisha on our management team. I'm confident that we'll make a smooth transition. 
Turning now to guidance. We believe that for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, non-GAAP earnings for the total company, including the Imaging Components business and ramp-up costs for its separation, will be in the range of $1.03 to $1.07 per diluted share, and revenues will increase by about 1% to 2%. 
As we announced earlier, we will not give earnings guidance for the full fiscal year until after we have completed the separation of the Imaging Components business. 
For the full fiscal year 2017, we expect that Varian revenues, excluding the Imaging Components business, will rise by 3% to 4%. We expect that Imaging Components revenues for the full fiscal year 2017 will also rise by 3% to 4%.

And it looks like receivables were up, I think about $120 million year-on-year, and even $50 million up sequentially. So just trying to figure out if it's a receivables issue, what's going on there?

And I think that slowed down collections in the first half, and we are continuing to feel that effect. Although we're making good progress, collections in Q3 and Q4 were very strong, but as we move into FY '17, absolutely, AR collections is going to be a big focus for the entire team. Little bit of it has to do with more extended terms. In a 0 interest-rate environment, we can continue to win high-margin business by offering terms. And then some of it also, both inventory and AR, up in the proton business as we continue to grow that business. And with percentage of completion accounting, it gets a little funky in proton because a lot of times we're taking revenue and creating an AR under the percentage of completion long before the bills are actually due by the customer. But it will be a big focus as we move into this year."

But we think that, that market remains robust and should kind of bounce back to double-digit levels. And then the question for us all this year has been kind of Western Europe and where's it going to land. We've talked about that on this call, about it being soft all this year.

And that's versus a very easy year-ago comp as their recovery continues. On EPS, we're -- if you look at our range, it would be 4% to 8% EPS growth versus the year-ago quarter. But I need to stress, that also includes $0.01 to $0.02 of costs that we're building in the Imaging Components business today to prepare them for the spin. So for an example, they've hired a CIO. They've hired a manager of tax. As they're building out their corporate function, those costs are duplicated in this quarter.

So lots of work already going on, on that. I will tell you that most of those dissynergies for Varian are offset because we will have a lower tax rate because Varex has a 35%, 36% tax rate.

Now when you look at some of the capabilities, the interesting thing when you talk about HyperArc, HyperArc's available on every one of those TrueBeams. So this is the kind of our first real -- we've had some other smaller upgrades that we've offered on TrueBeam, like some imaging improvements and just some other things over the last few years. But the HyperArc for some of the stereotactic radiosurgery applications that Dr. Khuntia talked about at ASTRO will be available on the EDGE and TrueBeam only. So we're very excited about that. I think that will probably drive some of the other installed base to trade out to TrueBeam as well. So we're very encouraged about that. We're, I'd say, when you look at the past quarter, Americas was almost virtually 100% TrueBeam/VitalBeam. There might have been 1 or 2 that weren't, but pretty much everything in the Americas -- well, North America for sure, was TrueBeam/VitalBeam. In rest of the -- and I'd say of those, in terms of the capabilities that they had in the fourth quarter, maybe half-ish had SRS/SPRT capability. When you look at the installed base, a big opportunity there. Most of them do not have that capability. And so I think this bodes well for us next year in 2 ways. One, it's an upgrade opportunity; and two, it's going to help us on pricing on TrueBeam. It's going to  -- we're going to be able to maintain or grow price on TrueBeam, and I think that's a little bit of the -- we're doing very well on the cost side, where is this margin rate improvement coming from? We're doing very well on the cost side. The operational team has done a fabulous job getting cost down on TrueBeam.

Having said that, clinicians are going to want to make sure there's a really responsible clinical comparison done. So our customers are sensitive about that.

So for example, in prostate cancer, over the last half dozen years, we've lost a little bit of share in [ph] robotic surgery. But I think now as those start to go hypofractionation, we get those -- a lot of those patients back. The results are as good or better than surgery, and that's well documented. And then as well, I think the other big opportunity from a clinical growth perspective here is metastatic disease. This capability really enables a very precise dose deposition. And we think that there are, in the U.S. alone, 300,000 patients that we could have opportunity to go after with this capability and bring some new folks into the radiation therapy paradigm.

As it came up earlier on the call, our cash flow from operations was down year-over-year. We ended both Q3 and Q4 on a strong note, but we were kind of in a hole in the first half of the fiscal year on collections of AR for a couple of reasons -- moved this collection staff, we had an IT implementation, et cetera. So we're very focused on cash flow, particularly AR, as we move into FY '17. And on a consolidated basis, our expectation would be that we could get back to around the $400 million level in cash flow from operations. CapEx has always been relatively stable. And then, in terms of share repurchase versus M&A, I think we would always love to prioritize M&A if the right targets come along. And that's the beauty of our share repurchase program. We can turn it on and off and at various levels, depending on what activity and M&A that's there."

Orders in the Oncology and pro",1519,"Good afternoon, and welcome. Our company finished fiscal year 2016 on a positive note, with healthy fourth quarter growth in revenues and significant margin improvement in both our Oncology and Imaging Components businesses. Orders in the Oncology and proton businesses, on the other hand, were down during the quarter versus tough year-ago comparisons in which we had record-setting Oncology growth in Western Europe and in our proton business. 
To summarize, our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2016 we are reporting GAAP net earnings of $1.24 per diluted share, up from $0.99 in the year-ago quarter; non-GAAP net earnings of $1.38 per diluted share, up more than 30% from $1.04 in year-ago quarter; a decline in Oncology orders due to weakness in Western Europe; revenues of $912 million, up 12% in dollars and up 11% in constant currency; and gains of about 4 percentage points in our gross margin, with significant improvements in both our major businesses. 
Focusing on Oncology operations. Orders totaled $897 million for the fourth quarter, down 2% in dollars and down 4% in constant currency versus a strong year-ago quarter. Orders for the year totaled $2.7 billion, up 1% from the prior year and up 2% in constant currency. 
Fourth quarter orders in the Americas grew by 4% in dollars, an increase by 3% in constant currency for the year. Orders in the Americas were up 4% in both dollars and constant currency. 
In North America, orders fell by 2% in the fourth quarter but grew by 5% for the year, ahead of our expectations for this market. 
Fourth quarter Oncology orders in APAC rose by 8% in dollars and fell by 1% in constant currency. For the full year, APAC orders rose by 5% in dollars and by 3% in constant currency. 
In EMEA, Oncology orders declined by 17% in dollars and in constant currency, principally because of weakness in Western Europe, where we had exceptionally strong growth in the year-ago quarter when we set a record by booking orders for more than 100 accelerators. 
For the year, orders in EMEA were down 6% in dollars and down 4% in constant currency, driven by weakness in Western Europe. 
Comparing revenues on a trailing 12-month basis, we believe we gained market share versus our primary competition. Our average selling price rose with the help of a higher mix of TrueBeam and VitalBeam orders. We generated solid order growth during the quarter in emerging markets, including Brazil, Africa and in the Middle East. 
In Brazil, we booked nearly $30 million of new business, including a big win at Grupo Oncoclínicas, where we will be installing 13 TrueBeam and VitalBeam accelerators as well as software to support clinical operations. These will be the first VitalBeam accelerators installed in Latin America. 
Colombia was also a strong contributor to robust order growth in the quarter. Total orders in Latin America exceeded $60 million during the quarter, up more than 70% from the prior year period. 
Other emerging markets contributing to Oncology orders during the quarter included Africa, with about $20 million; and the Middle East, where we booked more than $40 million. As an example of progress, we received a $14 million order for 8 accelerators at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. 
In APAC emerging markets, we generated healthy order growth in Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines. Developed markets, particularly Japan, also contributed to the order growth in this region. Meanwhile, orders in Greater China were down from the year-ago period in part because of continuing tender protest. While we are anniversarying the effects of these multiple orders, and while we are retaining the bulk of the business that we've won, we estimate that orders in China in the fiscal year could have been more than $15 million higher without this protest activity. 
Turning to North America. We established a significant new 3-year strategic agreement with McKesson Specialty Health to supply its U.S. oncology and vantage cancer treatment networks with equipment, software and services. In the first phase, we will be equipping centers with 7 TrueBeam and 5 VitalBeam accelerators. We also will be working to establish interoperability with Varian's information management and McKesson's iKnowMed G2 clinical oncology software. We see an opportunity here to support these networks with more of our Eclipse, ARIA, Velocity and new 360 Oncology software. 
Overall, we had a very good year in North America, where we had in excess of $130 million in takeouts of more than 40 accelerators and nearly 100 software installations from competitors. 
As you know, we've just returned from ASTRO in Boston. It was a great show for us, with some 900 attendees at our users meeting, numerous customers from emerging markets and very positive response to several major new products that we'll be bringing to market this year. 
We introduced 360 Oncology, a first-of-its-kind software tool that enables clinicians on tumor boards to more effectively coordinate patient care among the numerous specialists involved in cancer treatment. This software also provides patients with a clearer picture of how the many elements involving -- involved in treating their cancer fit together. Customer response is enthusiastic, and we believe we have a winning product on our hands. 
We also showed our progress in the development of our HyperArc technology for automating and simplifying the delivery of stereotactic radiosurgery, with more compact dose distribution and better protection of surrounding healthy tissue. We're aiming to introduce this important upgrade to our TrueBeam and EDGE platforms this year, beginning with a module for treating head and neck cancers. 
Oncology administrators are also very interested in our initiative, in which we will be enhancing the security embedded within Varian software systems. We believe we have a leading position in the development of this important new capability, and we expect it could generate an additional $80 million in revenues by the end of fiscal year 2018. 
We have continued to see a very positive market response to our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software products that help to improve the speed, quality and cost efficiency of treatments. We've taken more than 650 orders for RapidPlan since its launch and more than 135 orders for our InSightive software. 
Touching on the service business, global revenues rose by 7% during the quarter, with gains in all geographies. 
Turning now to our Particle Therapy business, we generated $38 million in orders during the fourth quarter, bringing total orders for the year to $104 million. Orders were down significantly from fiscal 2015 when we had a total of 6 system orders, including an $87 million order for our ProBeam system at the University of Maryland. 
Revenues from 14 ongoing projects grew nicely, reaching $68 million in the fourth quarter and bringing total revenues for the year to $163 million, including about $10 million in annual service revenues. 
During the fourth quarter, we booked our first single-room ProBeam Compact order, marking an important milestone for the business. This new system will be installed at the Advanced Medicine Training Centre in Singapore, where Varian will also provide its Eclipse treatment planning system. We also have a 10-year agreement to service this system. 
Also during the quarter, the U.K.'s University College London Hospital placed an order for a fourth treatment gantry at the proton therapy center that is currently under construction. 
Earlier this month, treatments commenced using our ProBeam system at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, making it the fifth Varian-equipped proton center to treat clinically. At this point, the proton sales funnel looks healthy, and I'm pleased by the progress we are making. 
  
Let me turn now to Imaging Components. Recovery in this business continued in the fourth quarter. Orders grew by 2% to $168 million in the fourth quarter, resulting in 7% orders growth for the last 6 months. Orders for the year totaled $571 million, down 6% from the prior year because of first half headwinds, including significant purchasing slowdowns at 2 major customers. Revenues were up 7% for the fourth quarter and down 2% for the year. 
Our MeVis and Claymount acquisitions as well as successful efforts to develop business with new customers contributed to Imaging Components' order and revenue growth during the quarter. Great cost control as well as a favorable product mix in tubes and flat panel imaging detectors and higher volumes in our security and inspection line enabled the Imaging business to achieve the significant gain in its gross margin for the quarter. 
Looking at operational highlights for the whole year. The Imaging Components business introduced 20 new products, completed 140,000 square foot expansion of its manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, opened a new facility in China to service growing customer base there, successfully integrated and mobilized its MeVis and Claymount acquisitions, added 12 new customers to offset slower purchasing from established customers and exceeded its profit targets. We're proud of this performance, and we expect Imaging Components to be a great company that delivers solid returns when it separates from Varian and has established as Varex Imaging, an independent publicly traded company. Work on the separation continues to go smoothly. 
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $47 million, bringing net orders for the company to $1.1 million. 
Fourth quarter revenues for the total company were $912 million, up 12% in dollars and up 11% in constant currency. For the year, total company revenues were $3.2 billion, up 4% in dollars and up 5% in constant currency. 
Oncology posted a fourth quarter revenue gain, up 7% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. For the year, Oncology revenues increased 5% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. 
Imaging Components posted a fourth quarter revenue gain of 7%, driven by our recently acquired X-ray accessories businesses as well as security and inspection products. Including the challenges in the first half, Imaging Components revenues declined 2% for the full year. 
Our Particle Therapy business posted fourth quarter revenues of $68 million, bringing total revenues for the year to $163 million, a 13% increase from the prior year. 
The total company gross margin for the quarter was 42.7%, up by nearly 4 points, with significant contributions from both Oncology and Imaging Components. 
Oncology Systems fourth quarter gross margin improved by about 5 points to 45.3%, with the help of favorable product and geographic mix shifts as well as product cost reductions. For the year, Oncology Systems gross margin improved by almost 2 points to 44.5%. 
Imaging Components fourth quarter gross margin rose by about 3 points to 42.1% due largely to favorable product mix, high volumes in tube and security products and lower warranty cost. For the year, Imaging Components gross margin improved by about 1 point to 41.9%. 
R&D expenses were $66 million or 7% of revenue, down 1 point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. For the year, R&D expenses were $254 million or equal with the prior year as a percentage of revenue at 8%.
On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $152 million or 17% of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $134 million or 15% of revenue. 
The $19 million in non-GAAP adjustments, primarily related to the planned separation of the Imaging Components business, ongoing patent litigation and amortization of intangibles. 
Operating earnings for the quarter were 18.6% of revenues on a GAAP basis and 20.7% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting our solid gross margin performance in the quarter. 
For the year, our operating earnings were 17.1% of revenues on a GAAP basis and up 50 basis points from the prior year to 19.1% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $24 million for the fourth quarter and $80 million for the year. The fourth quarter effective tax rate is 31.1%, up from the year-ago quarter due to an unfavorable geographic mix of profits. For the year, the effective tax rate was 27.6%. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 94.5 million, down almost 5 million shares from the year-ago period due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Fourth quarter diluted EPS was $1.24 for the quarter on a GAAP basis and $1.38 on a non-GAAP basis. For the year, diluted EPS was $4.19 on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted EPS rose 9% to $4.68. 
 
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $844 million, debt of $667 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. 
DSO at 93 days was up from the year-ago quarter, but improved sequentially from the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $152 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations for the year to $356 million. Primary uses of cash were $87 million for the repurchase of about 1 million shares of stock, $43 million to reduce debt and $20 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the quarter, we had 3.8 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization. 
Before I turn it over to Dow, as you may have seen in the release issued before this call, I intend to retire from Varian in fiscal year 2017. I will remain in my current role as CFO until a replacement is found and a smooth transition has been completed. I will also continue leading the separation of our Imaging Components business. We have a tremendous finance team that will perform to this transition to a new CFO without missing a beat. It has been an honor to serve all of Varian's investors and analysts over the past 17.5 years, and it's been a privilege to be part of a tremendous growth story that has seen Varian become a global power in the fight against cancer. 
Thank you for being part of the story with me. And now here's Dow."

Turning now to guidance. We believe that for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, non-GAAP earnings for the total company, including the Imaging Components business and ramp-up costs for its separation, will be in the range of $1.03 to $1.07 per diluted share, and revenues will increase by about 1% to 2%. 
As we announced earlier, we will not give earnings guidance for the full fiscal year until after we have completed the separation of the Imaging Components business. 
For the full fiscal year 2017, we expect that Varian revenues, excluding the Imaging Components business, will rise by 3% to 4%. We expect that Imaging Components revenues for the full fiscal year 2017 will also rise by 3% to 4%.

So Jeff, the Oncology AR increased about 8%, and that compares to their year-to-date sales up 5%. And as we've been talking all through this fiscal year, early in the year, we moved our collections staff. We had a Salesforce IT implementation. And I think that slowed down collections in the first half, and we are continuing to feel that effect. Although we're making good progress, collections in Q3 and Q4 were very strong, but as we move into FY '17, absolutely, AR collections is going to be a big focus for the entire team. Little bit of it has to do with more extended terms. In a 0 interest-rate environment, we can continue to win high-margin business by offering terms. And then some of it also, both inventory and AR, up in the proton business as we continue to grow that business. And with percentage of completion accounting, it gets a little funky in proton because a lot of times we're taking revenue and creating an AR under the percentage of completion long before the bills are actually due by the customer. But it will be a big focus as we move into this year."

And that's versus a very easy year-ago comp as their recovery continues. On EPS, we're -- if you look at our range, it would be 4% to 8% EPS growth versus the year-ago quarter. But I need to stress, that also includes $0.01 to $0.02 of costs that we're building in the Imaging Components business today to prepare them for the spin. So for an example, they've hired a CIO.

I mean, Q4 is always our largest quarter with the highest operating margin typically. So it's not uncommon for the operating margin to step down from Q4 to Q1. When you run your model through, I mean, what I am showing at the midpoint is that we will increase our operating margin by about a point to 18% on a non-GAAP basis. Again, Oncology's gross margin will be between 44%, 45%. Imaging Components in the low 40s, so it looks closer to an 18% operating margin. And again, Vijay, that does include -- I want to make sure everyone understands. It includes some duplicative costs in Varex as we're hiring people to gear up for this spin. We cannot take those costs out to be non-GAAP, and it's between $0.01 and $0.02 in Q1 for those duplicative costs."

And really what I'm getting at is what percentage of the installed base has stereotactic capabilities? And what percent does not? And it's really in relation to Dr. Khuntia's sort of presentation at ASTRO, the opportunity for SRS/SPRT going forward over the next 10 to 15 years. I'm just trying to get a sense of what percentage of the base can migrate to having stereotactic capabilities in the next few years? And then I have a follow-up on software and margins."

I'd say from a very high level, we've got about 1,500 TrueBeams in the installed base of, call it, 7,500 machines. Now when you look at some of the capabilities, the interesting thing when you talk about HyperArc, HyperArc's available on every one of those TrueBeams. So this is the kind of our first real -- we've had some other smaller upgrades that we've offered on TrueBeam, like some imaging improvements and just some other things over the last few years. But the HyperArc for some of the stereotactic radiosurgery applications that Dr. Khuntia talked about at ASTRO will be available on the EDGE and TrueBeam only. So we're very excited about that. I think that will probably drive some of the other installed base to trade out to TrueBeam as well. So we're very encouraged about that. We're, I'd say, when you look at the past quarter, Americas was almost virtually 100% TrueBeam/VitalBeam. There might have been 1 or 2 that weren't, but pretty much everything in the Americas -- well, North America for sure, was TrueBeam/VitalBeam. In rest of the -- and I'd say of those, in terms of the capabilities that they had in the fourth quarter, maybe half-ish had SRS/SPRT capability. When you look at the installed base, a big opportunity there. Most of them do not have that capability. And so I think this bodes well for us next year in 2 ways. One, it's an upgrade opportunity; and two, it's going to help us on pricing on TrueBeam. It's going to  -- we're going to be able to maintain or grow price on TrueBeam, and I think that's a little bit of the -- we're doing very well on the cost side, where is this margin rate improvement coming from? We're doing very well on the cost side. The operational team has done a fabulous job getting cost down on TrueBeam. But then as well, we're seeing a really nice mix of these advanced capabilities that are giving us some price support on the pricing side."

Having said that, clinicians are going to want to make sure there's a really responsible clinical comparison done. So our customers are sensitive about that. I think one of the exciting things to us is in some applications, hypofractionation -- the hypofractionation trend is going to bring more patients back to us. So for example, in prostate cancer, over the last half dozen years, we've lost a little bit of share in [ph] robotic surgery. But I think now as those start to go hypofractionation, we get those -- a lot of those patients back. The results are as good or better than surgery, and that's well documented. And then as well, I think the other big opportunity from a clinical growth perspective here is metastatic disease. This capability really enables a very precise dose deposition. And we think that there are, in the U.S. alone, 300,000 patients that we could have opportunity to go after with this capability and bring some new folks into the radiation therapy paradigm. So we're excited about the capability that this opens up."

I think this next year, with the improvement that we have in our InSightive Analytics and with our 360 Oncology product, it can be very exciting. We're curious a little bit to see how that goes because the 360 Oncology is going to be cloud-based, so the financial impact is going to be a little more back-end loaded as we accumulate sites, do the billing and click the orders on that basis. I think it's going to be a little -- it is a little bit of a transition as we go kind of from an annual license model to a software-as-a-service model. So having said that, one of the really cool things about the 360 Oncology product is it can play not just in ARIA Varian sites, it can play in every radiation oncology site in the world.
