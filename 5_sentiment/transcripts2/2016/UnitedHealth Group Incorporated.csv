Thank you for joining us today as we close on 2015 and look ahead to 2016. We finished 2015 in line with the guidance provided at our December investor conference with fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share at $1.40, bringing full year 2",423,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us today as we close on 2015 and look ahead to 2016. We finished 2015 in line with the guidance provided at our December investor conference with fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share at $1.40, bringing full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share to $6.45. Overall, UnitedHealthcare had a positive year and finished with strong fourth quarter growth exceeding 300,000 members and growing across all its markets. Optum delivered an exceptionally strong fourth quarter with revenues up 70% and earnings up 46% over the prior year. 
Before we go into the business commentary, let me offer a brief recap of 2015. 2015, UnitedHealth Group's revenue grew more than 20% to $157 billion with organic revenue growth of 10%. Our cash flows were exceptional at $9.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Our dividend increased 33% to an annual rate of $2 per share this year. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve more than 1.7 million more people domestically as Optum grew its revenues by 42% and revenue backlog by more than 20%. Excluding the impact of individual exchange compliant products and reserves related to the initiation of a new Medicaid contract, UnitedHealth Group still grew revenues by 19% in 2015 and grew operating earnings 15% to $11.8 billion, and that would have produced an adjusted earnings per share of $7, a 16% year-over-year increase, again after those 2 items, to give you an idea of the underlying strength of the enterprise.
We know the individual exchanges are top of mind to you, and Dave Wichmann will discuss these fully in his comments. As we said at the investor conference, the balance of our total business, with well more than $175 billion of it, is driving considerably stronger and better positioned than this time last year. We are committed to delivering a strong 2016 performance year in growth in financial results and in the quality of our services, Net Promoter Score or NPS performance metrics. 
2016 is off to a strong start, considerably stronger than 2015. Our initial growth trends are very encouraging and our service performance for new January business is strong. Optum's revenue backlog and pipeline have never been stronger. Medical costs in the fourth quarter trended slightly better than expected, and we are confident our benefit businesses have appropriately priced our products for 2016. Our operating business platforms drive these results, so I'll ask Larry Renfro to review Optum's performance for full year 2015 and Dave Wichmann to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide some UnitedHealth Group enterprise live comments. Larry?"
104673,320178822,919224,"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,"Earnings Calls","UnitedHealth Group Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve. 2015 was without question an exceptional performance year for Optum in revenues and earnings growth and now our preparations to set up 2016 to deliver well for the nearly 115 million people we serve. Optum's businesses have strong momentum",913,"Thanks, Steve. 2015 was without question an exceptional performance year for Optum in revenues and earnings growth and now our preparations to set up 2016 to deliver well for the nearly 115 million people we serve. Optum's businesses have strong momentum and are producing strong sustainable growth across the board. Since beginning the One Optum journey in 2011, we have compounded revenues at 23% per year and operating earnings at 34% per year.
In 2015, Optum's revenues of $67.6 billion grew 42% including organic revenue growth of 13%. OptumRx revenues grew 51% this past year to $48 billion and even excluding the Catamaran combination posted solid double-digit organic growth. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to more than $20 billion, which is growth of 24% over 2014. Our full year operating margin of 6.3% reflects the increased mix of pharmacy care services revenues, driven by OptumRx organic growth in 5 months of Catamaran business. Both OptumHealth's and OptumInsight's strong full year 2015 margins are sustainable and we project operating margin expansion for OptumRx in 2016. 
In 2015, we added to our strategic relationship portfolio, which now numbers 10, and we remain focused on developing more of these comprehensive large scale relationships. They leverage Optum's unique end-to-end capabilities to help solve the broader challenges customers and prospects are facing in a changing health care environment, whether they are physicians or hospitals, health benefit sponsors, governments or consumers. 
To illustrate, consider our Optum360 revenue management with Dignity Health where cash flows have already improved by $0.5 billion and accounts are being settled for 8 days fasters and where our documentation technology is helping Dignity Health physicians with demanding ICD-10 requirements even as they are realizing a 50% gain in productivity. Or consider Optum care, our expanding care delivery business in which we are developing some of the most impactful and durable consumer relationships. Today, we serve 7 million patients to more than 150 payer relationships across our physician practices, our community-based clinical services and our MedExpress neighborhood care centers. MedExpress operates at the convergence of health care and retail, measuring success one patient at a time. MedExpress can provide as much as 90% of the care patients received in the ER and for a little as 10% of the cost. MedExpress mitigates costs for both payers and consumers while providing high quality convenient care.
We currently operate over 160 [ph] neighborhood care centers with a goal of operating several multiples of that number 5 years from now. Today, there are Optum care clinics in more than 270 locations in 26 local markets having recently added prohealth in that Connecticut market to that distinctive high-performance practice portfolio. 
Our pipeline for growth is gaining momentum as well. The Optum care approach expects local market norms and expectations, and our doctors consistently deliver high-quality results for the communities they serve. We consistently outperform benchmarks around the acute care readmissions and skilled nursing facility stays. More than 3/4 of private Medicare patients we care for are in health plans rated 4 stars or better, and more than 96% of our patients would recommend our local care provider office to others. 
For patients with complex medical conditions, our integrated care model has proven distinctive results. We deliver, on average, a 50% reduction in overall health care costs for medically complex patients with very high patient and family satisfaction. Our number of Optum care's high performing practices have been nationally recognized for their performance in [indiscernible] care initiatives including Monarch in Southern California and prohealth in New York metro area. 
And finally, our housecall services continued to deliver clear and distinctive value for Medicare recipients and payers with 98% patient satisfaction and more than 1 million visits to patients in their homes delivered in 2015 and further growth in 2016.
With market momentum we have today and through these constantly advancing capabilities, we expect Optum care will remain a high growth business for many years to come. As we share other examples in future quarters that reflect Optum's growing diversification such as our military and veterans health services or our pharmacy care services or our technology support services, you should see with even more clarity a pattern emerging, the application of data, technology and services to bring better performance, helping health systems work better for everyone. 
Today, revenues from our top 25 customer relationships at Optum have quadrupled over the last 3 years. In 2015, the average customer award size doubled across OptumHealth and OptumInsight, and we expect continued strong customer retention at OptumRx as we work to bring the powerful benefits of the OptumRx merger to these clients. Prominent organizations continued to inquire about how our capabilities can help them, so we are exploring potentially large and interesting new strategic relationships. In many cases, these pairings could further accelerate growth in the OptumInsight backlog, which now exceeds $10.4 billion and grew by more than 20% year-over-year. Within the current portion of that backlog, we already cover more than 80% of OptumInsight's full year projected 2016 revenues. 
We remain optimistic about the prospects for Optum in 2016, 2017 and beyond. For 2016, we are projecting revenues to well exceed $80 billion, which would be growth in the area of 20% and for operating earnings to grow 30% to 34% to more than $5.55 billion. Optum is becoming an increasingly valuable business and now represents about 42% of UnitedHealth Group's consolidated operating earnings outlook. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."

UnitedHealthcare continues to differentiate itself from competitors on a foundation of distinctive service product innovation and integrated clinical and network value and the result is strong sustainable growth. UnitedHealthcare now s",1245,"Thank you, Larry. UnitedHealthcare continues to differentiate itself from competitors on a foundation of distinctive service product innovation and integrated clinical and network value and the result is strong sustainable growth. 
UnitedHealthcare now serves 46.4 million medical members and we have leading market positions in all private health insurance segments of North and South America. Over the past 5 years, we have grown by nearly 13.5 million people or 40%, well diversified across commercial, government programs and international offerings. This reflects a deliberate diversification and consistent competitiveness of our offerings globally. 
UnitedHealthcare continued this trend in 2015 growing to serve 1.75 million more people domestically as we continue to improve its market share. UnitedHealthcare's full year revenues grew nearly 10% to $131.3 billion. The full year operating margin of 5.1% decreased as expected, declining 70 basis points year-over-year due to the effects of public insurance exchange products. Full year commercial medical cost trends of 5.5% came in at the low end of our initial outlook one year ago. Our cost trends reflect the positive, sustainable impact of higher consumer engagement, strong alignment of incentives with care professionals through value-based relationships and improving data collections and application.
We are equally pleased with emerging innovation trends in our business focused on advancing the consumer movement in health care. Today, 25 million consumers are served through our Advocate4Me service model. People served by this innovative approach are more engaged in their health and are more effective in their health care decisionmaking and are more satisfied. Today, over 23 million consumers have joined our Raleigh Digital Health applications and we are seeing steady advances in daily active use of these services including, importantly, engagement around selecting primary care physicians, better use of urgent care over emergency care, screenings and higher adoption of personal health and condition management programs. 
And today, our Real Appeal Digital medical service designed to help manage weight and reduce the onset of diabetes has been deployed to accounts representing 1 million people in just the last half of 2015 and with an additional 0.5 million committed for the first half of 2016. The initial results are encouraging with 46% of participants achieving a meaningful reduction of 5% or more of their body weight within 16 weeks. 5% weight loss reduces the conversion to diabetes by nearly 60% according to studies conducted by the National Institute of Health. Given these exceptional results, we plan to make available digitally a broader set of preventative medical services to engage people to live healthier lives to the fullest. 
Across UnitedHealthcare, we intend to continue to positively impact the quality of social services, condition management, cost and quality transparency, convenient care, wellness and the overall quality of life of the consumers we serve by giving them the tools like these to engage them in their health.
Our work is improving the quality of patient care. In Medicare, we helped close 9 million gaps and care for the seniors we serve. We will serve 1.7 million members in health plans with higher star ratings in 2017 as we expect at least 63% of our members to be in a 4-star plans, and we will further improve that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more. It is not a coincidence we are off to our strongest growth start for Medicare Advantage in company history. We expect to close first quarter with growth of around 300,000 seniors in Medicare Advantage and we are tracking well against our full year outlook of 325,000 to 400,000 people in that growth. 
In commercial benefits, we combine tiered networks, our clinical strategies and innovative product designs in a myriad of ways to align to a wide array of affordable price points for employers and consumers. Today, 1/3 of our commercial customers are served through one of these more affordable plan offerings. That's double the number from 5 years ago, and we expect that percentage to more than double again over the next 5 years, aiding to our exceptional growth.
In Medicaid, over the past 2 years, we have secured new contract awards totaling more than 2 million people. Managed Medicaid continues to emerge as the ultimate long-term sustaining solution for states and we believe UnitedHealthcare offers our state customers the most distinctive and comprehensive set of capabilities. Like in Medicare and commercial, we are well positioned for 2016 growth in Community & State.
Turning to exchanges. We expect to start the year at around 700,000 or fewer public exchange members and expect these numbers will steadily decline over the course of the year. We are not pursuing membership growth and have taken a comprehensive set of actions to contain membership and sharpen performance over the balance of 2016. We have withdrawn premium products, increased prices, eliminated marketing and commissions, intensified clinical engagement and medical management with this membership group and reduced the operating cost as appropriate. 
As a matter of prudence, we have increased our premium deficiency reserve by $65 million above our investor conference estimates, bringing the total fourth quarter charge to $340 million. $245 million of that charge addresses 2016's exchange compliant product exposure. This is in addition to the unreserved losses included in our 2016 outlook combined more than $1.5 billion set aside for 2016. We believe we have fully captured 2016 exposure now based on our actual starting enrollment. And by mid-2016, we will determine to what extent, if any, we will continue to offer products in the exchange market in 2017.
In Medicaid, the start of the new program in Iowa has been deferred while the state has also increased the assigned enrollment for each contracted plan, which increases our estimate of revenues. We are in constructive discussions with the state concerning elements of an effective and sustainable managed Medicaid program to serve that market. 
As we look into 2016 and 2017, we believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at a strong pace and profitably improve its market share. Fundamentally, UnitedHealthcare's emerging across the spectrum of consumer-driven products, service, wellness, transparency and, most important, care and engagement and clinical quality particularly in government programs. We have room to improve but with sharp focus on NPS and the quality of the work we do and a culture centered around helping others, we have an opportunity to offer even greater value to consumers, providers and customers alike in the coming years. 
Before Steve sums up, let me touch on the outlook for UnitedHealthcare as a whole. We are committed to strong performance in 2016 across UnitedHealthcare and Optum in service, in operations, in growth, in earnings generation and in cash flow production. We foresee cash flows approaching $10 billion and adjusted net earnings of $7.60 to $7.80 per share. Again, adjusted net earnings for us is GAAP EPS plus after-tax intangible amortization. We encourage everyone to move to adjusted net earnings to enable better comparability among companies and among the analyst community. We expect about 46% to 47% of full year earnings in the first half of the year with Optum at approximately 40% of its full year plan in the first half, exactly as you saw it last year and in the past. We expect the rate of our earnings growth to strengthen during 2016. Current consensus Street estimates for first quarter adjusted earnings per share might be slightly strong compared to our expectations at the moment. All in, we have a strong view of 2016 and look forward to this year.

So those are the elements that played into the increase in both the '15 impact and the assumed losses for '16 in the individual exchange compliant plan offerings. And then with regard to the Medicaid portion, that's simply just a function of higher enrollment expectation as the number of carriers was reduced from 4 down to 3. But when you put that all together in total, as we close the year, it was about $100 million of impact beyond what our guidance had assumed from December.

Now with that said, I would tell you in terms of the impact, in Medicaid, we expect it to be no impact. In the commercial business, because that's priced on a policy year basis and the tax is levied on a calendar year basis, there's no impact over 3 years but there are some differences by year, and we expect it to be actually a drag on our 2016 earnings. We've estimated that impact to be about $100 million of pretax or about $0.06 earnings per share.

I think that activity, in fact, I think we expect to respond to over 20 RFPs this year that'll be implemented in '16, '17 and on into '18. So again, when I say the pipeline is strong, it's very strong. That's heavily weighted towards more complex populations, so that's really what you're talking about when you speak to LTSS and the movement of those complex populations from fee-for-service into managed Medicaid. We've got one of the largest books of business in that space. We've got a very long history of dealing with these very vulnerable people and delivering real value to those individuals as well as value to the states. So I think we feel, and Dave mentioned it in our opening comments, I think uniquely positioned between UnitedHealthcare and Optum to really serve these populations, help them live healthier lives year-over-year and deliver value back to the states in the process. So I think our outlook form that continued movement, even within states where we're already providing traditional [indiscernible] population managed care, to continue to grow into those complex populations."

First, thank you for the recognition of the hard work this team has done this year, particularly in the last half of the year to get its cost structures aligned and to really position its business for growth in 2016 and beyond. Our cash flows were exceptionally strong. I think you know from past calls and discussions that we've that, we're very, very focused on cash flows and in particular managing balance sheet elements of our business. And the strength of the cash flows, the departure from where our original expectations were really around collecting receivables more quickly and paying claims more in line with what our contractual requirements are as opposed to paying early. So just better working capital management and really contributed to that. As it relates to then what our priorities are for that is around share repurchases, deleveraging and investment, we're going to continue to maintain a very balanced posture with respect to those things. Obviously, it's important that we continue to delever the businesses we had indicated that we would over the course of 18 months following the Catamaran transaction and we continue to be committed to doing so. Part of that is that our expectations that we'll continue to curtail our share repurchases, at least for 2016, unless extreme circumstances arise. But for 2016, it's about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in cash used. And as you can probably suspect by the activity that underway in our business, we continue to be a strong investor in new capabilities organically in our business, but also through [indiscernible]. As it relates to 2016 and the cash flow, certainly jumping off about $9.7 billion cash flow year. With strong impact expectations for 2016, we would achieve higher cash flows and. As a result, we used the language of $9.5 billion to $10 billion in cash flows. We're now talking closer to $10 billion and then we'll take a hard look at that over the course of the first quarter and reassess whether or not we can push that number forward. But clearly, the business is operating well. From a balance sheet management perspective, we'll do all what we can do push the cash flow number forward."

And our dividend as increased and we will certainly address that in the middle of the year, as is our custom. UnitedHealthcare served more than 1.7 million people domestically, growing virtually in every market that we serve, and Optum grew its revenues by 42% and its backlog by more than 20%. 
In 2016, we expect to continue and accelerate this growth trend and carry it into 2017 and beyond. We intend to further differentiate our products, our services by focusing on consistently high quality in everything we do and putting real value for customers and consumers on their terms.

Thank you for joining us today as we close on 2015 and look ahead to 2016. We finished 2015 in line with the guidance provided at our December investor conference with fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share at $1.40, bringing full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share to $6.45. Overall, UnitedHealthcare had a positive year and finished it with strong fourth quarter growth exceeding 300,000 members and growing across all its markets. Optum delivered an exceptionally strong fourth quarter, with revenues up 70% and earnings up 46% over the prior year. 
Before we go into the business commentary, let me offer a brief recap of 2015. 2015, UnitedHealth Group's revenue grew more than 20% to $157 billion with organic revenue growth of 10%. Our cash flows were exceptional at $9.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Our dividend increased 33% to an annual rate of $2 per share this year. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve more than 1.7 million more people domestically as Optum grew its revenues by 42% and revenue backlog by more than 20%. Excluding the impact of individual exchange compliant products and reserves related to the initiation of a new Medicaid contract, UnitedHealth Group still grew revenues by 19% in 2015 and grew operating earnings 15% to $11.8 billion, and that would have produced an adjusted earnings per share of $7, a 16% year-over-year increase, again absent those 2 items, to give you an idea of the underlying strength of the enterprise.
We know the individual exchanges are top of mind to you, and Dave Wichmann will discuss these fully in his comments. As we said at the investor conference, the balance of our total business, with well more than $175 billion of it, is driving considerably stronger and better positioned than this time last year. We are committed to delivering a strong 2016 performance year in growth in financial results and in the quality of our services, Net Promoter Score or NPS performance metrics. 
2016 is off to a strong start, considerably stronger than 2015. Our initial growth trends are very encouraging, and our service performance for new January business is strong. Optum's revenue backlog and pipeline have never been stronger. Medical costs in the fourth quarter trended slightly better than expected, and we are confident our benefit businesses have appropriately priced our products for 2016. Our operating business platforms drive these results, so I'll ask Larry Renfro to review Optum's performance for full year 2015 and Dave Wichmann to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide some UnitedHealth Group enterprise-wide comments.

Optum's businesses have strong momentum and are producing strong sustainable growth across the board. Since beginning the One Optum journey in 2011, we have compounded revenues at 23% per year and operating earnings at 34% per year.
In 2015, Optum's revenues of $67.6 billion grew 42% including organic revenue growth of 13%. OptumRx revenues grew 51% this past year to $48 billion and even excluding the Catamaran combination posted solid double-digit organic growth. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to more than $20 billion, which is growth of 24% over 2014. Our full year operating margin of 6.3% reflects the increased mix of pharmacy care services revenues, driven by OptumRx organic growth in 5 months of Catamaran business. Both OptumHealth's and OptumInsight's strong full year 2015 margins are sustainable, and we project operating margin expansion for OptumRx in 2016. 
In 2015, we added to our strategic relationship portfolio, which now numbers 10, and we remain focused on developing more of these comprehensive large scale relationships. They leverage Optum's unique end-to-end capabilities to help solve the broader challenges customers and prospects are facing in a changing health care environment, whether they are physicians or hospitals, health benefit sponsors, governments or consumers. 
To illustrate, consider our Optum360 revenue management relationship with Dignity Health, where cash flows have already improved by $1.5 billion and accounts are being settled there for 8 days faster, and where our documentation technology is helping Dignity Health physicians meet demanding ICD-10 requirements even as they are realizing a 50% gain in productivity. Or consider Optum Care, our expanding care delivery business in which we are developing some of the most impactful and durable consumer relationships. Today, we serve 7 million patients through more than 150 payer relationships across our physician practices, our community-based clinical services and our MedExpress neighborhood care centers. 
MedExpress operates at the convergence of health care and retail, measuring success one patient at a time. MedExpress can provide as much as 90% of the care patients received in the ER and for as little as 10% of the cost. MedExpress mitigates costs for both payers and consumers while providing high quality convenient care.
We currently operate over 160 neighborhood care centers, with a goal of operating several multiples of that number 5 years from now. Today, there are Optum Care clinics in more than 270 locations in 26 local markets having recently added ProHealth in the Connecticut market to that distinctive high-performance practice portfolio. 
Our pipeline for growth is gaining momentum as well. The Optum Care approach respects local market norms and expectations, and our doctors consistently deliver high-quality results for the communities they serve. We consistently outperform benchmarks around the acute care readmissions and skilled nursing facility stays. More than 3/4 of private Medicare patients we care for are in health plans rated 4 stars or better, and more than 96% of our patients would recommend our local care provider office to others. 
For patients with complex medical conditions, our integrated care model has proven distinctive results. We deliver, on average, a 50% reduction in overall health care costs for medically complex patients with very high patient and family satisfaction. Our number of Optum Care's high performing practices have been nationally recognized for their performance in counsel care initiatives including Monarch in Southern California and ProHealth in New York metro area. 
And finally, our HouseCall services continued to deliver clear and distinctive value for Medicare recipients and payers with 98% patient satisfaction and more than 1 million visits to patients in their homes delivered in 2015 and further growth in 2016.
With market momentum we have today and through these constantly advancing capabilities, we expect Optum Care will remain a high growth business for many years to come. As we share other examples in future quarters that reflect Optum's growing diversification such as our Military and Veterans Health Services or our pharmacy care services or our technology support services, you should see with even more clarity a pattern emerging, the application of data, technology and services to bring better performance, helping health systems work better for everyone. 
Today, revenues from our top 25 customer relationships at Optum have quadrupled over the last 3 years. In 2015, the average customer award size doubled across OptumHealth and OptumInsight, and we expect continued strong customer retention at OptumRx as we work to bring the powerful benefits of the OptumRx merger to these clients. Prominent organizations continue to inquire about how our capabilities can help them, so we are exploring potentially large and interesting new strategic relationships. In many cases, these pairings could further accelerate growth in the OptumInsight backlog, which now exceeds $10.4 billion and grew by more than 20% year-over-year. Within the current portion of that backlog, we already cover more than 80% of OptumInsight's full year projected 2016 revenues. 
We remain optimistic about the prospects for Optum in 2016, 2017 and beyond. For 2016, we are projecting revenues to well exceed $80 billion, which would be growth in the area of 20% and for operating earnings to grow 30% to 34% to more than $5.55 billion. Optum is becoming an increasingly valuable business and now represents about 42% of UnitedHealth Group's consolidated operating earnings outlook. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."

UnitedHealthcare continues to differentiate itself from competitors on a foundation of distinctive service, product innovation and integrated clinical and network value, and the result is strong sustainable growth. UnitedHealthcare now",1245,"Thank you, Larry. UnitedHealthcare continues to differentiate itself from competitors on a foundation of distinctive service, product innovation and integrated clinical and network value, and the result is strong sustainable growth. 
UnitedHealthcare now serves 46.4 million medical members, and we have leading market positions in all private health insurance segments of North and South America. Over the past 5 years, we have grown by nearly 13.5 million people or 40%, well diversified across commercial, government programs and international offerings. This reflects a deliberate diversification and consistent competitiveness of our offerings globally. 
UnitedHealthcare continued this trend in 2015, growing to serve 1.75 million more people domestically as we continue to improve its market share. UnitedHealthcare's full year revenues grew nearly 10% to $131.3 billion. The full year operating margin of 5.1% decreased as expected, declining 70 basis points year-over-year due to the effects of public insurance exchange products. Full year commercial medical cost trends of 5.5% came in at the low end of our initial outlook one year ago. Our cost trends reflect the positive, sustainable impact of higher consumer engagement, strong alignment of incentives with care professionals through value-based relationships and improving data collections and application.
We are equally pleased with emerging innovation trends in our business focused on advancing the consumer movement in health care. Today, 25 million consumers are served through our Advocate4Me service model. People served by this innovative approach are more engaged in their health and are more effective in their health care decision-making and are more satisfied. Today, over 23 million consumers have joined our Rally Digital Health applications, and we are seeing steady advances in daily active use of these services including, importantly, engagement around selecting primary care physicians, better use of urgent care over emergency care, screenings and higher adoption of personal health and condition management programs. 
And today, our Real Appeal digital medical service, designed to help manage weight and reduce the onset of diabetes, has been deployed to accounts, representing 1 million people in just the last half of 2015 and with an additional 0.5 million committed for the first half of 2016. The initial results are encouraging, with 46% of participants achieving a meaningful reduction of 5% or more of their body weight within 16 weeks. 5% weight loss reduces the conversion to diabetes by nearly 60% according to studies conducted by the National Institute of Health. Given these exceptional results, we plan to make available digitally a broader set of preventative medical services to engage people to live healthier lives to the fullest. 
Across UnitedHealthcare, we intend to continue to positively impact the quality of social services, condition management, cost and quality transparency, convenient care, wellness and the overall quality of life of the consumers we serve by giving them the tools like these to engage them in their health.
Our work is improving the quality of patient care. In Medicare, we helped to close 9 million gaps in care for the seniors we serve. We will serve 1.7 million members in health plans with higher star ratings in 2017 as we expect at least 63% of our members to be in a 4-star plan, and we will further improve that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more. It is not a coincidence we are off to our strongest growth start for Medicare Advantage in company history. We expect to close first quarter with growth of around 300,000 seniors in Medicare Advantage, and we are tracking well against our full year outlook of 325,000 to 400,000 people in that growth. 
In commercial benefits, we combine tiered networks, our clinical strategies and innovative product designs in a myriad of ways to align to a wide array of affordable price points for employers and consumers. Today, 1/3 of our commercial customers are served through one of these more affordable plan offerings. That's double the number from 5 years ago, and we expect that percentage to more than double again over the next 5 years, aiding to our exceptional growth.
In Medicaid, over the past 2 years, we have secured new contract awards totaling more than 2 million people. Managed Medicaid continues to emerge as the ultimate long-term sustaining solution for states and we believe UnitedHealthcare offers our state customers the most distinctive and comprehensive set of capabilities. Like in Medicare and commercial, we are well positioned for 2016 growth in Community & State.
Turning to exchanges. We expect to start the year at around 700,000 or fewer public exchange members and expect these numbers will steadily decline over the course of the year. We are not pursuing membership growth and have taken a comprehensive set of actions to contain membership and sharpen performance over the balance of 2016. We have withdrawn platinum products, increased prices, eliminated marketing and commissions, intensified clinical engagement and medical management with this membership group and reduced operating cost as appropriate. 
As a matter of prudence, we have increased our premium deficiency reserve by $65 million above our investor conference estimates, bringing the total fourth quarter charge to $340 million. $245 million of that charge addresses 2016's exchange compliant product exposure. This is in addition to the unreserved losses including in our 2016 outlook combined more than $1.5 billion set aside for 2016. We believe we have fully captured 2016 exposure now based on our actual starting enrollment. And by mid-2016, we will determine to what extent, if any, we will continue to offer products in the exchange market in 2017.
In Medicaid, the start of the new program in Iowa has been deferred while the state has also increased the assigned enrollment for each contracted plan, which increases our estimate of revenues. We are in constructive discussions with the state concerning elements of an effective and sustainable managed Medicaid program to serve that market. 
As we look into 2016 and 2017, we believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at a strong pace and profitably improve its market share. Fundamentally, UnitedHealthcare's emerging across the spectrum of consumer-driven products, service, wellness, transparency and, most important, care engagement and clinical quality particularly in government programs. We have room to improve but with sharp focus on NPS and the quality of the work we do and a culture centered around helping others, we have an opportunity to offer even greater value to consumers, providers and customers alike in the coming years. 
Before Steve sums up, let me touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. We are committed to strong performance in 2016 across UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in service, in operations, in growth, in earnings generation and in cash flow production. We foresee cash flows approaching $10 billion and adjusted net earnings of $7.60 to $7.80 per share. Again, adjusted net earnings for us is GAAP EPS plus after-tax intangible amortization. We encourage everyone to move to adjusted net earnings to enable better comparability among companies and among the analyst community. We expect about 46% to 47% of full year earnings in the first half of the year with Optum at approximately 40% of its full year plan in the first half, exactly as you saw it last year and in the past. We expect the rate of our earnings growth to strengthen during 2016. Current consensus Street estimates for first quarter adjusted earnings per share might be slightly strong compared to our expectations at the moment. All in, we have a strong view of 2016 and look forward to this year.

On the customer side, we're committed to further elevating satisfaction for consumers, care providers and all our stakeholders who levels, who are often seen outside our industries to better meet the increasing expectations people and society have for health care. 
When our Net Promoter Scores reflect people being staunch advocates for our products and businesses because of the way we make their lives simpler and the value we provided, they define and experience it as consumers and customers, we'll be on the path of creating truly distinctive and substantial growth and brand equity.
We believe a differentiated brand and reputation will drive accelerated growth in market share gains for our businesses for years to come. Our goal for serving U.S. investors in 2016 is simple. We're committed to delivering clean, strong results this year backed by a growing pipeline of opportunities for 2017 and beyond.

We did increase our loss expectations for 2016, and what it came down to really as we closed out the year, we took a prudent posture on the '15 impact and then we carried that through to 2016 outlook and then we adjusted further for a little higher enrollment expectation for 2016. So those are the elements that played into the increase in both the '15 impact and the assumed losses for '16 in the individual exchange compliant plan offerings. And then with regard to the Medicaid portion, that's simply just a function of higher enrollment expectation as the number of carriers was reduced from 4 down to 3. But when you put that all together in total, as we close the year, it was about $100 million of impact beyond what our guidance had assumed from December. And so our base business -- the vast majority of our business performed exceptionally well, and we delivered fully in line with the expectations as we closed out '15.

About 1/3 of that comes from group, so really good insight into that pricing and that membership. And then within the individual business, meaningful improvement in our retention also has added to this growth. And so this is membership that we've been engaged with and they've been in involved in our clinical programs. And it's very evenly spread across geography and products, but the stability of our products, the evolution of our portfolio is really resonating in the market.

We continue to be -- feel good about the relationships that we've developed with the state. We're in very productive conversations with them about really tried and true methods to ensure long-term stability, and so we feel good about where that's headed and it'll become a long-term and very durable part of our portfolio. And with regard to the rates overall, as you know, states are always pressured. There's nothing new in that. I think we're very pleased with our business, most pleased with the value that we've been able to bring to our customers and to the consumers over the years. We've got a very strong management team, very locally deployed and able to manage these populations and really help people in very vulnerable situations and deliver value for the long term. So I think we feel good about a pressured but stable rate environment and the growth in this market."

So as we look at the elimination of it for 2017, we're certainly encouraged by that, and frankly we've been long supporters of its permanent repeal. Now with that said, I'll tell you in terms of the impact, in Medicaid, we expect it to be no impact in the commercial business because that's priced on a policy year basis and the tax is levied on a calendar year basis. There's no impact over 3 years but there are some differences by year, and we expect it to actually be a drag on our 2016 earnings. We've estimated that impact to be about $100 million of pretax or about $0.06 earnings per share. And then lastly, the Medicare business, the tax has not been part of the rate setting process previously, so we wouldn't expect it to be for 2017 either."

First, thank you for the recognition of the hard work this team has done this year, particularly in last half of the year to get its cost structures aligned and to really position its business for growth in 2016 and beyond. Our cash flows were exceptionally strong. I think you know from past calls and discussions that we had, we're very, very, very focused on cash flows and, in particular, managing the balance sheet elements of our business. And the strength of the cash flows, the departure from what our original expectations were really around collecting receivables more quickly and paying claims more in line with what our contractual requirements are as opposed to paying early. So just better working capital management and really contributed to that. As it relates to then what our priorities are for that is around share repurchases, deleveraging and investment. We're going to continue to maintain a very balanced posture with respect to those things. Obviously, it's important that we continue to delever the businesses we had indicated that we would over the course of 18 months following the Catamaran transaction, and we continue to be committed to doing so. Part of that is that our expectations that will continue to curtail our share repurchases, at least for 2016 unless extreme circumstances arise. But for 2016, about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in cash used. And as you can probably suspect by the activity that's underway in our business, we continue to be a strong investor in new capabilities organically in our business but also through requisite means. As it relates to 2016 and the cash flow, certainly jumping off $9.7 billion cash flow year, with  stronger earnings expectations for 2016, we would expect we would achieve higher cash flows, and as a result, we used language of $9.5 billion to $10 billion in cash flows. We're now talking closer to $10 billion, and we'll take a hard look at that over the course of the first quarter and reassess whether or not we can push that number forward. But clearly, the business is operating well from a balance sheet management perspective. We'll do all we can do to move that -- the cash flow number forward."

So we closed out '15 with very strong growth across both our fully insured and self-funded products. I would say driving a good part of that was increased retention of our existing clients. And in certain markets, we saw the market come back to more pricing, particularly in small group. We also had the opportunity to win back a very large part of the Health Republic small group block in New York at our rates. And as you recall, from early '14, one of our headwinds was that Health Republic pricing against our small group block in New York, so we were -- we're in position to win that back during the fourth quarter of '15, which is good. Now we also coupled that with very strong specialty sales. Our vision and dental products are selling really well, and I think it plays to sort of our value in the marketplace, our strong brand, our consistent pricing and the ability for folks to take advantage of our increasing innovation in the marketplace, the service that we deliver and our efforts to make the health care system a little simpler for our members. So we're really encouraged by the growth that we've had over the last 18 months.

And as I said, it's the 19th of January and I think that we should move forward thoughtfully and prudently in our business. So I think those are the factors. In terms of headwinds, like we said before, we have less than before but we clearly have to play out the year and that's what we intend to do. I think our focus is to really deliver a very clean, strong financial year to the marketplace to continue to advance our business, continue to innovate, continue to diversify it across both the platforms of UnitedHealthcare and Optum and kind of that's our focus. I think we're always endeavored to try to perform better, but I think our guidance right now is a very appropriate range. And I'm assuming you've taken some of the input in terms of how the quarters might play out from our commentary in the teleconference. 
So I think we'll just end it at that. And once again, I'll thank you for joining us today, and I'll leave you with a few closing thoughts of kind of as businesses, Optum and UnitedHealthcare we think really advanced to their capabilities significantly in 2015. And UnitedHealth Group's revenues and operating earnings grew significantly as cash flows increased, as we talked about, over 20%. And our dividend has increased and we will certainly address that in the middle of the year, as is our custom. UnitedHealthcare served more than 1.7 million people domestically, growing virtually in every market that we serve, and Optum grew its revenues by 42% and its backlog by more than 20%. In 2016, we expect to continue and accelerate this growth trend and carry it into 2017 and beyond. We intend to further differentiate our products, our services by focusing on consistently high quality in everything we do and pretty real value for customers and consumers on their terms. We remain committed to delivering clean, strong financial results, as I said, for our shareholders in this year with a growing pipeline of future opportunities. So we appreciate your interest today.

Thank you for joining us today as we close on 2015 and look ahead to 2016. We finished 2015 in line with the guidance provided at our December investor conference with fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share at $1.40, bringing full year 2",423,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us today as we close on 2015 and look ahead to 2016. We finished 2015 in line with the guidance provided at our December investor conference with fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share at $1.40, bringing full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share to $6.45. Overall, UnitedHealthcare had a positive year and finished it with strong fourth quarter growth, exceeding 300,000 members and growing across all its markets. Optum delivered an exceptionally strong fourth quarter, with revenues up 70% and earnings up 46% over the prior year. 
Before we go into the business commentary, let me offer a brief recap of 2015. 2015, UnitedHealth Group's revenue grew more than 20% to $157 billion with organic revenue growth of 10%. Our cash flows were exceptional at $9.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Our dividend increased 33% to an annual rate of $2 per share this year. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve more than 1.7 million more people domestically, as Optum grew its revenues by 42% and revenue backlog by more than 20%. Excluding the impact of individual exchange-compliant products and reserves related to the initiation of a new Medicaid contract, UnitedHealth Group still grew revenues by 19% in 2015 and grew operating earnings 15% to $11.8 billion, and that would have produced an adjusted earnings per share of $7, a 16% year-over-year increase, again absent those 2 items, to give you an idea of the underlying strength of the enterprise.
We know the individual exchanges are top of mind to you, and Dave Wichmann will discuss these fully in his comments. As we said at the investor conference, the balance of our total business, the well more than $175 billion of it, is thriving, considerably stronger and better positioned than this time last year. We are committed to delivering a strong 2016 performance year in growth, in financial results, and in the quality of our services and Net Promoter Score or NPS performance metrics. 
2016 is off to a strong start, considerably stronger than 2015. Our initial growth trends are very encouraging, and our service performance for new January business is strong. Optum's revenue backlog and pipeline have never been stronger. Medical costs in the fourth quarter trended slightly better than expected, and we are confident our benefit businesses have appropriately priced our products for 2016. Our operating business platforms drive these results, so I'll ask Larry Renfro to review Optum's performance for full year 2015 and Dave Wichmann to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide some UnitedHealth Group enterprise-wide comments. Larry?"
104673,320178822,919318,"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,"Earnings Calls","UnitedHealth Group Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve. 2015 was, without question, an exceptional performance year for Optum in revenues and earnings growth and in our preparations to set up 2016 to deliver well for the nearly 115 million people we serve. Optum's businesses have strong momentum",909,"Thanks, Steve. 2015 was, without question, an exceptional performance year for Optum in revenues and earnings growth and in our preparations to set up 2016 to deliver well for the nearly 115 million people we serve. Optum's businesses have strong momentum and are producing strong sustainable growth across the board. Since beginning the One Optum journey in 2011, we have compounded revenues at 23% per year and operating earnings at 34% per year.
In 2015, Optum's revenues of $67.6 billion grew 42%, including organic revenue growth of 13%. OptumRx revenues grew 51% this past year to $48 billion, and even excluding the Catamaran combination, posted solid double-digit organic growth. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to more than $20 billion, which is growth of 24% over 2014. Our full year operating margin of 6.3% reflects the increased mix of pharmacy care services revenues, driven by OptumRx organic growth and 5 months of Catamaran business. Both OptumHealth's and OptumInsight's strong full year 2015 margins are sustainable, and we project operating margin expansion for OptumRx in 2016. 
In 2015, we added to our strategic relationship portfolio, which now numbers 10, and we remain focused on developing more of these comprehensive large-scale relationships. They leverage Optum's unique end-to-end capabilities to help solve the broader challenges customers and prospects are facing in a changing health care environment, whether they are physicians or hospitals, health benefit sponsors, governments or consumers. 
To illustrate, consider our Optum360 revenue management relationship with Dignity Health, where cash flows have already improved by $0.5 billion and accounts are being settled a full 8 days faster, and where our documentation technology is helping Dignity Health physicians meet demanding ICD-10 requirements even as they are realizing a 50% gain in productivity. Or consider Optum Care, our expanding care delivery business in which we are developing some of the most impactful and durable consumer relationships. Today, we serve 7 million patients through more than 150 payer relationships across our physician practices, our community-based clinical services and our MedExpress neighborhood care centers. 
MedExpress operates at the convergence of health care and retail, measuring success one patient at a time. MedExpress can provide as much as 90% of the care patients received in the ER and for as little as 10% of the cost. MedExpress mitigates costs for both payers and consumers while providing high-quality convenient care.
We currently operate over 160 neighborhood care centers, with a goal of operating several multiples of that number 5 years from now. Today, there are Optum Care clinics in more than 270 locations in 26 local markets, having recently added ProHealth in the Connecticut market to that distinctive high-performance practice portfolio. 
Our pipeline for growth is gaining momentum as well. The Optum Care approach respects local market norms and expectations, and our doctors consistently deliver high-quality results for the communities they serve. We consistently outperform benchmarks around acute care readmissions and skilled nursing facility stays. More than 3/4 of private Medicare patients we care for are in health plans rated 4 stars or better, and more than 96% of our patients would recommend our local care provider office to others. 
For patients with complex medical conditions, our integrated care model has proven distinctive results. We deliver, on average, a 50% reduction in overall health care costs for medically complex patients, with very high patient and family satisfaction. A number of Optum Care's high-performing practices have been nationally recognized for their performance in counseled care initiatives, including Monarch in Southern California and ProHealth in New York metro area. 
And finally, our HouseCalls services continued to deliver clear and distinctive value for Medicare recipients and payers with 98% patient satisfaction and more than 1 million visits to patients in their homes delivered in 2015 and further growth in 2016.
With market momentum we have today and through these constantly advancing capabilities, we expect Optum Care will remain a high-growth business for many years to come. As we share other examples in future quarters that reflect Optum's growing diversification, such as our military and veterans health services or our pharmacy care services or our technology support services, you should see with even more clarity a pattern emerging: the application of data, technology and services to bring better performance, helping health systems work better for everyone. 
Today, revenues from our top 25 customer relationships at Optum have quadrupled over the last 3 years. In 2015, the average customer award size doubled across OptumHealth and OptumInsight, and we expect continued strong customer retention at OptumRx as we work to bring the powerful benefits of the OptumRx merger to these clients. Prominent organizations continue to inquire about how our capabilities can help them, so we are exploring potentially large and interesting new strategic relationships. In many cases, these pairings could further accelerate growth in the OptumInsight backlog, which now exceeds $10.4 billion and grew by more than 20% year-over-year. Within the current portion of that backlog, we already cover more than 80% of OptumInsight's full year projected 2016 revenues. 
We remain optimistic about the prospects for Optum in 2016, 2017 and beyond. For 2016, we are projecting revenues to well exceed $80 billion, which would be growth in the area of 20%, and for operating earnings to grow 30% to 34% to more than $5.55 billion. Optum is becoming an increasingly valuable business and now represents about 42% of UnitedHealth Group's consolidated operating earnings outlook. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."

UnitedHealthcare continues to differentiate itself from competitors on a foundation of distinctive service, product innovation and integrated clinical and network value, and the result is strong sustainable growth. UnitedHealthcare now",1245,"Thank you, Larry. UnitedHealthcare continues to differentiate itself from competitors on a foundation of distinctive service, product innovation and integrated clinical and network value, and the result is strong sustainable growth. 
UnitedHealthcare now serves 46.4 million medical members, and we have leading market positions in all private health insurance segments of North and South America. Over the past 5 years, we have grown by nearly 13.5 million people or 40%, well diversified across commercial, government programs and international offerings. This reflects the deliberate diversification and consistent competitiveness of our offerings globally. 
UnitedHealthcare continued this trend in 2015, growing to serve 1.75 million more people domestically as we continue to improve its market share. UnitedHealthcare's full year revenues grew nearly 10% to $131.3 billion. The full year operating margin of 5.1% decreased as expected, declining 70 basis points year-over-year due to the effects of public insurance exchange products. Full year commercial medical cost trends of 5.5% came in at the low end of our initial outlook 1 year ago. Our cost trends reflect the positive, sustainable impact of higher consumer engagement, strong alignment of incentives with care professionals through value-based relationships, and improving data collection and application.
We are equally pleased with emerging innovation trends in our business, focused on advancing the consumer movement in health care. Today, 25 million consumers are served through our Advocate4Me service model. People served by this innovative approach are more engaged in their health and are more effective in their health care decision-making, and are more satisfied. Today, over 23 million consumers have joined our Rally digital health applications, and we are seeing steady advances in daily active use of these services, including, importantly, engagement around selecting primary care physicians, better use of urgent care over emergency care, screenings and higher adoption of personal health and condition management programs. 
And today, our Real Appeal digital medical service, designed to help manage weight and reduce the onset of diabetes, has been deployed to accounts representing 1 million people in just the last half of 2015, and with an additional 0.5 million committed for the first half of 2016. The initial results are encouraging, with 46% of participants achieving a meaningful reduction of 5% or more of their body weight within 16 weeks. 5% weight loss reduces the conversion to diabetes by nearly 60% according to studies conducted by the National Institute of Health. Given these exceptional results, we plan to make available digitally a broader set of preventative medical services to engage people to live healthier lives to the fullest. 
Across UnitedHealthcare, we intend to continue to positively impact the quality of social services, condition management, cost and quality transparency, convenient care, wellness and the overall quality of life of the consumers we serve by giving them the tools like these to engage them in their health.
Our work is improving the quality of patient care. In Medicare, we helped to close 9 million gaps in care for the seniors we serve. We will serve 1.7 million members in health plans with higher star ratings in 2017, as we expect at least 63% of our members to be in a 4-star plan, and we will further improve that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more. It is not a coincidence we are off to our strongest growth start for Medicare Advantage in company history. We expect to close first quarter with growth of around 300,000 seniors in Medicare Advantage, and we are tracking well against our full year outlook of 325,000 to 400,000 people in that growth. 
In commercial benefits, we combine tiered networks, our clinical strategies and innovative product designs in a myriad of ways to align to a wide array of affordable price points for employers and consumers. Today, 1/3 of our commercial customers are served through one of these more affordable plan offerings. That's double the number from 5 years ago, and we expect that percentage to more than double again over the next 5 years, aiding to our exceptional growth.
In Medicaid, over the past 2 years, we have secured new contract awards totaling more than 2 million people. Managed Medicaid continues to emerge as the ultimate long-term sustaining solution for states, and we believe UnitedHealthcare offers our state customers the most distinctive and comprehensive set of capabilities. Like in Medicare and commercial, we are well positioned for 2016 growth in Community & State.
Turning to exchanges. We expect to start the year at around 700,000 or fewer public exchange members and expect these numbers will steadily decline over the course of the year. We are not pursuing membership growth and have taken a comprehensive set of actions to contain membership and sharpen performance over the balance of 2016. We have withdrawn platinum products, increased prices, eliminated marketing and commissions, intensified clinical engagement and medical management with this membership group and reduced operating cost as appropriate. 
As a matter of prudence, we have increased our premium deficiency reserve by $65 million above our investor conference estimates, bringing the total fourth quarter charge to $340 million. $245 million of that charge addresses 2016's exchange-compliant product exposure. This is in addition to the unreserved losses included in our 2016 outlook, combined more than $0.5 billion set aside for 2016. We believe we have fully captured 2016 exposure, now based on our actual starting enrollment. And by mid-2016, we will determine to what extent, if any, we will continue to offer products in the exchange market in 2017.
In Medicaid, the start of the new program in Iowa has been deferred while the state has also increased the assigned enrollment for each contracted plan, which increases our estimate of revenues. We are in constructive discussions with the state concerning elements of an effective and sustainable managed Medicaid program to serve that market. 
As we look into 2016 and 2017, we believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at a strong pace and profitably improve its market share. Fundamentally, UnitedHealthcare's emerging across the spectrum of consumer-driven products, service, wellness, transparency and, most important, care engagement and clinical quality, particularly in government programs. We have room to improve, but with the sharp focus on NPS and the quality of the work we do and a culture centered around helping others, we have an opportunity to offer even greater value to consumers, providers and customers alike in the coming years. 
Before Steve sums up, let me touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. We are committed to strong performance in 2016 across UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in service, in operations, in growth, in earnings generation and in cash flow production. We foresee cash flows approaching $10 billion and adjusted net earnings of $7.60 to $7.80 per share. Again, adjusted net earnings for us is GAAP EPS plus after-tax intangible amortization. We encourage everyone to move to adjusted net earnings to enable better comparability among companies and among the analyst community. We expect about 46% to 47% of full year earnings in the first half of the year, with Optum at approximately 40% of its full year plan in the first half, exactly as you saw it last year and in the past. We expect the rate of our earnings growth to strengthen during 2016. Current consensus Street estimates for first quarter adjusted earnings per share might be slightly strong compared to our expectations at the moment. All in, we have a strong view of 2016 and look forward to this year.

We did increase our loss expectations for 2016, and what it came down to really, as we closed out the year, we took a prudent posture on the '15 impact and then we carried that through to 2016 outlook, and then we adjusted further for a little higher enrollment expectation for 2016. So those are the elements that played into the increase in both the '15 impact and the assumed losses for '16 in the individual exchange-compliant plan offerings. And then with regard to the Medicaid portion, that's simply just a function of higher enrollment expectation as the number of carriers was reduced from 4 down to 3. But when you put that all together in total, as we closed the year, it was about $100 million of impact beyond what our guidance had assumed from December. And so our base business -- the vast majority of our business performed exceptionally well, and we delivered fully in line with the expectations as we closed out '15.

And second, we really like where the growth is coming from. And so I think Dave mentioned in his comments about 300,000 or so as a result of AEP. About 1/3 of that comes from group, so really good insight into that pricing and that membership. And then within the individual business, meaningful improvement in our retention also has added to this growth. And so this is membership that we've been engaged with and they've been in involved in our clinical programs. And it's very evenly spread across geography and products. But the stability of our products, the evolution of our portfolio is really resonating in the market.

In the commercial business, because that's priced on a policy-year basis and the tax is levied on a calendar-year basis, there's no impact over 3 years but there are some differences by year, and we expect it to actually be a drag on our 2016 earnings.

First, thank you for the recognition of the hard work this team has done this year, particularly in last half of the year, to get its cost structures aligned and to really position its business for growth in 2016 and beyond. Our cash flows were exceptionally strong. I think you know from past calls and discussions that we had, we're very, very, very focused on cash flows and, in particular, managing the balance sheet elements of our business. And the strength of the cash flows, the departure from what our original expectations were, were really around collecting receivables more quickly and paying claims more in line with what our contractual requirements are as opposed to paying early. So just better working capital management and -- really contributed to that. As it relates to then what our priorities are for that is -- around share repurchases, deleveraging and investment, we're going to continue to maintain a very balanced posture with respect to those things. Obviously, it's important that we continue to delever the business as we had indicated that we would over the course of 18 months following the Catamaran transaction, and we continue to be committed to doing so. Part of that is our expectations that we'll continue to curtail our share repurchases, at least for 2016, unless extreme circumstances arise. But for 2016, it's about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in cash use. And as you can probably suspect by the activity that's underway in our business, we continue to be a strong investor in new capabilities organically in our business, but also through acquisitive means. As it relates to 2016 and the cash flow, certainly jumping off a $9.7 billion cash flow year, with stronger earnings expectations for 2016, we would expect we would achieve higher cash flows, and as a result, we used language of $9.5 billion to $10 billion in cash flows. We're now talking closer to $10 billion, and we'll take a hard look at that over the course of the first quarter and reassess whether or not we can push that number forward. But clearly, the business is operating well from a balance sheet management perspective. We'll do all we can do to move that -- the cash flow number forward."

Now we also coupled that with very strong specialty sales. Our vision and dental products are selling really well, and I think it plays to sort of our value in the marketplace, our strong brand, our consistent pricing and the ability for folks to take advantage of our increasing innovation in the marketplace, the service that we deliver and our efforts to make the health care system a little simpler for our members.

In terms of headwinds, like we said before, we have less than before, but we clearly have to play out the year and that's what we intend to do. I think our focus is to really deliver a very clean, strong financial year to the marketplace to continue to advance our business, continue to innovate, continue to diversify it across both the platforms of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and kind of that's our focus. I think we always endeavor to try to perform better, but I think our guidance right now is a very appropriate range.

So I think we'll just end it at that. And once again, I'll thank you for joining us today, and I'll leave you with a few closing thoughts of kind of as businesses. Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we think, really advanced their capabilities significantly in 2015. And UnitedHealth Group's revenues and operating earnings grew significantly as cash flows increased, as we talked about, over 20%. And our dividend has increased and we will certainly address that in the middle of the year, as is our custom. UnitedHealthcare served more than 1.7 million people domestically, growing virtually in every market that we serve, and Optum grew its revenues by 42% and its backlog by more than 20%. In 2016, we expect to continue and accelerate this growth trend and carry it into 2017 and beyond. We intend to further differentiate our products, our services, by focusing on consistently high quality in everything we do and creating real value for customers and consumers on their terms. We remain committed to delivering clean, strong financial results, as I said, for our shareholders in this year with a growing pipeline of future opportunities. So we appreciate your interest today.

Thank you for joining us today to review our results for first quarter 2016. UnitedHealth Group businesses have steadily strengthened over the last several years and this trend continued in the first quarter of 2016. A momentu",575,"Thank you, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review our results for first quarter 2016. UnitedHealth Group businesses have steadily strengthened over the last several years and this trend continued in the first quarter of 2016. A momentum is evidenced in the highest levels of customer and consumer retention in our history combined with new customer acquisitions driving strong revenue gains across the enterprise. Growth in the size, scope and diversity of products and services within our client base as well as a number of new customer opportunities we are pursuing, steadily improving metrics for brand and reputation and steadily rising net promoter scores across our businesses. Customers buy value and expect results and we are sharpening our performance focus, driving the highest quality customer experiences, helping us become the go-to choice, the must-have partner for everyone looking to improve performance and sustainability and health benefits and health services. When we combine higher quality from consistent excellent execution with practical innovations at scale, our opportunities to grow and serve continue to expand. Our intensified commitments to quality performance and to growth on the strength of that quality positions UnitedHealth Group to look forward to what we believe may become our best decade of performance and [indiscernible]. 
Turning to the results. We are reporting today our first quarter revenues grew 9% prior to acquisitions and over 24% overall to $44.5 billion with broad strength across the enterprise. In health benefits, medical costs were well managed and controlled as is evident in the consolidated care ratio of 81.7%. Prior year reserves developed favorably by $360 million in the quarter. The medical days claims payable increased 4 days year-over-year to 51 days. Cash flows of $2.3 billion or 1.4x net income continued the strong and reliable pace. First quarter's operating cost ratio decreased 110 basis points year-over-year to 15.2% due to a combination of business mix, technology-driven operational efficiencies and the cumulative overall effects of revenue growth. These efficiency gains were partially offset by continued investments in our businesses. Our tax rate reflected early adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation, adding roughly $0.06 per share in the quarter. You should expect that will add considerably less in coming quarters due to the natural pattern of equity-based compensation activity for our company. 
First quarter adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share grew 17% year-over-year and our full year revenue and per share earnings outlook is strengthening as Dave Wichmann will describe shortly. Since we know exchanges are in the minds of many of you, let me take a quick minute for an update. As you know, we have been evaluating Public Exchanges on a state-by-state basis. We have maintained a regular public dialogue with Houston's November about the individual exchange market and how our own experience and performance have been unfavorable for these markets. The smaller overall market size and shorter-term high risk profile was in this market segment continued to suggest we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustained basis. Next year, we will remain in only a handful of states and we will not carry financial exposure from exchanges into 2017. We continue to remain an advocate for more stable and sustainable approaches to serving this market and those who rely on [indiscernible] care. 
With that, I will now ask Larry Renfro to review Optum's exceptional performance and then Dave to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide UnitedHealth Group's comments. Larry?"
104673,328875980,959335,"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","UnitedHealth Group Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Optum is off to a strong start again this year, consistent with the ambitious plans we shared with you at our investor conference last December. Optum will again grow revenue at more than 20% and earnings from operations at above 30% this y",1159,"Thanks, Steve. Optum is off to a strong start again this year, consistent with the ambitious plans we shared with you at our investor conference last December. Optum will again grow revenue at more than 20% and earnings from operations at above 30% this year. We continue to estimate Optum will contribute 42% or more of enterprisewide operating earnings this year, even considering our ongoing investments to support the future growth of this young business. 
Optum's performance reflects the large scale opportunities we are pursuing and the tremendous efforts our 100,000 employees make to deliver differentiated services and capabilities to those seeking to solve complex challenges across the health care system. 
Our first quarter revenues of $19.7 billion grew 54% year-over-year or 11% prior to acquisitions. OptumRx revenues grew 72% to $14.3 billion while OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to $5.7 billion, which is growth of 21% over the first quarter of 2015. Our first quarter operating margin of 5.6% includes the continuing increase of pharmacy care revenues as you have seen in the past 2 quarters. Overall, Optum produced $1.1 billion in earnings from operations. 
As you may know, we identified 5 drivers for Optum's growth over the next 5 years. They are pharmacy care services, care delivery, technology, government services and international. Last quarter, we spent some time on a more detailed review of care delivery. Today, we will focus on pharmacy care services then follow up briefly with data analytics. Pharmacy care services is a high priority area for us. This focus goes back some 5 years to the original decision to undertake the largest and, arguably, most complex business insourcing ever attempted. It required significant investments, precise execution and flawless delivery. As you know now, it has been a real success. Last year, we took another step. Our combination with Catamaran led by Mark Thierer who now heads our entire OptumRx platform and serves as a senior member of our overall Optum leadership team. This combination was a significant advance in scale. And today, the business is running at over 1 billion scrips annually, up from 350 million in 2012. 
Eight months in, the greatly expanded OptumRx is advancing a meaningful differentiated solution for clients in the marketplace with distinctive capabilities around patient-centered data analytics, new capabilities and specialty pharmacy such as home infusion and workplace-related resources. Since we came together, our retention rates have persisted in the high 90s and we are building our largest ever pipeline of opportunities. We were pleased this quarter to announce an innovative partnership with Walgreens, to which we are creating a 90-day at-retail pharmacy offering. This is all about meeting consumers where and when they want, whether that means home delivery or walking into the local Walgreens store. Together, we will provide choice and cost savings to our clients as we work and benefit together in a meaningful more collaborative way. We are enthusiastic about the potential of the extension of our relationship with Walgreens, the largest retail pharmacy in the U.S. Overall, this year, we expect OptumRx to generate more than $58 billion in revenues and manage nearly $80 billion in pharmacy spend for our customers including $30 billion of specialty drug spending. 
Pharmaceutical spending comprises 12% to 15% of the overall cost of health benefits. It has been the traditional focus of the pharmacy benefits industry. We find that focus much too limiting when it comes to improving health and health care overall. The impact of OptumRx is on health care and its cost has the potential to be profoundly broader and deeper. Here, you have the most frequent consumer touch point in all of health care, one that provides great visibility into the full health care continuum. 
An individual's engagement with OptumRx becomes more impactful when we break out one-dimensional procurement and formulary arbitrage model of today and open up to providing consumers integrated medical and pharmaceutical services. In the process, we help reduce unnecessary overall systems utilization including ER visits, hospital admissions and readmissions and provide more effective and timely interventions to improve adherence and health outcomes. That's the value proposition of the future we are focused on. Employers using our integrated and technology-enabled approach can save an excess of $120 per member per year across their combined medical benefit. 
In summary, our objective for the impact of this business goes far beyond traditional pharmaceutical management, to where the potential to influence both the consumer and the health system for the better is much greater. That is why pharmacy care services are core to our growth and value story over the next decade. 
Optum also is delivering differentiated value from the work and size of the health system. A second core to our growth are unrivaled existing capabilities in health care data science and analytics. Companies new to this space are excited about the potential that someday these forces will [indiscernible] health care into a new age. Well, for Optum's customers, that someday is today. We are meeting their critical needs right now. We are the leader in using advanced technology and predictive analytics to connect stakeholders across the care continuum with the insights to better manage the health populations and the resources they depend on. Our continuously updated integrated and curated clinical and claims data asset comprises more than 80 million lives of robust clinical data and 170 million lives of claims data we can see from both sides. Beyond the 250 million clinical administrative lives, our diverse and comprehensive data set includes 8 billion lab results, 4 billion determinations and 3 billion medical procedures. We can provide a real-time clinical and financial picture that is fully integrated and spans years of large [ph] and total detail. Our health data resources continue to grow securely and responsibly everyday. 
Today, our analytics products are helping thousands of care providers and, ultimately, the millions of consumers and they serve, translate data into action and action into better medical outcomes. Today, not someday, we help our customers step up from reacting to challenges to designing and implementing actions that reliably leads to better health delivered at lower costs. Today we are delivering the wealth of information, analysis and positive benefits of big data with results that include double-digit improvements in critical performance factors like utilization and chronic disease control, which, in turn, empower care providers to adopt and succeed in new models of care and related new revenue streams. 
Today, we lead the way in implementing predictive analytics in health care because health care is all that we do. Health care technology and data analytics has been our specialized focus for years. So while others learn to crunch large amounts of static data, Optum is fully integrated into the live flow of health care transactions, enabling us to provide up-to-date, useful information that makes the health care system more intelligent and enables it to act that way. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."
104673,328875980,959335,"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","UnitedHealth Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Larry. As we open 2016, UnitedHealthcare's momentum continues. Strong new customer growth and historically higher retention levels affect the competitive value UnitedHealthcare offers in the marketplace. Quarter by quarter and year by year, we",1078,"Thank you, Larry. As we open 2016, UnitedHealthcare's momentum continues. Strong new customer growth and historically higher retention levels affect the competitive value UnitedHealthcare offers in the marketplace. Quarter by quarter and year by year, we continue to gain new customers and retain valuable established customers who choose the combination of our more engaging consumer experience, distinctive service, product innovation and integrated clinical and network value. People using our modern consumer-based benefit designs are supported by actionable information available at their fingertips, enabled and delivered by advanced analytic capabilities, as Larry just described, increasingly channeled through consumer and care-provider-friendly mobile technologies. Employers continue to be drawn to well-managed competitive cost strengths, physician and consumer engagement and value-based arrangements for care delivery. We partner with our largest customers to benchmark performance and design customized plans to help them advance year by year along the continuum of ever benefit performance and heightened consumer engagement, and we are serving individual patients and overall populations with more complex medical conditions. Our coordination of services and ability to close gaps in care significantly increase the value we bring to consumers and customers. Simply put, the greater the level of patient needs, the more we can help. 
As a result, we continue to deliver exceptional organic growth. Our US-based benefits businesses grew organically to serve 1.3 million more people with medical benefits in the first quarter and that brought organic growth to 2 million people in the past year. Looking at commercial markets, we are up about 700,000 people in the quarter and 1 million people since March 2015. First quarter 2016 delivered diversified growth across self-funded national accounts, public sector, small groups middle-market businesses and individual. 
Turning to exchanges. As we expected when we spoke with you in January, we grew roughly 300,000 lives through the first quarter and served 795,000 people on Public Exchanges as of March 31. We expect that level to decline to around 650,000 by December. Through this first quarter, we have seen no change in our estimates of cost from the 2015 exchange period. This quarter, with the majority of our 2016 exchange members new to us, we have been appropriately cautious in our reserve estimates, reflecting an additional 125 million in full year 2016 exchange losses. This were fully absorbed in this quarter and fully considered for the year in our guidance range, and as Steve mentioned, we do not anticipate financial exposure to exchanges in 2017. 
In Medicare, the value of our Medicare Advantage offerings continue to resonate, differentiated by the stability of our benefits, networks, membership and distribution systems. We offer seniors clear value and a consistent modern consumer experience, all of which drive new growth as well as strong consumer retention. This strength is reflected in our first quarter membership growth of about 300,000 seniors. Medicare is a consumer business, with seniors receiving a variety of outreach approaches focused on better and more distinct -- and more consistent care, such as receiving home visits and benefiting from our personalized, compassionate and education-focused consumer service. In 2015, we helped closed 9 million gaps in care for seniors we serve, and we expect nearly 65% of our members to be in a 4-star plan by 2017, which further improvement in that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more. 
We believe our Medicare prescription drug benefit business will be much better positioned for 2017. We pulled back in a number of markets this year to reposition products and added membership in the new product potential via modest acquisition in the first quarter. Our Part D membership decreased 70,000 people in the first quarter and should decline by another 200,000 or so by year-end. This suggests we will serve 4.7 million to 4.8 million people by year-end 2016, considerably better than what we projected last December, and we expect to return to growth in Medicare Part D in 2017. 
Switching to Medicaid. Managed care services -- Managed Care serves as the most effective proven tool to ensure budget sustainability for our state Medicaid programs. This financial predictability, along with the ability of Managed Care to expedite systems transformation, comprehensively integrating care while addressing social determinants, has resulted in an unprecedented level of procurement activity. Of special note is the significant increase in the volume of opportunities for populations with more complex needs such as people served by long-term services and support programs. The recent award of Nebraska's integrated health, behavioral and pharmaceutical model reinforces these expected trends and procurement to include more populations with more complex needs and to look to integrated solution to address the state's needs. Our expectation for continued expansion of opportunities to serve all Medicaid populations was reinforced by our recent award in 2 California counties and across our Community & State business, the addition of 145,000 people in the first quarter. 
Let me now touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Building on the strength of our first quarter, we expect full year revenues of approximately $182 billion, up from our prior outlook of $180 billion to $181 billion, led by strength in OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual. First -- strong first quarter results combined with a slightly lower tax rate for the balance of the year and the impact of recently completed acquisitions, allows us to increase our outlook for adjusted net earnings by $0.15 to a range of $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We continue to foresee cash flows approaching $10 billion. 
As you know, we expect Optum to grow full year operating earnings by more than 30% in 2016. We continue to expect seasonality to be a factor in our overall earnings results. Similar to years past, Optum expects to generate in the area of 60% of its operating earnings in the second half of the year, while the current consensus view appears to be modestly more first-half-biased. Taken together, this suggest that updates for full year UnitedHealth Group earnings per share estimates, after recognition of our first quarter performance, would most appropriately be focused on the second half of this year. 
Turning to capital. We closed the quarter with a strong balance sheet. We expect share repurchase activity to be more pronounced in the first half of this year with the second half focused on debt reduction toward targeted levels, and we will see our dividend levels and we will address our dividend levels at our June board meeting as we do each year.

So let me recap what we shared with you in our prior conversations and then talk specifically about what we're updating today. So in January, we described and expected combined loss for both the 2015 and 2016 policy years of $1 billion. Inside that, the 2015 policy or loss was $475 million and that number, as Dave mentioned, remains unchanged. Obviously the balance related to the 2016 policy year so at that point was estimated at $525 million. Today, we are updating our full year outlook for the 2016 policy year to a loss of $650 million. So that $125 million increase was fully recognized in our first quarter financials, and not surprisingly, our PDR, as you asked, did increase over the course of the first quarter. As we look at it, our enrollment is very much in keeping with our expectation at that 795,000 lives on the exchange specifically. And I'll tell you that over half of that enrollment is new to us this year. So as we look at it, the early indications on the health status of the members appears to be a little bit worse. So we are being appropriately cautious in updating our full year outlook and recognizing that additional $125 million in the first quarter financial results. In the month of June, importantly, we will have a first indication of how our risks course actually compare to the industry and we will look forward to updating you further at that time with regard to our individual ACA [ph] business.

If you look at our history, we got decades of experience really using analytics as a foundational tool to build a lot of businesses. And when you ask about constituencies that we serve, it ranges, as Larry mentioned, from providers, payers where we're particularly strong, but also government, pharma that we've been servicing a lot of time for a long time and now more recently consumers and employers. Just to give you a flavor for some ways that they're consuming these analytics, I mean, from a payer provider standpoint, people have been using our analytics to close gaps in care on a monthly basis. We fire up $131 billion rule-based decision every month to help close gaps using our tool like Optum One, which you've heard a lot about. It's really crunching and assessing both clinical and claims data to predict where we're going to see people that need intervention, that those interventions are additive to the tool and how we've extended it in terms of being able to action it, where we can actually go out and prove where we've shown our interventions intercede and people having strokes, people having heart attacks. And what that saves, not obviously good for the patient but obviously good for the system. Our revenue cycle analytics actively are taking out friction between payers and providers, speeding up payment, driving more accuracy and improving the financial conditions of both payers and providers. So I could go on and provide a lot of examples, but they range from strong financial performance that our analytics drive to clinical performance, which really drive better outcomes and lower costs."

We're working with the trust. In the U.K., the trust would be the hospitals. We're working with what's called NHS improvement. They're the organization that really monitors the trust. We're working with NHS. We're working with the Prime Minister's office, Department of Health. So we have a variety of programs that we have underway and we believe that we're pretty well positioned at this point to bring a lot of the products and services that we actually have in the states. I didn't want to interrupt the conversation a few minutes ago about the data and the analytics, but that also is a very, very good area for us to introduce and we're working to do just that as we speak today.

So just specifically a few comments on EMEA and the activities we've undertaken. The business remains profitable as it was last year. Similar to last year, it's continued to become more and more competitive in the market and I'd say the market segments that are most attractive in Brazil and the performance improvement across the business system is substantial. We have put in very strong pricing and cost containment disciplines. We've improved our service substantially down there, I'd say, to more of a kind of UnitedHealthcare style service approach but in Brazil. Our net promoter scores in the market continue to advance and we have a more extensive and better-performing health care delivery company broadly. So I'd characterize that all as a stronger foundation. Obviously, we're still impacted by the devaluation of the real. That affects both our revenues and you can see it probably best in local currency we have a 16% increase in our revenues. But when you translate it into U.S. dollars, it's a 15% [ph] decrease. And I think it's obvious that the economy is not particularly strong there. Companies are struggling. Middle class is flat to declining slightly. And obviously the political situation is unsettled, certainly doesn't help things a whole lot. So we are pretty measured in terms of our view about Brazil right at this point in time. We are competitive, like I said, in certain segments and we are focused on our growth on those segments and we are growing. We do have a fair amount of group attrition right now as employment levels decline on an employer-by-employer basis. But we are seeing growth underneath all that, which is very encouraging. I think most important really is to me is that not only are we strong insurance company but we created a strong health care delivery company throughout the course of the time that we owned [indiscernible] meal and we see that is very positive positioning the market and a meaningful source of our overall performance advanced expectations here in 2016."

Thanks for your question. The tax rate changes really because there was a new accounting pronouncement that came out in March, which we think has a $0.10 impact on the full year, of which we recognize $0.06 from the first quarter, the pronouncement wasn't required to be adopted until 1/1/17. But as is often the case, if we're prepared to adopt, we go ahead and adopt early as law by pronouncement. The sustainability of that is -- this is going to be a little bit of a challenge I think broadly for companies because it -- what it does it subjects your tax rate or your tax position to more of a period type cost or some more volatility overall in the expected effective tax rate and in part because it has to do with the kind of the combination of the performance of your stock and then also the timing of option exercises as well as stock-based plans either vesting in or becoming available to employees at given points in time. So there will be a little bit more volatility in the rate. We expect the full year rate to be in the neighborhood of about 41% or so for the full year 2016, and we'd expect on that at least this impact, if you will, [indiscernible] kind of pronouncement to be pretty consistent year after year depending upon again, how the stock price performs as well as the investing activity underlying our equity boys there for this year, it is a year-by-year proposition.

If I were to take some of the national account clients that we're privileged to serve and who have been more progressive, adopters of kind of the entire breadth of capabilities that we can bring to them and then working with them cooperatively and then working with them in terms of how they are engaging their consumers, if you will, you will actually see distinctive performance patterns and you see them distinctive in terms of, I'd say, 2 dimensions: the better use of the health care resource system, resource in total and the year by-year improvement in the consistency of that pattern of usage and the improvement in their overall health status as they embrace with, they get comfortable with programs that are more consumer friendly and easier, and as you suggest, fueled with data analytics that are now really positioned that they can actually act on them and kind of the whole spectrum of what we've been talking about that some of the things that we are doing and capabilities are put in the marketplace on a time -- a real-time basis, the marketplace is adjusting in terms how do I exactly use these. They know directionally how they want to use them. They know if they are kind of nuts and bolts to quite that point, but these more progressive clients have had distinctively better cost positions and distinctively better patterns of consumer decisions, resource utilization and health status, wellness. And we can translate that from those venues to the more progressive -- to make them more progressive in other sectors of the marketplace and I think about the large government sectors because they have the same attributes as large employer sponsors. They're sponsoring large populations, they have more influence on of these programs go. Many begin to get into the water with respect to consumer behavior and you get into the water with respect to care provider behavior, and those kinds of elements I think can actually can really establish these patterned measures can really drive change. And clients are seeing it, states are seeing it, governments are seeing it, some of Larry's commentary with respect to international is showing some of these patterns to international government that have, arguably, a different health care system and their response to these things. And then the whole idea that the technology is now capable of doing this at such scale and such speed and doing it down to a mobile expression, whoever uses that mobile expression, whether it's a care provider or a consumer, those things are playing out. So we're in the early stages. The best way to see it is in the large national account. And then believe it or not, you can see it in some of the things like Medicaid or you can see large state sponsors that once they really get these programs in a mature state are just driving distinctive results relative to population they are serving. The next stage is really getting this directly to the consumer, and I think their platforms like Raleigh really represent first generation of the way to actually jump over and really get kind of in the consumer's head using these applications and things like that.

Beyond the rates, a little color around insurance fee and the changes to the group benefits. With respect to the service fee, if you step back a little bit, our goal is to provide predictable and stable benefits to seniors. That's something that we were able to do this year and that's I think going to be important in the long run. So as you know, we're in the midst of benefit planning right now and that is going to be one factor that we consider that amounts to several other factors in the pursuit of this goal to offer stable benefits and what has Steve accurately described it remains an underfunded environment in 2017. So it will be something that we'll consider and build to talk more about after we get through our planning system. In terms of the group, changes in the changes in the group benefit, while we're disappointed in that change, it remains, I would say, the value to the retirees, employers or trying to find solutions for the retiree population, Medicare Advantage remains a very strong value proposition and we're seeing it actually play out in our pipeline development.

Thank you for joining us today to review our results for first quarter 2016. UnitedHealth Group businesses have steadily strengthened over the last several years and this trend continued in the first quarter of 2016. Our momen",576,"Thank you, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review our results for first quarter 2016. UnitedHealth Group businesses have steadily strengthened over the last several years and this trend continued in the first quarter of 2016. Our momentum is evident in the highest levels of customer and consumer retention in our history combined with new customer acquisitions driving strong revenue gains across the enterprise; growth in the size, scope and diversity of products and services within our client base as well as a number of new customer opportunities we are pursuing; steadily improving metrics for brand and reputation; and steadily rising Net Promoter Scores across our businesses. Customers buy value and expect results and we are sharpening our performance focus, driving the highest quality customer experiences, helping us become the go-to choice, the must-have partner for everyone looking to improve performance in sustainability and health benefits and health services. 
When we combine higher quality from consistent excellent execution with practical innovations at scale, our opportunities to grow and serve continue to expand. Our intensified commitments to quality performance and to growth on the strength of that quality positions UnitedHealth Group to look forward toward what we believe may become our best decade of performance and growth yet.
Turning to the results. We are reporting today our first quarter revenues grew 9% prior to acquisitions and over 24% overall to $44.5 billion with broad strength across the enterprise. In health benefits, medical costs were well managed and controlled as is evident in the consolidated care ratio of 81.7%. Prior year reserves developed favorably by $360 million in the quarter. The medical days claims payable increased 4 days year-over-year to 51 days. Cash flows of $2.3 billion, or 1.4x net income, continued the strong and reliable pace. First quarter's operating cost ratio decreased 110 basis points year-over-year to 15.2% due to a combination of business mix, technology-driven operational efficiencies and the cumulative overall effects of revenue growth. These efficiency gains were partially offset by continued investments in our businesses. 
Our tax rate reflected early adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation, adding roughly $0.06 per share in the quarter. You should expect that we'll add considerably less in coming quarters due to the natural pattern of equity-based compensation activity for our company. First quarter adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share grew 17% year-over-year, and our full year revenue and per share earnings outlook is strengthening, as Dave Wichmann will describe shortly. 
Since we know exchanges are in the minds of many of you, let me take a quick minute for an update. As you know, we have been evaluating public exchanges on a state-by-state basis. We have maintained a regular public dialogue with you since November about the individual exchange market and how our own experience and performance have been unfavorable for these markets. The smaller overall market size and shorter-term, high-risk profile within this market segment continued to suggest we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustained basis. Next year, we will remain in only a handful of states, and we will not carry financial exposure from exchanges into 2017. We continue to remain an advocate for more stable and sustainable approaches to serving this market and those who rely on it for care. 
With that, I will now ask Larry Renfro to review Optum's exceptional performance, and then Dave to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide UnitedHealth Group's comments. Larry?"

Optum is off to a strong start again this year, consistent with the ambitious plans we shared with you at our investor conference last December. Optum will again grow revenue at more than 20% and earnings from operations at above 30% this y",1157,"Thanks, Steve. Optum is off to a strong start again this year, consistent with the ambitious plans we shared with you at our investor conference last December. Optum will again grow revenue at more than 20% and earnings from operations at above 30% this year. We continue to estimate Optum will contribute 42% or more of enterprise-wide operating earnings this year, even considering our ongoing investments to support the future growth of this young business. 
Optum's performance reflects the large-scale opportunities we are pursuing and the tremendous efforts our 100,000 employees make to deliver differentiated services and capabilities to those seeking to solve complex challenges across the health care system. Our first quarter revenues of $19.7 billion grew 54% year-over-year or 11% prior to acquisitions. OptumRx revenues grew 72% to $14.3 billion while OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to $5.7 billion, which is growth of 21% over the first quarter of 2015. Our first quarter operating margin of 5.6% includes the continuing increase of pharmacy care revenues as you have seen in the past 2 quarters. Overall, Optum produced $1.1 billion in earnings from operations. 
As you may know, we identified 5 drivers for Optum's growth over the next 5 years. They are pharmacy care services, care delivery, technology, government services and international. Last quarter, we spent some time on a more detailed review of care delivery. Today, we will focus on pharmacy care services then follow up briefly with data analytics. 
Pharmacy care services is a high priority area for us. This focus goes back some 5 years to the original decision to undertake the largest and arguably, most complex business in sourcing ever attempted. It required significant investments, precise execution and flawless delivery. As you know now, it has been a real success. 
Last year, we took another step. Our combination with Catamaran led by Mark Thierer, who now heads our entire OptumRx platform and serves as a senior member of our overall Optum leadership team. This combination was a significant advance in scale. And today, the business is running at over 1 billion scripts annually, up from 350 million in 2012. Eight months in, the greatly expanded OptumRx is advancing a meaningful differentiated solutions for clients in the marketplace with distinctive capabilities around patient-centered data analytics; new capabilities in specialty pharmacy, such as home infusion; and workplace-related resources. Since we came together, our retention rates have persisted in the high 90s, and we are building our largest ever pipeline of opportunities. 
We were pleased this quarter to announce an innovative partnership with Walgreens, to which we are creating a 90-day, at-retail pharmacy offering. This is all about meeting consumers where and when they want, whether that means home delivery or walking into the local Walgreens store. Together, we will provide choice and cost savings to our clients as we work and benefit together in a meaningful, more collaborative way. We are enthusiastic about the potential of the extension of our relationship with Walgreens, the largest retail pharmacy in the U.S. Overall, this year, we expect OptumRx to generate more than $58 billion in revenues and manage nearly $80 billion in pharmacy spend for our customers, including $30 billion in specialty drug spending. 
Pharmaceutical spending comprises 12% to 15% of the overall cost of health benefits. It has been the traditional focus of the pharmacy benefits industry. We find that focus much too limiting when it comes to improving health and health care overall. The impact that OptumRx has on health care and its cost has the potential to be profoundly broader and deeper. Here, you have the most frequent consumer touch point in all of health care, one that provides great visibility into the full health care continuum. 
An individual's engagement with OptumRx becomes more impactful when we break out of the one-dimensional procurement and formulary arbitrage model of today and open up to providing consumers integrated medical and pharmaceutical services. In the process, we help reduce unnecessary overall systems utilization, including ER visits, hospital admissions and readmissions; and provide more effective and timely interventions to improve adherence and health outcomes. That's the value proposition of the future we are focused on. Employers using our integrated and technology-enabled approach can save an excess of $120 per member per year across their combined medical benefit.
In summary, our objective for the impact of this business goes far beyond traditional pharmaceutical management, to where the potential to influence both the consumer and the health system for the better is much greater. That is why pharmacy care services are core to our growth and value story over the next decade. 
Optum also is delivering differentiated value from our work inside the health system. A second core to our growth are unrivaled existing capabilities in health care data science and analytics. Companies new to this space are excited about the potential that someday these forces will evolve health care into a new age. Well, for Optum's customers, that someday is today. We are meeting their critical needs right now. We are the leader in using advanced technology and predictive analytics to connect stakeholders across the care continuum with the insights to better manage the health of populations and the resources they depend on. 
Our continuously updated, integrated and curated clinical and claims data asset comprises more than 80 million lives of robust clinical data and 170 million lives of claims data we can see from both sides. Beyond the 250 million clinical administrative lives, our diverse and comprehensive data set includes 8 billion lab results, 4 billion determinations and 3 billion medical procedures. We can provide a real-time clinical and financial picture that is fully integrated and spans years of longitudinal detail. Our health data resources continue to grow securely and responsibly everyday. 
Today, our analytics products are helping thousands of care providers, and ultimately the millions of consumers they serve, translate data into action and action into better medical outcomes. Today, not someday, we help our customers step up from reacting to challenges to designing and implementing actions that reliably lead to better health delivered at lower cost. Today we are delivering the wealth of information, analysis and positive benefits of big data with the results that include double-digit improvements in critical performance factors, like utilization and chronic disease control, which in turn, empower care providers to adopt and succeed in new models of care and related new revenue streams.
Today, we lead the way in implementing predictive analytics in health care because health care is all that we do. Health care technology and data analytics have been our specialized focus for years. So while others learn to crunch large amounts of static data, Optum is fully integrated into the live flow of health care transactions, enabling us to provide up-to-date, useful information that makes the health care system more intelligent and enables it to act that way. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."

Strong new customer growth and historically higher retention levels reflect the competitive value UnitedHealthcare offers in the marketplace. Quarter by quarter and year by year, we continue to gain new customers and retain valuable established customers, who choose the combination of our more engaging consumer experience, distinctive service, product innovation and integrated clinical and network value. People using our modern consumer-based benefit designs are supported by actionable information available at their fingertips, enabled and delivered by advanced analytic capabilities, as Larry just described, increasingly channeled through consumer and care-provider-friendly mobile technologies. 
Employers continue to be drawn to well-managed, competitive cost trends; physician and consumer engagement and value-based arrangements for care delivery. We partner with our largest customers to benchmark performance and design customized plans to help them advance year by year along the continuum of ever-improving benefit performance and heightened consumer engagement. And we are serving individual patients and overall populations with more complex medical conditions. Our coordination of services and ability to close gaps in care significantly increase the value we bring to consumers and customers. Simply put, the greater the level of patient needs, the more we can help. 
As a result, we continue to deliver exceptional organic growth. Our U.S.-based benefits businesses grew organically to serve 1.3 million more people with medical benefits in the first quarter, and that brought organic growth to 2 million people in the past year. Looking at commercial markets, we are up about 700,000 people in the quarter and 1 million people since March 2015. First quarter 2016 delivered diversified growth across self-funded national accounts, public sector, small group, middle-market businesses and individual. 
Turning to exchanges. As we expected when we spoke with you in January, we grew roughly 300,000 lives through the first quarter and served 795,000 people on public exchanges as of March 31. We expect that level to decline to around 650,000 by December. Through this first quarter, we have seen no change in our estimates of cost from the 2015 exchange period. This quarter, with the majority of our 2016 exchange members new to us, we have been appropriately cautious in our reserve estimates, reflecting an additional 125 million in full year 2016 exchange losses. These were fully absorbed in this quarter and fully considered for the year in our guidance range, and as Steve mentioned, we do not anticipate financial exposure to exchanges in 2017.
In Medicare, the value of our Medicare Advantage offerings continue to resonate, differentiated by the stability of our benefits, networks, membership and distribution systems. We offer seniors clear value and a consistent modern consumer experience, all of which drive new growth as well as strong consumer retention. This strength is reflected in our first quarter membership growth of about 300,000 seniors. 
Medicare is a consumer business, with seniors receiving a variety of outreach approaches focused on better and more distinct -- and more consistent care, such as receiving home visits and benefiting from our personalized, compassionate and education-focused consumer service. In 2015, we helped closed 9 million gaps in care for seniors we serve, and we expect nearly 65% of our members to be in a 4-star plan by 2017, with further improvement in that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more. 
We believe our Medicare prescription drug benefit business will be much better positioned for 2017. We pulled back in a number of markets this year to reposition products and added membership in the new product potential via modest acquisition in the first quarter. 
Our Part D membership decreased 70,000 people in the first quarter and should decline by another 200,000 or so by year-end. This suggests we will serve 4.7 million to 4.8 million people by year-end 2016, considerably better than what we projected last December, and we expect to return to growth in Medicare Part D in 2017. 
Switching to Medicaid. Managed care services -- Managed Care serves as the most effective, proven tool to ensure budget sustainability for state Medicaid programs. This financial predictability, along with the ability of Managed Care to expedite systems transformation, comprehensively integrating care while addressing social determinants, has resulted in an unprecedented level of procurement activity. Of special note is the significant increase in the volume of opportunities for populations with more complex needs, such as people served by long-term services and support programs. The recent award of Nebraska's integrated health, behavioral and pharmaceutical model reinforces these expected trends in procurement to include more populations with more complex needs and to look to integrated solution to address states' needs. Our expectation for continued expansion of opportunities to serve all Medicaid populations was reinforced by our recent award in 2 California counties and across our Community & State business, the addition of 145,000 people in the first quarter. 
Let me now touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Building on the strength of our first quarter, we expect full year revenues of approximately $182 billion, up from our prior outlook of $180 billion to $181 billion, led by strength in OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual. First -- strong first quarter results combined with a slightly lower tax rate for the balance of the year and the impact of recently completed acquisitions, allows us to increase our outlook for adjusted net earnings by $0.15 to a range of $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We continue to foresee cash flows approaching $10 billion. 
As you know, we expect Optum to grow full year operating earnings by more than 30% in 2016. We continue to expect seasonality to be a factor in our overall earnings results. Similar to years past, Optum expects to generate in the area of 60% of its operating earnings in the second half of the year, while the current consensus view appears to be modestly more first-half biased. Taken together, this suggests that updates for full year UnitedHealth Group earnings per share estimates, after recognition of our first quarter performance, would most appropriately be focused on the second half of this year. 
Turning to capital. We closed the quarter with a strong balance sheet. We expect share repurchase activity to be more pronounced in the first half of this year with the second half focused on debt reduction toward targeted levels, and we will see our dividend levels -- and we will address our dividend levels at our June board meeting as we do each year.

So in January, we described an expected combined loss for both the 2015 and 2016 policy years of $1 billion. Inside that, the 2015 policy or loss was $475 million. And that number, as Dave mentioned, remains unchanged. Obviously, the balance related to the 2016 policy year, so at that point, it was estimated at $525 million. Today, we are updating our full year outlook for the 2016 policy year to a loss of $650 million. So that $125 million increase was fully recognized in our first quarter financials. And not surprisingly, our PDR, as you asked, did increase over the course of the first quarter. As we look at it, our enrollment is very much in keeping with our expectation at that 795,000 lives on the exchange specifically. And I'll tell you that well over half of that enrollment is new to us this year. So as we look at it, the early indications on the health status of the members appears to be a little bit worse.

And that -- on a comparative quarter basis, that influenced our MLR favorably in the quarter as well as our EPS as well. The development, I won't get into the specifics of how that's broken out by line of business. It was pretty broad reaching across all of our lines of business and really is reflective of what we experienced in the fourth quarter as well, which is the delayed realization of affordability efforts and end-market initiatives that we pursued in UnitedHealthcare in the back half of 2015. So we're very pleased with how our trends are developing, consistent with the forecast that we provided you before. And obviously, this is a favorable development in the quarter."

But we also extend that work into other areas with particular focus around outpatient, because it's one of the bigger drivers of costs, and making sure that we're driving care to the most appropriate setting and, likewise, looking at it on a network spend.

If you look at our history, we got decades of experience really using analytics as a foundational tool to build a lot of businesses. And when you ask about constituencies that we serve, it ranges, as Larry mentioned, from providers; payers where we're particularly strong; but also government; pharma, who've we've been servicing a lot of time -- for a long time; and now more recently, consumers and employers. Just to give you a flavor for some ways that they're consuming these analytics, I mean, from a payer and provider standpoint, people have been using our analytics to close gaps in care on a monthly basis. We fire off a $131 billion rule-based decision every month to help close gaps using our tool, like Optum One, which you've heard a lot about. It's really crunching and assessing both clinical and claims data to predict where we're going to see people that need interventions. And those interventions are additive to the tool in how we've extended it in terms of being able to action it, where we can actually go out and prove where we've shown how our interventions intercede in people having strokes, people having heart attacks and what that saves -- not obviously good for the patient but obviously good for the system. Our revenue cycle analytics actively are taking out friction between payers and providers, speeding up payment, driving more accuracy and improving the financial conditions of both payers and providers. So I could go on and provide a lot of examples, but they range from strong financial performance that our analytics drive, to clinical performance, which really drive better outcomes and lower costs."

So the vast majority of our membership is retained membership, membership that we have great experience with.

The growth came from -- pretty evenly across our geographies, so that was very much in line with our expectations. Our new-to-Medicare population, well, it is -- we're seeing actually that population choose Medicare Advantage more often and the percentage is growing there. We see that sequentially. That's our experience. But that, again, is very much in line with our expectation.

So just specifically, a few comments on Amil and the activities we've undertaken. The business remains profitable as it was last year. Similar to last year, it's continued to become more and more competitive in the market. And I'd say the market segments that are most attractive in Brazil and the performance improvement across the business has been substantial. We have put in very strong pricing and cost-containment disciplines. We've improved our service substantially down there, I'd say, to more of a kind of UnitedHealthcare-style service approach but in Brazil. Our Net Promoter Scores in the market continue to advance, and we have a more extensive and better-performing health care delivery company broadly, so I'd characterize that all as a stronger foundation. Obviously, we're still impacted by the devaluation of the real. That affects both our revenues and you can see it there probably best, where in local currency, we have a 16% increase in our revenues, but when you translate it into U.S. dollars, it's a 15% decrease. And I think I'll -- it's obvious that the economy is not particularly strong there. Companies are struggling. Middle class is flat to declining slightly. And obviously the political situation is unsettled, certainly doesn't help things a whole lot. So we are pretty measured in terms of our view about Brazil right at this point in time. We are competitive, like I said, in certain segments, and we are focused on our growth in those segments and we are growing. We do have a fair amount of in-group attrition right now as employment levels decline on an employer-by-employer basis. But we are seeing growth underneath all that, which is very encouraging. I think most important really it relates to Amil is that we've -- not only are we a strong insurance company, but we've created a strong health care delivery company throughout the course of the time that we've owned Amil.

The sustainability of that is -- this is going to be a little bit of a challenge, I think broadly, for companies because it -- what it does is subjects your tax rate or your tax position to more of a period-type cost or some more volatility overall in the expected effective tax rate. And in part because it has to do with the kind of the combination of the performance of your stock and then also the timing of option exercises as well as stock-based plans either vesting and/or becoming available to employees at given points in time. So there'll be a little bit more volatility in the rate. We expect the full year rate to be in the neighborhood of about 41% or so for the full year 2016.

But -- so maybe I could only respond to it kind of in the broadest context. If I were to take some of the national account clients that we're privileged to serve and who have been more progressive adopters of kind of the entire breadth of capabilities that we can bring to them, and then working with them cooperatively, and then working with them in terms of how they are engaging their consumers, if you will, you actually see distinctive performance patterns. And you see them distinctive in terms of, I'd say, 2 dimensions: the better use of the health care resource system resources in total and a year-by-year improvement in the consistency of that pattern of usage; and improvement in their overall health status as they embrace with and get comfortable with programs that are more consumer friendly and easier, and as you suggest, fueled with data analytics that are now really positioned, that they can actually act on them and kind of the whole spectrum of what we were -- been talking about. That some of the things that we are doing and capabilities we're putting in the marketplace on a time -- on a real-time basis, the marketplace is adjusting in terms of, how do I exactly use these? They know directionally how they want to use them. Don't know if they are kind of nuts and bolts to quite that point. But these more progressive clients have had distinctively better cost positions and distinctively better patterns of consumer decisions, resource utilization and health status, wellness. If we can translate that from those venues to the more progressive -- to make them more progressive in other sectors of the marketplace -- and I think about the large government sectors because they have the same attributes as large health employer sponsors. They're sponsoring large populations. They have more influence in how these programs go. Then you begin to get into the water with respect to consumer behavior, and you get into the water with respect to care provider behavior. And those kinds of elements, I think, can actually when you -- can really establish -- the pattern measures can really drive change. And clients are seeing it. States are seeing it. Governments are seeing it. The -- some of Larry's commentary with respect of international is showing some of these patterns to international governments that have, arguably, a different health care system and their response to these things. And then the whole idea that the technology is now capable of doing this at such scale and such speed and doing it down to a mobile expression, whoever uses that mobile expression, whether it's a care provider or a consumer, those things are playing out. So we're in the early stages. The best way to see it is in large national accounts. And then, believe it or not, you can see it in some of the things like Medicaid where you can see large state sponsors, that once they really get these programs in a mature state, are just driving distinctive results relative to the populations they're serving. The next stage is really getting this directly to the consumer, and I think their platforms, like Rally, really represent first generation of a way to actually jump over and really get kind of in the consumer's head using these applications and things like that. And I think this is just the beginning. So that would be my reaction to it. I don't know if we can react in a more granular way. So I thank you for that question."

Beyond the rates, a little color around insurer's fee and the changes to the group benefits. With respect to insurer's fee, to step back a little bit, our goal is to provide predictable and stable benefits to seniors. That's something that we were able to do this year and that's, I think, going to be important in the long run. So as you know, we're in the midst of benefit planning right now and that is going to be one factor that we consider amongst the several other factors in our pursuit of this goal to offer stable benefits and what, as Steve accurately described, at a -- remains an underfunded environment in 2017. So it will be something that we'll consider and build to talk more about after we get through our planning season. In terms of the group -- change in the group benefit, while we're disappointed in that change, it remains, I would say, the value to the retirees. Employers are trying to find solutions for the retiree population, Medicare Advantage remains a very strong value proposition, and we're seeing that actually play out in our pipeline development. And as we look towards 2017, it's one of the strongest in years. So there's a lot of work for us to do in terms of continuing to advocate for seniors on behalf of this very popular and effective program, and we're going to continue to do that. Thanks for the question."

Thank you for joining us today to review our results for first quarter 2016. UnitedHealth Group businesses have steadily strengthened over the last several years and this trend continued in the first quarter of 2016. Our momen",577,"Thank you, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review our results for first quarter 2016. UnitedHealth Group businesses have steadily strengthened over the last several years and this trend continued in the first quarter of 2016. Our momentum is evident in the highest levels of customer and consumer retention in our history combined with new customer acquisitions driving strong revenue gains across the enterprise; growth in the size, scope and diversity of products and services within our client base as well as a number of new customer opportunities we are pursuing; steadily improving metrics for brand and reputation; and steadily rising Net Promoter Scores across our businesses. Customers buy value and expect results and we are sharpening our performance focus, driving the highest quality customer experiences, helping us become the go-to choice, the must-have partner for everyone looking to improve performance in sustainability and health benefits and health services. 
When we combine higher quality from consistent excellent execution with practical innovations at scale, our opportunities to grow and serve continue to expand. Our intensified commitments to quality performance and to growth on the strength of that quality positions UnitedHealth Group to look forward toward what we believe may become our best decade of performance and growth yet.
Turning to the results. We are reporting today our first quarter revenues grew 9% prior to acquisitions and over 24% overall to $44.5 billion with broad strength across the enterprise. In health benefits, medical costs were well managed and controlled as is evident in the consolidated care ratio of 81.7%. Prior year reserves developed favorably by $360 million in the quarter. The medical days claims payable increased 4 days year-over-year to 51 days. Cash flows of $2.3 billion, or 1.4x net income, continued at a strong and reliable pace. First quarter's operating cost ratio decreased 110 basis points year-over-year to 15.2% due to a combination of business mix, technology-driven operational efficiencies and the cumulative overall effects of revenue growth. These efficiency gains were partially offset by continued investments in our businesses. 
Our tax rate reflected early adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation, adding roughly $0.06 per share in the quarter. You should expect that we'll add considerably less in coming quarters due to the natural pattern of equity-based compensation activity for our company. First quarter adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share grew 17% year-over-year, and our full year revenue and per share earnings outlook is strengthening, as Dave Wichmann will describe shortly. 
Since we know exchanges are in the minds of many of you, let me take a quick minute for an update. As you know, we have been evaluating public exchanges on a state-by-state basis. We have maintained a regular public dialogue with you since November about the individual exchange market and how our own experience and performance have been unfavorable for these markets. The smaller overall market size and shorter-term, high-risk profile within this market segment continued to suggest we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustained basis. Next year, we will remain in only a handful of states, and we will not carry financial exposure from exchanges into 2017. We continue to remain an advocate for more stable and sustainable approaches to serving this market and those who rely on it for care. 
With that, I will now ask Larry Renfro to review Optum's exceptional performance, and then Dave to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide UnitedHealth Group's comments. Larry?"

Optum is off to a strong start again this year, consistent with the ambitious plans we shared with you at our investor conference last December. Optum will again grow revenue at more than 20% and earnings from operations at above 30% this y",1156,"Thanks, Steve. Optum is off to a strong start again this year, consistent with the ambitious plans we shared with you at our investor conference last December. Optum will again grow revenue at more than 20% and earnings from operations at above 30% this year. We continue to estimate Optum will contribute 42% or more of enterprise-wide operating earnings this year, even considering our ongoing investments to support the future growth of this young business. 
Optum's performance reflects the large-scale opportunities we are pursuing and the tremendous efforts our 100,000 employees make to deliver differentiated services and capabilities to those seeking to solve complex challenges across the health care system. Our first quarter revenues of $19.7 billion grew 54% year-over-year or 11% prior to acquisitions. OptumRx revenues grew 72% to $14.3 billion while OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to $5.7 billion, which is growth of 21% over the first quarter of 2015. Our first quarter operating margin of 5.6% includes the continuing increase of pharmacy care revenues as you have seen in the past 2 quarters. Overall, Optum produced $1.1 billion in earnings from operations. 
As you may know, we identified 5 drivers for Optum's growth over the next 5 years. They are pharmacy care services, care delivery, technology, government services and international. Last quarter, we spent some time on a more detailed review of care delivery. Today, we will focus on pharmacy care services then follow up briefly with data analytics. 
Pharmacy care services is a high priority area for us. This focus goes back some 5 years to the original decision to undertake the largest and arguably, most complex business insourcing ever attempted. It required significant investments, precise execution and flawless delivery. As you know now, it has been a real success. 
Last year, we took another step. Our combination with Catamaran led by Mark Thierer, who now heads our entire OptumRx platform and serves as a senior member of our overall Optum leadership team. This combination was a significant advance in scale. And today, the business is running at over 1 billion scripts annually, up from 350 million in 2012. Eight months in, the greatly expanded OptumRx is advancing a meaningful differentiated solutions for clients in the marketplace with distinctive capabilities around patient-centered data analytics; new capabilities in specialty pharmacy, such as home infusion; and workplace-related resources. Since we came together, our retention rates have persisted in the high 90s, and we are building our largest ever pipeline of opportunities. 
We were pleased this quarter to announce an innovative partnership with Walgreens, to which we are creating a 90-day, at-retail pharmacy offering. This is all about meeting consumers where and when they want, whether that means home delivery or walking into the local Walgreens store. Together, we will provide choice and cost savings to our clients as we work and benefit together in a meaningful, more collaborative way. We are enthusiastic about the potential of the extension of our relationship with Walgreens, the largest retail pharmacy in the U.S. Overall, this year, we expect OptumRx to generate more than $58 billion in revenues and manage nearly $80 billion in pharmacy spend for our customers, including $30 billion in specialty drug spending. 
Pharmaceutical spending comprises 12% to 15% of the overall cost of health benefits. It has been the traditional focus of the pharmacy benefits industry. We find that focus much too limiting when it comes to improving health and health care overall. The impact that OptumRx has on health care and its cost has the potential to be profoundly broader and deeper. Here, you have the most frequent consumer touch point in all of health care, one that provides great visibility into the full health care continuum. 
An individual's engagement with OptumRx becomes more impactful when we break out of the one-dimensional procurement and formulary arbitrage model of today and open up to providing consumers integrated medical and pharmaceutical services. In the process, we help reduce unnecessary overall systems utilization, including ER visits, hospital admissions and readmissions; and provide more effective and timely interventions to improve adherence and health outcomes. That's the value proposition of the future we are focused on. Employers using our integrated and technology-enabled approach can save in excess of $120 per member per year across their combined medical benefit.
In summary, our objective for the impact of this business goes far beyond traditional pharmaceutical management, to where the potential to influence both the consumer and the health system for the better is much greater. That is why pharmacy care services are core to our growth and value story over the next decade. 
Optum also is delivering differentiated value from our work inside the health system. A second core to our growth are unrivaled existing capabilities in health care data science and analytics. Companies new to this space are excited about the potential that someday these forces will evolve health care into a new age. Well, for Optum's customers, that someday is today. We are meeting their critical needs right now. We are the leader in using advanced technology and predictive analytics to connect stakeholders across the care continuum with the insights to better manage the health of populations and the resources they depend on. 
Our continuously updated, integrated and curated clinical and claims data asset comprises more than 80 million lives of robust clinical data and 170 million lives of claims data we can see from both sides. Beyond the 250 million clinical administrative lives, our diverse and comprehensive data set includes 8 billion lab results, 4 billion determinations and 3 billion medical procedures. We can provide a real-time clinical and financial picture that is fully integrated and spans years of longitudinal detail. Our health data resources continue to grow securely and responsibly every day. 
Today, our analytics products are helping thousands of care providers, and ultimately the millions of consumers they serve, translate data into action and action into better medical outcomes. Today, not someday, we help our customers step up from reacting to challenges to designing and implementing actions that reliably lead to better health delivered at lower cost. Today we are delivering the wealth of information, analysis and positive benefits of Big Data with results that include double-digit improvements in critical performance factors, like utilization and chronic disease control, which in turn empower care providers to adopt and succeed in new models of care and related new revenue streams.
Today, we lead the way in implementing predictive analytics in health care because health care is all that we do. Health care technology and data analytics have been our specialized focus for years. So while others learn to crunch large amounts of static data, Optum is fully integrated into the live flow of health care transactions, enabling us to provide up-to-date, useful information that makes the health care system more intelligent and enables it to act that way. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."
104673,328875980,959530,"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","UnitedHealth Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Larry.

Strong new customer growth and historically high retention levels reflect the competitive value UnitedHealthcare offers in the marketplace. Quarter by quarter and year by year, we continue to gain new customers and retain valuable established customers, who choose the combination of our more engaging consumer experience, distinctive service, product innovation and integrated clinical and network value. People using our modern consumer-based benefit designs are supported by actionable information available at their fingertips, enabled and delivered by advanced analytic capabilities, as Larry just described, increasingly channeled through consumer and care-provider-friendly mobile technologies. 
Employers continue to be drawn to well-managed, competitive cost trends; physician and consumer engagement and value-based arrangements for care delivery. We partner with our largest customers to benchmark performance and design customized plans to help them advance year by year along the continuum of ever-improving benefit performance and heightened consumer engagement. And we are serving individual patients and overall populations with more complex medical conditions. Our coordination of services and ability to close gaps in care significantly increase the value we bring to consumers and customers. Simply put, the greater the level of patient needs, the more we can help. 
As a result, we continue to deliver exceptional organic growth. Our U.S.-based benefits businesses grew organically to serve 1.3 million more people with medical benefits in the first quarter, and that brought organic growth to 2 million people in the past year. Looking at commercial markets, we are up about 700,000 people in the quarter and 1 million people since March 2015. First quarter 2016 delivered diversified growth across self-funded national accounts, public sector, small group, middle-market businesses and individual. 
Turning to exchanges. As we expected when we spoke with you in January, we grew roughly 300,000 lives through the first quarter and served 795,000 people on public exchanges as of March 31. We expect that level to decline to around 650,000 by December. Through this first quarter, we have seen no change in our estimates of cost from the 2015 exchange period. This quarter, with the majority of our 2016 exchange members new to us, we have been appropriately cautious in our reserve estimates, reflecting an additional 125 million in full year 2016 exchange losses. These were fully absorbed in this quarter and fully considered for the year in our guidance range, and as Steve mentioned, we do not anticipate financial exposure to exchanges in 2017.
In Medicare, the value of our Medicare Advantage offerings continue to resonate, differentiated by the stability of our benefits, networks, membership and distribution systems. We offer seniors clear value and a consistent modern consumer experience, all of which drive new growth as well as strong consumer retention. This strength is reflected in our first quarter membership growth of about 300,000 seniors. 
Medicare is a consumer business, with seniors receiving a variety of outreach approaches focused on better and more distinct -- and more consistent care, such as receiving home visits and benefiting from our personalized, compassionate and education-focused consumer service. In 2015, we helped closed 9 million gaps in care for seniors we serve, and we expect nearly 65% of our members to be in a 4-star plan by 2017, with further improvement in that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more. 
We believe our Medicare prescription drug benefit business will be much better positioned for 2017. We pulled back in a number of markets this year to reposition products and added membership in the new product potential via modest acquisition in the first quarter. 
Our Part D membership decreased 70,000 people in the first quarter and should decline by another 200,000 or so by year-end. This suggests we will serve 4.7 million to 4.8 million people by year-end 2016, considerably better than what we projected last December, and we expect to return to growth in Medicare Part D in 2017. 
Switching to Medicaid. Managed care services -- Managed Care serves as the most effective, proven tool to ensure budget sustainability for state Medicaid programs. This financial predictability, along with the ability of Managed Care to expedite systems transformation, comprehensively integrating care while addressing social determinants, has resulted in an unprecedented level of procurement activity. Of special note is the significant increase in the volume of opportunities for populations with more complex needs, such as people served by long-term services and support programs. The recent award of Nebraska's integrated health, behavioral and pharmaceutical model reinforces these expected trends in procurement to include more populations with more complex needs and to look to integrated solution to address states' needs. Our expectation for continued expansion of opportunities to serve all Medicaid populations was reinforced by our recent award in 2 California counties and across our Community & State business, the addition of 145,000 people in the first quarter. 
Let me now touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Building on the strength of our first quarter, we expect full year revenues of approximately $182 billion, up from our prior outlook of $180 billion to $181 billion, led by strength in OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual. First -- strong first quarter results combined with a slightly lower tax rate for the balance of the year and the impact of recently completed acquisitions, allows us to increase our outlook for adjusted net earnings by $0.15 to a range of $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We continue to foresee cash flows approaching $10 billion. 
As you know, we expect Optum to grow full year operating earnings by more than 30% in 2016. We continue to expect seasonality to be a factor in our overall earnings results. Similar to years past, Optum expects to generate in the area of 60% of its operating earnings in the second half of the year, while the current consensus view appears to be modestly more first-half biased. Taken together, this suggests that updates for full year UnitedHealth Group earnings per share estimates, after recognition of our first quarter performance, would most appropriately be focused on the second half of this year. 
Turning to capital. We closed the quarter with a strong balance sheet. We expect share repurchase activity to be more pronounced in the first half of this year with the second half focused on debt reduction toward targeted levels, and we will see our dividend levels -- and we will address our dividend levels at our June board meeting as we do each year.

So in January, we described an expected combined loss for both the 2015 and 2016 policy years of $1 billion. Inside that, the 2015 policy or loss was $475 million. And that number, as Dave mentioned, remains unchanged. Obviously, the balance related to the 2016 policy year, so at that point, it was estimated at $525 million. Today, we are updating our full year outlook for the 2016 policy year to a loss of $650 million. So that $125 million increase was fully recognized in our first quarter financials. And not surprisingly, our PDR, as you asked, did increase over the course of the first quarter. As we look at it, our enrollment is very much in keeping with our expectation at that 795,000 lives on the exchange specifically. And I'll tell you that well over half of that enrollment is new to us this year. So as we look at it, the early indications on the health status of the members appears to be a little bit worse.

The prior year reserve development in the first quarter of 2016 advanced explicitly by about $220 million or so. And that -- on a comparative quarter basis, that influenced our MLR favorably in the quarter as well as our EPS as well. The development, while I won't get into the specifics of how that's broken out by line of business, it was pretty broad reaching across all of our lines of business and really is reflective of what we experienced in the fourth quarter as well, which is the delayed realization of affordability efforts and end-market initiatives that we pursued in UnitedHealthcare in the back half of 2015. So we're very pleased with how our trends are developing, consistent with the forecast that we provided you before. And obviously, this is a favorable development in the quarter."

Some of the areas, not surprisingly, we've talked to you about at length in the past, our focus on inpatient management is ever present. 2015 marked our seventh consecutive year of absolute reductions in both admissions and bed days on a per capita basis, and that's true across all of our lines of business. But we also extend that work into other areas with particular focus around outpatient, because it's one of the bigger drivers of costs, and making sure that we're driving care to the most appropriate setting and, likewise, looking at it on a network spend.

If you look at our history, we got decades of experience really using analytics as a foundational tool to build a lot of businesses. And when you ask about constituencies that we serve, it ranges, as Larry mentioned, from providers; payers where we're particularly strong; but also government; pharma, who we've been servicing a lot of time -- for a long time; and now more recently, consumers and employers. Just to give you a flavor for some ways that they're consuming these analytics, I mean, from a payer and provider standpoint, people have been using our analytics to close gaps in care on a monthly basis. We fire off a $131 billion rule-based decision every month to help close gaps using our tool, like Optum One, which you've heard a lot about. It's really crunching and assessing both clinical and claims data to predict where we're going to see people that need interventions. And those interventions are additive to the tool in how we've extended it in terms of being able to action it, where we can actually go out and prove where we've shown how our interventions intercede in people having strokes, people having heart attacks and what that saves -- not obviously good for the patient but obviously good for the system. Our revenue cycle analytics actively are taking out friction between payers and providers, speeding up payment, driving more accuracy and improving the financial conditions of both payers and providers. So I could go on and provide a lot of examples, but they range from strong financial performance that our analytics drive, to clinical performance, which really drive better outcomes and lower costs."

So the vast majority of our membership is retained membership, membership that we have great experience with. But in terms of the mix across -- and the different categories that I would think about in describing our mix is around geography, which is very broad-based. The growth came from -- pretty evenly across our geographies, so that was very much in line with our expectations. Our new-to-Medicare population, well, it is -- we're seeing actually that population choose Medicare Advantage more often and the percentage is growing there. And we see that sequentially. That's our experience. But that, again, is very much in line with our expectation.

So just specifically, a few comments on Amil and the activities we've undertaken. The business remains profitable as it was last year. Similar to last year, it's continued to become more and more competitive in the market. And I'd say the market segments that are most attractive in Brazil and the performance improvement across the business has been substantial. We have put in very strong pricing and cost-containment disciplines. We've improved our service substantially down there, I'd say, to more of a kind of UnitedHealthcare-style service approach but in Brazil. Our Net Promoter Scores in the market continue to advance, and we have a more extensive and better-performing health care delivery company broadly, so I'd characterize that all as a stronger foundation. Obviously, we're still impacted by the devaluation of the real. That affects both our revenues and you can see it there probably best, where in local currency, we have a 16% increase in our revenues, but when you translate it into U.S. dollars, it's a 15% decrease. And I think I'll -- it's obvious that the economy is not particularly strong there. Companies are struggling. Middle class is flat to declining slightly. And obviously the political situation is unsettled, certainly doesn't help things a whole lot. So we are pretty measured in terms of our view about Brazil right at this point in time. We are competitive, like I said, in certain segments, and we are focused on our growth in those segments and we are growing. We do have a fair amount of in-group attrition right now as employment levels decline on an employer-by-employer basis. But we are seeing growth underneath all that, which is very encouraging. I think most important really as it relates to Amil is that we've -- not only are we a strong insurance company, but we've created a strong health care delivery company throughout the course of the time that we've owned Amil. And we see that as very positive positioning in that market and a meaningful source of our overall performance advance expectations here in 2016."

So thanks for your question. The tax rate change is really because there was a new accounting pronouncement that came out in March, which we think has a $0.10 impact on the full year, of which we recognize $0.06 in the first quarter. The pronouncement wasn't required to be adopted until 1/1/17. But as is often the case, if we're prepared to adopt, we go ahead and adopt early as allowed by the pronouncement. The sustainability of that is -- this is going to be a little bit of a challenge, I think broadly, for companies because it -- what it does is subjects your tax rate or your tax position to more of a period-type cost or some more volatility overall in the expected effective tax rate. And in part because it has to do with the kind of the combination of the performance of your stock and then also the timing of option exercises as well as stock-based plans either vesting and/or becoming available to employees at given points in time. So there'll be a little bit more volatility in the rate. We expect the full year rate to be in the neighborhood of about 41% or so for the full year 2016. And we'd expect on -- that at least this impact, if you will, of the new accounting pronouncement to be pretty consistent year after year, depending upon again, how the stock price performs as well as the vesting activity underlying our equity-based plans."

But -- so maybe I could only respond to it kind of in the broadest context. If I were to take some of the national account clients that we're privileged to serve and who have been more progressive adopters of kind of the entire breadth of capabilities that we can bring to them, and then working with them cooperatively, and then working with them in terms of how they are engaging their consumers, if you will, you actually see distinctive performance patterns. And you see them distinctive in terms of, I'd say, 2 dimensions: the better use of the health care resource system resources in total and a year-by-year improvement in the consistency of that pattern of usage; and improvement in their overall health status as they embrace with and get comfortable with programs that are more consumer friendly and easier, and as you suggest, fueled with data analytics that are now really positioned, that they can actually act on them and kind of the whole spectrum of what we were -- been talking about. That some of the things that we are doing and capabilities we're putting in the marketplace on a time -- on a real-time basis, the marketplace is adjusting in terms of, how do I exactly use these? They know directionally how they want to use them. Don't know if they are kind of nuts and bolts to quite that point. But these more progressive clients have had distinctively better cost positions and distinctively better patterns of consumer decisions, resource utilization and health status, wellness. If we can translate that from those venues to the more progressive -- to make them more progressive in other sectors of the marketplace -- and I think about the large government sectors because they have the same attributes as large health employer sponsors. They're sponsoring large populations. They have more influence in how these programs go. Then you begin to get into the water with respect to consumer behavior, and you get into the water with respect to care provider behavior. And those kinds of elements, I think, can actually when you -- can really establish -- the pattern measures can really drive change. And clients are seeing it. States are seeing it. Governments are seeing it. The -- some of Larry's commentary with respect of international is showing some of these patterns to international governments that have, arguably, a different health care system and their response to these things. And then the whole idea that the technology is now capable of doing this at such scale and such speed and doing it down to a mobile expression, whoever uses that mobile expression, whether it's a care provider or a consumer, those things are playing out. So we're in the early stages. The best way to see it is in the large national accounts. And then, believe it or not, you can see it in some of the things like Medicaid where you can see large state sponsors, that once they really get these programs in a mature state, are just driving distinctive results relative to the populations they're serving. The next stage is really getting this directly to the consumer, and I think their platforms, like Rally, really represent first generation of a way to actually jump over and really get kind of in the consumer's head using these applications and things like that. And I think this is just the beginning. So that would be my reaction to it. I don't know if we can react in a more granular way. So I thank you for that question."

So it will be something that we'll consider and build to talk more about after we get through our planning season. In terms of the group -- change in the group benefit, while we're disappointed in that change, it remains, I would say, the value to the retirees. Employers are trying to find solutions for the retiree population, Medicare Advantage remains a very strong value proposition, and we're seeing that actually play out in our pipeline development. And as we look towards 2017, it's one of the strongest in years. So there's a lot of work for us to do in terms of continuing to advocate for seniors on behalf of this very popular and effective program, and we're going to continue to do that. Thanks for the question."

Thank you for joining us today to review our results for first quarter 2016. UnitedHealth Group businesses have steadily strengthened over the last several years and this trend continued in the first quarter of 2016. Our momen",577,"Thank you, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review our results for first quarter 2016. UnitedHealth Group businesses have steadily strengthened over the last several years and this trend continued in the first quarter of 2016. Our momentum is evident in the highest levels of customer and consumer retention in our history combined with new customer acquisitions driving strong revenue gains across the enterprise; growth in the size, scope and diversity of products and services within our client base as well as a number of new customer opportunities we are pursuing; steadily improving metrics for brand and reputation; and steadily rising Net Promoter Scores across our businesses. Customers buy value and expect results and we are sharpening our performance focus, driving the highest quality customer experiences, helping us become the go-to choice, the must-have partner for everyone looking to improve performance in sustainability and health benefits and health services. 
When we combine higher quality from consistent excellent execution with practical innovations at scale, our opportunities to grow and serve continue to expand. Our intensified commitments to quality performance and to growth on the strength of that quality positions UnitedHealth Group to look forward toward what we believe may become our best decade of performance and growth yet.
Turning to the results. We are reporting today our first quarter revenues grew 9% prior to acquisitions and over 24% overall to $44.5 billion with broad strength across the enterprise. In health benefits, medical costs were well managed and controlled as is evident in the consolidated care ratio of 81.7%. Prior year reserves developed favorably by $360 million in the quarter. The medical days claims payable increased 4 days year-over-year to 51 days. Cash flows of $2.3 billion, or 1.4x net income, continued at a strong and reliable pace. First quarter's operating cost ratio decreased 110 basis points year-over-year to 15.2% due to a combination of business mix, technology-driven operational efficiencies and the cumulative overall effects of revenue growth. These efficiency gains were partially offset by continued investments in our businesses. 
Our tax rate reflected early adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation, adding roughly $0.06 per share in the quarter. You should expect that we'll add considerably less in coming quarters due to the natural pattern of equity-based compensation activity for our company. First quarter adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share grew 17% year-over-year, and our full year revenue and per share earnings outlook is strengthening, as Dave Wichmann will describe shortly. 
Since we know exchanges are in the minds of many of you, let me take a quick minute for an update. As you know, we have been evaluating public exchanges on a state-by-state basis. We have maintained a regular public dialogue with you since November about the individual exchange market and how our own experience and performance have been unfavorable for these markets. The smaller overall market size and shorter-term, high-risk profile within this market segment continued to suggest we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustained basis. Next year, we will remain in only a handful of states, and we will not carry financial exposure from exchanges into 2017. We continue to remain an advocate for more stable and sustainable approaches to serving this market and those who rely on it for care. 
With that, I will now ask Larry Renfro to review Optum's exceptional performance, and then Dave to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide UnitedHealth Group's comments. Larry?"

Optum is off to a strong start again this year, consistent with the ambitious plans we shared with you at our investor conference last December.

Optum is off to a strong start again this year, consistent with the ambitious plans we shared with you at our investor conference last December. Optum will again grow revenue at more than 20% and earnings from operations at above 30% this year. We continue to estimate Optum will contribute 42% or more of enterprise-wide operating earnings this year, even considering our ongoing investments to support the future growth of this young business. 
Optum's performance reflects the large-scale opportunities we are pursuing and the tremendous efforts our 100,000 employees make to deliver differentiated services and capabilities to those seeking to solve complex challenges across the health care system. Our first quarter revenues of $19.7 billion grew 54% year-over-year or 11% prior to acquisitions. OptumRx revenues grew 72% to $14.3 billion while OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to $5.7 billion, which is growth of 21% over the first quarter of 2015. Our first quarter operating margin of 5.6% includes the continuing increase of pharmacy care revenues as you have seen in the past 2 quarters. Overall, Optum produced $1.1 billion in earnings from operations. 
As you may know, we identified 5 drivers for Optum's growth over the next 5 years. They are pharmacy care services, care delivery, technology, government services and international. Last quarter, we spent some time on a more detailed review of care delivery. Today, we will focus on pharmacy care services then follow up briefly with data analytics. 
Pharmacy care services is a high priority area for us. This focus goes back some 5 years to the original decision to undertake the largest and arguably, most complex business insourcing ever attempted. It required significant investments, precise execution and flawless delivery. As you know now, it has been a real success. 
Last year, we took another step. Our combination with Catamaran led by Mark Thierer, who now heads our entire OptumRx platform and serves as a senior member of our overall Optum leadership team. This combination was a significant advance in scale. And today, the business is running at over 1 billion scripts annually, up from 350 million in 2012. Eight months in, the greatly expanded OptumRx is advancing a meaningful differentiated solutions for clients in the marketplace with distinctive capabilities around patient-centered data analytics; new capabilities in specialty pharmacy, such as home infusion; and workplace-related resources. Since we came together, our retention rates have persisted in the high 90s, and we are building our largest ever pipeline of opportunities. 
We were pleased this quarter to announce an innovative partnership with Walgreens, to which we are creating a 90-day, at-retail pharmacy offering. This is all about meeting consumers where and when they want, whether that means home delivery or walking into the local Walgreens store. Together, we will provide choice and cost savings to our clients as we work and benefit together in a meaningful, more collaborative way. We are enthusiastic about the potential of the extension of our relationship with Walgreens, the largest retail pharmacy in the U.S. Overall, this year, we expect OptumRx to generate more than $58 billion in revenues and manage nearly $80 billion in pharmacy spend for our customers, including $30 billion in specialty drug spending. 
Pharmaceutical spending comprises 12% to 15% of the overall cost of health benefits. It has been the traditional focus of the pharmacy benefits industry. We find that focus much too limiting when it comes to improving health and health care overall. The impact that OptumRx has on health care and its cost has the potential to be profoundly broader and deeper. Here, you have the most frequent consumer touch point in all of health care, one that provides great visibility into the full health care continuum. 
An individual's engagement with OptumRx becomes more impactful when we break out of the one-dimensional procurement and formulary arbitrage model of today and open up to providing consumers integrated medical and pharmaceutical services. In the process, we help reduce unnecessary overall systems utilization, including ER visits, hospital admissions and readmissions; and provide more effective and timely interventions to improve adherence and health outcomes. That's the value proposition of the future we are focused on. Employers using our integrated and technology-enabled approach can save in excess of $120 per member per year across their combined medical benefit.
In summary, our objective for the impact of this business goes far beyond traditional pharmaceutical management, to where the potential to influence both the consumer and the health system for the better is much greater. That is why pharmacy care services are core to our growth and value story over the next decade. 
Optum also is delivering differentiated value from our work inside the health system. A second core to our growth are unrivaled existing capabilities in health care data science and analytics. Companies new to this space are excited about the potential that someday these forces will evolve health care into a new age. Well, for Optum's customers, that someday is today. We are meeting their critical needs right now. We are the leader in using advanced technology and predictive analytics to connect stakeholders across the care continuum with the insights to better manage the health of populations and the resources they depend on. 
Our continuously updated, integrated and curated clinical and claims data asset comprises more than 80 million lives of robust clinical data and 170 million lives of claims data we can see from both sides. Beyond the 250 million clinical administrative lives, our diverse and comprehensive data set includes 8 billion lab results, 4 billion determinations and 3 billion medical procedures. We can provide a real-time clinical and financial picture that is fully integrated and spans years of longitudinal detail. Our health data resources continue to grow securely and responsibly every day. 
Today, our analytics products are helping thousands of care providers, and ultimately the millions of consumers they serve, translate data into action and action into better medical outcomes. Today, not someday, we help our customers step up from reacting to challenges to designing and implementing actions that reliably lead to better health delivered at lower cost. Today we are delivering the wealth of information, analysis and positive benefits of Big Data with results that include double-digit improvements in critical performance factors, like utilization and chronic disease control, which in turn empower care providers to adopt and succeed in new models of care and related new revenue streams.
Today, we lead the way in implementing predictive analytics in health care because health care is all that we do. Health care technology and data analytics have been our specialized focus for years. So while others learn to crunch large amounts of static data, Optum is fully integrated into the live flow of health care transactions, enabling us to provide up-to-date, useful information that makes the health care system more intelligent and enables it to act that way. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."

Strong new customer growth and historically high retention levels reflect the competitive value UnitedHealthcare offers in the marketplace. Quarter by quarter and year by year, we continue to gain new customers and retain valuable established customers, who choose the combination of our more engaging consumer experience, distinctive service, product innovation and integrated clinical and network value. People using our modern consumer-based benefit designs are supported by actionable information available at their fingertips, enabled and delivered by advanced analytic capabilities, as Larry just described, increasingly channeled through consumer and care-provider-friendly mobile technologies. 
Employers continue to be drawn to well-managed, competitive cost trends; physician and consumer engagement and value-based arrangements for care delivery. We partner with our largest customers to benchmark performance and design customized plans to help them advance year by year along the continuum of ever-improving benefit performance and heightened consumer engagement. And we are serving individual patients and overall populations with more complex medical conditions. Our coordination of services and ability to close gaps in care significantly increase the value we bring to consumers and customers. Simply put, the greater the level of patient needs, the more we can help. 
As a result, we continue to deliver exceptional organic growth. Our U.S.-based benefits businesses grew organically to serve 1.3 million more people with medical benefits in the first quarter, and that brought organic growth to 2 million people in the past year. Looking at commercial markets, we are up about 700,000 people in the quarter and 1 million people since March 2015. First quarter 2016 delivered diversified growth across self-funded national accounts, public sector, small group, middle-market businesses and individual. 
Turning to exchanges. As we expected when we spoke with you in January, we grew roughly 300,000 lives through the first quarter and served 795,000 people on public exchanges as of March 31. We expect that level to decline to around 650,000 by December. Through this first quarter, we have seen no change in our estimates of cost from the 2015 exchange period. This quarter, with the majority of our 2016 exchange members new to us, we have been appropriately cautious in our reserve estimates, reflecting an additional 125 million in full year 2016 exchange losses. These were fully absorbed in this quarter and fully considered for the year in our guidance range, and as Steve mentioned, we do not anticipate financial exposure to exchanges in 2017.
In Medicare, the value of our Medicare Advantage offerings continue to resonate, differentiated by the stability of our benefits, networks, membership and distribution systems. We offer seniors clear value and a consistent modern consumer experience, all of which drive new growth as well as strong consumer retention. This strength is reflected in our first quarter membership growth of about 300,000 seniors. 
Medicare is a consumer business, with seniors receiving a variety of outreach approaches focused on better and more distinct -- and more consistent care, such as receiving home visits and benefiting from our personalized, compassionate and education-focused consumer service. In 2015, we helped closed 9 million gaps in care for seniors we serve, and we expect nearly 65% of our members to be in a 4-star plan by 2017, with further improvement in that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more. 
We believe our Medicare prescription drug benefit business will be much better positioned for 2017. We pulled back in a number of markets this year to reposition products and added membership in the new product potential via modest acquisition in the first quarter. 
Our Part D membership decreased 70,000 people in the first quarter and should decline by another 200,000 or so by year-end. This suggests we will serve 4.7 million to 4.8 million people by year-end 2016, considerably better than what we projected last December, and we expect to return to growth in Medicare Part D in 2017. 
Switching to Medicaid. Managed care services -- Managed Care serves as the most effective, proven tool to ensure budget sustainability for state Medicaid programs. This financial predictability, along with the ability of Managed Care to expedite systems transformation, comprehensively integrating care while addressing social determinants, has resulted in an unprecedented level of procurement activity. Of special note is the significant increase in the volume of opportunities for populations with more complex needs, such as people served by long-term services and support programs. The recent award of Nebraska's integrated health, behavioral and pharmaceutical model reinforces these expected trends in procurement to include more populations with more complex needs and to look to integrated solution to address states' needs. Our expectation for continued expansion of opportunities to serve all Medicaid populations was reinforced by our recent award in 2 California counties and across our Community & State business, the addition of 145,000 people in the first quarter. 
Let me now touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Building on the strength of our first quarter, we expect full year revenues of approximately $182 billion, up from our prior outlook of $180 billion to $181 billion, led by strength in OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual. First -- strong first quarter results combined with a slightly lower tax rate for the balance of the year and the impact of recently completed acquisitions, allows us to increase our outlook for adjusted net earnings by $0.15 to a range of $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We continue to foresee cash flows approaching $10 billion. 
As you know, we expect Optum to grow full year operating earnings by more than 30% in 2016. We continue to expect seasonality to be a factor in our overall earnings results. Similar to years past, Optum expects to generate in the area of 60% of its operating earnings in the second half of the year, while the current consensus view appears to be modestly more first-half biased. Taken together, this suggests that updates for full year UnitedHealth Group earnings per share estimates, after recognition of our first quarter performance, would most appropriately be focused on the second half of this year. 
Turning to capital. We closed the quarter with a strong balance sheet. We expect share repurchase activity to be more pronounced in the first half of this year with the second half focused on debt reduction toward targeted levels, and we will see our dividend levels -- and we will address our dividend levels at our June board meeting as we do each year.

So in January, we described an expected combined loss for both the 2015 and 2016 policy years of $1 billion. Inside that, the 2015 policy or loss was $475 million. And that number, as Dave mentioned, remains unchanged. Obviously, the balance related to the 2016 policy year, so at that point, it was estimated at $525 million. Today, we are updating our full year outlook for the 2016 policy year to a loss of $650 million. So that $125 million increase was fully recognized in our first quarter financials. And not surprisingly, our PDR, as you asked, did increase over the course of the first quarter. As we look at it, our enrollment is very much in keeping with our expectation at that 795,000 lives on the exchange specifically. And I'll tell you that well over half of that enrollment is new to us this year. So as we look at it, the early indications on the health status of the members appears to be a little bit worse. So we are being appropriately cautious in updating our full year outlook and recognizing that additional $125 million in the first quarter financial results. In the month of June, importantly, we will have a first indication of how our risks scores actually compare to the industry, and we will look forward to updating you further at that time with regard to our individual ACA business."

Some of the areas, not surprisingly, we've talked to you about at length in the past, our focus on inpatient management is ever present. 2015 marked our seventh consecutive year of absolute reductions in both admissions and bed days on a per capita basis, and that's true across all of our lines of business. But we also extend that work into other areas with particular focus around outpatient, because it's one of the bigger drivers of costs, and making sure that we're driving care to the most appropriate setting and, likewise, looking at it on a network spend. So there's some context, Matt, on some of the things that we're looking at.

If you look at our history, we got decades of experience really using analytics as a foundational tool to build a lot of businesses. And when you ask about constituencies that we serve, it ranges, as Larry mentioned, from providers; payers where we're particularly strong; but also government; pharma, who we've been servicing a lot of time -- for a long time; and now more recently, consumers and employers. Just to give you a flavor for some ways that they're consuming these analytics, I mean, from a payer and provider standpoint, people have been using our analytics to close gaps in care on a monthly basis. We fire off a $131 billion rule-based decision every month to help close gaps using our tool, like Optum One, which you've heard a lot about. It's really crunching and assessing both clinical and claims data to predict where we're going to see people that need interventions. And those interventions are additive to the tool in how we've extended it in terms of being able to action it, where we can actually go out and prove where we've shown how our interventions intercede in people having strokes, people having heart attacks and what that saves -- not obviously good for the patient but obviously good for the system. Our revenue cycle analytics actively are taking out friction between payers and providers, speeding up payment, driving more accuracy and improving the financial conditions of both payers and providers. So I could go on and provide a lot of examples, but they range from strong financial performance that our analytics drive, to clinical performance, which really drive better outcomes and lower costs."

And then innovations in our member experience have all led to not only strong sales, but it's important to note, strong retention as well. So the vast majority of our membership is retained membership, membership that we have great experience with. But in terms of the mix across -- and the different categories that I would think about in describing our mix is around geography, which is very broad-based. The growth came from -- pretty evenly across our geographies, so that was very much in line with our expectations. Our new-to-Medicare population, well, it is -- we're seeing actually that population choose Medicare Advantage more often and the percentage is growing there. And we see that sequentially. That's our experience. But that, again, is very much in line with our expectation. And then the new-to-us category, which -- folks that have disenrolled in other plans and enrolled in one of our plans again, is very much in line with our expectations.

So just specifically, a few comments on Amil and the activities we've undertaken. The business remains profitable as it was last year. Similar to last year, it's continued to become more and more competitive in the market. And I'd say the market segments that are most attractive in Brazil and the performance improvement across the business has been substantial. We have put in very strong pricing and cost-containment disciplines. We've improved our service substantially down there, I'd say, to more of a kind of UnitedHealthcare-style service approach but in Brazil. Our Net Promoter Scores in the market continue to advance, and we have a more extensive and better-performing health care delivery company broadly, so I'd characterize that all as a stronger foundation. Obviously, we're still impacted by the devaluation of the real. That affects both our revenues and you can see it there probably best, where in local currency, we have a 16% increase in our revenues, but when you translate it into U.S. dollars, it's a 15% decrease. And I think I'll -- it's obvious that the economy is not particularly strong there. Companies are struggling. Middle class is flat to declining slightly. And obviously the political situation is unsettled, certainly doesn't help things a whole lot. So we are pretty measured in terms of our view about Brazil right at this point in time. We are competitive, like I said, in certain segments, and we are focused on our growth in those segments and we are growing. We do have a fair amount of in-group attrition right now as employment levels decline on an employer-by-employer basis. But we are seeing growth underneath all that, which is very encouraging. I think most important really as it relates to Amil is that we've -- not only are we a strong insurance company, but we've created a strong health care delivery company throughout the course of the time that we've owned Amil. And we see that as very positive positioning in that market and a meaningful source of our overall performance advance expectations here in 2016."

We also see interest in the -- still in the international markets, although our activities there have dampened just a bit given the -- how those global markets are performing overall. And of course, we still have interest kind of broadly across our business. We haven't done much in the health plan space in quite some time because of all the work that we've done over the course of the last 2 decades to establish strong market presence and -- as well as strong presence in each: Medicare, commercial and Medicaid. But certainly, we would continue to consider those things in the future.

So thanks for your question. The tax rate change is really because there was a new accounting pronouncement that came out in March, which we think has a $0.10 impact on the full year, of which we recognize $0.06 in the first quarter. The pronouncement wasn't required to be adopted until 1/1/17. But as is often the case, if we're prepared to adopt, we go ahead and adopt early as allowed by the pronouncement. The sustainability of that is -- this is going to be a little bit of a challenge, I think broadly, for companies because it -- what it does is subjects your tax rate or your tax position to more of a period-type cost or some more volatility overall in the expected effective tax rate. And in part because it has to do with the kind of the combination of the performance of your stock and then also the timing of option exercises as well as stock-based plans either vesting and/or becoming available to employees at given points in time. So there'll be a little bit more volatility in the rate. We expect the full year rate to be in the neighborhood of about 41% or so for the full year 2016. And we'd expect on -- that at least this impact, if you will, of the new accounting pronouncement to be pretty consistent year after year, depending upon again, how the stock price performs as well as the vesting activity underlying our equity-based plans."

But -- so maybe I could only respond to it kind of in the broadest context. If I were to take some of the national account clients that we're privileged to serve and who have been more progressive adopters of kind of the entire breadth of capabilities that we can bring to them, and then working with them cooperatively, and then working with them in terms of how they are engaging their consumers, if you will, you actually see distinctive performance patterns. And you see them distinctive in terms of, I'd say, 2 dimensions: the better use of the health care resource system resources in total and a year-by-year improvement in the consistency of that pattern of usage; and improvement in their overall health status as they embrace with and get comfortable with programs that are more consumer friendly and easier, and as you suggest, fueled with data analytics that are now really positioned, that they can actually act on them and kind of the whole spectrum of what we were -- been talking about. That some of the things that we are doing and capabilities we're putting in the marketplace on a time -- on a real-time basis, the marketplace is adjusting in terms of, how do I exactly use these? They know directionally how they want to use them. Don't know if they are kind of nuts and bolts to quite that point. But these more progressive clients have had distinctively better cost positions and distinctively better patterns of consumer decisions, resource utilization and health status, wellness. If we can translate that from those venues to the more progressive -- to make them more progressive in other sectors of the marketplace -- and I think about the large government sectors because they have the same attributes as large health employer sponsors. They're sponsoring large populations. They have more influence in how these programs go. Then you begin to get into the water with respect to consumer behavior, and you get into the water with respect to care provider behavior. And those kinds of elements, I think, can actually when you -- can really establish -- the pattern measures can really drive change. And clients are seeing it. States are seeing it. Governments are seeing it. The -- some of Larry's commentary with respect of international is showing some of these patterns to international governments that have, arguably, a different health care system and their response to these things. And then the whole idea that the technology is now capable of doing this at such scale and such speed and doing it down to a mobile expression, whoever uses that mobile expression, whether it's a care provider or a consumer, those things are playing out. So we're in the early stages. The best way to see it is in the large national accounts. And then, believe it or not, you can see it in some of the things like Medicaid where you can see large state sponsors, that once they really get these programs in a mature state, are just driving distinctive results relative to the populations they're serving. The next stage is really getting this directly to the consumer, and I think their platforms, like Rally, really represent first generation of a way to actually jump over and really get kind of in the consumer's head using these applications and things like that. And I think this is just the beginning. So that would be my reaction to it. I don't know if we can react in a more granular way. So I thank you for that question."

So it will be something that we'll consider and build to talk more about after we get through our planning season. In terms of the group -- change in the group benefit, while we're disappointed in that change, it remains, I would say, the value to the retirees. Employers are trying to find solutions for the retiree population, Medicare Advantage remains a very strong value proposition, and we're seeing that actually play out in our pipeline development. And as we look towards 2017, it's one of the strongest in years.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our company's second quarter performance. For full year 2016, both UnitedHealthcare and Optum continue to grow at a vibrant place.

For full year 2016, both UnitedHealthcare and Optum continue to grow at a vibrant place. The outlook for net earnings, cash flows and return on capital remains strong and consistent with our recent commentary. The steady advancement of innovative market-responsive products and services and experiences has led the balance to organic gains across virtually all of our businesses. We believe our businesses remain well positioned for continued broad-based growth for the balance of 2016, for 2017 and in the years to come. As we reflect on this quarter's performance, we once again see exceptional growth, improved customer retention and important new business awards and opportunities leading to continued advances in both revenue backlog and sales pipelines. 
For second quarter 2016, UnitedHealth Group revenues grew 28.2% year-over-year to $46.5 billion, with all domestic lines posting double-digit growth as we grew to serve 132 million unique individuals. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.96 per share grew 13.3% year-over-year. Medical cost trends remained steady and consistent with the outlook we shared as we began the year and operating costs remain well controlled. 
Last quarter, we updated you on our intent in 2017 to participate in only a handful of ACA-compliant individual markets, what we refer to as the exchange market. That effort is on track and we do not expect any meaningful financial exposure on 2017 business from the 3 or fewer exchange markets where we currently plan to remain. 
Our second quarter includes an incremental $200 million in full year 2016 exchange market losses fully absorbed in these results. Along with what we absorbed last quarter, first half 2016 results reflect an incremental $325 million in full year losses beyond the expectation established as we entered the year. 
Looking at the company overall. We intend to carry strong 2016 business momentum into 2017 that will include investing in and improving our competitiveness for the years beyond 2017. We will balance these investments with our commitment to provide returns to shareholders through growth in earnings per share and dividends. We will lay out a strongly positive and detailed view of 2017 later this year and address questions at that time. 
We'll now turn the call to Larry Renfro to discuss Optum's strong second quarter performance, then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group overall. Larry?"
104673,365973568,1007787,"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","UnitedHealth Group Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Optum's second quarter results continued to build on the exceptional growth trends, earning results and operating performance metrics we achieved for the last 7 [ph] years.

Optum's second quarter results continued to build on the exceptional growth trends, earning results and operating performance metrics we achieved for the last 7 [ph] years. Second quarter revenues exceeded $20 billion, increasing 52% [ph] over last year. OptumRx revenues expanded 69% [ph] to $15.1 billion. OptumHealth and OptumInsight combined grew their top line to $5.8 billion, growth of 20% over last year. Optum earned more than $1.2 billion in the second quarter, with all segments reporting earnings growth of 20% or more. First half 2016 earnings from operations exceeded $2.3 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the first half 2015, an increase of 47%. As expected, first half 2016 earnings results represent just over 40% of Optum's full year outlook. 
OptumInsight's revenue backlog grew 15% or $1.5 billion to $7.3 billion, with growth particularly strong in revenue management, technology and government services. OptumHealth grew to over 80 million consumers, up 6% over last year, while OptumRx is tracking well to its target of managing 1 billion adjusted scripts this year. 
The pipeline of opportunities we are discussing with existing and prospective customers are increasingly more strategic. We are being asked to help fundamentally change and improve core business operations. Residents simply respond to traditional RFPs or single-point solutions. Today, the average award size for OptumHealth and OptumInsight AIM Healthcare Services more than doubled what it was just a few years ago. And Optum's qualified sales pipeline continues to grow strongly in both opportunity size and quality. Last quarter, we discussed with you in some detail our vision for the next generation pharmacy care services business. 
So far this year, OptumRx has been honored to receive new external business awards for January 2017 covering more than 1.7 million people, an increase of 40% over last year's sales results at this point in the year and the selling season continues. Sophisticated buyers are embracing our modern and innovative approaches to data and proprietary analytics, consumer engagement and service, specialty pharmacy and clinical programs that integrate to improve overall patient health. 
A second high potential area is the health financial services market. Independent estimates project market growth of more than 20% per year as the number of people using health benefit accounts expand and their account balances increase. OptumHealth financial services business aligns with the company's efforts to help consumers navigate and use the entire health care system more effectively. Optum financial services serves consumers through 3 million health financial accounts with approximately $7 billion in assets under management by year-end 2016. And there are expanding opportunities in these areas and others to simplify the consumer health care experience, incent prevention and wellness and provide consumers with deeper insights and more control as they seek to optimize their personal health and manage their health-related finances throughout their lives. 
The consistent theme in these examples and in Optum's performance quarter by quarter is that customers are embracing Optum's innovative approaches to making health care worker better. We bring to market 4 things: seasoned people, experienced operators to helping solve our clients' complex challenges; proven technology, specifically technology-enabled solutions and tools to power clients' processes and operations; unique data assets and analytics. We help clients gain insight and make better decisions and take better actions on multiple levels. Action and results, we have the flexibility and focus to respond quickly and execute our tasks accurately for those we serve. 
Optum is uniquely positioned to serve as a valuable data-enabled health services company in a growing $1 trillion global marketplace, a company serving all stakeholders across the health care system, consumers, health plans, life sciences companies, governments, employers and health care providers.

Broad, diversified growth and strong forward momentum also continued at UnitedHealthcare again this quarter. UnitedHealthcare is passionate about modernizing and enriching the customer experience and continues to advance new approaches to simplify that experience for the people we serve. 
Second quarter Medicare & Retirement revenues grew nearly 14% to $14.3 billion. Strong retention and growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement yielded net growth of nearly 1.5 million people year-to-date. Growth in Medicare is being driven by dependable products that offer clear value and serve people in simple and caring ways. For instance, while seniors are on the phone with us for other reasons, we will encourage and schedule hundreds of thousands of doctors' appointments for them this year. Home visits by our house call nurses will be up 20% year-over-year to over 1.2 million in 2016. Activities such as these, along with consistent approaches around benefits, products, network engagement and tailored service, meaningfully improve care quality, the consumer experience and customer retention. From these and other activities, we expect to serve a significantly higher percentage of our Medicare Advantage members through 4-star plans in 2017. This was a big lift by our people and care delivery partners, and I'm grateful to all of them for what they have achieved on behalf of those we serve. 
Strong organic growth continues in Medicaid as well with revenues up 14.7% to $8.3 billion as UnitedHealthcare Community & State serves 225,000 more people in the second quarter. This past quarter's growth includes new members in Iowa and expanded services in New York, and we were awarded additional markets in Pennsylvania for next year as part of that state's program expansion. Importantly, Medicaid revenue growth also reflects a stronger mix as states continue to ask us to help them serve more people with more complex health care needs. We now serve nearly 5.7 million people through state-sponsored health care programs, and we expect to grow -- that growth to continue as we advance innovations to help states better serve their most complex and higher-cost citizens, meeting their needs with more integrated social services built around their health. 
Our Employer & Individual business revenues also grew 14% to $13.5 billion in the second quarter. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve nearly 400,000 more people in commercial benefits through the first 6 months of the year outside of the exchange market products. This is strongly favorable to the initial growth forecast for both self-funded and full-risk offerings. 
Turning to medical costs. We reported a care ratio of 82% this quarter, which is 30 basis points year-over-year -- a 30 basis point year-over-year increase, primarily due to adverse exchange market performance and the relative levels of claim reserve development in the quarter offset by strong underlying core performance by the rest of our UnitedHealthcare businesses. Year-to-date, favorable prior year reserve development was $300 million as compared to $130 million in the first half of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, reserves developed unfavorably by $100 million. Of this, $60 million relates to items that predate 2016 and do not impact 2016 core medical trends such as 2013 and 2014 Medicaid and Medicare true ups and settlements. The current portion of development relates to exchange market products. Beyond this component, the current year development in the second quarter was favorable. 
Commercial medical trend remains consistent with the original outlook of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Hospital inpatient admissions per person are lower year-over-year across all UnitedHealthcare businesses. Like most years, there are pockets of higher cost trends including specialty pharmacy and the increasing use of the ER and outpatient services this year. Overall, health care cost trends remain in line and controlled. 
Bringing these items together, in the second quarter, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues by $4.5 billion or 13.6% on a year-over-year basis. The business grew by 320,000 domestic consumers in the quarter and has added more than 1.6 million consumers year-to-date. UnitedHealthcare generated nearly $2 billion in operating earnings in the quarter despite the pressures from exchange market products and the second quarter prior year reserve development we just described. 
Stepping back, UnitedHealthcare delivered steady distinguished organic growth consistently for more than half a decade, and here's how we're doing it. We help people achieve better health by using our data and analytics to simplify decision-making and to help them access the care they need. We work with physicians and hospitals sharing information to help them make [indiscernible] based decisions about the care they provide, and we focus every day on improving the quality of our execution in every interaction and process for the people we engage with and serve as well as those who provide their care. UnitedHealthcare still is only a modest national share in a growing health care benefits market expect to drive further growth by delivering on these commitments better and better every day every quarter and every year. 
Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Cash flows from operations in the second quarter was $1.7 billion or about 1x net income compared to 0.7x net income in the year ago period. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations of $4 billion was 1.2x net income also ahead of last year's pace. The company repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1 billion in the first half of 2016. Our Board of Directors increased the dividend in June by 25% to an annual rate of $2.50 per share. We will return nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders in dividends payments in the next 12 months. The debt to total capital ratio declined to 48% and we expect it will continue to decline in the second half of this year as we work back to a target in the 40% range. 
Reflecting our performance for the first 6 months of 2016, overall growth and results have been favorable across the businesses. However, our exchange market growth is also above our original estimates as are the corresponding losses. Prudently balancing this overall performance, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $7.80 $7.95 from the former $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We believe this to be an appropriate posture given the performance backdrop of the exchange business even as the core businesses have performed strongly. 
As we consider the balance of 2016, we expect the combination of cost to set up new business for 2017 and ongoing investments in growth areas such as MedExpress, Optum Care and international, along with strong seasonal fourth quarter earnings performance from Optum, will produce approximately equal adjusted earnings per share results in each of the last 2 quarters of this year.

As we have discussed in recent conversations, we believe we are in the early stages of a unique era for UnitedHealth Group looking ahead toward what may be the best and most important decade of performance for this enterprise. We serve growing markets that are seeking better performance in health care both in the U.S. and globally. We continue to strengthen and align enterprise capabilities to meet these needs, and we are intently focused on the quality and consistency of the experience we delivered to our consumers, customers, benefit sponsors and care providers. 
On this latter point, we have the opportunity to evolve and differentiate our enterprise in the coming years by focusing intensely on redefining the quality and value of the health care experience for those we serve and, importantly, objectively measuring the impact of these efforts and recalibrating and enhancing our performance as we advance. With this focus, paired with evolving capabilities and strong market positions of our growing diversified portfolio of businesses, we expect to drive differentiated growth for years to come. These efforts will help people with healthier lives and make health systems work better for everyone. As a company, we're committed to making the most of this period of opportunity.

So as you pointed out, it's a bit early to provide any detail, but I can give you some high-level perspective and direction. We clearly want to build on the momentum that we're experiencing right now in 2016. So our objective is to continue to offer stability in our benefits including premiums. There will be some enhancements where we think that's appropriate. It's obviously a market-by-market conversation, but overall, stability in both benefits and premiums. And this is driven in large part by the great improvement that we've been experiencing in our star performance, particularly for 2017. And then we're going to continue on the innovations around the member experience, our clinical programs, and we think this well positions us for growth in both the individual and the group Medicare Advantage products and particularly in the group side experiencing really strong sales and retention for 2017. With respect to the insurance fee and the moratorium there, I think it's important to think about that in the context of the overall funding equation. As you know, this program's been underfunded, 14% rate cut since 2010 and continues to be underfunded relative to medical costs. So our goal, as Steve mentioned, is to provide stability and valuable benefits to the seniors. It's a very effective program that continues to drive cost down and improve outcomes and satisfaction's really high. So our perspective and approach has been after we take this into the overall funding equation, we're going to share a portion of it, obviously, with the provider partners and employer groups in the group MA space and then passing on a meaningful amount to our members in the form of stable benefits and again enhancing where we can. So I think that provides a perspective. And again, we're just -- we're really feeling great about the position of this business and the opportunities as we head into 2017 and beyond."

It was a bit more comprehensive. So just to re-baseline on the individual ACA. So our expectation coming into the year was that on a policy year basis we would lose somewhere in the area of $525 million. We had done a premium deficiency reserve at the end of the year of $245 million to partially offset that. So the net of those 2 was about a $280 million impact to 2016 earnings performance. And then in the first quarter, we strengthened that or increased the lost expectation by $125 million and then likewise added an additional $200 million in the second quarter fully recognized in the quarter in terms of the expectation of full year. So when you put that all together, it's a shade over $600 million of P&L impact to 2016. As you look at what's driving the increase inside that, so for the quarter, the $200 million that we've added, it's a combination of 2 things. It's really more volume and higher consumption, and I'd break it down. About 1/3 of that is higher volume. So we've got higher sales as well as the more moderate attrition than we had expected and 2/3 is really around the consumption as, obviously, we had unfavorable development on our exchanges relating to the first quarter in the second that came with higher second quarter cost, and we've also let that inform our full year outlook. So 2/3 of that $200 million really relates to the underlying consumption. And what's changing underneath that, to your question, the reality is the severity of chronic conditions inside the population actually increased on a year-over-year basis. If you look at the prevalence of chronic disease, things like HIV and hepatitis C, diabetes, COPD, those are examples of things that the prevalence was high to begin with in 2015 and that has increased into 2016. So that's what's informing our view. As you think about 2017, I would tell you of that $605 million, on the math I went through previously, a good meaningful portion of that will contribute to our 2017 performance. Some of the things offsetting that are certainly some semi-variable and fixed costs associated with this business that don't go away as we shrink our footprint in 2017."

There's a collection of things and I tell you it was a blend of some  provider settlements as well as Dave mentioned some government true ups some of them dating back 3 years, particularly around [indiscernible] as a result intersection between claims and corridors and reinsurance and programs inside that. So those are things that contributed to that prior year element. Importantly though, those are all things that, frankly, don't have any bearing on our current year medical trend and medical outlook. And as it relates to the current year component, that obviously -- more than all of that was related to the individual ACA book of business. Absent that, we actually had favorable development related to the current year in the quarter. But importantly, putting it all together, from a medical cost perspective as well as a trends perspective, outside of the individual ACA, we continue to attract in line with our expectations across the platform."

Well, drug prices are the first item, obviously, on our clients' list. And I think if you look at how we're attacking this, this last quarter has been a real differentiator for us. As Larry said, the combination here for us was all about scale, and it is intended to take the supply chain. So as a much bigger business, we're talking about drug pricing every day to the biotech companies and to the pharmaceutical companies bringing product to the market. And the way we contract with them is to protect our clients as best we can from some of these pricing increases. Obviously, price can be addressed by regulatory issues at but also just by better management of the drug benefits. So we use our tools like formulary, like specialty [indiscernible], like preferred and exclusionary networks to drive price down. And in large part, this is what's defining us right now, are we reached the scale where we've obviously taken the drug spend that we manage for our clients to the supply chain and a differentiated model to drive down and contain to the best of our ability drug prices. And so rather than talk on a political stage about how to get after drug pricing, we're using the tools that we've deployed here and integrating them with better medical management in the broader Optum chassis. So we do think we have a differentiated model, a better way to get after drug pricing, drug cost management, combining both the technology platform that Larry talked about and really the leading clinical management platform in the broader Optum.

We expect to respond to about 20 RFPs this year that will be implemented over the next 3 years. Many of those, and I think this is a really important piece, continue to include, and Dave mentioned this in his comments, more and more populations with complex needs, that gives us an awful lot of confidence because when you look at the combined capabilities of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, that really is in a wheelhouse. That is really where we can provide tremendous amount of value to the consumer as well as our state partners. So we see that continuing. The Pennsylvania LTSS opportunity is just one example of that. We'll see Virginia as another example of that, Oklahoma another example. So you're going to see a continued increase in these very costly populations. Keep in mind when you back out and look at the macro story here, you got $500 billion of spend in the Medicaid space, you got about 70% of the membership in Managed Care today but only about 41% of the dollars. So when you talk about confidence in the pipeline and opportunity to grow, that's really where that opportunity sits. Coupled with that, still some greenfield states, there are 15 states that don't have Managed Care today, some very large like North Carolina where we've been successful in working with the state and to get legislation passed, and that market will continue to develop. Again, I think it squares up very nicely with our capabilities and marks the road for a very good growth opportunity going forward. In regard to Iowa, first and foremost, we're very pleased with the implementation. It's been going very well. We're staying very focused on job one, which is taking care of the folks we've been entrusted to do so. And we built a very good relationship with the state. As you know, it's 1 quarter-end.

So first and foremost, just as a reminder, coming into the year, our expectation was for a moderate increase in underlying utilization trends. That's what informed our pricing, our benefit planning as well as the guidance we provided, and that's what we're able to manage to in the second quarter, very consistent with our conversation in the first quarter and very much in line with our expectation. It's kind of looking at how trends progress through the year. Typically, we talk in annual terms. But as we look to the quarters, we certainly don't view Q2 use as having accelerated beyond the Q1 rate. If anything, I'd probably tell you that Q2 is perhaps a little bit lower. To your questions about the categories themselves, the bigger drivers of our trend are certainly in pharmacy and outpatient and Dave mentioned. And then working against that more moderate levels of trend as we drive down per capita use, so on an inpatient basis. The physician piece, I would tell you that's largely driven by hepatitis C. So we changed our coverage criteria effective 1/1 of 2016 in our commercial business. So we expanded coverage and that's what's really driving that 8% to 9% pharmacy trend on a commercial basis we talked about back at the investor conference. And then as you look to the outpatient side, inside there, we see elevated levels of emergency room. Surgical procedures are contributing, also facility-based -- facility dispensed prescription. So that's kind of oriented more around the oncology space. So those are some of the bigger contributors, and not surprisingly, that is absolutely where our medical management efforts are focused, to look down on those costs. All of those categories I would tell you are within the ranges that we expressed at the investor conference call, probably a little bit higher on the outpatient side in line with the pharmacy pace, a little bit better on the inpatient side. But net-net, we still expect, on a commercial basis, our full year medical trend to be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points."

And with that, can we focus on something that's important but I'm not sure we actually got a whole lot of detail around this. OptumRx has clearly done a very good job of winning competitive business and not based solely on price or not even importantly on price but rather on what appears to be an innovative and intriguing combination of services and capabilities as well as scale. But the implementation's going to be important, so and I gathered from your commentary around guidance that you plan to spend implement, which is great. But can you give us some more details about what you plan to do to ensure that these new lives as well as the existing lives as seamless and experienced becoming OptumRx beneficiaries as the 11 million commercial lives which you clearly were able to bring on without even a whisper of an issue, that would be very helpful, and with some estimate of what it will impact presumably in third and fourth quarter."

So we feel very, very confident in the leadership that we have and that we have developed as well as with the combination of Catamaran and OptumRx, we're pretty solid when it comes to that. When you step over into implementation and execution, that happens to also one of our key priorities that we pride ourselves on. So this is not out of the ordinary what we do. So we looked at both of those things from an execution standpoint as well as from a people standpoint, and so the third question you asked is about the monetary side of this, and it's built in. So there should not be any impact at all to the guidance. We expect to get this type of relationships and we have built it in the plan.

So I think I'd like to just take a moment, talk about what broadly large scale buyers want and need, and we are feeling very good about the fact that our message is resonating and we posted some substantial wins here recently and it's not by accident. Large buyers had a set of complicated needs, but first and foremost, they need a flexible improvement technology partner and engine to drive their PBM benefit. They obviously need market-clearing economics and prices -- price matters but our model provides superior service to really focusing on quality and then marrying our data analytics and our synchronization capability, these are really the reasons that our message is resonating. And then finally, someone's going to make a bet on a big transition, you have to have a track record of executing on large scale conversions or transitions, and this combined business has that. As you know, there was a very large scale transition several years ago in OptumRx. And in our prior business at Catamaran, we bought and integrated 8 companies. And so the notion of heavy lift and making large scale implementations happen is something that we know how to do. So we're feeling really good about the balance of the year and the work plan in place to implement these flawlessly. If you look back on 1/1/16 where we also had a good number of new client wins, we got great channel checks on our implementation work because that's the heart and soul of this business.

And I'll just tell you that from an overall year-over-year standpoint, our qualified sales pipeline, which is a very diversified pipeline, is double the size of what it was this time last year. Obviously, number two is that backlog that we were talking about where we're up the 15%, that $11.3 billion, obviously, that's another key indicator. And I think the third one and even a stronger one, and that's our, what I'll call our closed sales and how we look at the total contract value on that, and we're up 80% at the end of the second quarter. And that 80% is going against the entire year of 2015. So I'm doing an 80% above on contracted -- total contracted revenue for Optum, 80% above what was done in the entire year of 2015. So obviously, the sales pipeline, the closed sales and the backlog, that's going to give us a jumpstart into 2017.

As Larry said, there's a lot of confidence if you interrogate that backlog and that prevailing confidence comes from, if even you look at Q1 and Q2, they were marked by some of the largest software deals we've done.

Number two, if you just look at the velocity, the sheer numbers, the size of it, as Larry noted, it is at breakneck pace. And then third, if you kind of look at the nature and the demographics of that, just our activity in the pipeline in general, we are the recipient of more RFPs than we've ever been. We are engaging in strategic conversations with more constituencies at a faster pace than we ever had in, and that includes health providers, health plans, governments, employers and certainly pharma. And then also, I would think that the interesting part of that is the comprehensive nature of many of the opportunities in that pipeline. They're very big. They're long in their duration and really aligned with what we always expressed in terms of the deeper and more comprehensive relationships. And there is a fair amount of it that's marked by analytics too that's a growth market for us. If you look at the demographics in there, and you look at kind of the way we set up in the analytics market, it's clear that we're going to see grow there. The pipeline reflects that and I think we have distinguished ourselves very well in analytics from a revenue management, even integrity. So it's a very diverse sort of a boundary pipeline I think bodes well for the rest of the year and certainly into '17."

Maybe just extend on the capital deployment front, and then Larry or Jack want to comment as well, please feel free to do so. I think John Rex in his new role has done a great job responding to our overall capital priorities, but I think as been consistent over time, we have allocated about [ph] 50% of our capital to growth and about 50% of our capital to returning to shareholders. And you can see that it's strongly biased towards the dividend right now as we seek to also pay down our debt and our leverage ratio down [ph] to 40%. That 50% on M&A really didn't touch on a whole lot, and our priorities remain pretty consistent as they have been. As you can see, we've been investing significantly in Optum and you can see the returns of that which have been extensive, but the team has done a fantastic job of driving nice returns on the invested capital base that we put in place. Two of those areas were the MedExpress platform which is the urgent care platform, so which supports the notion of us providing better quality, more consumer-responsive and higher-value care, and in this case, it happens to be in ambulatory setting. We said that was the foundation investment in MedExpress. And I think as you knew at the time, we would continue to invest in opening new locations in that business over time. And as you can imagine, with novo start-ups, they tend to create a little bit of a drag on earnings, particularly as you're just getting going in the early stages of that. Your instincts are right. I mean they kind of tie into the trend conversation that Dan discussed as well which is we're seeing a higher utilization of ER, and of course, the care setting and the urgent care we believe is much more effective and will help to obviate cost not only for UnitedHealthcare but across all the payers that Optum serves. Another area of priority for us is to continue to invest in the Optum Care business. Larry laid out quite nicely I believe the 75 markets that we want to pursue which constitute about 80% of all health care. And one of the areas in which we're pursuing that is through the development of physician practices and services in those markets, and we have an initial foundation of that if we have if we have about [ph] $10 billion or so of revenue or so. On a combined basis, we serve over 7 million patients and we have a nice growing business, I believe, in some stages of some 25 plus markets so far. And our activities there continue, and we'll continue to deploying capital in that area and continue to pursue that development of our business in the primary care setting.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our company's second quarter performance. For full year 2016, both UnitedHealthcare and Optum continue to grow at a vibrant place. The outlook for net earnings, cash flows and return on",399,"Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our company's second quarter performance. For full year 2016, both UnitedHealthcare and Optum continue to grow at a vibrant place. The outlook for net earnings, cash flows and return on capital remains strong and consistent with our recent commentary. The steady advancement of innovative market-responsive products, services and experiences has led to balanced organic gains across virtually all of our businesses. We believe our businesses remain well positioned for continued broad-based growth for the balance of 2016, for 2017 and in the years to come. As we reflect on this quarter's performance, we once again see exceptional growth, improved customer retention and important new business awards and opportunities leading to continued advances in both revenue backlog and sales pipelines. 
For second quarter 2016, UnitedHealth Group revenues grew 28.2% year-over-year to $46.5 billion, with all domestic lines posting double-digit growth as we grew to serve 132 million unique individuals. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.96 per share grew 13.3% year-over-year. Medical cost trends remained steady and consistent with the outlook we shared as we began the year, and operating costs remained well controlled. 
Last quarter, we updated you on our intent in 2017 to participate in only a handful of ACA-compliant individual markets, what we refer to as the exchange market. That effort is on track and we do not expect any meaningful financial exposure on 2017 business from the 3 or fewer exchange markets where we currently plan to remain. 
Our second quarter includes an incremental $200 million in full year 2016 exchange market losses fully absorbed in these results. Along with what we absorbed last quarter, first half 2016 results reflect an incremental $325 million in full year losses beyond the expectation established as we entered the year. 
Looking at the company overall. We intend to carry strong 2016 business momentum into 2017 that will include investing in and improving our competitiveness for the years beyond 2017. We will balance these investments with our commitment to provide returns to shareholders through growth in earnings per share and dividend. We will lay out a strongly positive and detailed view of 2017 later this year and address questions at that time. 
We'll now turn the call to Larry Renfro to discuss Optum's strong second quarter performance, then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group overall. Larry?"

Optum's second quarter results continued to build on the exceptional growth trends, earning results and operating performance metrics we achieved for the last several years. Second quarter revenues exceeded $20 billion, increasing 52% over last year. OptumRx revenues expanded 69% to $15.1 billion. OptumHealth and OptumInsight combined grew their top line to $5.8 billion, growth of 20% over last year. 
Optum earned more than $1.2 billion in the second quarter, with all segments reporting earnings growth of 20% or more. First half 2016 earnings from operations exceeded $2.3 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the first half 2015, an increase of 47%. As expected, first half 2016 earnings results represent just over 40% of Optum's full year outlook. 
OptumInsight's revenue backlog grew 15% or $1.5 billion to $7.3 billion, with growth particularly strong in revenue management, technology and government services. OptumHealth grew to over 80 million consumers, up 6% over last year, while OptumRx is tracking well to its target of managing 1 billion adjusted scripts this year. 
The pipeline of opportunities we are discussing with existing and prospective customers are increasingly more strategic. We are being asked to help fundamentally change and improve core business operations. Residents simply respond to traditional RFPs or single-point solutions. Today, the average award size for OptumHealth and OptumInsight is more than double what it was just a few years ago. And Optum's qualified sales pipeline continues to grow strongly in both opportunity size and quality. 
Last quarter, we discussed with you in some detail our vision for the next-generation pharmacy care services business. So far this year, OptumRx has been honored to receive new external business awards for January 2017 covering more than 1.7 million people, an increase of 40% over last year's sales result at this point in the year, and the selling season continues. Sophisticated buyers are embracing our modern and innovative approaches to data and proprietary analytics, consumer engagement and service, specialty pharmacy and clinical programs that integrate to improve overall patient health. 
A second high potential area is the health financial services market. Independent estimates project market growth of more than 20% per year as the number of people using health benefit accounts expand and their account balances increase. Optum's health financial services business aligns with the company's efforts to help consumers navigate and use the entire health care system more effectively. 
Optum financial services serves consumers through 3 million health financial accounts with approximately $7 billion in assets under management by year-end 2016. And there are expanding opportunities in this area and others to simplify the consumer health care experience, incent prevention and wellness and provide consumers with deeper insights and more control as they seek to optimize their personal health and manage their health-related finances throughout their lives. 
The consistent theme in these examples and in Optum's performance quarter by quarter is that customers are embracing Optum's innovative approaches to making health care work better. We bring to market 4 things: seasoned people, experienced operators committing to helping solve our clients' complex challenges; proven technology, specifically technology-enabled solutions and tools to power clients' processes and operations; unique data assets and analytics, we help clients gain insights and make better decisions and take better actions on multiple levels; action and results, we have the flexibility and focus to respond quickly and execute our tasks accurately for those we served. Optum is uniquely positioned to serve as a valuable data-enabled health services company in a growing $1 trillion global marketplace, a company serving all stakeholders across the health care system: consumers, health plans, life sciences companies, governments, employers and health care providers. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."

Broad, diversified growth and strong forward momentum also continued at UnitedHealthcare again this quarter. UnitedHealthcare is passionate about modernizing and enriching the consumer experience and continues to advance new approaches to simplify that experience for the people we serve. 
Second quarter Medicare & Retirement revenues grew nearly 14% to $14.3 billion. Strong retention and growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement yielded net growth of nearly 1.5 million people year-to-date. Growth in Medicare is being driven by dependable products that offer clear value and serve people in simple and caring ways. For instance, while seniors are on the phone with us for other reasons, we will encourage and schedule hundreds of thousands of doctors' appointments for them this year. Home visits by our house call nurses will be up 20% year-over-year to over 1.2 million in 2016. 
Activities such as these, along with consistent approaches around benefits, products, network engagement and tailored service, meaningfully improve care quality, the consumer experience and customer retention. From these and other activities, we expect to serve a significantly higher percentage of our Medicare Advantage members through 4-star plans in 2017. This was a big lift by our people and care delivery partners, and I am grateful to all of them for what they have achieved on behalf of those we serve. 
Strong organic growth continues in Medicaid as well with revenues up 14.7% to $8.3 billion as UnitedHealthcare Community & State served 225,000 more people in the second quarter. This past quarter's growth includes new members in Iowa and expanded services in New York, and we were awarded additional markets in Pennsylvania for next year as part of that state's program expansion. 
Importantly, Medicaid revenue growth also reflects a stronger mix as states continued to ask us to help them serve more people with more complex health care needs. We now serve nearly 5.7 million people through state-sponsored health care programs, and we expect to grow -- that growth to continue as we advance innovations to help states better serve their most complex and higher-cost citizens, meeting their needs with more integrated social services built around their health. 
Our Employer & Individual business revenues also grew 14% to $13.5 billion in the second quarter. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve nearly 400,000 more people in commercial benefits through the first 6 months of the year outside of the exchange market products. This is strongly favorable to the initial growth forecast for both self-funded and full-risk offerings. 
Turning to medical costs. We reported a care ratio of 82% this quarter, which is 30 basis points year-over-year -- a 30 basis point year-over-year increase, primarily due to adverse exchange market performance and the relative levels of claim reserve development in the quarter offset by strong underlying core performance by the rest of our UnitedHealthcare businesses. Year-to-date, favorable prior year reserve development was $300 million as compared to $130 million in the first half of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, reserves developed unfavorably by $100 million. Of this, $60 million relates to items that predate 2016 and do not impact 2016 core medical trends, such as 2013 and 2014 Medicaid and Medicare true-ups and settlements. The current year portion of development relates to exchange market products. Beyond this component, the current year development in the second quarter was favorable. 
Commercial medical trend remains consistent with the original outlook of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Hospital inpatient admissions per person are lower year-over-year across all UnitedHealthcare businesses. Like most years, there are pockets of higher cost trends, including specialty pharmacy and the increasing use of ER and outpatient services this year. Overall, health care cost trends remain in line and controlled. 
Bringing these items together, in the second quarter, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues by $4.5 billion or 13.6% on a year-over-year basis. The business grew by 320,000 domestic consumers in the quarter and has added more than 1.6 million consumers year-to-date. UnitedHealthcare generated nearly $2 billion in operating earnings in the quarter despite the pressures from exchange market products and the second quarter prior year reserve development we just described. 
Stepping back, UnitedHealthcare has delivered steady, distinguished organic growth consistently for more than half a decade, and here's how we're doing it. We help people achieve better health by using our data and analytics to simplify decision-making and to help them access the care they need. We work with physicians and hospitals, sharing information to help them make fact-based decisions about the care they provide. And we focus every day on improving the quality of our execution in every interaction and process for the people we engage with and serve as well as those who provide their care. UnitedHealthcare, who still has only a modest national share in a growing health care benefits market, expects to drive further growth by delivering on these commitments better and better every day, every quarter and every year. 
Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Cash flows from operations in the second quarter was $1.7 billion or about 1x net income compared to 0.7x net income in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations of $4 billion was 1.2x net income, also ahead of last year's pace. The company repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1 billion in the first half of 2016. 
Our Board of Directors increased the dividend in June by 25% to an annual rate of $2.50 per share. We will return nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders in dividends payments in the next 12 months. The debt to total capital ratio declined to 48%, and we expect it will continue to decline in the second half of this year as we work back to a target in the 40% range. 
Reflecting our performance for the first 6 months of 2016, overall growth and results have been favorable across the businesses. However, our exchange market growth is also above our original estimates as are the corresponding losses. 
Prudently balancing this overall performance, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $7.80 to $7.95 from the former $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We believe this to be an appropriate posture given the performance backdrop of the exchange business even as the core businesses have performed strongly. 
As we consider the balance of 2016, we expect the combination of cost to set up new business for 2017 and ongoing investments in growth areas, such as MedExpress, Optum Care and international, along with strong seasonal fourth quarter earnings performance from Optum, will produce approximately equal adjusted earnings per share results in each of the last 2 quarters of this year.

As we have discussed in recent conversations, we believe we are in the early stages of a unique era for UnitedHealth Group, looking ahead toward what may be the best and most important decade of performance for this enterprise. We serve growing markets that are seeking better performance in health care, both in the U.S. and globally. We continue to strengthen and align enterprise capabilities to meet these needs. And we are intently focused on the quality and consistency of the experience we deliver to our consumers, customers, benefit sponsors and care providers. 
On this latter point, we have the opportunity to evolve and differentiate our enterprise in the coming years by focusing intensely on redefining the quality and value of the health care experience for those we serve and, importantly, objectively measuring the impact of these efforts and recalibrating and enhancing our performance as we advance. With this focus, paired with evolving capabilities and the strong market positions of our growing diversified portfolio of businesses, we expect to drive differentiated growth for years to come. These efforts will help people live healthier lives and make health systems work better for everyone. As a company, we're committed to making the most of this period of opportunity.

So as you pointed out, it is a bit early to provide any detail, but I can give you some high-level perspective and direction. We clearly want to build on the momentum that we're experiencing right now in 2016. So our objective is to continue to offer stability in our benefits including premiums. There will be some enhancements where we think that's appropriate. It's obviously a market-by-market conversation, but overall, stability in both benefits and premiums. And this is driven in large part by the great improvement that we've been experiencing in our star performance, particularly for 2017. And then we're going to continue on the innovations around the member experience for clinical programs, and we think this well positions us for growth in both the individual and the group Medicare Advantage products, and particularly in the group side, experiencing really strong sales and retention for 2017. With respect to the insurance fee and the moratorium there, I think it's important to think about that in the context of the overall funding equation. As you know, this program's been underfunded, 14% rate cut since 2010 and continues to be underfunded relative to medical costs. So our goal, as Steve mentioned, is to provide stability and valuable benefits to the seniors. It's a very effective program that continues to drive cost down and improve outcomes, and satisfaction's really high. So our perspective and approach has been, after we take this into the overall funding equation, we're going to share a portion of it, obviously, with the provider partners and employer groups in the group MA space, and then passing on a meaningful amount to our members in the form of stable benefits and again, enhancing where we can. So I think that provides a perspective. And again, we're just -- we're really feeling great about the position of this business and the opportunities as we head into 2017 and beyond."

That question was comprehensive. So just to re-baseline on the individual ACA. So our expectation coming into the year was that, on a policy-year basis, we would lose somewhere in the area of $525 million. We had done a premium deficiency reserve at the end of the year of $245 million to partially offset that. So the net of those 2 was about a $280 million impact to 2016 earnings performance. And then in the first quarter, we strengthened that or increased the lost expectation by $125 million and then likewise, added an additional $200 million in the second quarter fully recognized in the quarter in terms of the expectation on the full year. So when you put that all together, it's a shade over $600 million of P&L impact to 2016. As you look at what's driving the increase inside that, so for the quarter, the $200 million that we've added, it's a combination of 2 things: It's really more volume and higher consumption. And I'd break it down, about 1/3 of that is higher volume, so we've got higher sales as well as more moderate attrition than we had expected; and 2/3 is really around the consumption as, obviously, we had unfavorable development on our exchanges relating to the first quarter into second that came with higher second quarter costs, and we've also let that inform our full year outlook. So 2/3 of that $200 million really relates to the underlying consumption. And what's changing underneath that, to your question, the reality is the severity of chronic conditions inside the population actually increased on a year-over-year basis. If you look at the prevalence of chronic disease, things like HIV and hepatitis C, diabetes, COPD, those are examples of things that the prevalence was high to begin with in 2015, and that has increased into 2016. So that's what's informing our view. As you think about 2017, I would tell you of that $605 million and the math I went through previously, a good, meaningful portion of that will contribute to our 2017 performance. Some of the things offsetting that are certainly some semi-variable and fixed costs associated with this business that don't go away as we shrink our footprint in 2017."

So when you look at the portfolio of things that resolve in a given quarter, there are always some things that change period to period. As it relates to second quarter, as Dave mentioned, we experienced $100 million of unfavorable reserve development, and that was split 60% on the prior year and 40% on the current year. As you look at that prior year element, there isn't anything individually large. There's a collection of things, and I'd tell you that was a blend of some old provider settlements as well, as Dave mentioned, some government true-ups, some of them dating back 3 years, particularly around Part D as you resolve the intersection between claims and corridors and reinsurance and programs inside that. So those are things that contributed to that prior year element. Importantly, though, those are all things that, frankly, don't have any bearing on our current-year medical trend and medical outlook. And as it relates to the current-year component, that obviously -- well, more than all of that was related to the individual ACA book of business. Absent that, we actually had favorable development related to the current year in the quarter.

The value proposition, and that's what I think you're starting to see now, the expanded services, the scale as well as synchronization, is starting to take hold and it's resonating in the industry.

And I think if you look at how we're attacking this, this last quarter has been a real differentiator for us. As Larry said, the combination here for us was all about scale, and it is intended to take to the supply chain. So as a much bigger business, we're talking about drug pricing every day to the biotech companies and to the pharmaceutical companies bringing product to the market. And the way we contract with them is to protect our clients as best we can from some of these price increases. Obviously, price can be addressed by regulatory issues, but also just by better management of the drug benefits. So we use our tools like formulary, like specialty storage [ph], like preferred and exclusionary networks to drive price down. And in large part, this is what's defining us right now. Our -- we reached the scale where we've obviously taken the drug spend that we manage for our clients to the supply chain and a differentiated model to drive down and contain, to the best of our ability, drug prices. And so rather than talk on a political stage about how to get after drug pricing, we're using the tools that we've deployed here and integrating them with better medical management in the broader Optum chassis. So we do think we have a differentiated model, a better way to get after drug price and drug cost management, combining both the technology platform that Larry talked about and really the leading clinical management platform in the broader Optum. So that's what we're doing."

First of all, as far as the pipeline, as I think we've mentioned a couple of times earlier in the year, we see a very robust pipeline. We expect to respond to about 20 RFPs this year that will be implemented over the next 3 years. Many of those, and I think this is a really important piece, continue to include, and Dave mentioned this in his comments, more and more populations with complex needs. That gives us an awful lot of confidence because when you look at the combined capabilities of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, that really is in our wheelhouse. That's really where we can provide tremendous amount of value to the consumer as well as our state partners. So we see that continuing. The Pennsylvania LTSS opportunity is just one example of that. We'll say Virginia as another example of that; Oklahoma, another example. So you're going to see a continued increase in these very costly populations. Keep in mind when you back up and look at the macro story here, you got $500 billion of spend in the Medicaid space. You got about 70% of the membership in Managed Care today but only about 41% of the dollars. So when you talk about confidence in the pipeline and opportunity to grow, that's really where that opportunity sits. Coupled with that, still some greenfield states. There are 15 states that don't have Managed Care today, some very large like North Carolina, where we've been successful in working with the state to get legislation passed, and that market will continue to develop. So again, I think it squares up very nicely with our capabilities and marks the road for a very good growth opportunity going forward. In regard to Iowa, first and foremost, we're very pleased with the implementation. It's been going very well. We've stayed very focused on job 1, which is taking care of the folks we've been entrusted to do so. And we have built a very good relationship with the state. As you know, it's -- we're 1 quarter in so it's very early, so -- too early to really comment on what we're seeing.

So first and foremost, just as a reminder, coming into the year, our expectation was for a moderate increase in underlying utilization trends. That's what informed our pricing, our benefit planning as well as the guidance we provided, and that's what we were able to manage to in the second quarter, very consistent with our conversation in the first quarter and very much in line with our expectation. Just kind of looking at how trends progress through the year. Typically, we talk in annual terms, but as we look to the quarters, we certainly don't view Q2 use as having accelerated beyond the Q1 rate. If anything, I'd probably tell you that Q2 is perhaps a little bit lower. To your questions about the categories themselves, the bigger drivers of our trend are certainly in pharmacy and outpatient, as Dave mentioned, and then working against that as -- more moderate levels of trend as we drive down per-capita use on an inpatient basis. The pharmacy piece, I would tell you that's largely driven by hepatitis C. So we changed our coverage criteria effective 1/1 of 2016 in our commercial business. So we expanded coverage, and that's what's really driving that 8% to 9% pharmacy trend on a commercial basis we talked about back at the investor conference. And then as you look to the outpatient side, inside there we see elevated levels of emergency room. Surgical procedures are contributing, also facility-based -- facility-dispensed prescriptions. So that's kind of oriented more around the oncology space. So those are some of the bigger contributors, and not surprisingly, that is absolutely where our medical management efforts are focused, to work down those costs. All of those categories, I would tell you, are within the ranges that we expressed at the investor conference, probably a little bit higher on the outpatient side, in line on the pharmacy, paced a little bit better on the inpatient side. But net-net, we still expect, on a commercial basis, our full year medical trend to be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points."

So I know you know that we have certain priorities that we work toward in Optum, and one of them is to establish what I'll call these deeper, more comprehensive relationships. I think we had a goal to have about 8 to 10 of them by the end of 2016. I think we're pushing 17 right now, and these last wins were part of that. So as part of going after that effort, a few years ago, we have been strengthening leadership ever since that started. So we feel very, very confident in the leadership that we have and that we have developed as well as with the combination of Catamaran and OptumRx. We're pretty solid when it comes to that. When you step over into implementation and execution, that happens to also be one of our key priorities that we pride ourself on. So this is not really out of the ordinary what we do. So we looked at both of those things from an execution standpoint as well as from a people standpoint. And so we're -- the third question you asked is about the monetary side of this, and it's built in. So there should not be any impact at all to guidance. We expect to get this type of relationships, and we have built it in the plan. So there shouldn't be anything extraordinary that would happen from a financial standpoint. Mark?"

So I think I'd like to just take a moment to talk about what, broadly, large-scale buyers want and need. And we are feeling very good about the fact that our message is resonating and we posted some substantial wins here",285,"Yes, Sheryl, and Larry, thank you. So I think I'd like to just take a moment to talk about what, broadly, large-scale buyers want and need. And we are feeling very good about the fact that our message is resonating and we posted some substantial wins here recently, and it's not by accident. Large buyers have a set of complicated needs, but first and foremost, they need a flexible and proven technology partner and engine to drive their PBM benefit. They obviously need market-clearing economics, and prices -- price matters. But our model providing superior service and really focusing on quality and then marrying our data analytics and our synchronization capability, these are really the reasons that our message is resonating. And then finally, if someone's going to make a bet on a big transition, you have to have a track record of executing on large-scale conversions or transitions, and this combined business has that. As you know, there was a very large scale transition several years ago in OptumRx, and in our prior business at Catamaran, we bought and integrated 8 companies. And so the notion of a heavy lift and making large-scale implementations happen is something that we know how to do. So we're feeling really good about the balance of the year and the work plan in place to implement these flawlessly. If you look back on our 1/1/16, where we also had a good number of new client wins, we got great channel checks on our implementation work because that's the heart and soul of this business. You have to do well. It all starts with a successful implementation, and we do know what to do. So thanks for the question."

I think we see them both in combination with UnitedHealthcare, as Austin mentioned earlier, in the areas of the long-term self-services [ph] or IDD populations. Those populations continue to kind of be driven into Managed Care in some way with the behavioral piece. So we see plenty of opportunity there. There are also other states which are looking to do that on a direct basis, and so we compete on a regular basis and have a robust pipeline today, specifically in the direct market, with some of these states as they look to build it. So we see that as a continuing growth opportunity for us."

So when we -- we look at all of our indicators, and all are in line with what we are expecting. And 3 of the -- what I'll call the top metrics that we engage with to see how the growth is going, one would be our qualified sales pipeline, and I brought that up a few minutes ago in the script. And I'll just tell you that from an overall year-over-year standpoint, our qualified sales pipeline, which is a very diverse pipeline, is double the size of what it was this time last year. Obviously, number two is that backlog that we were talking about, where we're up 15%, that $11.3 billion. Obviously, that's another key indicator. And I think the third one is even a stronger one, and that's our -- what I'll call our closed sales and how we look at the total contract value on that. And we're up 80% at the end of the second quarter, and that 80% is going against the entire year of 2015. So I'm doing an 80% above on contracted -- total contracted revenue for Optum, 80% above what was done in the entire year of 2015. So obviously, the sales pipeline, the closed sales and the backlog, that's going to give us a jump-start into 2017. So we're feeling very good about where we stand right now.

And that prevailing confidence comes from -- if you even look at Q1 and Q2, they were marked by some of the largest software deals we've done. Those are piled into the backlog. We see more of that coming down the pipe in the future. Number two, if you just look at the velocity, the sheer numbers, the size of it, as Larry noted, it is at breakneck pace. And then third, if you kind of look at the nature and the demographics of that, just our activity in the pipeline in general, we are the recipient of more RFPs than we've ever been. We are engaging in strategic conversations with more constituencies at a faster pace than we ever had, and that includes health providers, health plans, governments, employers and, certainly, pharma. And then also, I would think that the interesting part about it is the comprehensive nature of the -- many of the opportunities in that pipeline. They're very big. They're long in their duration, and they are really aligned with what we always expressed in terms of these deeper and more comprehensive relationships. And there is a fair amount of it that's marked by analytics, too. That's a growth market for us. If you look at the demographics in there and you look at kind of the way we set up in the analytics market, it's clear that we're going to see growth there. The pipeline reflects that, and I think we have distinguished ourselves very well in the analytics front, on the revenue management front, payment integrity. So it's a very diverse, sort of boundary-less pipeline that I think bodes well for the rest of the year and certainly into '17."

And then if Larry or Jack want to comment as well, please feel free to do so. I think John Rex, in his new role, we'll see a positive, great job responding to our overall capital priorities. But I think, as has been consistent over time, we have allocated about  50% of our capital to growth and about 50% of our capital to returning to shareholders. And you can see that it's strongly biased towards the dividend right now as we seek to also pay down our debt and get our leverage ratio down to 40%. That 50% on M&A, we really didn't touch on a whole lot, and our priorities remain pretty consistent as they have been. As you can see, we have been investing significantly in Optum, and you can see the returns of that, which have been extensive. I think the team has done a fantastic job of driving nice returns on the invested capital base that we put in place there. Two of those areas were the MedExpress platform, which is the urgent care platform, which supports the notion of us providing better quality, more consumer-responsive and higher-value care and, in this case, happens to be in the ambulatory setting. We said that, that was a foundational investment in MedExpress. And I think, as you knew at the time, we would continue to invest in opening new locations in that business over time. And as you can imagine, with de novo start-ups, they tend to create a little bit of a drag on earnings, particularly as you're just getting going in the early stages of that. Your instincts are right. I mean they kind of tie into the trend conversation that Dan discussed as well, which is we're seeing a higher utilization of ER. And of course, the care setting and the urgent care, we believe, is much more effective and will help to obviate costs not only for UnitedHealthcare but across all the payers that Optum serves. Another area of priority for us is to continue to invest in the Optum Care business. Larry laid out quite nicely, I believe, the 75 markets that we want to pursue, which constitute about 80% of all health care. And one of the areas in which we're pursuing that is through the development of physician practices and services in those markets, and we have an initial foundation of that, I believe, about $10 billion of revenue or so. On a combined basis, we serve over 7 million patients, and we have a nice growing business, I believe, in some stages of some 25-plus markets so far. And our activities there continue, and we'll continue to deploy capital in that area and continue to pursue that development of our business in that primary care setting. Larry, do you want to add?"

Ana, in the Optum Care care delivery business, we're certainly in the early innings of building this.

For second quarter 2016, UnitedHealth Group revenues grew 28.2% year-over-year to $46.5 billion, with all domestic lines posting double-digit growth as we grew to serve 132 million unique individuals. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.96 per share grew 13.3% year-over-year. Medical cost trends remained steady and consistent with the outlook we shared as we began the year, and operating costs remained well controlled. 
Last quarter, we updated you on our intent in 2017 to participate in only a handful of ACA-compliant individual markets, what we refer to as the ""exchange market"". That effort is on track and we do not expect any meaningful financial exposure on 2017 business from the 3 or fewer exchange markets where we currently plan to remain. 
Our second quarter includes an incremental $200 million in full year 2016 exchange market losses fully absorbed in these results. Along with what we absorbed last quarter, first half 2016 results reflect an incremental $325 million in full year losses beyond the expectation established as we entered the year. 
Looking at the company overall. We intend to carry strong 2016 business momentum into 2017 that will include investing in and improving our competitiveness for the years beyond 2017. We will balance these investments with our commitment to provide returns to shareholders through growth in earnings per share and dividend. We will lay out a strongly positive and detailed view of 2017 later this year and address questions at that time. 
We'll now turn the call to Larry Renfro to discuss Optum's strong second quarter performance, then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group overall. Larry?"

Optum's second quarter results continued to build on the exceptional growth trends, earning results and operating performance metrics we have achieved for the last several years. Second quarter revenues exceeded $20 billion, increasing 52%",614,"Thanks, Steve. Optum's second quarter results continued to build on the exceptional growth trends, earning results and operating performance metrics we have achieved for the last several years. Second quarter revenues exceeded $20 billion, increasing 52% over last year. OptumRx revenues expanded 69% to $15.1 billion. OptumHealth and OptumInsight combined grew their top line to $5.8 billion, growth of 20% over last year. 
Optum earned more than $1.2 billion in the second quarter, with all segments reporting earnings growth of 20% or more. First half 2016 earnings from operations exceeded $2.3 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the first half of 2015, an increase of 47%. As expected, first half 2016 earnings results represent just over 40% of Optum's full year outlook. 
OptumInsight's revenue backlog grew 15% or $1.5 billion to $11.3 billion, with growth particularly strong in revenue management, technology and government services. OptumHealth grew to over 80 million consumers, up 6% over last year, while OptumRx is tracking well to its target of managing 1 billion adjusted scripts this year. 
The pipeline opportunities we are discussing with existing and prospective customers are increasingly more strategic. We are being asked to help fundamentally change and improve core business operations, rather than simply respond to traditional RFPs or single-point solutions. Today, the average award size for OptumHealth and OptumInsight is more than double what it was just a few years ago. And Optum's qualified sales pipeline continues to grow strongly in both opportunity size and quality. 
Last quarter, we discussed with you in some detail our vision for the next-generation pharmacy care services business. So far this year, OptumRx has been honored to receive new external business awards for January 2017 covering more than 1.7 million people, an increase of 40% over last year's sales result at this point in the year, and the selling season continues. Sophisticated buyers are embracing our modern and innovative approaches to data and proprietary analytics, consumer engagement and service, specialty pharmacy and clinical programs that integrate to improve overall patient health. 
A second high-potential area is the health financial services market. Independent estimates project market growth of more than 20% per year as the number of people using health benefit accounts expands and their account balances increase. Optum's health financial services business aligns with the company's efforts to help consumers navigate and use the entire health care system more effectively. 
Optum financial services serves consumers through 3 million health financial accounts with approximately $7 billion in assets under management by year-end 2016. And there are expanding opportunities in this area and others to simplify the consumer health care experience, incent prevention and wellness and provide consumers with deeper insights and more control as they seek to optimize their personal health and manage their health-related finances throughout their lives. 
The consistent theme in these examples and in Optum's performance, quarter by quarter, is that customers are embracing Optum's innovative approaches to making health care work better. We bring to market 4 things: seasoned people, experienced operators committing to helping solve our clients' complex challenges; proven technology, specifically technology-enabled solutions and tools to power clients' processes and operations; unique data assets and analytics, we help clients gain insights and make better decisions and take better actions on multiple levels; action and results, we have the flexibility and focus to respond quickly and execute our tasks accurately for those we serve. Optum is uniquely positioned to serve as a valuable data-enabled health services company in a growing $1 trillion global marketplace, a company serving all stakeholders across the health care system: consumers, health plans, life sciences companies, governments, employers and health care providers.

Broad, diversified growth and strong forward momentum also continued at UnitedHealthcare again this quarter.

Broad, diversified growth and strong forward momentum also continued at UnitedHealthcare again this quarter. UnitedHealthcare is passionate about modernizing and enriching the consumer experience and continues to advance new approaches to simplify that experience for the people we serve. 
Second quarter Medicare & Retirement revenues grew nearly 14% to $14.3 billion. Strong retention and growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement yielded net growth of nearly 0.5 million people year-to-date. Growth in Medicare is being driven by dependable products that offer clear value and serve people in simple and caring ways. For instance, while seniors are on the phone with us for other reasons, we will encourage and schedule hundreds of thousands of doctors' appointments for them this year. Home visits by our HouseCalls nurses will be up 20% year-over-year to over 1.2 million in 2016. 
Activities such as these, along with consistent approaches around benefits, products, network engagement and tailored service, meaningfully improve care quality, the consumer experience and customer retention. From these and other activities, we expect to serve a significantly higher percentage of our Medicare Advantage members through 4-star plans in 2017. This was a big lift by our people and care delivery partners, and I am grateful to all of them for what they have achieved on behalf of those we serve. 
Strong organic growth continues in Medicaid as well with revenues up 14.7% to $8.3 billion as UnitedHealthcare Community & State served 225,000 more people in the second quarter. This past quarter's growth includes new members in Iowa and expanded services in New York, and we were awarded additional markets in Pennsylvania for next year as part of that state's program expansion. 
Importantly, Medicaid revenue growth also reflects a stronger mix as states continue to ask us to help them serve more people with more complex health care needs. We now serve nearly 5.7 million people through state-sponsored health care programs, and we expect to grow -- that growth to continue as we advance innovations to help states better serve their most complex and higher-cost citizens, meeting their needs with more integrated social services built around their health. 
Our Employer & Individual business revenues also grew 14% to $13.5 billion in the second quarter. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve nearly 400,000 more people in commercial benefits through the first 6 months of the year outside of the exchange market products. This is strongly favorable to the initial growth forecasts for both self-funded and full-risk offerings. 
Turning to medical costs. We reported a care ratio of 82% this quarter, which is 30 basis points year-over-year -- a 30 basis point year-over-year increase, primarily due to adverse exchange market performance and the relative levels of claim reserve development in the quarter offset by strong underlying core performance by the rest of our UnitedHealthcare businesses. Year-to-date, favorable prior year reserve development was $300 million as compared to $130 million in the first half of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, reserves developed unfavorably by $100 million. Of this, $60 million relates to items that predate 2016 and do not impact 2016 core medical trends, such as 2013 and 2014 Medicaid and Medicare true-ups and settlements. The current year portion of development relates to exchange market products. Beyond this component, the current year development in the second quarter was favorable. 
Commercial medical trend remains consistent with the original outlook of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Hospital inpatient admissions per person are lower year-over-year across all UnitedHealthcare businesses. Like most years, there are pockets of higher cost trends, including specialty pharmacy and the increasing use of ER and outpatient services this year. Overall, health care cost trends remain in line and controlled. 
Bringing these items together, in the second quarter, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues by $4.5 billion or 13.6% on a year-over-year basis. The business grew by 320,000 domestic consumers in the quarter and has added more than 1.6 million consumers year-to-date. UnitedHealthcare generated nearly $2 billion in operating earnings in the quarter despite the pressures from exchange market products and the second quarter prior year reserve development we just described. 
Stepping back, UnitedHealthcare has delivered steady, distinguished organic growth consistently for more than half a decade, and here's how we're doing it. We help people achieve better health by using our data and analytics to simplify decision-making and to help them access the care they need. We work with physicians and hospitals, sharing information to help them make fact-based decisions about the care they provide. And we focus every day on improving the quality of our execution in every interaction and process for the people we engage with and serve as well as those who provide their care. UnitedHealthcare, still with only a modest national share in a growing health care benefits market, expects to drive further growth by delivering on these commitments better and better every day, every quarter and every year. 
Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Cash flows from operations in the second quarter was $1.7 billion or about 1x net income compared to 0.7x net income in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations of $4 billion was 1.2x net income, also ahead of last year's pace. The company repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1 billion in the first half of 2016. 
Our Board of Directors increased the dividend in June by 25% to an annual rate of $2.50 per share. We will return nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders in dividends payments in the next 12 months. The debt to total capital ratio declined to 48% and we expect it will continue to decline in the second half of this year as we work back to a target in the 40% range. 
Reflecting our performance for the first 6 months of 2016, overall growth and results have been favorable across the businesses. However, our exchange market growth is also above our original estimates as are the corresponding losses. 
Prudently balancing this overall performance, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $7.80 to $7.95 from the former $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We believe this to be an appropriate posture given the performance backdrop of the exchange business even as the core businesses have performed strongly. 
As we consider the balance of 2016, we expect the combination of costs to set up new business for 2017 and ongoing investments in growth areas, such as MedExpress, Optum Care and international, along with strong seasonal fourth quarter earnings performance from Optum, will produce approximately equal adjusted earnings per share results in each of the last 2 quarters of this year.

As we have discussed in recent conversations, we believe we are in the early stages of a unique era for UnitedHealth Group, looking ahead toward what may be the best and most important decade of performance for this enterprise. We serve growing markets that are seeking better performance in health care, both in the U.S. and globally. We continue to strengthen and align enterprise capabilities to meet these needs. And we are intensely focused on the quality and consistency of the experience we deliver to our consumers, customers, benefit sponsors and care providers. 
On this latter point, we have the opportunity to evolve and differentiate our enterprise in the coming years by focusing intensely on redefining the quality and value of the health care experience for those we serve and, importantly, objectively measuring the impact of these efforts and recalibrating and enhancing our performance as we advance. With this focus, paired with evolving capabilities and the strong market positions of our growing diversified portfolio of businesses, we expect to drive differentiated growth for years to come. These efforts will help people live healthier lives and make health systems work better for everyone. As a company, we're committed to making the most of this period of opportunity.

So as you pointed out, it is a bit early to provide any detail but I can give you some high-level perspective and direction. We clearly want to build on the momentum that we're experiencing right now in 2016. So our objective is to continue to offer stability in our benefits including premiums. There will be some enhancements where we think that's appropriate. It's obviously a market-by-market conversation, but overall, stability in both benefits and premiums. And this is driven in large part by the great improvement that we've been experiencing in our Star performance, particularly for 2017. And then we're going to continue on the innovations around the member experience, our clinical programs, and we think this well positions us for growth in both the individual and the group Medicare Advantage products, and particularly on the group side, experiencing really strong sales and retention for 2017. With respect to the insurance fee and the moratorium there, I think it's important to think about that in the context of the overall funding equation. As you know, this program's been underfunded, 14% rate cut since 2010 and continues to be underfunded relative to medical costs. So our goal, as Steve mentioned, is to provide stability and valuable benefits to the seniors. And it's a very effective program that continues to drive costs down and improve outcomes, and satisfaction's really high. So our perspective and approach has been, after we take this into the overall funding equation, we're going to share a portion of it, obviously, with the provider partners and employer groups in the group MA space, and then passing on a meaningful amount to our members in the form of stable benefits and again, enhancing where we can. So I think that provides a perspective. And again, we're just -- we're really feeling great about the position of this business and the opportunities as we head into 2017 and beyond."

That question was comprehensive. So just to re-baseline on the individual ACA. So our expectation coming into the year was that, on a policy-year basis, we would lose somewhere in the area of $525 million. We had done a premium deficiency reserve at the end of the year of $245 million to partially offset that. So the net of those 2 was about a $280 million impact to 2016 earnings performance. And then in the first quarter, we strengthened that or increased the lost expectation by $125 million and then, likewise, added an additional $200 million in the second quarter fully recognized in the quarter in terms of the expectation on the full year. So when you put that all together, it's a shade over $600 million of P&L impact to 2016. As you look at what's driving the increase inside that, so for the quarter, the $200 million that we've added, it's a combination of 2 things: It's really more volume and higher consumption. And I'd break it down, about 1/3 of that is higher volume, so we've got higher sales as well as more moderate attrition than we had expected; and 2/3 is really around the consumption as, obviously, we had unfavorable development on our exchanges relating to the first quarter in the second that came with higher second quarter costs, and we've also let that inform our full year outlook. So 2/3 of that $200 million really relates to the underlying consumption. And what's changing underneath that, to your question, the reality is the severity of chronic conditions inside the population actually increased on a year-over-year basis. If you look at the prevalence of chronic disease, things like HIV and hepatitis C, diabetes, COPD, those are examples of things that the prevalence was high to begin with in 2015, and that has increased into 2016. So that's what's informing our view. As you think about 2017, I would tell you of that $605 million and the math I went through previously, a good, meaningful portion of that will contribute to our 2017 performance. Some of the things offsetting that are certainly some semi-variable and fixed costs associated with this business that don't go away as we shrink our footprint in 2017."

So when you look at the portfolio of things that resolve in a given quarter, there are always some things that change period to period. As it relates to the second quarter, as Dave mentioned, we experienced $100 million of unfavorable reserve development, and that was split 60% on the prior year and 40% on the current year. As you look at that prior year element, there isn't anything individually large. There's a collection of things, and I'd tell you that was a blend of some old provider settlements as well as, as Dave mentioned, some government true-ups, some of them dating back 3 years, particularly around Part D as you resolve the intersection between claims and corridors and reinsurance and programs inside that. So those are things that contributed to that prior year element. Importantly, though, those are all things that, frankly, don't have any bearing on our current-year medical trend and medical outlook. And as it relates to the current-year component, that obviously -- well, more than all of that was related to the individual ACA book of business. Absent that, we actually had favorable development related to the current year in the quarter.

And when we did that -- we had a lot of reasons we did the business and a couple of them I thought might be important to call out in regard to your question, and one was around the complementary strengths that we had. And that was the retail and the mail focus in those business coming together as well as payers and employers coming together. But probably, the most complementary was the technology, and we've been able to get that put in place. The value proposition, and that's what I think you're starting to see now, the expanded services, the scale as well as synchronization, is starting to take hold and it's resonating in the industry.

And I think if you look at how we're attacking this, this last quarter has been a real differentiator for us. As Larry said, the combination here for us was all about scale, and it is intended to take to the supply chain. So as a much bigger business, we're talking about drug pricing every day to the biotech companies and to the pharmaceutical companies bringing product to the market. And the way we contract with them is to protect our clients as best we can from some of these price increases. Obviously, price can be addressed by regulatory issues, but also just by better management of the drug benefits. So we use our tools like formulary, like specialty steerage, like preferred and exclusionary networks to drive price down. And in large part, this is what's defining us right now. Our -- we've reached a scale where we've obviously taken the drug spend that we manage for our clients to the supply chain and a differentiated model to drive down and contain, to the best of our ability, drug prices. And so rather than talk on a political stage about how to get after drug pricing, we're using the tools that we've deployed here and integrating them with better medical management in the broader Optum chassis. So we do think we have a differentiated model, a better way to get after drug price and drug cost management, combining both the technology platform that Larry talked about and really the leading clinical management platform in the broader Optum.

First of all, as far as the pipeline, as I think we've mentioned a couple of times earlier in the year, we see a very robust pipeline. We expect to respond to about 20 RFPs this year that will be implemented over the next 3 years. Many of those, and I think this is a really important piece, continue to include, and Dave mentioned this in his comments, more and more populations with complex needs. That gives us an awful lot of confidence because when you look at the combined capabilities of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, that really is in our wheelhouse. That's really where we can provide a tremendous amount of value to the consumer as well as our state partners. So we see that continuing. The Pennsylvania LTSS opportunity is just one example of that. We'll see Virginia as another example of that; Oklahoma, another example. So you're going to see a continued increase in these very costly populations. Keep in mind when you back up and look at the macro story here, you got $500 billion of spend in the Medicaid space. You got about 70% of the membership in Managed Care today but only about 41% of the dollars. So when you talk about confidence in the pipeline and opportunity to grow, that's really where that opportunity sits. Coupled with that, still some greenfield states. There are 15 states that don't have Managed Care today, some very large like North Carolina, where we've been successful in working with the state to get legislation passed, and that market will continue to develop. So again, I think it squares up very nicely with our capabilities and marks the road for a very good growth opportunity going forward. In regard to Iowa, first and foremost, we're very pleased with the implementation. It's been going very well. We've stayed very focused on job 1, which is taking care of the folks we've been entrusted to do so. And we have built a very good relationship with the state. As you know, it's -- we're 1 quarter in so it's very early, so -- too early to really comment on what we're seeing.

So first and foremost, just as a reminder, coming into the year, our expectation was for a moderate increase in underlying utilization trend. That's what informed our pricing, our benefit planning as well as the guidance we provided, and that's what we were able to manage to in the second quarter, very consistent with our conversation in the first quarter and very much in line with our expectation. Just kind of looking at how trends progress through the year. Typically, we talk in annual terms, but as we look to the quarters, we certainly don't view Q2 use as having accelerated beyond the Q1 rate. If anything, I'd probably tell you that Q2 is perhaps a little bit lower. To your questions about the categories themselves, the bigger drivers of our trend are certainly in pharmacy and outpatient, as Dave mentioned, and then working against that as -- more moderate levels of trend as we drive down per-capita use on an inpatient basis. The pharmacy piece, I would tell you that's largely driven by hepatitis C. So we've changed our coverage criteria effective 1/1 of 2016 in our commercial business. So we expanded coverage, and that's what's really driving that 8% to 9% pharmacy trend on a commercial basis that we talked about back at the investor conference. And then as you look to the outpatient side, inside there we see elevated levels of emergency room. Surgical procedures are contributing, also facility-based -- facility-dispensed prescriptions. So that's kind of oriented more around the oncology space. So those are some of the bigger contributors, and not surprisingly, that is absolutely where our medical management efforts are focused, to work down those costs. All of those categories, I will tell you, are within the ranges that we expressed at the investor conference, probably a little bit higher on the outpatient side, in line on the pharmacy, pace, a little bit better on the inpatient side. But net-net, we still expect, on a commercial basis, our full year medical trend to be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points."

As you know, there was a very large scale transition several years ago in OptumRx and in our prior business at Catamaran, we bought and integrated 8 companies. And so the notion of a heavy lift and making large-scale implementations happen is something that we know how to do. So we're feeling really good about the balance of the year and the work plan in place to implement these flawlessly. If you look back on our 1/1/16, where we also had a good number of new client wins, we got great channel checks on our implementation work because that's the heart and soul of this business. You have to do well. It all starts with a successful implementation, and we do know what to do. So thanks for the question."

I think when we look at behavioral health and we look at the Medicaid market in particular, we see a number of opportunities. I think we see them both in combination with UnitedHealthcare, as Austin mentioned earlier, in the areas of the long-term social services or IDD population. Those populations continue to kind of be driven into Managed Care in some way with the behavioral piece. So we see plenty of opportunity there. There are also other states which are looking to do that on a direct basis, and so we compete on a regular basis and have a robust pipeline today, specifically in the direct market, with some of these states as they look to build it. So we see that as a continuing growth opportunity for us."

And I'll just tell you that from an overall year-over-year standpoint, our qualified sales pipeline, which is a very diverse pipeline, is double the size of what it was this time last year. Obviously, number two is that backlog that we were talking about, where we're up 15%, that $11.3 billion. Obviously, that's another key indicator. And I think the third one is even a stronger one, and that's our -- what I'll call our closed sales and how we look at the total contract value on that. And we're up 80% at the end of the second quarter, and that 80% is going against the entire year of 2015. So I'm doing an 80% above on contracted -- total contracted revenue for Optum, 80% above what was done in the entire year of 2015.

And that prevailing confidence comes from -- if you even look at Q1 and Q2, they were marked by some of the largest software deals we've done. Those have piled into the backlog. We see more of that coming down the pipe in the future. Number two, if you just look at the velocity, the sheer numbers, the size of it, as Larry noted, it is at breakneck pace. And then third, if you kind of look at the nature and the demographics of that, just our activity in the pipeline in general, we are the recipients of more RFPs than we've ever been. We are engaging in strategic conversations with more constituencies at a faster pace than we ever had, and that includes health providers, health plans, governments, employers and, certainly, pharma. And then also, I would think that the interesting part about it is the comprehensive nature of the -- many of the opportunities in that pipeline. They're very big. They're long in their duration, and they are really aligned with what we always expressed in terms of these deeper and more comprehensive relationships. And there is a fair amount of it that's marked by analytics, too. That's a growth market for us. If you look at the demographics in there and you look at kind of the way we set up in the analytics market, it's clear that we're going to see growth there. The pipeline reflects that, and I think we have distinguished ourselves very well on the analytics front, on the revenue managed front, payment integrity. So it's a very diverse, sort of boundary-less pipeline that I think bodes well for the rest of the year and certainly into '17."

And then if Larry or Jack want to comment as well, please feel free to do so. I think John Rex, in his new role as CFO, did a great job responding to our overall capital priorities. But I think, as has been consistent over time, we have allocated about 50% of our capital to growth and about 50% of our capital to returning to shareholders. And you can see that it's strongly biased towards the dividend right now as we seek to also pay down our debt and get our leverage ratio down to 40%. That 50% on M&A, we really didn't touch on a whole lot and our priorities remain pretty consistent as they have been. As you can see, we have been investing significantly in Optum, and you can see the returns of that, which have been extensive. I think the team has done a fantastic job of driving nice returns on the invested capital base that we've put in place there. Two of those areas were the MedExpress platform, which is the urgent care platform, which supports the notion of us providing better quality, more consumer-responsive and higher-value care and, in this case, happens to be in the ambulatory setting. We said that, that was a foundational investment in MedExpress. And I think, as you knew at the time, we would continue to invest in opening new locations in that business over time. And as you can imagine, with de novo start-ups, they tend to create a little bit of a drag on earnings, particularly as you're just getting going in the early stages of that. Your instincts are right and they kind of tie into the trend conversation that Dan discussed as well, which is we're seeing a higher utilization of ER. And of course, the care setting and the urgent care, we believe, is much more effective and will help to obviate costs, not only for UnitedHealthcare but across all the payers that Optum serves. Another area of priority for us is to continue to invest in the Optum Care business. Larry laid out quite nicely, I believe, the 75 markets that we want to pursue, which constitute about 80% of all health care. And one of the areas in which we're pursuing that is through the development of physician practices and services in those markets, and we have an initial foundation of that, I believe, about $10 billion of revenue or so. On a combined basis, we serve over 7 million patients, and we have a nice growing business, I believe, in some stages of some 25-plus markets so far. And our activities there continue, and we'll continue to deploy capital in that area and continue to pursue that development of our business in that primary care setting. Larry, do you want to add?"

So we have been hard at work at that. And we continue to see good receptivity, and we're going to be at it for certainly the balance of 2016 and 2017.

For full year 2016, both UnitedHealthcare and Optum continue to grow at a vibrant place. The outlook for net earnings, cash flows and return on capital remains strong and consistent with our recent commentary. The steady advancement of innovative market-responsive products, services and experiences has led to balanced organic gains across virtually all of our businesses. We believe our businesses remain well positioned for continued broad-based growth for the balance of 2016, for 2017 and in the years to come. As we reflect on this quarter's performance, we once again see exceptional growth, improved customer retention and important new business awards and opportunities leading to continued advances in both revenue backlog and sales pipelines. 
For second quarter 2016, UnitedHealth Group revenues grew 28.2% year-over-year to $46.5 billion, with all domestic lines posting double-digit growth as we grew to serve 132 million unique individuals. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.96 per share grew 13.3% year-over-year. Medical cost trends remained steady and consistent with the outlook we shared as we began the year, and operating costs remained well controlled. 
Last quarter, we updated you on our intent in 2017 to participate in only a handful of ACA-compliant individual markets, what we refer to as the ""exchange market"". That effort is on track and we do not expect any meaningful financial exposure on 2017 business from the 3 or fewer exchange markets where we currently plan to remain. 
Our second quarter includes an incremental $200 million in full year 2016 exchange market losses fully absorbed in these results. Along with what we absorbed last quarter, first half 2016 results reflect an incremental $325 million in full year losses beyond the expectation established as we entered the year. 
Looking at the company overall. We intend to carry strong 2016 business momentum into 2017 that will include investing in and improving our competitiveness for the years beyond 2017. We will balance these investments with our commitment to provide returns to shareholders through growth in earnings per share and dividend. We will lay out a strongly positive and detailed view of 2017 later this year and address questions at that time. 
We'll now turn the call to Larry Renfro to discuss Optum's strong second quarter performance, then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group overall. Larry?"

OptumInsight's revenue backlog grew 15% or $1.5 billion to $11.3 billion, with growth particularly strong in revenue management, technology and government services. OptumHealth grew to over 80 million consumers, up 6% over last year, while OptumRx is tracking well to its target of managing 1 billion adjusted scripts this year. 
The pipeline opportunities we are discussing with existing and prospective customers are increasingly more strategic. We are being asked to help fundamentally change and improve core business operations, rather than simply respond to traditional RFPs or single-point solutions. Today, the average award size for OptumHealth and OptumInsight is more than double what it was just a few years ago. And Optum's qualified sales pipeline continues to grow strongly in both opportunity size and quality. 
Last quarter, we discussed with you in some detail our vision for the next-generation pharmacy care services business. So far this year, OptumRx has been honored to receive new external business awards for January 2017 covering more than 1.7 million people, an increase of 40% over last year's sales result at this point in the year, and the selling season continues. Sophisticated buyers are embracing our modern and innovative approaches to data and proprietary analytics, consumer engagement and service, specialty pharmacy and clinical programs that integrate to improve overall patient health. 
A second high-potential area is the health financial services market. Independent estimates project market growth of more than 20% per year as the number of people using health benefit accounts expands and their account balances increase. Optum's health financial services business aligns with the company's efforts to help consumers navigate and use the entire health care system more effectively. 
Optum financial services serves consumers through 3 million health financial accounts with approximately $7 billion in assets under management by year-end 2016. And there are expanding opportunities in this area and others to simplify the consumer health care experience, incent prevention and wellness and provide consumers with deeper insights and more control as they seek to optimize their personal health and manage their health-related finances throughout their lives. 
The consistent theme in these examples and in Optum's performance, quarter by quarter, is that customers are embracing Optum's innovative approaches to making health care work better. We bring to market 4 things: seasoned people, experienced operators committing to helping solve our clients' complex challenges; proven technology, specifically technology-enabled solutions and tools to power clients' processes and operations; unique data assets and analytics, we help clients gain insights and make better decisions and take better actions on multiple levels; action and results, we have the flexibility and focus to respond quickly and execute our tasks accurately for those we serve. Optum is uniquely positioned to serve as a valuable data-enabled health services company in a growing $1 trillion global marketplace, a company serving all stakeholders across the health care system: consumers, health plans, life sciences companies, governments, employers and health care providers.

Broad, diversified growth and strong forward momentum also continued at UnitedHealthcare again this quarter. UnitedHealthcare is passionate about modernizing and enriching the consumer experience and continues to advance new approaches to simplify that experience for the people we serve. 
Second quarter Medicare & Retirement revenues grew nearly 14% to $14.3 billion. Strong retention and growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement yielded net growth of nearly 0.5 million people year-to-date. Growth in Medicare is being driven by dependable products that offer clear value and serve people in simple and caring ways. For instance, while seniors are on the phone with us for other reasons, we will encourage and schedule hundreds of thousands of doctors' appointments for them this year. Home visits by our HouseCalls nurses will be up 20% year-over-year to over 1.2 million in 2016. 
Activities such as these, along with consistent approaches around benefits, products, network engagement and tailored service, meaningfully improve care quality, the consumer experience and customer retention. From these and other activities, we expect to serve a significantly higher percentage of our Medicare Advantage members through 4-star plans in 2017. This was a big lift by our people and care delivery partners, and I am grateful to all of them for what they have achieved on behalf of those we serve. 
Strong organic growth continues in Medicaid as well with revenues up 14.7% to $8.3 billion as UnitedHealthcare Community & State served 225,000 more people in the second quarter. This past quarter's growth includes new members in Iowa and expanded services in New York, and we were awarded additional markets in Pennsylvania for next year as part of that state's program expansion. 
Importantly, Medicaid revenue growth also reflects a stronger mix as states continue to ask us to help them serve more people with more complex health care needs. We now serve nearly 5.7 million people through state-sponsored health care programs, and we expect to grow -- that growth to continue as we advance innovations to help states better serve their most complex and higher-cost citizens, meeting their needs with more integrated social services built around their health. 
Our Employer & Individual business revenues also grew 14% to $13.5 billion in the second quarter. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve nearly 400,000 more people in commercial benefits through the first 6 months of the year outside of the exchange market products. This is strongly favorable to the initial growth forecasts for both self-funded and full-risk offerings. 
Turning to medical costs. We reported a care ratio of 82% this quarter, which is 30 basis points year-over-year -- a 30 basis point year-over-year increase, primarily due to adverse exchange market performance and the relative levels of claim reserve development in the quarter offset by strong underlying core performance by the rest of our UnitedHealthcare businesses. Year-to-date, favorable prior year reserve development was $300 million as compared to $130 million in the first half of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, reserves developed unfavorably by $100 million. Of this, $60 million relates to items that predate 2016 and do not impact 2016 core medical trends, such as 2013 and 2014 Medicaid and Medicare true-ups and settlements. The current year portion of development relates to exchange market products. Beyond this component, the current year development in the second quarter was favorable. 
Commercial medical trend remains consistent with the original outlook of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Hospital inpatient admissions per person are lower year-over-year across all UnitedHealthcare businesses. Like most years, there are pockets of higher cost trends, including specialty pharmacy and the increasing use of ER and outpatient services this year. Overall, health care cost trends remain in line and controlled. 
Bringing these items together, in the second quarter, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues by $4.5 billion or 13.6% on a year-over-year basis. The business grew by 320,000 domestic consumers in the quarter and has added more than 1.6 million consumers year-to-date. UnitedHealthcare generated nearly $2 billion in operating earnings in the quarter despite the pressures from exchange market products and the second quarter prior year reserve development we just described. 
Stepping back, UnitedHealthcare has delivered steady, distinguished organic growth consistently for more than half a decade, and here's how we're doing it. We help people achieve better health by using our data and analytics to simplify decision-making and to help them access the care they need. We work with physicians and hospitals, sharing information to help them make fact-based decisions about the care they provide. And we focus every day on improving the quality of our execution in every interaction and process for the people we engage with and serve as well as those who provide their care. UnitedHealthcare, still with only a modest national share in a growing health care benefits market, expects to drive further growth by delivering on these commitments better and better every day, every quarter and every year. 
Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Cash flows from operations in the second quarter was $1.7 billion or about 1x net income compared to 0.7x net income in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations of $4 billion was 1.2x net income, also ahead of last year's pace. The company repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1 billion in the first half of 2016. 
Our Board of Directors increased the dividend in June by 25% to an annual rate of $2.50 per share. We will return nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders in dividends payments in the next 12 months. The debt to total capital ratio declined to 48% and we expect it will continue to decline in the second half of this year as we work back to a target in the 40% range. 
Reflecting our performance for the first 6 months of 2016, overall growth and results have been favorable across the businesses. However, our exchange market growth is also above our original estimates as are the corresponding losses. 
Prudently balancing this overall performance, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $7.80 to $7.95 from the former $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We believe this to be an appropriate posture given the performance backdrop of the exchange business even as the core businesses have performed strongly. 
As we consider the balance of 2016, we expect the combination of costs to set up new business for 2017 and ongoing investments in growth areas, such as MedExpress, Optum Care and international, along with strong seasonal fourth quarter earnings performance from Optum, will produce approximately equal adjusted earnings per share results in each of the last 2 quarters of this year.

As we have discussed in recent conversations, we believe we are in the early stages of a unique era for UnitedHealth Group, looking ahead toward what may be the best and most important decade of performance for this enterprise. We serve growing markets that are seeking better performance in health care, both in the U.S. and globally. We continue to strengthen and align enterprise capabilities to meet these needs. And we are intensely focused on the quality and consistency of the experience we deliver to our consumers, customers, benefit sponsors and care providers. 
On this latter point, we have the opportunity to evolve and differentiate our enterprise in the coming years by focusing intensely on redefining the quality and value of the health care experience for those we serve and, importantly, objectively measuring the impact of these efforts and recalibrating and enhancing our performance as we advance. With this focus, paired with evolving capabilities and the strong market positions of our growing diversified portfolio of businesses, we expect to drive differentiated growth for years to come. These efforts will help people live healthier lives and make health systems work better for everyone. As a company, we're committed to making the most of this period of opportunity.

So as you pointed out, it is a bit early to provide any detail but I can give you some high-level perspective and direction. We clearly want to build on the momentum that we're experiencing right now in 2016. So our objective is to continue to offer stability in our benefits including premiums. There will be some enhancements where we think that's appropriate. It's obviously a market-by-market conversation, but overall, stability in both benefits and premiums. And this is driven in large part by the great improvement that we've been experiencing in our Star performance, particularly for 2017. And then we're going to continue on the innovations around the member experience, our clinical programs, and we think this well positions us for growth in both the individual and the group Medicare Advantage products, and particularly on the group side, experiencing really strong sales and retention for 2017. With respect to the insurance fee and the moratorium there, I think it's important to think about that in the context of the overall funding equation. As you know, this program's been underfunded, 14% rate cut since 2010 and continues to be underfunded relative to medical costs. So our goal, as Steve mentioned, is to provide stability and valuable benefits to the seniors. And it's a very effective program that continues to drive costs down and improve outcomes, and satisfaction's really high. So our perspective and approach has been, after we take this into the overall funding equation, we're going to share a portion of it, obviously, with the provider partners and employer groups in the group MA space, and then passing on a meaningful amount to our members in the form of stable benefits and again, enhancing where we can. So I think that provides a perspective. And again, we're just -- we're really feeling great about the position of this business and the opportunities as we head into 2017 and beyond."

That question was comprehensive. So just to re-baseline on the individual ACA. So our expectation coming into the year was that, on a policy-year basis, we would lose somewhere in the area of $525 million. We had done a premium deficiency reserve at the end of the year of $245 million to partially offset that. So the net of those 2 was about a $280 million impact to 2016 earnings performance. And then in the first quarter, we strengthened that or increased the lost expectation by $125 million and then, likewise, added an additional $200 million in the second quarter fully recognized in the quarter in terms of the expectation on the full year. So when you put that all together, it's a shade over $600 million of P&L impact to 2016. As you look at what's driving the increase inside that, so for the quarter, the $200 million that we've added, it's a combination of 2 things: It's really more volume and higher consumption. And I'd break it down, about 1/3 of that is higher volume, so we've got higher sales as well as more moderate attrition than we had expected; and 2/3 is really around the consumption as, obviously, we had unfavorable development on our exchanges relating to the first quarter in the second that came with higher second quarter costs, and we've also let that inform our full year outlook. So 2/3 of that $200 million really relates to the underlying consumption. And what's changing underneath that, to your question, the reality is the severity of chronic conditions inside the population actually increased on a year-over-year basis. If you look at the prevalence of chronic disease, things like HIV and hepatitis C, diabetes, COPD, those are examples of things that the prevalence was high to begin with in 2015, and that has increased into 2016. So that's what's informing our view. As you think about 2017, I would tell you of that $605 million and the math I went through previously, a good, meaningful portion of that will contribute to our 2017 performance. Some of the things offsetting that are certainly some semi-variable and fixed costs associated with this business that don't go away as we shrink our footprint in 2017."

So when you look at the portfolio of things that resolve in a given quarter, there are always some things that change period to period. As it relates to the second quarter, as Dave mentioned, we experienced $100 million of unfavorable reserve development, and that was split 60% on the prior year and 40% on the current year. As you look at that prior year element, there isn't anything individually large. There's a collection of things, and I'd tell you that was a blend of some old provider settlements as well as, as Dave mentioned, some government true-ups, some of them dating back 3 years, particularly around Part D as you resolve the intersection between claims and corridors and reinsurance and programs inside that. So those are things that contributed to that prior year element. Importantly, though, those are all things that, frankly, don't have any bearing on our current-year medical trend and medical outlook. And as it relates to the current-year component, that obviously -- well, more than all of that was related to the individual ACA book of business. Absent that, we actually had favorable development related to the current year in the quarter. But importantly, when you put it all together, from a medical cost perspective as well as a trend perspective, outside of the individual ACA, we continue to track in line with our expectations across the platform."

So we believe we're building a sound business and you know how that works. So we've had a good first half. We have hit all the metrics and are set up pretty well for the second half. And so I'll let Tami comment on that."

And I think if you look at how we're attacking this, this last quarter has been a real differentiator for us. As Larry said, the combination here for us was all about scale, and it is intended to take to the supply chain. So as a much bigger business, we're talking about drug pricing every day to the biotech companies and to the pharmaceutical companies bringing product to the market. And the way we contract with them is to protect our clients as best we can from some of these price increases. Obviously, price can be addressed by regulatory issues, but also just by better management of the drug benefits. So we use our tools like formulary, like specialty steerage, like preferred and exclusionary networks to drive price down. And in large part, this is what's defining us right now. Our -- we've reached a scale where we've obviously taken the drug spend that we manage for our clients to the supply chain and a differentiated model to drive down and contain, to the best of our ability, drug prices. And so rather than talk on a political stage about how to get after drug pricing, we're using the tools that we've deployed here and integrating them with better medical management in the broader Optum chassis. So we do think we have a differentiated model, a better way to get after drug price and drug cost management, combining both the technology platform that Larry talked about and really the leading clinical management platform in the broader Optum.

First of all, as far as the pipeline, as I think we've mentioned a couple of times earlier in the year, we see a very robust pipeline. We expect to respond to about 20 RFPs this year that will be implemented over the next 3 years. Many of those, and I think this is a really important piece, continue to include, and Dave mentioned this in his comments, more and more populations with complex needs. That gives us an awful lot of confidence because when you look at the combined capabilities of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, that really is in our wheelhouse. That's really where we can provide a tremendous amount of value to the consumer as well as our state partners. So we see that continuing. The Pennsylvania LTSS opportunity is just one example of that. We'll see Virginia as another example of that; Oklahoma, another example. So you're going to see a continued increase in these very costly populations. Keep in mind when you back up and look at the macro story here, you got $500 billion of spend in the Medicaid space. You got about 70% of the membership in Managed Care today but only about 41% of the dollars. So when you talk about confidence in the pipeline and opportunity to grow, that's really where that opportunity sits. Coupled with that, still some greenfield states. There are 15 states that don't have Managed Care today, some very large like North Carolina, where we've been successful in working with the state to get legislation passed, and that market will continue to develop. So again, I think it squares up very nicely with our capabilities and marks the road for a very good growth opportunity going forward. In regard to Iowa, first and foremost, we're very pleased with the implementation. It's been going very well. We've stayed very focused on job 1, which is taking care of the folks we've been entrusted to do so. And we have built a very good relationship with the state. As you know, it's -- we're 1 quarter in so it's very early, so -- too early to really comment on what we're seeing. Early indications would be that it's in line with our expectations, but again very early."

So first and foremost, just as a reminder, coming into the year, our expectation was for a moderate increase in underlying utilization trend. That's what informed our pricing, our benefit planning as well as the guidance we provided, and that's what we were able to manage to in the second quarter, very consistent with our conversation in the first quarter and very much in line with our expectation. Just kind of looking at how trends progress through the year. Typically, we talk in annual terms, but as we look to the quarters, we certainly don't view Q2 use as having accelerated beyond the Q1 rate. If anything, I'd probably tell you that Q2 is perhaps a little bit lower. To your questions about the categories themselves, the bigger drivers of our trend are certainly in pharmacy and outpatient, as Dave mentioned, and then working against that as -- more moderate levels of trend as we drive down per-capita use on an inpatient basis. The pharmacy piece, I would tell you that's largely driven by hepatitis C. So we've changed our coverage criteria effective 1/1 of 2016 in our commercial business. So we expanded coverage, and that's what's really driving that 8% to 9% pharmacy trend on a commercial basis that we talked about back at the investor conference. And then as you look to the outpatient side, inside there we see elevated levels of emergency room. Surgical procedures are contributing, also facility-based -- facility-dispensed prescriptions. So that's kind of oriented more around the oncology space. So those are some of the bigger contributors, and not surprisingly, that is absolutely where our medical management efforts are focused, to work down those costs. All of those categories, I will tell you, are within the ranges that we expressed at the investor conference, probably a little bit higher on the outpatient side, in line on the pharmacy, pace, a little bit better on the inpatient side. But net-net, we still expect, on a commercial basis, our full year medical trend to be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points."

Large buyers have a set of complicated needs, but first and foremost, they need a flexible and proven technology partner and engine to drive their PBM benefit. They obviously need market-clearing economics, and prices -- price matters. But our model providing superior service and really focusing on quality and then marrying our data analytics and our synchronization capability, these are really the reasons that our message is resonating. And then finally, if someone's going to make a bet on a big transition, you have to have a track record of executing on large-scale conversions or transitions, and this combined business has that. As you know, there was a very large scale transition several years ago in OptumRx and in our prior business at Catamaran, we bought and integrated 8 companies. And so the notion of a heavy lift and making large-scale implementations happen is something that we know how to do. So we're feeling really good about the balance of the year and the work plan in place to implement these flawlessly.

There are also other states which are looking to do that on a direct basis, and so we compete on a regular basis and have a robust pipeline today, specifically in the direct market, with some of these states as they look to build it. So we see that as a continuing growth opportunity for us."

So Mike mentioned this, but the work we continue to do to really integrate our behavioral health with our physical health, really creating a new model that we're calling whole person health, is really an exciting new direction for us. It certainly will bode well for UnitedHealthcare and Optum's growth on that piece of business as well as that external business. In fact, you could probably think of it with a lot of the same attributes that were just discussed around OptumRx, integrating and synchronizing that work with our full clinical model. The same thing applies here. It's a really exciting next step for us."

And 3 of the -- what I'll call the top metrics that we engage with to see how the growth is going, one would be our qualified sales pipeline, and I brought that up a few minutes ago in the script. And I'll just tell you that from an overall year-over-year standpoint, our qualified sales pipeline, which is a very diverse pipeline, is double the size of what it was this time last year. Obviously, number two is that backlog that we were talking about, where we're up 15%, that $11.3 billion. Obviously, that's another key indicator. And I think the third one is even a stronger one, and that's our -- what I'll call our closed sales and how we look at the total contract value on that. And we're up 80% at the end of the second quarter, and that 80% is going against the entire year of 2015. So I'm doing an 80% above on contracted -- total contracted revenue for Optum, 80% above what was done in the entire year of 2015. So obviously, the sales pipeline, the closed sales and the backlog, that's going to give us a jump-start into 2017. So we're feeling very good about where we stand right now.

And that prevailing confidence comes from -- if you even look at Q1 and Q2, they were marked by some of the largest software deals we've done. Those have piled into the backlog. We see more of that coming down the pipe in the future. Number two, if you just look at the velocity, the sheer numbers, the size of it, as Larry noted, it is at breakneck pace. And then third, if you kind of look at the nature and the demographics of that, just our activity in the pipeline in general, we are the recipients of more RFPs than we've ever been. We are engaging in strategic conversations with more constituencies at a faster pace than we ever had, and that includes health providers, health plans, governments, employers and, certainly, pharma. And then also, I would think that the interesting part about it is the comprehensive nature of the -- many of the opportunities in that pipeline. They're very big. They're long in their duration, and they are really aligned with what we always expressed in terms of these deeper and more comprehensive relationships. And there is a fair amount of it that's marked by analytics, too. That's a growth market for us. If you look at the demographics in there and you look at kind of the way we set up in the analytics market, it's clear that we're going to see growth there. The pipeline reflects that, and I think we have distinguished ourselves very well on the analytics front, on the revenue managed front, payment integrity. So it's a very diverse, sort of boundary-less pipeline that I think bodes well for the rest of the year and certainly into '17."

And then if Larry or Jack want to comment as well, please feel free to do so. I think John Rex, in his new role as CFO, did a great job responding to our overall capital priorities. But I think, as has been consistent over time, we have allocated about 50% of our capital to growth and about 50% of our capital to returning to shareholders. And you can see that it's strongly biased towards the dividend right now as we seek to also pay down our debt and get our leverage ratio down to 40%. That 50% on M&A, we really didn't touch on a whole lot and our priorities remain pretty consistent as they have been. As you can see, we have been investing significantly in Optum, and you can see the returns of that, which have been extensive. I think the team has done a fantastic job of driving nice returns on the invested capital base that we've put in place there. Two of those areas were the MedExpress platform, which is the urgent care platform, which supports the notion of us providing better quality, more consumer-responsive and higher-value care and, in this case, happens to be in the ambulatory setting. We said that, that was a foundational investment in MedExpress. And I think, as you knew at the time, we would continue to invest in opening new locations in that business over time. And as you can imagine, with de novo start-ups, they tend to create a little bit of a drag on earnings, particularly as you're just getting going in the early stages of that. Your instincts are right and they kind of tie into the trend conversation that Dan discussed as well, which is we're seeing a higher utilization of ER. And of course, the care setting and the urgent care, we believe, is much more effective and will help to obviate costs, not only for UnitedHealthcare but across all the payers that Optum serves. Another area of priority for us is to continue to invest in the Optum Care business. Larry laid out quite nicely, I believe, the 75 markets that we want to pursue, which constitute about 80% of all health care. And one of the areas in which we're pursuing that is through the development of physician practices and services in those markets, and we have an initial foundation of that, I believe, about $10 billion of revenue or so. On a combined basis, we serve over 7 million patients, and we have a nice growing business, I believe, in some stages of some 25-plus markets so far. And our activities there continue, and we'll continue to deploy capital in that area and continue to pursue that development of our business in that primary care setting. Larry, do you want to add?"

This longstanding approach consistently executed continues to produce distinctive quality outcomes, balanced growth and steady financial performance. 
Third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew nearly $5 billion over last year or 12%. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $2.17 per share. Third quarter adjusted cash flows of $3.4 billion increased 22% over last year, and third quarter return on equity exceeded 21%.

At Optum, we are pleased once again to report solid results for the third quarter and the year so far with positive business momentum as we head into 2017. The market continues to affirm Optum's distinctive position as a scaled and broadly capable health services and innovation company. We have aligned our resources to address enduring market trends around helping make the health system work better. 
We had strengthened fundamental capabilities, deepened relationships across the industry, including unique collaborations like Optum Labs and built a reputation for reliable service even in challenging situations. And we balance investments in our core capabilities with the expectation that we consistently deliver operating earnings and returns on capital. 
This quarter, we again closed several large, long-term business awards. Quest Diagnostics has asked Optum360 to be the partner for revenue management, covering everything following the receipt of doctors' lab orders through billing and cash collections from health plans, payers and consumers. In collaboration with Quest, our analytics processing approaches in technology can further modernize their business processes, improve service, lower costs, improve access to clinical and financial information and heighten transparency for consumers. 
Hospitals and acute care facilities continued to move to Optum360's innovative revenue services products. Today, we serve more than 400 facilities through our patented computer-assisted medical coding technology. The number of facilities using our computerized documentation technology has doubled in the past year to more than 125. These represent solid advances in markets with significantly more growth and expansion potential. 
A recent BlackRock market research report estimated 85% of care providers are assessing and/or replacing their approach to revenue management over the next 2 years. For the third consecutive year, the experts at the BlackRock had ranked Optum360 as the best in the market in revenue cycle management software technology, in revenue cycle management outsourcing and in computer-assisted coding and health information outsourcing solutions. During this coming quarter, Optum360 will reach a run rate of $60 billion and handle customer billings. 
This quarter, consulting leader, Frost & Sullivan, named Optum the top population health management company in the nation based on their assessment of the Optum One technology. Optum One integrates patient clinical information with administrative and demographic data covering millions of people. Proprietary analytics are applied to health care providers identify and take action with patients who are at highest risk of adverse health developments. Today, nearly 700 facilities and nearly 7,000 medical clinics are using Optum One, growth of 28% year-over-year. 
We see a broad range of opportunities in helping enable ACOs as this emerging market evolves. The rise of ACOs and value-based care in the market will only increase Optum One's utility and value. 
OptumHealth revenues continued to grow strongly, led by Optum Care local care delivery. Optum Care leverages modern technology and data and analytics to improve clinical care and offer superior quality and value to patients, payers and physicians. Aligning care delivery improves the health of communities at the local level. In fact, perhaps, nowhere else can the potential benefit to individuals [indiscernible]. And while Optum Care already comprises more than half of OptumHealth revenues, we are still early in developing this business. You should expect to see us continue to build out Optum Care market by market to emerge as a national platform for primary care-driven ambulatory care services. We aim to expand our care delivery through owned or affiliated clinics to more than 75 local markets, where more than 200 million people reside. 
This quarter, OptumHealth was honored to receive a multi-billion-dollar award from the Veterans Administration to conduct medical feasibility exams for service men and women for a period of up to 5 years. This award highlights some of the unique services we can offer government as customers and shows how the diversity of our capabilities and customer segments drives overall growth. 
OptumRx continues to advance our pharmacy care services business. This is another example of how we can help make the health system work better when we integrate across the Optum platform. We differentiate through the value of superior data analytics, clinical integration and consumer engagement at the earliest point of care possible. 
OptumHealth, with its deep expertise, scaled capabilities and assets and care management, clinical insights and population health, is helping to enable this transformation to what we call pharmacy care services. The value of this approach is particularly evident in the areas of chronic care and specialty pharmacy, where we generate more value for benefit sponsors and consumers than anyone in this market. And we are still only in the early stages in the evolution of this approach. The market is responding to our focus on total cost. OptumRx continues to perform well and expects to build on the success seen during 2017 selling season for 2018 and beyond. Our customer retention rate for January 2017 will be in the high 90s. 
OptumInsight's backlog grew 24% year-over-year to $12.6 billion, and script growth at OptumRx and the number of people served by OptumHealth continue to grow, consistent with our expectations. 
Optum's third quarter revenues grew 9.4%. Our third quarter operating earnings grew 28% year-over-year to approach $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, earnings from operations are up 40% to more than $3.8 billion. Our third quarter operating margin of 6.9% expanded most sequentially and year-over-year led by OptumInsight's margin and offset by continued investments in the Optum health care delivery businesses. 
We recognized Optum remains a young company, still in the formative stages in many respects and requiring continued investment and improvement. We know we can and should perform better and, in turn, help make the health system work better for more people. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."

We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again with solid growth across all 3 domest",1077,"Thank you, Larry. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again with solid growth across all 3 domestic medical markets. This continues the remarkable organic growth trend at UnitedHealthcare. Over the half decade leading up to 2016, we came to serve 9 million more people with medical benefits in domestic markets. We are delivering value through a combination of innovative and expansive products and service capabilities, data-driven consumer engagement and decision resources and modern value-based relationships with care providers, supported by data sharing and physician engagement. These capabilities engage and support consumers, while containing costs for both the health consumer as well as their benefit sponsors. Our full year commercial medical cost trend remains solidly in line with our estimate of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
The market continued to respond positively to the value UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual plans offer. Excluding individual plans, our commercial group business has grown to serve 775,000 more people year-over-year, continuing its consistent pattern of growth. In 6 of the past 7 calendar years, our Employer & Individual business has grown the number of consumers served with cumulative growth across all products totaling in the millions of people, all of this organic. 
In the seniors market, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement's performance continues to strengthen each year. In the past 12 months, more than 600,000 additional seniors have chosen our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products. These plans have excellent consumer retention rates and distinctive consumer Net Promoter Scores. The strength in our Medicare business is grounded in the quality of our benefit offerings, the stability of our networks and the distinctive clinical engagement and consumer experience approach. This approach directly engages our own clinical resources when data suggests we need to better coordinate care. These activities improve consumer satisfaction, or NPS, and strengthen loyalty, customer retention, Stars performance and the use of health care resources, all leading to better value for seniors. 
Our Medicare Advantage plans are increasingly recognized for quality and service. For 2018, factoring in our expected growth, we expect 85% of UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage membership will be in plans rated 4 Stars or higher by CMS. For 2017, we expect this metric to exceed 80%. 
This quarter, our group retiree call centers achieved J.D. Power's certification, placing them among the highest performing in consumer services across all industries. This accomplishment reflects the commitment and compassion of our Medicare team, who seek to serve seniors with high-quality health care and flawless service. 
We expect 2017 to be another year of strong growth, both in individual and group MA. We also expect to grow in Part D in 2017 with the introduction of a new nationwide product set targeted to a broader senior demographic. 
Our Community & State plans have grown steadily in response to state government's needs to improve quality for beneficiaries, while ensuring the sustainability of their programs. The increase in Medicaid benefit coverage has been a clear success of the Affordable Care Act, serving millions of -- more Americans and using public funds in the most effective way. Our ability to improve quality and outcomes for all types of Medicaid beneficiaries, including those with some of the most complex medical conditions, has driven distinguished overall growth for us for a number of years, including organic growth of 9% or nearly 500,000 people in the past 12 months. 
Our commitment to quality care, outcomes and service have led to our position as the largest organization serving programs for dual-eligible beneficiaries and those who need long-term services and support. Today, we serve more than 0.5 million of these vulnerable individuals for our state customers and our growth in these categories continues. This past quarter, we were honored to be selected to proceed to contract in Virginia in what will be another new state partner for us. And in just the past few days, we were selected to serve in Missouri, also a new state for our Community & State business. Our new business and growth opportunities for 2017 and beyond are as robust as ever. 
Looking at these benefits businesses together, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues of $37.2 billion -- revenues of $37.2 billion grew 13.3% year-over-year with organic growth again across the 3 businesses. It has also been organic -- same organic growth has been experienced over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by a double-digit percentage over third quarter 2015. Earnings from operations of $2.1 billion also grew 13% year-over-year on steady operating margins of 5.7%. 
Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Our third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew 12% over last year. The consolidated medical care ratio decreased 60 basis points to 80.3%. Through the first 9 months of the year, our medical care ratio of 81.3% is nearly identical to last year. The operating cost ratio has improved 60 basis points year-to-date to 15%. The third quarter ratio of 15.2% increased 60 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the regular seasonal increase in marketing and enrollment costs as well as increased level of investment across the enterprise to develop and support future growth. 
As Steve mentioned, third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 grew 23% year-over-year and were supported by distinctive cash flow. Year-to-date, adjusted cash flows from operations of $7.4 billion are 1.4x net income, and adjusted cash flow was 1.7x net income in the third quarter. 
We are increasing our outlook for 2016 adjusted earnings to approximately $8 per share due to the strength of the results produced by our businesses so far this year. We look to finish 2016 with strong momentum and carry that momentum into 2017. 
At this point of the year, the focus begins to shift to the coming year, and we look forward to discussing our 2017 outlook with you in depth at our investor conference on Tuesday, November 29. While we will reserve that discussion for another 6 weeks, we will offer that, at this point, we are comfortable with where the consensus 2017 adjusted earnings per share are currently positioned on The Street. We remain committed to continually improving our performance. If we finish the year with the momentum we aspire to, we could potentially see our 2017 EPS view reflect a modestly stronger growth outlook. For now we will maintain an appropriately prudent posture.

A couple of things. I think past history, in terms of how our business is kind of lined up this way currently shows that the fourth quarter for Optum is always going pretty much play out this way, and I'll talk about that in a minute. So the third quarter, strong quarter for us. It met expectations and we're exactly where we expected to be right now in terms of our in-line expectations. The fourth quarter always brings to us seasonality. And when we get into the seasonality, we're dealing with pay for performance. We're dealing with our incentive and our shared savings. What we're doing from a technology standpoint during the year, a lot of that comes to play and impacts us during the fourth quarter. The number of new accounts that we have as well as AEP kicks in, some of our coding kicks in. So we have a lot on the list side in the fourth quarter. But what I might do is talk a little bit about what our overall business plan has been. Our overall business plan has been to have these large, well, what I'll call, complex relationships. And when we get into that, and this is all part of how we build this during the year, we expected to have around 10 of these major relationships. We're probably somewhere around 20 at this point in time and this has been building over the last few years. We had 3 measurements that kicked into this as well and that is our backlog. And I think I mentioned it a few minutes ago on insight of about $12.6 billion. That's up about 24% year-over-year. We have our qualified sales pipeline that will also kick in partially during the fourth quarter. That's up about 2x over last year. And the third area is our sales for this year, what I'll call, our TCV, our total contract value, that's up about 3x. So we're confident where we're at right now for the fourth quarter. We believe the fourth quarter will give us momentum into 2017. So we're right where we expected to be. I would tell you that this time next year, if we're setting here, we'll be having the same conversation because it will constantly be a seasonality issue for us to deal with in the fourth quarter."

So as you said, we'll discuss 2017 at our investor conference in November. I think the largest tailwind for the business is you're probably picking up this growth both at Optum, which you've seem pretty systemically throughout the year with the PBM wins and then, obviously, here with the Quest win, which is Optum360 win as well as, what I'll call, a lot of that smaller business size wins that occur in that business every day, a lot of which you'll see in that ramp in the Q4 as well. All those things speak to Optum's growth. And I think UnitedHealthcare's growth is statistically well understood with the pattern of growth and its membership across all 3 lines of business. The second one I would point out is the reduced loss position on the ACA that, clearly, will aid earnings in 2017 as well. On the headwinds front, obviously, with that growth, there's a lot of implementation costs that need to occur. And then as you can tell, we're strategically positioning Optum to have a broader range in serving more market segments as well. So there's a lot of de novo startup costs, if you will, in that business as well as a lot of implementation costs for the [indiscernible] business that we've won over time. The last thing, I guess, I'd point out in 2017, particularly at this distance and maybe a reason why you feel like we are -- we may be more moderate in terms of our point of view at this early stage, is really we -- this organization has a deep respect for medical costs and trend. And while we expect them to be pretty level, our trends to be pretty level next year, we're deeply respectful of that -- of medical costs as well as the rating environment. As those things become clear, that's when I think that you'll see us clarify our position with respect to 2017 and that could be as early as in the 2017 investor conference in November."

And so this is a new approach and we do think we're redefining pharmacy care services, taking pharmacy data, coupling it and linking it to medical data, linking it to the care delivery process and including lab behavioral data in a comprehensive data set, we call it eSync. And the whole business is focused on now a whole-person approach, how can we take everything we know about a member's medical condition and improve their care, utilizing cost strategies and cost trend management strategies that you mentioned, but much more than that, delivering care in a more meaningful way. This could include phone calls by pharmacist, house calls by nurses. This could include adherence programs. It's a full suite of programs all aimed at driving down total medical cost.

From our view, certainly in the quarter, costs were well controlled. And as you look at the consolidated medical care ratio, it was 80.3% in the third quarter this year, and that's actually down 60 basis points year-over-year, so down a little bit more than we had expected. So we continue to do well managing costs across the portfolio within UnitedHealthcare. To the components of development specifically, so underneath that, we did have prior period reserve development in the quarter of about $120 million and that was favorable. That's pretty consistent with the development we've recorded in the same quarter last year. As you look at the pieces inside of it, to your question, the current year component was favorable $230 million, and that was partially offset by $110 million of prior year unfavorable development. With regard to the businesses, I would tell you that it's really less about the exchanges, frankly, and it's more about our core businesses across Medicare, Medicaid and our commercial businesses, both the current year favorable as well as the prior year unfavorable. And on the prior year unfavorable, I'd tell you that we do have a host of things that result in any given quarter. And there was nothing in this quarter that was individually material. And that prior year element does not influence our current or our future outlook on trend.

And when we contemplated our benefit planning back in the spring, we obviously considered that, had insight into that and also the insurer's fee moratorium as well. And so that allowed us to make some meaningful investments and bring to market some stable benefits that we're really excited to offer to our seniors. It's meaningful to them, the stability in premiums and co-pays and choice. And so we think we're really well positioned. And then you add to that the capabilities that we've been investing in as well in terms of our quality, which benefits our members. But also, it's something that we're going to stay diligent about. We also have -- I think Dave mentioned in his opening comments some of the distinguished capabilities we have in our member experience and service. So all of these position us really well for growth. But it's -- in terms of the margins specifically, we wanted to position this business for growth and we think we have done that.

So on the enrollment front, we ended the quarter with 770,000 exchange lives and another 210,000 off exchange. So on a combined basis, our individual ACA block was just a shade under 1 million lives at the end of the quarter. When you look at the performance inside the quarter, I would tell you that, as you pointed out, nothing's really changed on the ACA front, and that's a good thing. Our third quarter was a very much in line with our revised expectations that we set coming out in the second quarter and we've continued to maintain our full year view. To be more specific about it, so we recorded losses in the quarter of $200 million, and of that, $120 million was offset against the premium deficiency reserve, and the remaining $80 million flowed through the P&L this quarter. That $80 million of P&L impact is very comparable to the P&L impact we had in the third quarter last year, so very similar year-over-year. And from our view, we think that we're appropriately positioned for the remainder of the year. I think you also asked about the contribution of enrollment from special election versus open enrollment. I would tell you that we had a little less orientation towards special election this year as compared to last year. So to your point, we were a little shade above 20% sitting through the third quarter of the year, and now we're more in the teens as you look at ACA-compliant membership base.

But on the international front, I'd say we spent the last 1.5 years building our foundation. We've been planting seeds, and I would say that we're strong with the NHS. We're strong with NHS improvement. We're getting stronger with the Minister of Health as well as the secretary of health. As we said here today, we actually have the Minister of Health with us for the next 2 or 3 days on tour with quite a few of the commissioners of the trust which can be hospitals the way we would know it. I'd say that as we've gone through this, with the relationship building and where we stand, the pipeline is getting stronger and I believe that 2017 will be a year that we will validate as we've been validating some things here in the state. So that's where I would say that the international sets [indiscernible] the U.K. We're also working with our sister organization [indiscernible] in Brazil. That's more of a health plan.

So again, we talk about that market potentially being a $500 billion market and we remain focused and confident that that's the size of that market. Move over into what we're doing on the -- what I'll call over large deeper relationships, and I spoke about that both in the script as well as on the other answer. Instead of me speaking on this, I'm going to ask Bill to talk about it from an OptumInsight 360 standpoint and some of the large relationships we're working with. And then I'm going to ask Amir to do the same on what I'll call the Optum Care side. I will make one comment myself on what we're doing in the military. We closed the -- we were able to get this nice award with the Veterans Administration on disability exam. So that's -- we won about 8 out of 12 regions, exactly 8 out of 12 regions, 4 at LHI. That's in Lacrosse, Wisconsin, 4 in California with MSLA that we own. It will service about 4.2 million service men and women, and we'll be going strong with that starting in January of this year.

And whether its Qwest or dignity which we've talked about in the past, they're looking for modern technology, modern systems. They're looking for people that can bring in accuracy and the expertise that could reengineer workflow, that can leverage a worldwide workforce. And tempering in all of that is someone who can drive analytics and insights to really automate and improve the economic performance and the efficiency performance of their own operations. And anyone that evaluate this likes to see that, one, we're comprehensive in that approach; two, we're pretty much lined up culturally with them; and they really enjoyed the fact that we drive a performance-based contract with us.

You're seeing improvements in the accuracy of those estimates. And as you look at it on a year-to-date basis, we're sitting at a $190 million of prior year favorable development. That compares to $230 million for the 3 quarters last year. So from our perspective, there's some vagaries and that have happened quarter-on-quarter, but on balance, we continue to get more accurate.

Medicaid has been a very significant success of the ACA. And wherever that has played out, those environment -- those markets have actually been more stable and better performing. And Medicare continues to be a core program of the country, and that funding for both Medicare Medicaid is something that we have been advocating its consistency and stability of it, kind of those themes are what we have stayed with. I think commenting beyond that, particularly as the new administrations take hold and so forth, our posture is to be very constructive about making the marketplace work most effectively and serving the most number of individuals and making that system simpler and more usable for everybody. So I think beyond commenting on that level, I don't think we are going to get into what's going to happen going forward on either state basis or federal."

So in view of the fact that you didn't do that this quarter and it seems from your seemingly well-based enthusiasm for your momentum and the strength of your business and customer relationships that you're unlikely to push your margins off the new business in several coming quarters, how much of this new business win is actually related to the -- and also the ability to present margin especially within UHC, is the ability -- is attributable to the integration of all of the business units not just in Optum Care within OptumHealth but -- or not just the UHC with OptumInsight but all of it together?

I won't go further than that, and again, we'll just have to prove that every quarter in terms of our own performance, our execution, the consistency of our growth and the consistency of our financial performance as we continue to grow and expand the business, and there are still a lot of opportunity. We are far from our full potential. And generally, when we conclude these sessions with you, we have an internal meeting talking about how much better we should be doing and could be doing if we perform the full potential. So we are going to continue on that path and pleased to perform consistently this quarter.

I think that's really important for us. We are focused on MPS and quality performance to bring that to customers and to bring it to providers, improve the health care experience for consumers.

This quarter, we are privileged to report continued broad-based revenue and earnings growth, consistent execution and continuing forward momentum for our enterprise. We serve people's health and health care, a sensitive, social and personal domain that we know requires a mission and value-driven culture and a commitment to a quality experience, getting that experience right the first time for each individual we serve. We're advancing cautiously and steadily in this direction, more to do to achieve the full potential and positive impact we could have in people's lives and an access to cost -- and on access, cost and quality of care. 
We work to improve overall health care system performance through clinical insight, enabling technologies and distinctive data analytics. We find those capabilities across our businesses. This longstanding approach consistently executed continues to produce distinctive quality outcomes, balanced growth and steady financial performance. 
Third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew nearly $5 billion over last year or 12%. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $2.17 per share. Third quarter adjusted cash flows of $3.4 billion increased 22% over last year, and third quarter return on equity exceeded 21%. 
Looking forward, we expect continued strong performance in the fourth quarter and into 2017. That performance will be built on strong customer retention and broad-based growth across our businesses driven by deeper and more strategic relationships and new business awards already received.

At Optum, we are pleased once again to report solid results for the third quarter and the year so far with positive business momentum as we head into 2017. The market continues to affirm Optum's distinctive position as a scaled and broadly capable health services and innovation company. We have aligned our resources to address enduring market trends around helping make the health system work better. 
We had strengthened fundamental capabilities, deepened relationships across the industry, including unique collaborations like Optum Labs and built a reputation for reliable service even in challenging situations. And we balance investments in our core capabilities with the expectation that we consistently deliver operating earnings and returns on capital. 
This quarter, we again closed several large, long-term business awards. Quest Diagnostics has asked Optum360 to be the partner for revenue management, covering everything following the receipt of doctors' lab orders through billing and cash collections from health plans, payers and consumers. In collaboration with Quest, our analytics processing approaches in technology can further modernize their business processes, improve service, lower costs, improve access to clinical and financial information and heighten transparency for consumers. 
Hospitals and acute care facilities continued to move to Optum360's innovative revenue services products. Today, we serve more than 400 facilities through our patented computer-assisted medical coding technology. The number of facilities using our computerized documentation technology has doubled in the past year to more than 125. These represent solid advances in markets with significantly more growth and expansion potential. 
A recent BlackRock market research report estimated 85% of care providers are assessing and/or replacing their approach to revenue management over the next 2 years. For the third consecutive year, the experts at the BlackRock had ranked Optum360 as the best in the market in revenue cycle management software technology, in revenue cycle management outsourcing and in computer-assisted coding and health information outsourcing solutions. During this coming quarter, Optum360 will reach a run rate of $60 billion and handle customer billings. 
This quarter, consulting leader, Frost & Sullivan, named Optum the top population health management company in the nation based on their assessment of the Optum One technology. Optum One integrates patient clinical information with administrative and demographic data covering millions of people. Proprietary analytics are applied to health care providers identify and take action with patients who are at highest risk of adverse health developments. Today, nearly 700 facilities and nearly 7,000 medical clinics are using Optum One, growth of 28% year-over-year. 
We see a broad range of opportunities in helping enable ACOs as this emerging market evolves. The rise of ACOs and value-based care in the market will only increase Optum One's utility and value. 
OptumHealth revenues continued to grow strongly, led by Optum Care local care delivery. Optum Care leverages modern technology and data and analytics to improve clinical care and offer superior quality and value to patients, payers and physicians. Aligning care delivery improves the health of communities at the local level. In fact, perhaps, nowhere else can the potential benefit to individuals be as profound. And while Optum Care already comprises more than half of OptumHealth revenues, we are still early in developing this business. You should expect to see us continue to build out Optum Care market by market to emerge as a national platform for primary care-driven ambulatory care services. We aim to expand our care delivery through owned or affiliated clinics to more than 75 local markets, where more than 200 million people reside. 
This quarter, OptumHealth was honored to receive a multi-billion-dollar award from the Veterans Administration to conduct medical feasibility exams for service men and women for a period of up to 5 years. This award highlights some of the unique services we can offer government as customers and shows how the diversity of our capabilities and customer segments drives overall growth. 
OptumRx continues to advance our pharmacy care services business. This is another example of how we can help make the health system work better when we integrate across the Optum platform. We differentiate through the value of superior data analytics, clinical integration and consumer engagement at the earliest point of care possible. 
OptumHealth, with its deep expertise, scaled capabilities and assets and care management, clinical insights and population health, is helping to enable this transformation to what we call pharmacy care services. The value of this approach is particularly evident in the areas of chronic care and specialty pharmacy, where we generate more value for benefit sponsors and consumers than anyone in this market. And we are still only in the early stages in the evolution of this approach. The market is responding to our focus on total cost. OptumRx continues to perform well and expects to build on the success seen during 2017 selling season for 2018 and beyond. Our customer retention rate for January 2017 will be in the high 90s. 
OptumInsight's backlog grew 24% year-over-year to $12.6 billion, and script growth at OptumRx and the number of people served by OptumHealth continue to grow, consistent with our expectations. 
Optum's third quarter revenues grew 9.4%. Our third quarter operating earnings grew 28% year-over-year to approach $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, earnings from operations are up 40% to more than $3.8 billion. Our third quarter operating margin of 6.9% expanded most sequentially and year-over-year led by OptumInsight's margin and offset by continued investments in the Optum health care delivery businesses. 
We recognized Optum remains a young company, still in the formative stages in many respects and requiring continued investment and improvement. We know we can and should perform better and, in turn, help make the health system work better for more people. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."

We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again with solid growth across all 3 domest",1077,"Thank you, Larry. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again with solid growth across all 3 domestic medical markets. This continues the remarkable organic growth trend at UnitedHealthcare. Over the half decade leading up to 2016, we came to serve 9 million more people with medical benefits in domestic markets. We are delivering value through a combination of innovative and expansive products and service capabilities, data-driven consumer engagement and decision resources and modern value-based relationships with care providers, supported by data sharing and physician engagement. These capabilities engage and support consumers, while containing costs for both the health consumer as well as their benefit sponsors. Our full year commercial medical cost trend remains solidly in line with our estimate of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
The market continued to respond positively to the value UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual plans offer. Excluding individual plans, our commercial group business has grown to serve 775,000 more people year-over-year, continuing its consistent pattern of growth. In 6 of the past 7 calendar years, our Employer & Individual business has grown the number of consumers served with cumulative growth across all products totaling in the millions of people, all of this organic. 
In the seniors market, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement's performance continues to strengthen each year. In the past 12 months, more than 600,000 additional seniors have chosen our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products. These plans have excellent consumer retention rates and distinctive consumer Net Promoter Scores. The strength in our Medicare business is grounded in the quality of our benefit offerings, the stability of our networks and the distinctive clinical engagement and consumer experience approach. This approach directly engages our own clinical resources when data suggests we need to better coordinate care. These activities improve consumer satisfaction, or NPS, and strengthen loyalty, customer retention, Stars performance and the use of health care resources, all leading to better value for seniors. 
Our Medicare Advantage plans are increasingly recognized for quality and service. For 2018, factoring in our expected growth, we expect 85% of UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage membership will be in plans rated 4 Stars or higher by CMS. For 2017, we expect this metric to exceed 80%. 
This quarter, our group retiree call centers achieved J.D. Power's certification, placing them among the highest performing in consumer services across all industries. This accomplishment reflects the commitment and compassion of our Medicare team, who seek to serve seniors with high-quality health care and flawless service. 
We expect 2017 to be another year of strong growth, both in individual and group MA. We also expect to grow in Part D in 2017 with the introduction of a new nationwide product set targeted to a broader senior demographic. 
Our Community & State plans have grown steadily in response to state government's needs to improve quality for beneficiaries, while ensuring the sustainability of their programs. The increase in Medicaid benefit coverage has been a clear success of the Affordable Care Act, serving millions of -- more Americans and using public funds in the most effective way. Our ability to improve quality and outcomes for all types of Medicaid beneficiaries, including those with some of the most complex medical conditions, has driven distinguished overall growth for us for a number of years, including organic growth of 9% or nearly 500,000 people in the past 12 months. 
Our commitment to quality care, outcomes and service have led to our position as the largest organization serving programs for dual-eligible beneficiaries and those who need long-term services and support. Today, we serve more than 0.5 million of these vulnerable individuals for our state customers and our growth in these categories continues. This past quarter, we were honored to be selected to proceed to contract in Virginia in what will be another new state partner for us. And in just the past few days, we were selected to serve in Missouri, also a new state for our Community & State business. Our new business and growth opportunities for 2017 and beyond are as robust as ever. 
Looking at these benefits businesses together, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues of $37.2 billion -- revenues of $37.2 billion grew 13.3% year-over-year with organic growth again across the 3 businesses. It has also been organic -- same organic growth has been experienced over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by a double-digit percentage over third quarter 2015. Earnings from operations of $2.1 billion also grew 13% year-over-year on steady operating margins of 5.7%. 
Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Our third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew 12% over last year. The consolidated medical care ratio decreased 60 basis points to 80.3%. Through the first 9 months of the year, our medical care ratio of 81.3% is nearly identical to last year. The operating cost ratio has improved 60 basis points year-to-date to 15%. The third quarter ratio of 15.2% increased 60 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the regular seasonal increase in marketing and enrollment costs as well as increased level of investment across the enterprise to develop and support future growth. 
As Steve mentioned, third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 grew 23% year-over-year and were supported by distinctive cash flow. Year-to-date, adjusted cash flows from operations of $7.4 billion are 1.4x net income, and adjusted cash flow was 1.7x net income in the third quarter. 
We are increasing our outlook for 2016 adjusted earnings to approximately $8 per share due to the strength of the results produced by our businesses so far this year. We look to finish 2016 with strong momentum and carry that momentum into 2017. 
At this point of the year, the focus begins to shift to the coming year, and we look forward to discussing our 2017 outlook with you in depth at our investor conference on Tuesday, November 29. While we will reserve that discussion for another 6 weeks, we will offer that, at this point, we are comfortable with where the consensus 2017 adjusted earnings per share are currently positioned on The Street. We remain committed to continually improving our performance. If we finish the year with the momentum we aspire to, we could potentially see our 2017 EPS view reflect a modestly stronger growth outlook. For now we will maintain an appropriately prudent posture.

A couple of things. I think past history, in terms of how our business is kind of lined up this way currently shows that the fourth quarter for Optum is always going pretty much play out this way, and I'll talk about that in a minute. So the third quarter, strong quarter for us. It met expectations and we're exactly where we expected to be right now in terms of our in-line expectations. The fourth quarter always brings to us seasonality. And when we get into the seasonality, we're dealing with pay for performance. We're dealing with our incentive and our shared savings. What we're doing from a technology standpoint during the year, a lot of that comes to play and impacts us during the fourth quarter. The number of new accounts that we have as well as AEP kicks in, some of our coding kicks in. So we have a lot on the list side in the fourth quarter. But what I might do is talk a little bit about what our overall business plan has been. Our overall business plan has been to have these large, well, what I'll call, complex relationships. And when we get into that, and this is all part of how we build this during the year, we expected to have around 10 of these major relationships. We're probably somewhere around 20 at this point in time and this has been building over the last few years. We had 3 measurements that kicked into this as well and that is our backlog. And I think I mentioned it a few minutes ago on insight of about $12.6 billion. That's up about 24% year-over-year. We have our qualified sales pipeline that will also kick in partially during the fourth quarter. That's up about 2x over last year. And the third area is our sales for this year, what I'll call, our TCV, our total contract value, that's up about 3x. So we're confident where we're at right now for the fourth quarter. We believe the fourth quarter will give us momentum into 2017. So we're right where we expected to be. I would tell you that this time next year, if we're setting here, we'll be having the same conversation because it will constantly be a seasonality issue for us to deal with in the fourth quarter."

So as you said, we'll discuss 2017 at our investor conference in November. I think the largest tailwind for the business is you're probably picking up this growth both at Optum, which you've seem pretty systemically throughout the year with the PBM wins and then, obviously, here with the Quest win, which is Optum360 win as well as, what I'll call, a lot of that smaller business size wins that occur in that business every day, a lot of which you'll see in that ramp in the Q4 as well. All those things speak to Optum's growth. And I think UnitedHealthcare's growth is statistically well understood with the pattern of growth and its membership across all 3 lines of business. The second one I would point out is the reduced loss position on the ACA that, clearly, will aid earnings in 2017 as well. On the headwinds front, obviously, with that growth, there's a lot of implementation costs that need to occur. And then as you can tell, we're strategically positioning Optum to have a broader range in serving more market segments as well. So there's a lot of de novo startup costs, if you will, in that business as well as a lot of implementation costs for the subsequent business that we've won over time. The last thing, I guess, I'd point out in 2017, particularly at this distance and maybe a reason why you feel like we are -- we may be more moderate in terms of our point of view at this early stage, is really we -- this organization has a deep respect for medical costs and trend. And while we expect them to be pretty level, our trends to be pretty level next year, we're deeply respectful of that -- of medical costs as well as the rating environment. As those things become clear, that's when I think that you'll see us clarify our position with respect to 2017 and that could be as early as in the 2017 investor conference in November."

And so this is a new approach and we do think we're redefining pharmacy care services, taking pharmacy data, coupling it and linking it to medical data, linking it to the care delivery process and including lab behavioral data in a comprehensive data set, we call it eSync. And the whole business is focused on now a whole-person approach, how can we take everything we know about a member's medical condition and improve their care, utilizing cost strategies and cost trend management strategies that you mentioned, but much more than that, delivering care in a more meaningful way. This could include phone calls by pharmacist, house calls by nurses. This could include adherence programs. It's a full suite of programs all aimed at driving down total medical cost.

To the components of development specifically, so underneath that, we did have prior period reserve development in the quarter of about $120 million and that was favorable.

With regard to the businesses, I would tell you that it's really less about the exchanges, frankly, and it's more about our core businesses across Medicare, Medicaid and our commercial businesses, both the current year favorable as well as the prior year unfavorable. And on the prior year unfavorable, I'd tell you that we do have a host of things that result in any given quarter. And there was nothing in this quarter that was individually material. And that prior year element does not influence our current or our future outlook on trend. So as we look to the full year and look at our medical costs, we expect the medical care ratio 81.5% on the full year, plus or minus 50 basis points. And I'd probably tell you, we'd likely orient below that midpoint."

I really think we're well positioned overall. As you mentioned, we have -- we've seen improvement in our STARS. And when we contemplated our benefit planning back in the spring, we obviously considered that, had insight into that and also the insurer's fee moratorium as well. And so that allowed us to make some meaningful investments and bring to market some stable benefits that we're really excited to offer to our seniors. It's meaningful to them, the stability in premiums and co-pays and choice. And so we think we're really well positioned. And then you add to that the capabilities that we've been investing in as well in terms of our quality, which benefits our members. But also, it's something that we're going to stay diligent about. We also have -- I think Dave mentioned in his opening comments some of the distinguished capabilities we have in our member experience and service. So all of these position us really well for growth. But it's -- in terms of the margins specifically, we wanted to position this business for growth and we think we have done that.

I think at the end of the day, the reason that we're posting these wins is, first of all, we are driving better economics in the market. That's important when you're trying to save money in drugs. But it is this differentiated model that we're selling, the pharmacy care services model is resonating with very sophisticated buyers. I think what you're seeing, Scott, is the convergence of the traditional PBM model, which we're trying to rebuild, and combining it with the Optum clinical platform, and here, we're talking about OptumHealth and all the care management, data management and care delivery services.

So on the enrollment front, we ended the quarter with 770,000 exchange lives and another 210,000 off exchange. So on a combined basis, our individual ACA block was just a shade under 1 million lives at the end of the quarter. When you look at the performance inside the quarter, I would tell you that, as you pointed out, nothing's really changed on the ACA front, and that's a good thing. Our third quarter was very much in line with our revised expectations that we set coming out of the second quarter and we've continued to maintain our full year view. To be more specific about it, so we recorded losses in the quarter of $200 million. And of that, $120 million was offset against the premium deficiency reserve. And the remaining $80 million flowed through the P&L this quarter. That $80 million of P&L impact is very comparable to the P&L impact we had in the third quarter last year, so very similar year-over-year. And from our view, we think that we're appropriately positioned for the remainder of the year. I think you also asked about the contribution of enrollment from special election versus open enrollment. I would tell you that we had a little less orientation towards special election this year as compared to last year. So to your point, we were a little shade above 20% sitting through the third quarter of the year. And now we're more in the mid-teens as you look at our ACA-compliant membership base. Hopefully, that covers the list."

We've been planting seeds. And I would say that we're strong with the NHS. We're strong with NHS improvement. We're getting stronger with the Minister of Health as well as the secretary of health. As we said here today, we actually have the Minister of Health with us for the next 2 or 3 days on tour with quite a few of the commissioners of the trust, which could be hospitals the way we would know it. I'd say that as we've gone through this, with the relationship building and where we stand, the pipeline is getting stronger. And I believe that 2017 will be a year that we will validate as we've been validating some things here in the state. So that's where I would say that the international sets in the U.K. We are also working with our sister organization, Amil, in Brazil, and that's more of a health plan. As you know, the way that we would approach that from our standpoint. So we're working day in, day out to line up with them. We are also looking at other emerging markets. We are looking probably and the way we would go about is to look at Australia, maybe Mexico, maybe Asia. But we're going to finish out what we're doing with the U.K. and have a very solid start as well as in Brazil before we start to pursue other things. So again, we've talked about that market potentially being a $500 billion market. And we remain focused and confident that, that's the size of that market. We move over into what we're doing on the -- what I'll call, our large deeper relationships, and I spoke about that both in the script as well as on the other answer. Instead of me speaking on this, I'm going to ask Bill to talk about it from an OptumInsight 360 standpoint and some of the large relationships we're working with. And then I'm going to ask Amir to do the same on the -- what I'll call the Optum Care side. I will make one comment myself on what we're doing in the military. We closed the -- we were able to get this nice award with the Veterans Administration on disability exam. So that's -- we won about 8 out of 12 regions, exactly 8 out of 12 regions. 4 at LHI that's in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. 4 in California with MSLA that we own. It'll service about 4.2 million service men and women. And we'll be going strong with that starting in January of this year. So Bill?"

With respect to our managed -- our revenue management offerings, we've used this word validation a fair number of times this morning.

And whether its Quest or Dignity, which we've talked about in the past, they're looking for modern technology, modern systems. We're looking for people that can bring in accuracy and the expertise that could reengineer workflows, that can leverage a worldwide workforce. And peppering in all of that is someone who can drive analytics and insights to really automate and improve the economic performance and the efficiency performance of their own operations. And anyone that evaluate this likes to see that, one, we're comprehensive in that approach; two, we're pretty much lined up culturally with them; and they really enjoyed the fact that we drive a performance-based contract with us. So we're very much focused on aligning ourselves with them. So they are successful on that. Formula is working. It's highly enabled by a very modern set of portfolios that they've set. People buy every day. But more and more, we're seeing a trend in the marketplace where any of those constituencies are looking for more of an end-to-end comprehensive approach to handling some of these most pronounced challenges they have in their environments.

You're seeing improvements in the accuracy of those estimates. And as you look at it on a year-to-date basis, we're sitting at a $190 million of prior year favorable development. That compares to $230 million for the 3 quarters last year. So from our perspective, there's some vagaries that happened quarter-on-quarter. But on balance, it's -- we continue to get more accurate.

Medicaid has been a very significant success of the ACA. And wherever that has played out, those environment -- those markets have actually been more stable and better performing. And Medicare continues to be a core program of the country. And that funding for both Medicare Medicaid is something that we have been advocating its consistency and stability of it, kind of those themes are what we have stayed with. And I think commenting beyond that, particularly as the new administrations take hold and so forth, our posture is to be very constructive about making the marketplace work most effectively and serving the most number of individuals and making that system simpler and more usable for everybody.

So in view of the fact that you didn't do that this quarter and it seems from your well -- seemingly well-based enthusiasm for your momentum and the strength of your business and customer relationships that you're unlikely to crush your margins off the new business in the several coming quarters, how much of this new business win is actually related to the -- and also the ability to preserve margin especially within UHC, is ability to the -- is attributable to the integration of all of the business units, not just in Optum Care within OptumHealth, but -- or not just the UHC with OptumInsight, but all of it together.

And again, we just have to prove that every quarter in terms of our own performance, our execution, the consistency of our growth and the consistency of our financial performance as we continue to grow and expand the business. And there are still a lot of opportunity. We are far from our full potential. And generally, when we conclude these sessions with you, we have an internal meeting talking about how much better we should be doing and could be doing if we perform the full potential. So we are going to continue on that path and pleased to perform consistently this quarter, expect to do it into the finish of the year, have a positive attitude on '17 and we're just going to keep working on that level.

We're advancing consciously and steadily in this direction with more to do to achieve the full potential and positive impact we could have in people's lives and an access to cost -- and on access, cost and quality of care. 
We work to improve overall health care system performance through clinical insight, enabling technologies and distinctive data analytics, applying those capabilities across our businesses. This long-standing approach, consistently executed, continues to produce distinctive quality outcomes, balanced growth and steady financial performance. 
Third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew nearly $5 billion over last year or 12%. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $2.17 per share. Third quarter adjusted cash flows of $3.4 billion increased 22% over last year, and third quarter return on equity exceeded 21%. 
Looking forward, we expect continued strong performance in the fourth quarter and into 2017. That performance will be built on strong customer retention and broad-based growth across our businesses driven by deeper and more strategic relationships and new business awards already received.

At Optum, we are pleased once again to report solid results for the third quarter and the year so far, with positive business momentum as we head into 2017. The market continues to affirm Optum's distinctive position as a scaled and broadly capable health services and innovation company. We have aligned our resources to address enduring market trends around helping make the health system work better. 
We have strengthened fundamental capabilities, deepened relationships across the industry, including unique collaborations like Optum Labs, and built a reputation for reliable service even in challenging situations. And we balanced investments in our core capabilities with the expectation that we consistently deliver operating earnings and returns on capital. 
This quarter, we again closed several large, long-term business awards. Quest Diagnostics has asked Optum360 to be the partner for revenue management, covering everything following the receipt of doctors' lab orders through billing and cash collections from health plans, payers and consumers. In collaboration with Quest, our analytic processing approaches and technology can further modernize their business processes, improve service, lower costs, improve access to clinical and financial information and heighten transparency for consumers. 
Hospitals and acute care facilities continued to move to Optum360's innovative revenue services products. Today, we serve more than 400 facilities through our patented computer-assisted medical coding technology. The number of facilities using our computerized documentation technology has doubled in the past year to more than 125. These represent solid advances in markets with significantly more growth and expansion potential. 
A recent BlackRock (sic) [ Black Book ] Market Research report estimated 85% of care providers are assessing and/or replacing their approach to revenue management over the next few years. For the third consecutive year, the experts at the BlackRock (sic) [ Black Book ] have ranked Optum360 as the best in the market in revenue cycle management software technology, in revenue cycle management outsourcing and in computer-assisted coding and health information outsourcing solutions. During this coming quarter, Optum360 will reach a run rate of $60 billion in handle customer billings. 
This quarter, consulting leader, Frost & Sullivan, named Optum the top population health management company in the nation, based on their assessment of the Optum One technology. Optum One integrates patient clinical information with administrative and demographic data covering millions of people. Proprietary analytics are applied to help care providers identify and take action with patients who are at highest risk of adverse health developments. Today, nearly 700 facilities and nearly 7,000 medical clinics are using Optum One, growth of 28% year-over-year. 
We see a broad range of opportunities in helping enable ACOs as this emerging market evolves. The rise of ACOs and value-based care in the market will only increase Optum One's utility and value. 
OptumHealth revenues continue to grow strongly, led by Optum Care local care delivery. Optum Care leverages modern technology and data and analytics to improve clinical care and offer superior quality and value to patients, payers and physicians. Aligning care delivery improves the health of communities at the local level. In fact, perhaps, nowhere else can the potential benefit to individuals be as profound. And while Optum Care already comprises more than half of OptumHealth's revenues, we are still early in developing this business. You should expect to see us continue to build out Optum Care market-by-market to emerge as a national platform for primary care-driven ambulatory care services. We aim to expand our care delivery through owned or affiliated clinics to more than 75 local markets, where more than 200 million people reside. 
This quarter, OptumHealth was honored to receive a multi-billion-dollar award from the Veterans Administration to conduct medical disability exams for servicemen and women for a period of up to 5 years. This award highlights some of the unique services we can offer governments as customers and shows how the diversity of our capabilities and customer segments drives overall growth. 
OptumRx continues to advance our pharmacy care services business. This is another example of how we can help make the health system work better when we integrate across the Optum platform. We differentiate through the value of superior data analytics, clinical integration and consumer engagement at the earliest point of care possible. 
OptumHealth, with its deep expertise, scaled capabilities and assets and care management, clinical insights and population health, is helping to enable this transformation to what we call pharmacy care services. The value of this approach is particularly evident in the areas of chronic care and specialty pharmacy, where we generate more value for benefit sponsors and consumers than anyone in this market. And we are still only in the early stages in the evolution of this approach. The market is responding to our focus on total cost. OptumRx continues to perform well and expects to build on the success seen during 2017 selling season for 2018 and beyond. Our customer retention rate for January 2017 will be in the high 90s. 
OptumInsight's backlog grew 24% year-over-year to $12.6 billion, and script growth at OptumRx and the number of people served by OptumHealth continue to grow, consistent with our expectations. 
Optum's third quarter revenues grew 9.4%. Our third quarter operating earnings grew 28% year-over-year to approach $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, earnings from operations are up 40% to more than $3.8 billion. Our third quarter operating margin of 6.9% expanded both sequentially and year-over-year led by OptumInsight's margin and offset by continued investments in the Optum health care delivery businesses. 
We recognized Optum remains a young company, still in the formative stages in many respects and requiring continued investment and improvement. We know we can and should perform better and, in turn, help make the health system work better for more people. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."

We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again with solid growth across all 3 domest",1077,"Thank you, Larry. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again with solid growth across all 3 domestic medical markets. This continues a remarkable organic growth trend at UnitedHealthcare. Over the half decade leading up to 2016, we came to serve 9 million more people with medical benefits in domestic markets. We are delivering value through a combination of innovative and expansive products and service capabilities, data-driven consumer engagement and decision resources and modern value-based relationships with care providers, supported by data sharing and physician engagement. These capabilities engage and support consumers, while containing costs for both the health consumer as well as their benefit sponsors. Our full year commercial medical cost trend remains solidly in line with our estimate of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
The market continues to respond positively to the value UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual plans offer. Excluding individual plans, our commercial group business has grown to serve 775,000 more people year-over-year, continuing its consistent pattern of growth. In 6 of the past 7 calendar years, our Employer & Individual business has grown the number of consumers served with cumulative growth across all products totaling in the millions of people, all of it organic. 
In the seniors’ market, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement's performance continues to strengthen each year. In the past 12 months, more than 600,000 additional seniors have chosen our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products. These plans have excellent consumer retention rates and distinctive consumer net promoter scores. The strength in our Medicare business is grounded in the quality of our benefit offerings, the stability of our networks and a distinctive clinical engagement and consumer experience approach. This approach directly engages our own clinical resources when data suggests we need to better coordinate care. These activities improve consumer satisfaction, or NPS, and strengthen loyalty, customer retention, STARS performance and the use of health care resources, all leading to better value for seniors. 
Our Medicare Advantage plans are increasingly recognized for quality and service. For 2018, factoring in our expected growth, we expect 85% of UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage membership will be in plans rated 4 stars or higher by CMS. For 2017, we expect this metric to exceed 80%. 
This quarter, our Group Retiree call centers achieved J.D. Power's certification, placing them among the highest performing in consumer services across all industries. This accomplishment reflects the commitment and compassion of our Medicare team, who seek to serve seniors with high-quality health care and flawless service. 
We expect 2017 to be another year of strong growth, both in individual and group MA. We also expect to grow in Part D in 2017 with the introduction of a new nationwide product set targeted to a broader senior demographic. 
Our Community & State plans have grown steadily in response to state governments' needs to improve quality for beneficiaries while ensuring the sustainability of their programs. The increase in Medicaid benefit coverage has been a clear success of the Affordable Care Act, serving millions of -- more Americans and using public funds in the most effective way. Our ability to improve quality and outcomes for all types of Medicaid beneficiaries, including those with some of the most complex medical conditions, has driven distinguished overall growth for us for a number of years, including organic growth of 9% or nearly 500,000 people in the past 12 months. 
Our commitment to quality care, outcomes and service have led to our position as the largest organization serving programs for dual-eligible beneficiaries and those who need long-term services and support. Today, we serve more than 0.5 million of these vulnerable individuals for our state customers and our growth in these categories continues. This past quarter, we were honored to be selected to proceed to contract in Virginia in what will be another new state partner for us. And in just the past few days, we were selected to serve in Missouri, also a new state for our Community & State business. Our new business and growth opportunities for 2017 and beyond are as robust as ever. 
Looking at these benefits businesses together, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues of $37.2 billion -- revenues of $37.2 billion grew 13.3% year-over-year with organic growth again across the 3 businesses. It has also been organic -- same organic growth has been experienced over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by a double-digit percentage over third quarter 2015. Earnings from operations of $2.1 billion also grew 13% year-over-year on steady operating margins of 5.7%. 
Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Our third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew 12% over last year. The consolidated medical care ratio decreased 60 basis points to 80.3%. Through the first 9 months of the year, our medical care ratio of 81.3% is nearly identical to last year. The operating cost ratio has improved 60 basis points year-to-date to 15%. The third quarter ratio of 15.2% increased 60 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the regular seasonal increase in marketing and enrollment costs as well as increased levels of investment across the enterprise to develop and support future growth. 
As Steve mentioned, third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 grew 23% year-over-year and were supported by distinctive cash flow. Year-to-date, adjusted cash flows from operations of $7.4 billion are 1.4x net income, and adjusted cash flow was 1.7x net income in the third quarter. 
We are increasing our outlook for 2016 adjusted earnings to approximately $8 per share due to the strength of the results produced by our businesses so far this year. We look to finish 2016 with strong momentum and carry that momentum into 2017. 
At this point of the year, the focus begins to shift to the coming year, and we look forward to discussing our 2017 outlook with you in depth at our investor conference on Tuesday, November 29. While we will reserve that discussion for another 6 weeks, we will offer that, at this point, we are comfortable with where the consensus 2017 adjusted earnings per share are currently positioned on The Street. We remain committed to continually improving our performance. If we finish the year with the momentum we aspire to, we could potentially see our 2017 EPS view reflect a modestly stronger growth outlook. For now, we will maintain an appropriately prudent posture.

A couple of things. I think past history, in terms of how our business is kind of lined up this way currently shows that the fourth quarter for Optum is always going pretty much play out this way, and I'll talk about that in a minute. So the third quarter, a strong quarter for us. It met expectations and we're exactly where we expected to be right now in terms of our in-line expectations. The fourth quarter always brings to us seasonality. And when we get into the seasonality, we're dealing with pay for performance. We're dealing with our incentive and our shared savings. What we're doing from a technology standpoint during the year, a lot of that comes to play and impacts us during the fourth quarter. The number of new accounts that we have as well as AEP kicks in, some of our coding kicks in. So we have a lot on the list side in the fourth quarter. But what I might do is talk a little bit about what our overall business plan has been. Our overall business plan has been to have these large, well, what I'll call, complex relationships. And when we get into that, and this is all part of how we build this during the year, well, we expected to have around 10 of these major relationships. We're probably somewhere around 20 at this point in time and this has been building over the last few years. We have 3 measurements that kick into this as well and that is our backlog. And I think I mentioned it a few minutes ago on insight of about $12.6 billion. That's up about 24% year-over-year. We have our qualified sales pipeline that will also kick in partially during the fourth quarter. That's up about 2x over last year. And the third area is our sales for this year, what I'll call, our TCV, our total contract value, that's up about 3x. So we're confident with where we're at right now for the fourth quarter. We believe the fourth quarter will give us momentum into 2017. So we're right where we expected to be. I will tell you at this time next year, if we're sitting here, we'll be having the same conversation because it will constantly be a seasonality issue for us to deal with in the fourth quarter."

So as you said, we'll discuss 2017 at our investor conference in November. I think the largest tailwind for the business, as you're probably picking up, is growth both at Optum, which you've seem pretty systemically throughout the year with the PBM wins and then, obviously, here with the Quest win, which is Optum360 win as well as, what I'll call, a lot of that smaller business-size wins that occur in that business every day, a lot of which you'll see in that ramp in the Q4 as well. All those things speak to Optum's growth. And I think UnitedHealthcare's growth is statistically well understood with the pattern of growth in its membership across all 3 lines of business. The second one I would point out is the reduced loss position on the ACA that, clearly, will aid earnings in 2017 as well. On the headwinds front, obviously, with that growth, there's a lot of implementation costs that need to occur. And then as you can tell, we're strategically positioning Optum to have a broader range in serving more market segments as well. So there's a lot of de novo startup costs, if you will, in that business as well as a lot of implementation costs for the substantive business that we've won over time. The last thing, I guess, I'd point out in 2017, particularly at this distance and maybe a reason why you feel like we are -- we may be more moderate in terms of our point of view at this early stage, is really we -- this organization has a deep respect for medical costs and trends. And while we expect them to be pretty level, our trends to be pretty level next year, we're deeply respectful of that -- of medical costs as well as the rating environment. As those things become clear, that's when I think that you'll see us clarify our position with respect to 2017 and that could be as early as in the 2017 investor conference in November."

And so you mentioned synchronization, and as you know, this is a data-driven approach. It's been central to the wins that we posted this year from some very large and sophisticated buyers. And so this is a new approach and we do think we're redefining pharmacy care services: taking pharmacy data, coupling it and linking it to medical data, linking it to the care delivery process and including lab behavioral data in a comprehensive data set, we call it eSync. And the whole business is focused on now a whole-person approach, how can we take everything we know about a member's medical condition and improve their care, utilizing cost strategies and cost trend management strategies that you mentioned, but much more than that, delivering care in a more meaningful way. This could include phone calls by a pharmacist, house calls by nurses. This could include adherence programs. It's a full suite of programs all aimed at driving down total medical costs.

From our view, certainly in the quarter, costs were well controlled. And as you look at the consolidated medical care ratio, it was 80.3% in the third quarter this year, and that's actually down 60 basis points year-over-year, so down a little bit more than we had expected. So we continue to do well managing costs across the portfolio within UnitedHealthcare. To the components of development specifically, so underneath that, we did have a prior period reserve development in the quarter of about $120 million and that was favorable. That's pretty consistent with the development we've recorded in the same quarter last year. As you look at the pieces inside of it, to your question, the current year component was favorable $230 million, and that was partially offset by $110 million of prior year unfavorable development. With regard to the businesses, I would tell you that it's really less about the exchanges, frankly, and it's more about our core businesses across Medicare, Medicaid and our commercial businesses, both the current year favorable as well as the prior year unfavorable. And on the prior year unfavorable, I'd tell you that we do have a host of things that resolve in any given quarter. And there was nothing in this quarter that was individually material. And that prior year element does not influence our current or our future outlook on trend. So as we look to the full year and look at our medical costs, we expect a medical care ratio of 81.5% on the full year, plus or minus 50 basis points. And I'd probably tell you, we'd likely orient below that midpoint."

It's meaningful to them, the stability in premiums and co-pays and choice. And so we think we're really well positioned. And then you add to that the capabilities that we've been investing in as well in terms of our quality, which benefits our members. But also, it's something that we're going to stay diligent about.

I think at the end of the day, the reason that we're posting these wins is, first of all, we are driving better economics in the market. That's important when you're trying to save money in drugs. But it is this differentiated model that we're selling, the pharmacy care services model is resonating with very sophisticated buyers. I think what you're seeing, Scott, is the convergence of the traditional PBM model, which we're trying to rebuild, and combining it with the Optum clinical platform, and here, we're talking about OptumHealth and all the care management, data management and care delivery services.

When you look at the performance inside the quarter, I would tell you that, as you pointed out, nothing's really changed on the ACA front, and that's a good thing. Our third quarter was very much in line with our revised expectations that we set coming out of the second quarter and we've continued to maintain our full year view. To be more specific about it, so we recorded losses in the quarter of $200 million. And of that, $120 million was offset against the premium deficiency reserve. And the remaining $80 million flowed through the P&L this quarter. That $80 million of P&L impact is very comparable to the P&L impact we had in the third quarter last year, so very similar year-over-year. And from our view, we think that we're appropriately positioned for the remainder of the year. I think you also asked about the contribution of enrollment from special election versus open enrollment. I would tell you that we have a little less orientation towards special election this year as compared to last year. So to your point, we were a little -- a shade above 20% sitting through the third quarter of the year. And now we're more in the mid-teens as you look at our ACA-compliant membership base.

We've been planting seeds. And I would say that we're strong with the NHS. We're strong with NHS improvement. We're getting stronger with the Minister of Health as well as the Secretary of Health. As we sit here today, we actually have the Minister of Health with us for the next 2 or 3 days on tour with quite a few of the commissioners of the trust, which could be hospitals the way we would know it. I'd say that as we've gone through this, with the relationship building and where we stand, the pipeline is getting stronger. And I believe that 2017 will be a year that we will validate as we've been validating some things here in the States. So that's where I would say that the international sits in the U.K. We are also working with our sister organization, Amil, in Brazil, and that's more of a health plan. As you know, the way that we would approach that from our standpoint. So we're working day in, day out to line up with them. But we are also looking at other emerging markets. We are looking, probably, and the way we would go about it is to look at Australia, maybe Mexico, maybe Asia. But we're going to finish out what we're doing with the U.K. and have a very solid start as well as in Brazil before we start to pursue other things. So again, we've talked about that market potentially being a $500 billion market. And we remain focused and confident that, that's the size of that market. When you move over into what we're doing on the -- what I'll call, our large deeper relationships, and I spoke about that both in the script as well as on the other answer. Instead of me speaking on this, I'm going to ask Bill to talk about it from an OptumInsight 360 standpoint and some of the large relationships we're working with. And then I'm going to ask Amir to do the same on the -- what I'll call the Optum Care side. I will make one comment myself on what we're doing in the military. We closed the -- we were able to get this nice award with the Veterans Administration on disability exams. So that's -- we won about 8 out of 12 regions, exactly 8 out of 12 regions. 4 at LHI that's in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. 4 in California with MSLA that we own. It'll service about 4.2 million service men and women. And we'll be going strong with that starting in January of this year. So Bill?"

With respect to our managed -- our revenue management offerings, we've used this word validation a fair number of times this morning. And I think in the case of the win that we had with Quest, it just validates once again that our boundaries of where we can offer these technology-enabled services is expanding. And I think Quest represents that as one of the largest, if not the largest, lab diagnostic companies in the world. And I think whether it's a health plan, whether it's an employer, whether it's a health system, they all do go through a rigorous evaluation process. And whether its Quest or Dignity, which we've talked about in the past, they're looking for modern technology, modern systems. They're looking for people that can bring in accuracy and the expertise that could reengineer workflows, that could leverage a worldwide workforce. And peppering in all of that is someone who can drive analytics and insights to really automate and improve the economic performance and the efficiency performance of their own operations. And anyone that evaluates us likes to see that; one, we're comprehensive in that approach; two, we pretty much line up culturally with them; and they really enjoy the fact that we drive a performance-based contract with them. So we're very much focused on aligning ourselves with them so that they are successful. And that formula is working. It's highly enabled by a very modern set of portfolios that, as Dave said, people buy every day. But more and more, we're seeing a trend in the marketplace where any of those constituencies are looking for more of an end-to-end comprehensive approach to handling some of these most pronounced challenges they have in their environments. And Optum becomes a pretty formidable and desirable option in those contexts. So with that said, maybe I'll turn it over to Amir."

What I would say is, is that our agenda here has been very focused on solid opportunities for access around simplifying the environment in total, about going into managing costs and keeping the affordability of these programs more relevant to the marketplace and to really kind of lean to the programs that have really worked extremely well. Medicaid has been a very significant success of the ACA. And wherever that has played out, those environments, those markets have actually been more stable and better performing. And Medicare continues to be a core program of the country. And that funding for both Medicare and Medicaid is something that we have been advocating, the consistency and stability of it, kind of those themes are what we have stayed with. And I think commenting beyond that, particularly as the new administrations take hold and so forth, our posture is to be very constructive about making the marketplace work most effectively and serving the most number of individuals and making that system simpler and more usable for everybody.

And I think that's kind of really just sums it up. I won't go further than that. And again, we just have to prove that every quarter in terms of our own performance, our execution, the consistency of our growth and the consistency of our financial performance as we continue to grow and expand the business. And they are still a lot of opportunity. We are far from our full potential. And generally, when we conclude these sessions with you, we have an internal meeting talking about how much better we should be doing and could be doing if we performed to full potential. So we are going to continue on that path and pleased to perform consistently this quarter, expect to do it into the finish of the year, have a positive attitude on '17 and we're just going to keep working on that level.

We work to improve overall health care system performance through clinical insight, enabling technologies and distinctive data analytics, applying those capabilities across our businesses. This long-standing approach, consistently executed, continues to produce distinctive quality outcomes, balanced growth and steady financial performance. 
Third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew nearly $5 billion over last year or 12%. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $2.17 per share. Third quarter adjusted cash flows of $3.4 billion increased 22% over last year, and third quarter return on equity exceeded 21%.

In collaboration with Quest, our analytic processing approaches and technology can further modernize their business processes, improve service, lower costs, improve access to clinical and financial information and heighten transparency for consumers. 
Hospitals and acute care facilities continued to move to Optum360's innovative revenue services products. Today, we serve more than 400 facilities through our patented computer-assisted medical coding technology. The number of facilities using our computerized documentation technology has doubled in the past year to more than 125. These represent solid advances in markets with significantly more growth and expansion potential. 
A recent BlackRock (sic) [ Black Book ] Market Research report estimated 85% of care providers are assessing and/or replacing their approach to revenue management over the next few years. For the third consecutive year, the experts at the BlackRock (sic) [ Black Book ] have ranked Optum360 as the best in the market in revenue cycle management software technology, in revenue cycle management outsourcing and in computer-assisted coding and health information outsourcing solutions. During this coming quarter, Optum360 will reach a run rate of $60 billion in handle customer billings. 
This quarter, consulting leader, Frost & Sullivan, named Optum the top population health management company in the nation, based on their assessment of the Optum One technology. Optum One integrates patient clinical information with administrative and demographic data covering millions of people. Proprietary analytics are applied to help care providers identify and take action with patients who are at highest risk of adverse health developments. Today, nearly 700 facilities and nearly 7,000 medical clinics are using Optum One, growth of 28% year-over-year. 
We see a broad range of opportunities in helping enable ACOs as this emerging market evolves. The rise of ACOs and value-based care in the market will only increase Optum One's utility and value. 
OptumHealth revenues continue to grow strongly, led by Optum Care local care delivery. Optum Care leverages modern technology and data and analytics to improve clinical care and offer superior quality and value to patients, payers and physicians. Aligning care delivery improves the health of communities at the local level. In fact, perhaps, nowhere else can the potential benefit to individuals be as profound. And while Optum Care already comprises more than half of OptumHealth's revenues, we are still early in developing this business. You should expect to see us continue to build out Optum Care market-by-market to emerge as a national platform for primary care-driven ambulatory care services. We aim to expand our care delivery through owned or affiliated clinics to more than 75 local markets, where more than 200 million people reside. 
This quarter, OptumHealth was honored to receive a multi-billion-dollar award from the Veterans Administration to conduct medical disability exams for servicemen and women for a period of up to 5 years. This award highlights some of the unique services we can offer governments as customers and shows how the diversity of our capabilities and customer segments drives overall growth. 
OptumRx continues to advance our pharmacy care services business. This is another example of how we can help make the health system work better when we integrate across the Optum platform. We differentiate through the value of superior data analytics, clinical integration and consumer engagement at the earliest point of care possible. 
OptumHealth, with its deep expertise, scaled capabilities and assets and care management, clinical insights and population health, is helping to enable this transformation to what we call pharmacy care services. The value of this approach is particularly evident in the areas of chronic care and specialty pharmacy, where we generate more value for benefit sponsors and consumers than anyone in this market. And we are still only in the early stages in the evolution of this approach. The market is responding to our focus on total cost. OptumRx continues to perform well and expects to build on the success seen during 2017 selling season for 2018 and beyond. Our customer retention rate for January 2017 will be in the high 90s. 
OptumInsight's backlog grew 24% year-over-year to $12.6 billion, and script growth at OptumRx and the number of people served by OptumHealth continue to grow, consistent with our expectations. 
Optum's third quarter revenues grew 9.4%. Our third quarter operating earnings grew 28% year-over-year to approach $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, earnings from operations are up 40% to more than $3.8 billion. Our third quarter operating margin of 6.9% expanded both sequentially and year-over-year led by OptumInsight's margin and offset by continued investments in the Optum health care delivery businesses. 
We recognized Optum remains a young company, still in the formative stages in many respects and requiring continued investment and improvement. We know we can and should perform better and, in turn, help make the health system work better for more people. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."

We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again with solid growth across all 3 domest",1077,"Thank you, Larry. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again with solid growth across all 3 domestic medical markets. This continues a remarkable organic growth trend at UnitedHealthcare. Over the half decade leading up to 2016, we came to serve 9 million more people with medical benefits in domestic markets. We are delivering value through a combination of innovative and expansive products and service capabilities, data-driven consumer engagement and decision resources and modern value-based relationships with care providers, supported by data sharing and physician engagement. These capabilities engage and support consumers, while containing costs for both the health consumer as well as their benefit sponsors. Our full year commercial medical cost trend remains solidly in line with our estimate of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
The market continues to respond positively to the value UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual plans offer. Excluding individual plans, our commercial group business has grown to serve 775,000 more people year-over-year, continuing its consistent pattern of growth. In 6 of the past 7 calendar years, our Employer & Individual business has grown the number of consumers served with cumulative growth across all products totaling in the millions of people, all of it organic. 
In the seniors’ market, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement's performance continues to strengthen each year. In the past 12 months, more than 600,000 additional seniors have chosen our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products. These plans have excellent consumer retention rates and distinctive consumer net promoter scores. The strength in our Medicare business is grounded in the quality of our benefit offerings, the stability of our networks and a distinctive clinical engagement and consumer experience approach. This approach directly engages our own clinical resources when data suggests we need to better coordinate care. These activities improve consumer satisfaction, or NPS, and strengthen loyalty, customer retention, STARS performance and the use of health care resources, all leading to better value for seniors. 
Our Medicare Advantage plans are increasingly recognized for quality and service. For 2018, factoring in our expected growth, we expect 85% of UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage membership will be in plans rated 4 stars or higher by CMS. For 2017, we expect this metric to exceed 80%. 
This quarter, our Group Retiree call centers achieved J.D. Power's certification, placing them among the highest performing in consumer services across all industries. This accomplishment reflects the commitment and compassion of our Medicare team, who seek to serve seniors with high-quality health care and flawless service. 
We expect 2017 to be another year of strong growth, both in individual and group MA. We also expect to grow in Part D in 2017 with the introduction of a new nationwide product set targeted to a broader senior demographic. 
Our Community & State plans have grown steadily in response to state governments' needs to improve quality for beneficiaries while ensuring the sustainability of their programs. The increase in Medicaid benefit coverage has been a clear success of the Affordable Care Act, serving millions of -- more Americans and using public funds in the most effective way. Our ability to improve quality and outcomes for all types of Medicaid beneficiaries, including those with some of the most complex medical conditions, has driven distinguished overall growth for us for a number of years, including organic growth of 9% or nearly 500,000 people in the past 12 months. 
Our commitment to quality care, outcomes and service have led to our position as the largest organization serving programs for dual-eligible beneficiaries and those who need long-term services and support. Today, we serve more than 0.5 million of these vulnerable individuals for our state customers and our growth in these categories continues. This past quarter, we were honored to be selected to proceed to contract in Virginia in what will be another new state partner for us. And in just the past few days, we were selected to serve in Missouri, also a new state for our Community & State business. Our new business and growth opportunities for 2017 and beyond are as robust as ever. 
Looking at these benefits businesses together, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues of $37.2 billion -- revenues of $37.2 billion grew 13.3% year-over-year with organic growth again across the 3 businesses. It has also been organic -- same organic growth has been experienced over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by a double-digit percentage over third quarter 2015. Earnings from operations of $2.1 billion also grew 13% year-over-year on steady operating margins of 5.7%. 
Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Our third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew 12% over last year. The consolidated medical care ratio decreased 60 basis points to 80.3%. Through the first 9 months of the year, our medical care ratio of 81.3% is nearly identical to last year. The operating cost ratio has improved 60 basis points year-to-date to 15%. The third quarter ratio of 15.2% increased 60 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the regular seasonal increase in marketing and enrollment costs as well as increased levels of investment across the enterprise to develop and support future growth. 
As Steve mentioned, third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 grew 23% year-over-year and were supported by distinctive cash flow. Year-to-date, adjusted cash flows from operations of $7.4 billion are 1.4x net income, and adjusted cash flow was 1.7x net income in the third quarter. 
We are increasing our outlook for 2016 adjusted earnings to approximately $8 per share due to the strength of the results produced by our businesses so far this year. We look to finish 2016 with strong momentum and carry that momentum into 2017. 
At this point of the year, the focus begins to shift to the coming year, and we look forward to discussing our 2017 outlook with you in depth at our investor conference on Tuesday, November 29. While we will reserve that discussion for another 6 weeks, we will offer that, at this point, we are comfortable with where the consensus 2017 adjusted earnings per share are currently positioned on The Street. We remain committed to continually improving our performance. If we finish the year with the momentum we aspire to, we could potentially see our 2017 EPS view reflect a modestly stronger growth outlook. For now, we will maintain an appropriately prudent posture.

A couple of things. I think past history, in terms of how our business is kind of lined up this way currently shows that the fourth quarter for Optum is always going pretty much play out this way, and I'll talk about that in a minute. So the third quarter, a strong quarter for us. It met expectations and we're exactly where we expected to be right now in terms of our in-line expectations. The fourth quarter always brings to us seasonality. And when we get into the seasonality, we're dealing with pay for performance. We're dealing with our incentive and our shared savings. What we're doing from a technology standpoint during the year, a lot of that comes to play and impacts us during the fourth quarter. The number of new accounts that we have as well as AEP kicks in, some of our coding kicks in. So we have a lot on the list side in the fourth quarter. But what I might do is talk a little bit about what our overall business plan has been. Our overall business plan has been to have these large, well, what I'll call, complex relationships. And when we get into that, and this is all part of how we build this during the year, well, we expected to have around 10 of these major relationships. We're probably somewhere around 20 at this point in time and this has been building over the last few years. We have 3 measurements that kick into this as well and that is our backlog. And I think I mentioned it a few minutes ago on insight of about $12.6 billion. That's up about 24% year-over-year. We have our qualified sales pipeline that will also kick in partially during the fourth quarter. That's up about 2x over last year. And the third area is our sales for this year, what I'll call, our TCV, our total contract value, that's up about 3x. So we're confident with where we're at right now for the fourth quarter. We believe the fourth quarter will give us momentum into 2017. So we're right where we expected to be. I will tell you at this time next year, if we're sitting here, we'll be having the same conversation because it will constantly be a seasonality issue for us to deal with in the fourth quarter."

So as you said, we'll discuss 2017 at our investor conference in November. I think the largest tailwind for the business, as you're probably picking up, is growth both at Optum, which you've seem pretty systemically throughout the year with the PBM wins and then, obviously, here with the Quest win, which is Optum360 win as well as, what I'll call, a lot of that smaller business-size wins that occur in that business every day, a lot of which you'll see in that ramp in the Q4 as well. All those things speak to Optum's growth. And I think UnitedHealthcare's growth is statistically well understood with the pattern of growth in its membership across all 3 lines of business. The second one I would point out is the reduced loss position on the ACA that, clearly, will aid earnings in 2017 as well. On the headwinds front, obviously, with that growth, there's a lot of implementation costs that need to occur. And then as you can tell, we're strategically positioning Optum to have a broader range in serving more market segments as well. So there's a lot of de novo startup costs, if you will, in that business as well as a lot of implementation costs for the substantive business that we've won over time. The last thing, I guess, I'd point out in 2017, particularly at this distance and maybe a reason why you feel like we are -- we may be more moderate in terms of our point of view at this early stage, is really we -- this organization has a deep respect for medical costs and trends. And while we expect them to be pretty level, our trends to be pretty level next year, we're deeply respectful of that -- of medical costs as well as the rating environment. As those things become clear, that's when I think that you'll see us clarify our position with respect to 2017 and that could be as early as in the 2017 investor conference in November."

And so you mentioned synchronization, and as you know, this is a data-driven approach. It's been central to the wins that we posted this year from some very large and sophisticated buyers. And so this is a new approach and we do think we're redefining pharmacy care services: taking pharmacy data, coupling it and linking it to medical data, linking it to the care delivery process and including lab behavioral data in a comprehensive data set, we call it eSync. And the whole business is focused on now a whole-person approach, how can we take everything we know about a member's medical condition and improve their care, utilizing cost strategies and cost trend management strategies that you mentioned, but much more than that, delivering care in a more meaningful way. This could include phone calls by a pharmacist, house calls by nurses. This could include adherence programs. It's a full suite of programs all aimed at driving down total medical costs.

And then I'd put up costs related to preparing for the growth we expect in 2017 across a number of the businesses: within our senior businesses, in MNR, some of the Optum businesses, where you've seen there've been very -- some significant new business awards for next year and as we prepare for that. Just the general upward pressure also that we see from services growth. And then all of this, as you'd expect from us normally and offset, partially, by the productivity gains that we've logged [ph]. So within our expectations, if I sum it up, and those are the types of investments that we're making."

From our view, certainly in the quarter, costs were well controlled. And as you look at the consolidated medical care ratio, it was 80.3% in the third quarter this year, and that's actually down 60 basis points year-over-year, so down a little bit more than we had expected. So we continue to do well managing costs across the portfolio within UnitedHealthcare. To the components of development specifically, so underneath that, we did have a prior period reserve development in the quarter of about $120 million and that was favorable. That's pretty consistent with the development we've recorded in the same quarter last year. As you look at the pieces inside of it, to your question, the current year component was favorable $230 million, and that was partially offset by $110 million of prior year unfavorable development. With regard to the businesses, I would tell you that it's really less about the exchanges, frankly, and it's more about our core businesses across Medicare, Medicaid and our commercial businesses, both the current year favorable as well as the prior year unfavorable. And on the prior year unfavorable, I'd tell you that we do have a host of things that resolve in any given quarter. And there was nothing in this quarter that was individually material. And that prior year element does not influence our current or our future outlook on trend. So as we look to the full year and look at our medical costs, we expect a medical care ratio of 81.5% on the full year, plus or minus 50 basis points. And I'd probably tell you, we'd likely orient below that midpoint."

It's meaningful to them, the stability in premiums and co-pays and choice. And so we think we're really well positioned. And then you add to that the capabilities that we've been investing in as well in terms of our quality, which benefits our members. But also, it's something that we're going to stay diligent about.

I think at the end of the day, the reason that we're posting these wins is, first of all, we are driving better economics in the market. That's important when you're trying to save money in drugs. But it is this differentiated model that we're selling, the pharmacy care services model is resonating with very sophisticated buyers. I think what you're seeing, Scott, is the convergence of the traditional PBM model, which we're trying to rebuild, and combining it with the Optum clinical platform, and here, we're talking about OptumHealth and all the care management, data management and care delivery services.

When you look at the performance inside the quarter, I would tell you that, as you pointed out, nothing's really changed on the ACA front, and that's a good thing. Our third quarter was very much in line with our revised expectations that we set coming out of the second quarter and we've continued to maintain our full year view. To be more specific about it, so we recorded losses in the quarter of $200 million. And of that, $120 million was offset against the premium deficiency reserve. And the remaining $80 million flowed through the P&L this quarter. That $80 million of P&L impact is very comparable to the P&L impact we had in the third quarter last year, so very similar year-over-year. And from our view, we think that we're appropriately positioned for the remainder of the year. I think you also asked about the contribution of enrollment from special election versus open enrollment. I would tell you that we have a little less orientation towards special election this year as compared to last year. So to your point, we were a little -- a shade above 20% sitting through the third quarter of the year. And now we're more in the mid-teens as you look at our ACA-compliant membership base.

We've been planting seeds. And I would say that we're strong with the NHS. We're strong with NHS improvement. We're getting stronger with the Minister of Health as well as the Secretary of Health. As we sit here today, we actually have the Minister of Health with us for the next 2 or 3 days on tour with quite a few of the commissioners of the trust, which could be hospitals the way we would know it.

As you know, the way that we would approach that from our standpoint. So we're working day in, day out to line up with them. But we are also looking at other emerging markets. We are looking, probably, and the way we would go about it is to look at Australia, maybe Mexico, maybe Asia. But we're going to finish out what we're doing with the U.K. and have a very solid start as well as in Brazil before we start to pursue other things. So again, we've talked about that market potentially being a $500 billion market. And we remain focused and confident that, that's the size of that market. When you move over into what we're doing on the -- what I'll call, our large deeper relationships, and I spoke about that both in the script as well as on the other answer. Instead of me speaking on this, I'm going to ask Bill to talk about it from an OptumInsight 360 standpoint and some of the large relationships we're working with. And then I'm going to ask Amir to do the same on the -- what I'll call the Optum Care side. I will make one comment myself on what we're doing in the military. We closed the -- we were able to get this nice award with the Veterans Administration on disability exams. So that's -- we won about 8 out of 12 regions, exactly 8 out of 12 regions. 4 at LHI that's in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. 4 in California with MSLA that we own. It'll service about 4.2 million service men and women. And we'll be going strong with that starting in January of this year. So Bill?"

With respect to our managed -- our revenue management offerings, we've used this word validation a fair number of times this morning. And I think in the case of the win that we had with Quest, it just validates once again that our boundaries of where we can offer these technology-enabled services is expanding. And I think Quest represents that as one of the largest, if not the largest, lab diagnostic companies in the world. And I think whether it's a health plan, whether it's an employer, whether it's a health system, they all do go through a rigorous evaluation process. And whether its Quest or Dignity, which we've talked about in the past, they're looking for modern technology, modern systems. They're looking for people that can bring in accuracy and the expertise that could reengineer workflows, that could leverage a worldwide workforce. And peppering in all of that is someone who can drive analytics and insights to really automate and improve the economic performance and the efficiency performance of their own operations.

But more and more, we're seeing a trend in the marketplace where any of those constituencies are looking for more of an end-to-end comprehensive approach to handling some of these most pronounced challenges they have in their environments. And Optum becomes a pretty formidable and desirable option in those contexts. So with that said, maybe I'll turn it over to Amir."

And within those markets, we're seeing growth across different payer categories. And we're also seeing growth across a continuum of care assets. We also continue to grow our MedExpress centers. We see great success in our consumerism approach there with MedExpress, and we'll continue to expand those assets. And we also see ourselves addressing more and more complex populations: dual-eligibles, of course, Medicare Advantage, special needs populations as well. So we'll continue to see that. And then applying these capabilities, leveraging the capabilities from OptumInsight, our analytics, our risk stratification into our care delivery groups and now what Larry mentioned, applying those capabilities from Optum Care and OptumInsight abroad, globally."

What I would say is, is that our agenda here has been very focused on solid opportunities for access around simplifying the environment in total, about going into managing costs and keeping the affordability of these programs more relevant to the marketplace and to really kind of lean to the programs that have really worked extremely well. Medicaid has been a very significant success of the ACA. And wherever that has played out, those environments, those markets have actually been more stable and better performing. And Medicare continues to be a core program of the country. And that funding for both Medicare and Medicaid is something that we have been advocating, the consistency and stability of it, kind of those themes are what we have stayed with. And I think commenting beyond that, particularly as the new administrations take hold and so forth, our posture is to be very constructive about making the marketplace work most effectively and serving the most number of individuals and making that system simpler and more usable for everybody.

So in view of the fact that you didn't do that this quarter and it seems from your well -- seemingly well-based enthusiasm for your momentum and the strength of your business and customer relationships that you're unlikely to crush your margins off the new business in the several coming quarters, how much of this new business win is actually related to the -- and also the ability to preserve margin especially within UHC, is ability to the -- is attributable to the integration of all of the business units, not just in Optum Care within OptumHealth, but -- or not just the UHC with OptumInsight, but all of it together.

And I think that's kind of really just sums it up. I won't go further than that. And again, we just have to prove that every quarter in terms of our own performance, our execution, the consistency of our growth and the consistency of our financial performance as we continue to grow and expand the business. And they are still a lot of opportunity. We are far from our full potential. And generally, when we conclude these sessions with you, we have an internal meeting talking about how much better we should be doing and could be doing if we performed to full potential. So we are going to continue on that path and pleased to perform consistently this quarter, expect to do it into the finish of the year, have a positive attitude on '17 and we're just going to keep working on that level. So that's, I think, a good way to close out the call. 
So we thank you for the conversation today. I think we've delivered a strong third quarter. We recorded solid growth in virtually every business across both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We are going to leverage this forward momentum and expect to close '16 with real energy, and drive strong and sustained performance into 2017. We'll continue to elevate the quality of our service. I think that's really important for us. We are very focused on NPS and quality performance to bring that to customers and to bring it to providers, improve the health care experience for consumers.

Looking forward, we expect continued strong performance in the fourth quarter and into 2017. That performance will be built on strong customer retention and broad-based growth across our businesses driven by deeper and more strategic relationships and new business awards already received. 
To take you deeper, Larry Renfro will discuss Optum's third quarter performance, and then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group overall.

At Optum, we are pleased once again to report solid results for the third quarter and the year so far, with positive business momentum as we head into 2017. The market continues to affirm Optum's distinctive position as a scaled and broadly capable health services and innovation company. We have aligned our resources to address enduring market trends around helping make the health system work better. 
We have strengthened fundamental capabilities, deepened relationships across the industry, including unique collaborations like Optum Labs, and built a reputation for reliable service even in challenging situations. And we balanced investments in our core capabilities with the expectation that we consistently deliver operating earnings and returns on capital. 
This quarter, we again closed several large, long-term business awards. Quest Diagnostics has asked Optum360 to be the partner for revenue management, covering everything following the receipt of doctors' lab orders through billing and cash collections from health plans, payers and consumers. In collaboration with Quest, our analytic processing approaches and technology can further modernize their business processes, improve service, lower costs, improve access to clinical and financial information and heighten transparency for consumers. 
Hospitals and acute care facilities continued to move to Optum360's innovative revenue services products. Today, we serve more than 400 facilities through our patented computer-assisted medical coding technology. The number of facilities using our computerized documentation technology has doubled in the past year to more than 125. These represent solid advances in markets with significantly more growth and expansion potential. 
A recent BlackRock (sic) [ Black Book ] Market Research report estimated 85% of care providers are assessing and/or replacing their approach to revenue management over the next few years. For the third consecutive year, the experts at the BlackRock (sic) [ Black Book ] have ranked Optum360 as the best in the market in revenue cycle management software technology, in revenue cycle management outsourcing and in computer-assisted coding and health information outsourcing solutions. During this coming quarter, Optum360 will reach a run rate of $60 billion in handle customer billings. 
This quarter, consulting leader, Frost & Sullivan, named Optum the top population health management company in the nation, based on their assessment of the Optum One technology. Optum One integrates patient clinical information with administrative and demographic data covering millions of people. Proprietary analytics are applied to help care providers identify and take action with patients who are at highest risk of adverse health developments. Today, nearly 700 facilities and nearly 7,000 medical clinics are using Optum One, growth of 28% year-over-year. 
We see a broad range of opportunities in helping enable ACOs as this emerging market evolves. The rise of ACOs and value-based care in the market will only increase Optum One's utility and value. 
OptumHealth revenues continue to grow strongly, led by Optum Care local care delivery. Optum Care leverages modern technology and data and analytics to improve clinical care and offer superior quality and value to patients, payers and physicians. Aligning care delivery improves the health of communities at the local level. In fact, perhaps, nowhere else can the potential benefit to individuals be as profound. And while Optum Care already comprises more than half of OptumHealth's revenues, we are still early in developing this business. You should expect to see us continue to build out Optum Care market-by-market to emerge as a national platform for primary care-driven ambulatory care services. We aim to expand our care delivery through owned or affiliated clinics to more than 75 local markets, where more than 200 million people reside. 
This quarter, OptumHealth was honored to receive a multi-billion-dollar award from the Veterans Administration to conduct medical disability exams for servicemen and women for a period of up to 5 years. This award highlights some of the unique services we can offer governments as customers and shows how the diversity of our capabilities and customer segments drives overall growth. 
OptumRx continues to advance our pharmacy care services business. This is another example of how we can help make the health system work better when we integrate across the Optum platform. We differentiate through the value of superior data analytics, clinical integration and consumer engagement at the earliest point of care possible. 
OptumHealth, with its deep expertise, scaled capabilities and assets and care management, clinical insights and population health, is helping to enable this transformation to what we call pharmacy care services. The value of this approach is particularly evident in the areas of chronic care and specialty pharmacy, where we generate more value for benefit sponsors and consumers than anyone in this market. And we are still only in the early stages in the evolution of this approach. The market is responding to our focus on total cost. OptumRx continues to perform well and expects to build on the success seen during 2017 selling season for 2018 and beyond. Our customer retention rate for January 2017 will be in the high 90s. 
OptumInsight's backlog grew 24% year-over-year to $12.6 billion, and script growth at OptumRx and the number of people served by OptumHealth continue to grow, consistent with our expectations. 
Optum's third quarter revenues grew 9.4%. Our third quarter operating earnings grew 28% year-over-year to approach $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, earnings from operations are up 40% to more than $3.8 billion. Our third quarter operating margin of 6.9% expanded both sequentially and year-over-year led by OptumInsight's margin and offset by continued investments in the Optum health care delivery businesses. 
We recognized Optum remains a young company, still in the formative stages in many respects and requiring continued investment and improvement. We know we can and should perform better and, in turn, help make the health system work better for more people. 
Now let me turn it over to Dave."

We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again with solid growth across all 3 domest",1077,"Thank you, Larry. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again with solid growth across all 3 domestic medical markets. This continues a remarkable organic growth trend at UnitedHealthcare. Over the half decade leading up to 2016, we came to serve 9 million more people with medical benefits in domestic markets. We are delivering value through a combination of innovative and expansive products and service capabilities, data-driven consumer engagement and decision resources and modern value-based relationships with care providers, supported by data sharing and physician engagement. These capabilities engage and support consumers, while containing costs for both the health consumer as well as their benefit sponsors. Our full year commercial medical cost trend remains solidly in line with our estimate of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
The market continues to respond positively to the value UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual plans offer. Excluding individual plans, our commercial group business has grown to serve 775,000 more people year-over-year, continuing its consistent pattern of growth. In 6 of the past 7 calendar years, our Employer & Individual business has grown the number of consumers served with cumulative growth across all products totaling in the millions of people, all of it organic. 
In the seniors’ market, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement's performance continues to strengthen each year. In the past 12 months, more than 600,000 additional seniors have chosen our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products. These plans have excellent consumer retention rates and distinctive consumer net promoter scores. The strength in our Medicare business is grounded in the quality of our benefit offerings, the stability of our networks and a distinctive clinical engagement and consumer experience approach. This approach directly engages our own clinical resources when data suggests we need to better coordinate care. These activities improve consumer satisfaction, or NPS, and strengthen loyalty, customer retention, STARS performance and the use of health care resources, all leading to better value for seniors. 
Our Medicare Advantage plans are increasingly recognized for quality and service. For 2018, factoring in our expected growth, we expect 85% of UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage membership will be in plans rated 4 stars or higher by CMS. For 2017, we expect this metric to exceed 80%. 
This quarter, our Group Retiree call centers achieved J.D. Power's certification, placing them among the highest performing in consumer services across all industries. This accomplishment reflects the commitment and compassion of our Medicare team, who seek to serve seniors with high-quality health care and flawless service. 
We expect 2017 to be another year of strong growth, both in individual and group MA. We also expect to grow in Part D in 2017 with the introduction of a new nationwide product set targeted to a broader senior demographic. 
Our Community & State plans have grown steadily in response to state governments' needs to improve quality for beneficiaries while ensuring the sustainability of their programs. The increase in Medicaid benefit coverage has been a clear success of the Affordable Care Act, serving millions of -- more Americans and using public funds in the most effective way. Our ability to improve quality and outcomes for all types of Medicaid beneficiaries, including those with some of the most complex medical conditions, has driven distinguished overall growth for us for a number of years, including organic growth of 9% or nearly 500,000 people in the past 12 months. 
Our commitment to quality care, outcomes and service have led to our position as the largest organization serving programs for dual-eligible beneficiaries and those who need long-term services and support. Today, we serve more than 0.5 million of these vulnerable individuals for our state customers and our growth in these categories continues. This past quarter, we were honored to be selected to proceed to contract in Virginia in what will be another new state partner for us. And in just the past few days, we were selected to serve in Missouri, also a new state for our Community & State business. Our new business and growth opportunities for 2017 and beyond are as robust as ever. 
Looking at these benefits businesses together, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues of $37.2 billion -- revenues of $37.2 billion grew 13.3% year-over-year with organic growth again across the 3 businesses. It has also been organic -- same organic growth has been experienced over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by a double-digit percentage over third quarter 2015. Earnings from operations of $2.1 billion also grew 13% year-over-year on steady operating margins of 5.7%. 
Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Our third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew 12% over last year. The consolidated medical care ratio decreased 60 basis points to 80.3%. Through the first 9 months of the year, our medical care ratio of 81.3% is nearly identical to last year. The operating cost ratio has improved 60 basis points year-to-date to 15%. The third quarter ratio of 15.2% increased 60 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the regular seasonal increase in marketing and enrollment costs as well as increased levels of investment across the enterprise to develop and support future growth. 
As Steve mentioned, third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 grew 23% year-over-year and were supported by distinctive cash flow. Year-to-date, adjusted cash flows from operations of $7.4 billion are 1.4x net income, and adjusted cash flow was 1.7x net income in the third quarter. 
We are increasing our outlook for 2016 adjusted earnings to approximately $8 per share due to the strength of the results produced by our businesses so far this year. We look to finish 2016 with strong momentum and carry that momentum into 2017. 
At this point of the year, the focus begins to shift to the coming year, and we look forward to discussing our 2017 outlook with you in depth at our investor conference on Tuesday, November 29. While we will reserve that discussion for another 6 weeks, we will offer that, at this point, we are comfortable with where the consensus 2017 adjusted earnings per share are currently positioned on The Street. We remain committed to continually improving our performance. If we finish the year with the momentum we aspire to, we could potentially see our 2017 EPS view reflect a modestly stronger growth outlook. For now, we will maintain an appropriately prudent posture.

A couple of things. I think past history, in terms of how our business is kind of lined up this way currently shows that the fourth quarter for Optum is always going pretty much play out this way, and I'll talk about that in a minute. So the third quarter, a strong quarter for us. It met expectations and we're exactly where we expected to be right now in terms of our in-line expectations. The fourth quarter always brings to us seasonality. And when we get into the seasonality, we're dealing with pay for performance. We're dealing with our incentive and our shared savings. What we're doing from a technology standpoint during the year, a lot of that comes to play and impacts us during the fourth quarter. The number of new accounts that we have as well as AEP kicks in, some of our coding kicks in. So we have a lot on the list side in the fourth quarter. But what I might do is talk a little bit about what our overall business plan has been. Our overall business plan has been to have these large, well, what I'll call, complex relationships. And when we get into that, and this is all part of how we build this during the year, well, we expected to have around 10 of these major relationships. We're probably somewhere around 20 at this point in time and this has been building over the last few years. We have 3 measurements that kick into this as well and that is our backlog. And I think I mentioned it a few minutes ago on insight of about $12.6 billion. That's up about 24% year-over-year. We have our qualified sales pipeline that will also kick in partially during the fourth quarter. That's up about 2x over last year. And the third area is our sales for this year, what I'll call, our TCV, our total contract value, that's up about 3x. So we're confident with where we're at right now for the fourth quarter. We believe the fourth quarter will give us momentum into 2017. So we're right where we expected to be. I will tell you at this time next year, if we're sitting here, we'll be having the same conversation because it will constantly be a seasonality issue for us to deal with in the fourth quarter."

So as you said, we'll discuss 2017 at our investor conference in November. I think the largest tailwind for the business, as you're probably picking up, is growth both at Optum, which you've seem pretty systemically throughout the year with the PBM wins and then, obviously, here with the Quest win, which is Optum360 win as well as, what I'll call, a lot of that smaller business-size wins that occur in that business every day, a lot of which you'll see in that ramp in the Q4 as well. All those things speak to Optum's growth. And I think UnitedHealthcare's growth is statistically well understood with the pattern of growth in its membership across all 3 lines of business. The second one I would point out is the reduced loss position on the ACA that, clearly, will aid earnings in 2017 as well. On the headwinds front, obviously, with that growth, there's a lot of implementation costs that need to occur. And then as you can tell, we're strategically positioning Optum to have a broader range in serving more market segments as well. So there's a lot of de novo startup costs, if you will, in that business as well as a lot of implementation costs for the substantive business that we've won over time. The last thing, I guess, I'd point out in 2017, particularly at this distance and maybe a reason why you feel like we are -- we may be more moderate in terms of our point of view at this early stage, is really we -- this organization has a deep respect for medical costs and trends. And while we expect them to be pretty level, our trends to be pretty level next year, we're deeply respectful of that -- of medical costs as well as the rating environment. As those things become clear, that's when I think that you'll see us clarify our position with respect to 2017 and that could be as early as in the 2017 investor conference in November."

And so this is a new approach and we do think we're redefining pharmacy care services: taking pharmacy data, coupling it and linking it to medical data, linking it to the care delivery process and including lab behavioral data in a comprehensive data set, we call it eSync. And the whole business is focused on now a whole-person approach, how can we take everything we know about a member's medical condition and improve their care, utilizing cost strategies and cost trend management strategies that you mentioned, but much more than that, delivering care in a more meaningful way. This could include phone calls by a pharmacist, house calls by nurses. This could include adherence programs. It's a full suite of programs all aimed at driving down total medical costs.

So first of all, I'd say that it was in line with our view here in terms of how we trended in the 3Q. So the first perspective being from 2Q to 3Q there was a sequential increase of about 60 basis points in the OCR. And that is typical what we see as we move into the open enrollment period and the investments and spend to prepare for that season begins. So that is a typical move, and I think you're referring, particularly, to the year-over-year move, the 30 basis point increase. So that's, as you stated, primarily driven by increased investments. I've cited a few places where we were making investments in the quarter. Things that you're -- you may have heard us refer to in the past and maybe you're familiar with, the ongoing Stars investments, medical affordability and clinical investments, specific businesses that we've been very vocal on in terms of where we expect to grow and invest, such as the Optum Care businesses. And then I'd put up costs related to preparing for the growth we expect in 2017 across a number of the businesses: within our senior businesses, in MNR, some of the Optum businesses, where you've seen there've been very -- some significant new business awards for next year and as we prepare for that. Just the general upward pressure also that we see from services growth. And then all of this, as you'd expect from us normally and offset, partially, by the productivity gains that we've logged [ph]. So within our expectations, if I sum it up, and those are the types of investments that we're making."

From our view, certainly in the quarter, costs were well controlled. And as you look at the consolidated medical care ratio, it was 80.3% in the third quarter this year, and that's actually down 60 basis points year-over-year, so down a little bit more than we had expected. So we continue to do well managing costs across the portfolio within UnitedHealthcare. To the components of development specifically, so underneath that, we did have a prior period reserve development in the quarter of about $120 million and that was favorable. That's pretty consistent with the development we've recorded in the same quarter last year. As you look at the pieces inside of it, to your question, the current year component was favorable $230 million, and that was partially offset by $110 million of prior year unfavorable development. With regard to the businesses, I would tell you that it's really less about the exchanges, frankly, and it's more about our core businesses across Medicare, Medicaid and our commercial businesses, both the current year favorable as well as the prior year unfavorable. And on the prior year unfavorable, I'd tell you that we do have a host of things that resolve in any given quarter. And there was nothing in this quarter that was individually material. And that prior year element does not influence our current or our future outlook on trend. So as we look to the full year and look at our medical costs, we expect a medical care ratio of 81.5% on the full year, plus or minus 50 basis points. And I'd probably tell you, we'd likely orient below that midpoint."

It's meaningful to them, the stability in premiums and co-pays and choice. And so we think we're really well positioned.

But it is this differentiated model that we're selling, the pharmacy care services model is resonating with very sophisticated buyers. I think what you're seeing, Scott, is the convergence of the traditional PBM model, which we're trying to rebuild, and combining it with the Optum clinical platform, and here, we're talking about OptumHealth and all the care management, data management and care delivery services.

Our third quarter was very much in line with our revised expectations that we set coming out of the second quarter and we've continued to maintain our full year view. To be more specific about it, so we recorded losses in the quarter of $200 million. And of that, $120 million was offset against the premium deficiency reserve. And the remaining $80 million flowed through the P&L this quarter. That $80 million of P&L impact is very comparable to the P&L impact we had in the third quarter last year, so very similar year-over-year. And from our view, we think that we're appropriately positioned for the remainder of the year. I think you also asked about the contribution of enrollment from special election versus open enrollment. I would tell you that we have a little less orientation towards special election this year as compared to last year. So to your point, we were a little -- a shade above 20% sitting through the third quarter of the year. And now we're more in the mid-teens as you look at our ACA-compliant membership base.

It'll service about 4.2 million service men and women. And we'll be going strong with that starting in January of this year. So Bill?"

With respect to our managed -- our revenue management offerings, we've used this word validation a fair number of times this morning. And I think in the case of the win that we had with Quest, it just validates once again that our boundaries of where we can offer these technology-enabled services is expanding. And I think Quest represents that as one of the largest, if not the largest, lab diagnostic companies in the world. And I think whether it's a health plan, whether it's an employer, whether it's a health system, they all do go through a rigorous evaluation process. And whether its Quest or Dignity, which we've talked about in the past, they're looking for modern technology, modern systems. They're looking for people that can bring in accuracy and the expertise that could reengineer workflows, that could leverage a worldwide workforce. And peppering in all of that is someone who can drive analytics and insights to really automate and improve the economic performance and the efficiency performance of their own operations. And anyone that evaluates us likes to see that; one, we're comprehensive in that approach; two, we pretty much line up culturally with them; and they really enjoy the fact that we drive a performance-based contract with them. So we're very much focused on aligning ourselves with them so that they are successful. And that formula is working. It's highly enabled by a very modern set of portfolios that, as Dave said, people buy every day. But more and more, we're seeing a trend in the marketplace where any of those constituencies are looking for more of an end-to-end comprehensive approach to handling some of these most pronounced challenges they have in their environments. And Optum becomes a pretty formidable and desirable option in those contexts. So with that said, maybe I'll turn it over to Amir."

Medicaid has been a very significant success of the ACA. And wherever that has played out, those environments, those markets have actually been more stable and better performing. And Medicare continues to be a core program of the country. And that funding for both Medicare and Medicaid is something that we have been advocating, the consistency and stability of it, kind of those themes are what we have stayed with. And I think commenting beyond that, particularly as the new administrations take hold and so forth, our posture is to be very constructive about making the marketplace work most effectively and serving the most number of individuals and making that system simpler and more usable for everybody.

And I think that's kind of really just sums it up. I won't go further than that. And again, we just have to prove that every quarter in terms of our own performance, our execution, the consistency of our growth and the consistency of our financial performance as we continue to grow and expand the business. And they are still a lot of opportunity. We are far from our full potential. And generally, when we conclude these sessions with you, we have an internal meeting talking about how much better we should be doing and could be doing if we performed to full potential. So we are going to continue on that path and pleased to perform consistently this quarter, expect to do it into the finish of the year, have a positive attitude on '17 and we're just going to keep working on that level. So that's, I think, a good way to close out the call. 
So we thank you for the conversation today. I think we've delivered a strong third quarter. We recorded solid growth in virtually every business across both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We are going to leverage this forward momentum and expect to close '16 with real energy, and drive strong and sustained performance into 2017. We'll continue to elevate the quality of our service.
