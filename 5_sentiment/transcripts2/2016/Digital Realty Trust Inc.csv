I'd like to begin on Page 2 of our presentation by reminding you that delivering superior risk-adjusted returns is our guiding principle. That applies to the investment decisions under our control and it also holds for the investment opportunity we expect to provide shareholders. 
In terms of our capital allocation decisions. That means mitigating risk on development by requiring significant levels of preleasing and building only in the markets where we have very high visibility on demand. It means emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We are highly focused on the accretive deployment of capital and we decline deals that do not provide us a sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We emphasize growth in our bottom line on a per-share basis. 
In terms of the investment profile that we offer to shareholders. It means delivering consistent uninterrupted growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends per share throughout the business cycle, firmly supported by the underlying value of owned real estate. 
Let's turn now to our platform on Page 3. We have made a very conscious decision not to directly pursue the enterprise vertical with few exceptions such as our traditional bread-and-butter customers like financial services companies. We aim to enable our partners to service enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide. In early December, we announced a colocation resale alliance with AT&T as well as a direct link colocation partnership with IBM SoftLayer. I'm pleased to report that our partners and alliances program continues to gain momentum and that these partnerships have already begun to bear fruit, contributing meaningfully to our fourth quarter signing total. 
Through these strategic initiatives, we have on boarded some new target customers such as a large and growing Asian multinational communications networking company. These wins certainly speak to our approach of supporting partners as they grow their business while simultaneously leveraging a broader, collective sales engine. This pipeline is also growing significantly, including international opportunities and several large expansions for deals signed in 2015 as well as numerous enterprise logos not pursued by Digital Realty's direct sales force, highlighting the value proposition of this partnership model. 
Turning now to capital recycling on Page 4. We closed on the sale of a vacant industrial building in Franklin Township, New Jersey during the fourth quarter. This property have previously been held for redevelopment. But market conditions were unlikely to justify construction anytime soon. And we determined to sell the property to an owner user and move on. Subsequent to year-end, we sold the former [indiscernible] Facility in Fremont, California, to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $188 per square foot at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. This former R&D manufacturing campus was likewise vacant until we were able to successfully re-lease it last year, significantly enhancing the execution we were able to achieve on the sale of this non-core asset. 
We are now also under contract on the national 4 property data center portfolio that we mentioned on our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. There are no financing contingencies and we expect to close during the first half of the year. We've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of these non-core assets. And this portfolio sale will substantially conclude our capital recycling program. We do, however, continue to believe that calling the asset base represents prudent real estate portfolio management. And you can recently expect us to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly on data center properties or one-off assets that no longer fit our connected campus strategy. 
We've begun to shift from a harvesting mode to selectively investing to secure our supply chain and to carefully position the company for future growth. As previously announced, during the fourth quarter, we acquired a land partial in Ashburn less than a mile away from our existing campus. This is one of the few remaining greenfield sites suitable for data center development in Loudon County. It will support the development of approximately 2 million square feet in the buildout of roughly 150 megawatts and will facilitate our customers growth for the next several years upon completion of our existing Ashburn campus. 
We also established a foothold in Germany, a long time target market, with the acquisition of the 6-acre parcel in Frankfurt during the fourth quarter for $6 million. This parcel will support the development of a 3-building campus totaling approximately 340,000 square feet and roughly 27 megawatts of critical load. We have begun the local entitlement process and expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first suite in the second half of next year subject to market demand. 
Moving onto market fundamentals on Page 5. Most markets continue to gradually tighten. The data center demand backdrop remains incredibly healthy, driven largely by our targeted verticals, namely social, mobile, big data, cloud and content, along with financial and IT services. We've seen a significant uptick in the size of the average scale requirement, particularly from the hyper scale cloud service providers. The caveat here is that these requirements can be quite lumpy and timing can be hard to predict. The lumpiness of the large footprint business is complemented perfectly by the consistent cadence of the colocation and interconnection contribution from our Telx line of business. 
Andy will provide an update on performance against our underwriting targets, but suffice it to say, the integration is proceeding smoothly. We are pleased by the contribution Telx is already making to our quarterly bookings and we expect it will accelerate the overall growth rate of our organization. 
The Telx acquisition has introduced us to over 1,000 new logos and the combined organization is developing strong relationships with these new accounts. Over the past 2 years, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, highlighting the value of these new customer relationships and further underscoring the complementary nature of the Telx acquisition. 
And now let's turn to the macro environment on Page 6. Global economic growth has decelerated over the last 90 days, while volatility and uncertainty have increased. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation or even the price of oil. Although, the drop over the last 18 months is striking. We have the good fortune to be levered to secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing faster than GDP. 
It's worth pausing here to reflect on our performance during the last downturn, which you can see represented in some of the visuals on Page 7. By way of reminder, we have generated positive year-over-year growth in dividends and core FFO per share each and every year since our IPO in 2004 and the great financial crisis was no exception. 
Our total shareholder return in 2008 and 2009 also compared quite favorably to the REIT index as well as the broader market. During that capital-constrained environment, it was corporate outsourcing of data center requirements along with the prudently managed balance sheet that was responsible for our outperformance. In the current environment, cloud adoption is the next generation of corporate outsourcing REIT large. The cloud is gaining traction because it enables corporate enterprise end users to achieve efficiencies and contain costs. During a downturn, this becomes even more appealing. In addition, our target cloud service providers are generally mature, well-capitalized tech companies and the cloud platforms are among their fastest-growing business segments. Consequently, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue to deliver steady per share growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."
11041860,321213172,941413,"Digital Realty Trust Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx here on page 9. As you know, we closed the transaction in early October. I'm pleased to report that we reached our commitment for $15 million of expense synergies during the fourth quarter and we expect",1934,"Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx here on page 9. As you know, we closed the transaction in early October. I'm pleased to report that we reached our commitment for $15 million of expense synergies during the fourth quarter and we expect to realize the full run rate benefit of these savings in 2016. We also reached retention agreements with key personnel and we are well on our way to integrating the 2 platforms. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, Telx generated $89 million of revenue, an 11% increase compared to the prior year. Revenues are split roughly 50-50 between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to [ph] expense synergies, Telx generated $33 million of cash EBITDA during the fourth quarter. 
Telx performed at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts. That momentum has carried on into 2016 and we remain on track to meet our underwriting targets. Bill has already alluded to more than 1,000 new customers with whom we are able to establish a relationship as a result of the Telx transaction. Separately, Telx brought an additional 27 new logos into the fold during the fourth quarter as well, including new subsea cable systems, mobile operators and content suppliers. The total number of cross connects for the combined organization is now more than 60,000 and we believe that connectivity represents a significant opportunity for cross-fertilization. 
We told you on our last earnings call that the next order of business for Telx will be to transfer our existing colocation business at 365 Main along returning over pockets of available inventory within our Internet gateways. I'm pleased to report that the transfer of 365 Main was completed earlier this month and the buildout and transfer of approximately 10,000 square feet at 1118 Ave. should be online by the end of the third quarter. In addition, our investment committee recently approved allocation of capital to build out a dedicated colocation suite at Building J on our Ashburn Campus. We expect to begin selling into that market during the second quarter and to [indiscernible] flag in Ashburn during the second half of 2016. 
While revenue synergies will mostly be realized beyond 2016, we have begun to see some early successes through the collaboration of our scale and colocation sales force, including a recent signing by a top SMACC customer in a new location within the portfolio for that customer. 
In summary, while the integration mission is not yet fully accomplished, we are pleased with the promise and performance to date. 
Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 10. We signed leases totaling $36 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $7 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the fourth quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for more than 75% of our lease signings during the quarter. Notable highlights include a multi-megawatt lease with a hyper scale cloud service provider at our Franklin Park Campus in Chicago. The weighted average line between signings and commencements was 4.5 months. And as shown on Page 11, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence in the first half of this year. 
Turning to Page 12. The average cash releasing spread during the fourth quarter was a positive 15%, driven by robust mark-to-market on PBB renewals offset by a slight cash roll down on a much smaller sample size of turnkey renewals. For the full year of 2016, we expect releasing spreads to be flat on a cash basis and up in the high single digits on a GAAP basis. We do still have several remaining above market scale leases notably in Northern New Jersey and Phoenix. And from time to time, individual leases can be large enough to swing the mark-to-market into [indiscernible] in any given quarter. On balance however, we believe we're reaching an inflection point and we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by market rent growth and a steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. 
Turning to our financial results on Page 13. We reported 4Q '15 core FFO per share of $1.38, above the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance was driven by a combination of several items, including: A few cents for Telx operational outperformance during the fourth quarter and the Center [indiscernible] for early achievement on our expense synergy plan; roughly [indiscernible] for lower Asia-Pacific operating expenses; and lastly, our overall G&A did come in a little lighter than we had expected. 
FX represented roughly 150 to 200 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As shown on Page 14, and we expect this to persist and represent a drag of similar magnitude in 2016. It is worth reminding everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
We are well hedged with 89% of our net assets denominated in U.S. dollars. You may have noticed from the press release that our guidance assumes $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion of long-term debt issuance. This may include a potential $500 million Eurobond which will further enhance our natural balance sheet hedge and increase our U.S. dollar net assets to 95%. Furthermore, we generally utilized excess cash flows to repay non-U.S. dollar debt or redeploy into local investment rather than repatriating back to the U.S. While our global portfolio exposes us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of cloud service providers and other strategic customers around the world which represents a key competitive advantage. 
We've attempted to frame our exposure to swings in currencies, interest rates and commodities here on Page 15. The overarching theme is that we benefit from our scale as well as the diversification of our customer base and geographic footprint. 
I'd like to take a moment to highlight the long-term trend in straight-line rent shown here on Page 16. A portion of decline in the fourth quarter was due to the elimination of the straight-line rental revenue that Digital previously recognized under our long-term lease agreements with Telx. The longer-term trend however also reflects the improved underwriting discipline we've instilled over the past 2 years as well as the consistently improving data center fundamental landscape. 
Our 2016 guidance calls for $10 million to $20 million of net noncash rent adjustments including straight line rental revenue, straight line rent expense and FAS 141 adjustments. Straight-line rental revenue and FAS 141 adjustments are fairly ordinary course for our REIT investors. These items represent noncash revenue that is recognized on our books and is deducted from core FFO to arrive at AFFO. We expect these 2 line items together to total $35 million to $40 million in 2016. This would be down considerably from $87 million in 2014 and $60 million in 2015 but does not get all the way down to our $10 million to $20 million guidance. The offset is $20 million to $25 million of straight-line rent expense that Telx recognizes on long-term leases with third-party landlords. In contrast to straight-line rental revenue, this is a noncash expense that runs through the P&L and is added back rather than deducted from our core FFO to arrive at AFFO. 
When we first announced the Telx transaction, we stated it would be 1% accretive to FFO per share in 2016 but 3% accretive to AFFO per share. These straight-line rent adjustments are the primary reasons why Telx is more accretive to AFFO than FFO and also are a meaningful contributor to our forecast for double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2016. 
In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, [indiscernible] capital occupancy [indiscernible] sequentially -- 16 bps sequentially primarily due to a PBB move out in Phoenix. Same capital cash NOI was up 3.4% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, same capital cash NOI would have been up 4.9%. As you may have seen from the press release, we guided to 0% to 3% same capital cash NOI growth in 2016 which is net of the foreign currency headwinds. 
The 2016 forecast comes with a major caveat however. Telx greatly [indiscernible] the composition of our same-store pool since they were previously a customer in 11 of our locations. These locations are mostly Internet Gateways and represent a big chunk of our stabilized portfolio. So carving out the amount of same-store pool will result in a much smaller sample size. 
At the end of the day, we decided to continue to report same capital results for 2016 as if our leases with Telx were still in place. Beginning in 2017, Telx will be included in the same-store pool and we will revert to a less theoretical presentation. In the meantime, however, same [indiscernible] results should be taken with a grain of salt. 
Telx have a similar impact on our reported occupancy statistics. We previously [indiscernible] space leased to Telx as 100% occupied. Now however this space is shown on a look through basis reflecting Telx's utilization of the space. A look through treatment results in a lower reported occupancy across the 12 properties where Telx has a presence due to Telx lower utilization and embedded lease up potential within that space. 
Irrespective of the complexities of portfolio reporting, we remain keenly focused on organic growth. We will be aggressively attempting to renew expiring leases at higher rates, keeping our operating expenses in check and being mindful of our cost structure. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 17. In January, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than 2 years and upsize the term loan facilities by $550 million. We also established access to a new tenant within the bank loan market with a $300 million seven-year term loan. The facilities were well over subscribed and we like to thank our entire bank group for their support. 
I mentioned earlier in the midpoint of our guidance -- excuse me, I mentioned earlier that the midpoint of our guidance assumes $1.5 billion of long-term debt issuance. I would like to clarify that this total includes the incremental $550 million of 5 and 7 year term loans which were put to bed with his refinancing. 
As shown on Page 17, the refinancing clearly -- effectively clears up the left hand side of the maturity schedule. We have clear runway with very modest debt maturities until 2020 with well- [indiscernible] debt that maturities thereafter. In addition, floating rate debt now represents less than 15% total debt outstanding and we currently have $1.5 billion of undrawn capacity. We also generate approximately $150 million of cash flow after dividends and we expect to realize up to $200 million proceeds from asset sales, consequently, we believe we had ample liquidity to fund our capital requirements. Debt to EBITDA stood at 5.2x as of year-end and we expect to remain comfortably below our 5.5x target throughout 2016 with the balance sheet positioned for growth. 
This concludes our prepared remarks and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

I think Bill nailed it in his opening remarks and good focus on the hyper scale activity because those requirements really sort of form the foundation of what the demand is, was in Q4 and is and will be as we move forward in 2016. We see that demand as well as our regular demand accelerating. But we do have to keep an eye on the hyper scale requirement and the lumping nature of this requirements. We saw $36 million of revenue as a healthy pace for space and power in Q4. When you throw in connectivity, that gets up to about $43 million in the quarter. And I think all of that is still a reflection of our desire to remain disciplined, not just in challenging times, but to remain disciplined in good times as well. It's important to remember that we're seeing successfully signed deals at attractive cash returns. And as Andy mentioned in his remarks, we were happy to land one of those very large cloud deals at a 15 year term in Q4 and we expect to see that continue in the first quarter."

And then going back to your first question and I'll let others on the team jump in. I mean, holistically, the best ways obviously to mitigate this is through the diversification of your customers, your locations, your leases, maturities. We're always in constant dialogue with our customers to make sure we understand the business and where its going and trying to help them with their space needs. I don't think there's anything on the horizon right now dealing with the Rackspace and AT&T or CenturyLink. We're actually looking to contract from our specific footprints.

It's actually probably one of the best cases you can think about where these FinTech companies have to connect to other providers, had to connect to other institutions and had to connect to consumers so FinTech within FinServ is one of the exciting places that we found. The Internet enterprise another one of the verticals that we really liked to have a focus on, not just because of our historical performance in those particular verticals but because of the necessary growth that's coming out of some of the activities. So some of the both the M&A activity that we see happening here as well as some of the divestitures it creates for us an incredible opportunity when one of our great customers decides to split into 2 large companies, sometimes, we get the full the opportunity. And I wasn't supposed to talk about anything inside SMACC but we think the mobile vertical for us is one that's incredibly ready for us to continue to exploit and with the expertise of Telx now aboard, we are well situated to be able to do that."

The decrease in the total portfolio of occupancy is by 140 bps or so as of this quarter. That was due to a look through all in Telx. Sure 11 or 12 locations were 100% occupied at 3Q '15. And then we bought their business and they were not 100% utilized within their 4 walls. So that was a step down there. I just want to make sure we didn't miss communicate on that front. Going back to cost of capital. The base plan which we put out in our guidance, roughly 7 weeks ago has a source and uses plan that was funded through retained cash flow, a little bit from dispro proceeds and campus flow of 5.5x debt to EBITDA while at the same time, funding a pretty large investment in our development pipeline. That's the base case plan that doesn't require equity. I think you could expect us to follow our past track record if an opportunistic investment came about, whether it's some large-scale increase in our development from landing hyper scale deal or some M&A or other acquisition, we look to go to capital markets to keep our leverage stats in line and equity as time and time again been a part of that."

I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our fourth quarter highlights, as outlined here on Page 18 of the deck. 
First and foremost, we closed on the acquisition of Telx in what was truly a transformational transaction for our company. Telx checked all the boxes for us. It was highly strategic and extremely complementary to our existing platform. It was accretive to FFO and AFFO per share in year 1 and it was prudently financed. We reported fourth quarter results that we're well ahead of the high-end of our guidance range. The quality of our earnings is improving with the burn off of straight-line rent and the contribution from Telx. Growth in cash flow is accelerating and we are poised to deliver double-digit growth in AFFO per share. We also took deliberate steps to secure our supply chain with the acquisition of a highly desirable land parcel at Ashburn. We also entered the Frankfurt market, a long-standing target. Last but not least, we also raised the dividend for the 11th consecutive year. We've grown the dividend each and every year since our IPO in 2004 and we remain committed to delivering superior risk adjusted total returns to our shareholders. 
Finally, I'd like to thank -- say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. That concludes our fourth quarter call. Thank you for joining us and we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida over the next several weeks."

I'd like to begin on Page 2 of our presentation by reminding you that delivering superior risk-adjusted returns is our guiding principle. That applies to the investment decisions under our control and it also holds for the investment opportunity we expect to provide shareholders. 
In terms of our capital allocation decisions, that means mitigating risk on development by requiring significant levels of pre-leasing and building only in the markets where we have high visibility on demand. It means emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We are highly focused on the accretive deployment of capital and we decline deals that do not provide us sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We emphasize growth in our bottom line on a per-share basis. 
In terms of the investment profile that we offer to shareholders, it means delivering consistent uninterrupted growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends per share throughout the business cycle, firmly supported by the underlying value of owned real estate. 
Let's turn now to our platform on Page 3. We have made a very conscious decision not to directly pursue the enterprise vertical with few exceptions, such as our traditional bread-and-butter customers like financial services companies. We aim to enable our partners to service enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide. In early December, we announced a colocation resale alliance with AT&T as well as a direct link colocation partnership with IBM SoftLayer. I'm pleased to report that our partners and alliances program continues to gain momentum and that these partnerships have already begun to bear fruit, contributing meaningfully to our fourth quarter signing total. 
Through these strategic initiatives, we have on-boarded some new target customers such as a large and growing Asian multinational communications networking company. These wins certainly speak to our approach of supporting partners as they grow their business while simultaneously leveraging a broader, collective sales engine. This pipeline is also growing significantly, including international opportunities and several large expansions for deals signed in 2015 as well as numerous enterprise logos not pursued by Digital Realty's direct sales force, highlighting the value proposition of this partnership model. 
Turning now to capital recycling on Page 4. We closed on the sale of a vacant industrial building in Franklin Township, New Jersey during the fourth quarter. This property have previously been held for redevelopment, but market conditions were unlikely to justify construction any time soon. And we determined to sell the property to an owner user and move on. Subsequent to year-end, we sold the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $188 per square foot at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. This former R&D manufacturing campus was likewise vacant until we were able to successfully re-lease it last year, significantly enhancing the execution we were able to achieve on the sale of this non-core asset. 
We are now also under contract on the national 4-property data center portfolio that we mentioned on our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. There are no financing contingencies, and we expect to close during the first half of the year. We've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of these non-core assets, and this portfolio sale will substantially conclude our capital recycling program. We do, however, continue to believe that calling the asset base represents prudent real estate portfolio management. And you can recently expect us to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly non-data center properties or one-off assets that no longer fit our Connected Campus strategy. 
We've begun to shift from a harvesting mode to selectively investing to secure our supply chain and to carefully position the company for future growth. As previously announced, during the fourth quarter, we acquired a land parcel in Ashburn less than a mile away from our existing campus. This is one of the few remaining greenfield sites suitable for data center development in Loudon County. It will support the development of approximately 2 million square feet and the buildout of roughly 150 megawatts and will facilitate our customers' growth for the next several years upon completion of our existing Ashburn campus. 
We also established a foothold in Germany, a long-time target market, with the acquisition of a 6-acre parcel in Frankfurt during the fourth quarter for $6 million. This parcel will support the development of a 3-building campus, totaling approximately 340,000 square feet and roughly 27 megawatts of critical load. We have begun the local entitlement process and expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first suite in the second half of next year subject to market demand. 
Moving on to market fundamentals on Page 5. Most markets continue to gradually tighten. The data center demand backdrop remains incredibly healthy, driven largely by our target verticals, namely social, mobile, big data, cloud and content, along with financial and IT services. We've seen a significant uptick in the size of the average scale requirement, particularly from the hyperscale cloud service providers. The caveat here is that these requirements can be quite lumpy and timing can be hard to predict. The lumpiness of the large footprint business is complemented perfectly by the consistent cadence of the colocation and interconnection contribution from our Telx line of business. Andy will provide an update on performance against our underwriting targets, but suffice it to say, the integration is proceeding smoothly. We are pleased by the contribution Telx is already making to our quarterly bookings, and we expect it will accelerate the overall growth rate of our organization. 
The Telx acquisition has introduced us to over 1,000 new logos, and the combined organization is developing strong relationships with these new accounts. Over the past 2 years, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, highlighting the value of these new customer relationships and further underscoring the complementary nature of the Telx acquisition. 
And now let's turn to the macro environment on Page 6. Global economic growth has decelerated over the last 90 days, while volatility and uncertainty have increased. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation or even the price of oil, although the drop over the last 18 months is striking. We have the good fortune to be levered to secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing faster than GDP. 
It's worth pausing here to reflect on our performance during the last downturn, which you can see represented in some of the visuals on Page 7. By way of reminder, we have generated positive year-over-year growth in dividends and core FFO per share each and every year since our IPO in 2004, and the great financial crisis was no exception. 
Our total shareholder return in 2008 and 2009 also compared quite favorably to the REIT index as well as the broader market. During that capital-constrained environment, it was corporate outsourcing of data center requirements along with a prudently managed balance sheet that was responsible for our outperformance. In the current environment, cloud adoption is the next generation of corporate outsourcing the REIT large. The cloud is gaining traction because it enables corporate enterprise end users to achieve efficiencies and contain costs. During a downturn, this becomes even more appealing. In addition, our target cloud service providers are generally mature, well-capitalized tech companies, and the cloud platforms are among their fastest-growing business segments. Consequently, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver steady per-share growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

Let's begin with an update on Telx here on page 9. As you know, we closed the transaction in early October. I'm pleased to report that we reached our commitment for $15 million of expense synergies during the fourth quarter, and we expect to realize the full run rate benefit of these savings in 2016. We also reached retention agreements with key personnel, and we are well on our way to integrating the 2 platforms. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, Telx generated $89 million of revenue, an 11% increase compared to the prior year period. Revenues are split roughly 50-50 between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $33 million of cash EBITDA during the fourth quarter. 
Telx performed at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts. That momentum has carried on into 2016, and we remain on track to meet our underwriting targets. Bill has already alluded to more than 1,000 new customers with whom we are able to establish a relationship as a result of the Telx transaction. Separately, Telx brought an additional 27 new logos into the fold during the fourth quarter as well, including new subsea cable systems, mobile operators and content suppliers. The total number of cross connects for the combined organization is now more than 60,000, and we believe that connectivity represents a significant opportunity for cross-fertilization. 
We told you on our last earnings call that the next order of business for Telx will be to transfer our existing colocation business at 365 Main along with turning over pockets of available inventory within our Internet gateways. I'm pleased to report that the transfer of 365 Main was completed earlier this month and the buildout and transfer of approximately 10,000 square feet at 111 8th Ave. should be online by the end of the third quarter. In addition, our investment committee recently approved allocation of capital to build out a dedicated colocation suite at Building J on our Ashburn campus. We begin to -- we expect to begin selling into that market during the second quarter and to plant the Telx flag in Ashburn during the second half of 2016. While revenue synergies will mostly be realized beyond 2016, we have begun to see some early successes through the collaboration of our scale and colocation sales force, including the recent signing by a top SMACC customer in a new location within the portfolio for that customer. 
In summary, while the integration mission is not yet fully accomplished, we are pleased with the progress and performance to date. 
Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 10. We signed leases totaling $36 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $7 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the fourth quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for more than 75% of our lease signings during the quarter. Notable highlights include a multi-megawatt lease with a hyperscale cloud service provider at our Franklin Park campus in Chicago. The weighted average lag between signings and commencements was 4.5 months, and as shown on Page 11, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence in the first half of this year. 
Turning to Page 12. The average cash re-leasing spread during the fourth quarter was a positive 15%, driven by robust mark-to-market on PBB renewals offset by a slight cash roll-down on a much smaller sample size of turnkey renewals. For the full year of 2016, we expect re-leasing spreads to be flat on a cash basis and up in the high single digits on a GAAP basis. We do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Northern New Jersey and Phoenix. And from time to time, individual leases can be large enough to swing the mark-to-market into the red in any given quarter. On balance, however, we believe we are reaching inflection point and we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by market rent growth and a steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. 
Turning to our financial results on Page 13. We reported 4Q '15 core FFO per share of $1.38, above the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance was driven by a combination of several items, including: a few cents for Telx operational outperformance during the fourth quarter and $0.01 or so for early achievement on our expense synergy plan, roughly $0.01 for lower Asia-Pacific operating expenses, and lastly, our overall G&A did come in a little lighter than we had expected. 
FX represented roughly 150 to 200 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As shown on Page 14, and we expect this to persist and represent a drag of similar magnitude in 2016. It is worth reminding everyone that we manage currency risks by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.  We are well hedged with 89% of our net assets denominated in U.S. dollars. 
You may have noticed from the press release that our guidance assumes $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion of long-term debt issuance. This may include a potential $500 million eurobond, which would further enhance our natural balance sheet hedge and increase our U.S. dollar net assets to 95%. Furthermore, we generally utilize excess cash flows to repay non-U.S. dollar debt or redeploy into local investment rather than repatriating back to the U.S. While our global portfolio exposes us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of cloud service providers and other strategic customers around the world, which represents a key competitive advantage. 
We've attempted to frame our exposure to swings in currencies, interest rates and commodities here on Page 15. The overarching theme is that we benefit from our scale as well as the diversification of our customer base and geographic footprint. 
I'd like to take a moment to highlight the long-term trend in straight-line rent shown here on Page 16. A portion of decline in the fourth quarter was due to the elimination of the straight-line rental revenue that Digital previously recognized under our long-term lease agreements with Telx. The longer-term trend, however, also reflects the improved underwriting discipline we've instilled over the past 2 years as well as the consistently improving data center fundamental landscape. 
Our 2016 guidance calls for $10 million to $20 million of net noncash rent adjustments, including straight-line rental revenue, straight-line rent expense and FAS 141 adjustments. Straight-line rental revenue and FAS 141 adjustments are fairly ordinary course for our REIT investors. These items represent noncash revenue that is recognized on our books and is deducted from core FFO to arrive at AFFO. We expect these 2 line items together to total $35 million to $40 million in 2016. This would be down considerably from $87 million in 2014 and $60 million in 2015 but does not get you all the way down to our $10 million to $20 million guidance. The offset is $20 million to $25 million of straight-line rent expense that Telx recognizes on long-term leases with third-party landlords. In contrast to straight-line rental revenue, this is a noncash expense that runs through the P&L and is added back rather than deducted from our core FFO to arrive at AFFO. 
When we first announced the Telx transaction, we stated it would be 1% accretive to FFO per share in 2016 but 3% accretive to AFFO per share. These straight-line rent adjustments are the primary reason why Telx is more accretive to AFFO than FFO and also a -- are a meaningful contributor to our forecast for double-digit AFFO per-share growth in 2016. 
In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, same capital occupancy slipped sequentially -- 60 bps sequentially, primarily due to a PBB move-out in Phoenix. Same capital cash NOI was up 3.4% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, same capital cash NOI would have been up 4.9%. As you may have seen from the press release, we guided to 0% to 3% same capital cash NOI growth in 2016, which is net of the foreign currency headwinds. The 2016 forecast comes with a major caveat, however. Telx greatly complicates the composition of our same-store pool since they previously a customer in 11 of our locations. These locations are mostly Internet Gateways and represent a big chunk of our stabilized portfolio, so carving them out of the same-store pool will result in a much smaller sample size. 
At the end of the day, we decided to continue to report same capital results for 2016 as if our leases with Telx were still in place. Beginning in 2017, Telx will be included in the same-store pool and we will revert to a less theoretical presentation. In the meantime, however, same capital results should be taken with a grain of salt. 
Telx have a similar impact on our reported occupancy statistics. We previously reflected space leased to Telx as 100% occupied. Now however, this space is shown on a look-through basis, reflecting Telx's utilization of the space. A look-through treatment results in a lower reported occupancy across the 12 properties where Telx has a presence due to Telx lower utilization and embedded lease-up potential within those -- that space. 
Irrespective of the complexities of portfolio reporting, we remain keenly focused on organic growth. We will be aggressively attempting to renew expiring leases at higher rates, keeping our operating expenses in check and being mindful of our cost structure. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 17. In January, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than 2 years and upsize the term loan facilities by $550 million. We also established access to a new tenor within the bank loan market with a $300 million 7-year term loan. The facilities were well oversubscribed and we like to thank our entire bank group for their support. 
I mentioned earlier in the midpoint of our guidance -- excuse me, I mentioned earlier that the midpoint of our guidance assumes $1.5 billion of long-term debt issuance. I would like to clarify that this total includes the incremental $550 million, a 5- and 7-year term loans, which was put to bed with this refinancing. 
As shown on Page 17, the refinancing clearly -- effectively clears up the left-hand side of the maturity schedule. We have clear runway with very modest debt maturities until 2020 with well-laddered debt maturities thereafter. In addition, floating rate debt now represents less than 15% total debt outstanding, and we currently have $1.5 billion of undrawn capacity. We also generate approximately $150 million of cash flow after dividends and we expect to realize up to $200 million in proceeds from asset sales. Consequently, we believe we have ample liquidity to fund our capital requirements. Debt to EBITDA stood at 5.2x as of year-end, and we expect to remain comfortably below our 5.5x target throughout 2016 with the balance sheet positioned for growth. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

This is Matt. Yes, I think Bill nailed it in his opening remarks and good focus on the hyperscale activity because those requirements really sort of form the foundation of what the demand is, was in Q4 and is and will be as we move forward in 2016. We see that demand as well as our regular demand accelerating. But we do have to keep an eye on the hyperscale requirements and the lumpy nature of those requirements. We saw $36 million of revenue as a healthy pace for space and power in Q4. When you throw in connectivity, that gets up to about $43 million in the quarter. And I think all of that is still a reflection of our desire to remain disciplined, not just in challenging times, but to remain disciplined in good times as well. It's important to remember that we're seeing successfully signed deals at attractive cash returns. And as Andy mentioned in his remarks, we were happy to land one of those very large cloud deals at a 15-year term in Q4, and we expect to see that continue in the first quarter."

How comfortable are you right now with the exposure you have to these customers right now?

We're always in constant dialogue with our customers, making sure we understand their business and where it's going and trying to help them with their space needs. I don't think there's anything on the horizon right now, be it with the Rackspace and AT&T or CenturyLink, whether they're actually looking to contract from our specific footprints.

We certainly don't like to pick amongst the non-SMACC verticals because we're very big fans of the SMACC verticals. But in particular, financial services for us. And to go one click deeper, financial technology, we think, is one of the places that holds a lot of promise, not just for large-scale deployments on our scale team, but colocation requirements on our colocation team and then multiple points of connectivity. It's actually probably one of the best cases you can think about where these fintech companies have to connect to other providers, have to connect to other institutions and have to connect to consumers. So fintech within finserv is one of the exciting places that we found. The Internet enterprise is another one of the verticals that we really like to have a focus on, not just because of our historical performance in those particular verticals, but because of the necessary growth that's coming out of some of the activities. So some of the both -- the M&A activity that we see happening here as well as some of the divestitures creates for us an incredible opportunity when one of our great customers decides to split into 2 large companies, sometimes we get double the opportunity. And I know I wasn't supposed to talk about anything inside SMACC, but we think the mobile vertical for us is one that's incredibly ready for us to continue to exploit.

So -- and just let me go back to your first question because I think I might miss a piece of it. Just to make sure we're all in the same page, the decrease in the total portfolio is occupancy by 140 bps or so as of this quarter. That was due to a look-through on Telx. So 11 or 12 locations were 100% occupied at 3Q '15. And we then -- we bought their business and they were not 100% utilized within their 4 walls. So that was a step down there. So I just want to make sure we didn't miscommunicate on that front. Going back to cost of capital, the base plan which we put out in our guidance roughly 7 weeks ago has a source and uses plan that was funded through retained cash flow, a little bit from Digital proceeds and campus flow of 5.5x debt to EBITDA while at the same time funding a pretty large investment in our development pipeline. That's the base case plan. It doesn't require equity. I think you could expect us to follow our past track record if an opportunistic investment came about, whether it's some large-scale increase in our development from landing a hyperscale deal or some M&A or other acquisition.

And we've established a joint go-to-market plan and we've moved inventory from various digital locations to Telx, both 365 Main. We're going to do that at 108 -- 111 8th. And we've approved in our investment community at Telx side of Ashburn campus, so all of that's great. We're laying the revenue synergies groundwork here for '16 and expect to realize that in '17 and beyond. I mean, I think what should be clear to you is this is really a continuum. There's no clear point in time when you can say, ""Hey, green light. We're ready. "" We make progress every day. We actually -- as a leadership team, we review that progress once a week on Monday and there's work to be done. But at the same time, we're open to look at other investment opportunities, other M&A opportunities. And the criteria is what we've said from the very beginning, getting back to Ross' question, we wanted to be strategic and we want to be accretive. And of course, we'll finance it in a prudent manner, keeping it leverage neutral."

I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our fourth quarter highlights as outlined here on Page 18 of the deck. 
First and foremost, we closed on the acquisition of Telx in what was truly a transformational transaction for our company. Telx checked all the boxes for us. It was highly strategic and extremely complementary to our existing platform. It was accretive to FFO and AFFO per share in year 1, and it was prudently financed. We reported fourth quarter results that were well ahead of the high end of our guidance range. The quality of our earnings is improving with the burn off of straight-line rent and the contribution from Telx. Growth in cash flow is accelerating, and we are poised to deliver double-digit growth in AFFO per share. We also took deliberate steps to secure our supply chain with the acquisition of a highly desirable land parcel in Ashburn. We also entered the Frankfurt market, a long-standing target. Last, but not least, we also raised the dividend for the 11th consecutive year. We've grown the dividend each and every year since our IPO in 2004, and we remain committed to delivering superior risk-adjusted total returns to our shareholders. 
Finally, I'd like to thank -- say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. That concludes our fourth quarter call. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida over the next several weeks."

I'd like to begin on Page 2 of our presentation by reminding you that delivering superior risk-adjusted returns is our guiding principle. That applies to the investment decisions under our control and it also holds for the investment opportunity we expect to provide shareholders. 
In terms of our capital allocation decisions, that means mitigating risk on development by requiring significant levels of pre-leasing and building only in the markets where we have high visibility on demand. It means emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We are highly focused on the accretive deployment of capital and we decline deals that do not provide us sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We emphasize growth in our bottom line on a per-share basis. 
In terms of the investment profile that we offer to shareholders, it means delivering consistent uninterrupted growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends per share throughout the business cycle, firmly supported by the underlying value of owned real estate. 
Let's turn now to our platform on Page 3. We have made a very conscious decision not to directly pursue the enterprise vertical with few exceptions, such as our traditional bread-and-butter customers like financial services companies. We aim to enable our partners to service enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide. In early December, we announced a colocation resale alliance with AT&T as well as a direct link colocation partnership with IBM SoftLayer. I'm pleased to report that our partners and alliances program continues to gain momentum and that these partnerships have already begun to bear fruit, contributing meaningfully to our fourth quarter signing total. 
Through these strategic initiatives, we have on-boarded some new target customers such as a large and growing Asian multinational communications networking company. These wins certainly speak to our approach of supporting partners as they grow their business while simultaneously leveraging a broader, collective sales engine. This pipeline is also growing significantly, including international opportunities and several large expansions for deals signed in 2015 as well as numerous enterprise logos not pursued by Digital Realty's direct sales force, highlighting the value proposition of this partnership model. 
Turning now to capital recycling on Page 4. We closed on the sale of a vacant industrial building in Franklin Township, New Jersey during the fourth quarter. This property had previously been held for redevelopment, but market conditions were unlikely to justify construction any time soon. And we determined to sell the property to an owner user and move on. Subsequent to year-end, we sold the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $188 per square foot at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. This former R&D manufacturing campus was likewise vacant until we were able to successfully re-lease it last year, significantly enhancing the execution we were able to achieve on the sale of this non-core asset. 
We are now also under contract on the national 4-property data center portfolio that we mentioned on our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. There are no financing contingencies, and we expect to close during the first half of the year. We've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of these non-core assets, and this portfolio sale will substantially conclude our capital recycling program. We do, however, continue to believe that culling the asset base represents prudent real estate portfolio management. And you can reasonably expect us to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly non-data center properties or one-off assets that no longer fit our Connected Campus strategy. 
We've begun to shift from a harvesting mode to selectively investing to secure our supply chain and to carefully position the company for future growth. As previously announced, during the fourth quarter, we acquired a land parcel in Ashburn less than a mile away from our existing campus. This is one of the few remaining greenfield sites suitable for data center development in Loudon County. It will support the development of approximately 2 million square feet and the buildout of roughly 150 megawatts and will facilitate our customers' growth for the next several years upon completion of our existing Ashburn campus. 
We also established a foothold in Germany, a long-time target market, with the acquisition of a 6-acre parcel in Frankfurt during the fourth quarter for $6 million. This parcel will support the development of a 3-building campus, totaling approximately 340,000 square feet and roughly 27 megawatts of critical load. We have begun the local entitlement process and expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first suite in the second half of next year subject to market demand. 
Moving on to market fundamentals on Page 5. Most markets continue to gradually tighten. The data center demand backdrop remains incredibly healthy, driven largely by our target verticals, namely social, mobile, big data, cloud and content, along with financial and IT services. We've seen a significant uptick in the size of the average scale requirement, particularly from the hyperscale cloud service providers. The caveat here is that these requirements can be quite lumpy and timing can be hard to predict. The lumpiness of the large footprint business is complemented perfectly by the consistent cadence of the colocation and interconnection contribution from our Telx line of business. Andy will provide an update on performance against our underwriting targets, but suffice it to say, the integration is proceeding smoothly. We are pleased by the contribution Telx is already making to our quarterly bookings, and we expect it will accelerate the overall growth rate of our organization. 
The Telx acquisition has introduced us to over 1,000 new logos, and the combined organization is developing strong relationships with these new accounts. Over the past 2 years, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, highlighting the value of these new customer relationships and further underscoring the complementary nature of the Telx acquisition. 
And now let's turn to the macro environment on Page 6. Global economic growth has decelerated over the last 90 days, while volatility and uncertainty have increased. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation or even the price of oil, although the drop over the last 18 months is striking. We have the good fortune to be levered to secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing faster than GDP. 
It's worth pausing here to reflect on our performance during the last downturn, which you can see represented in some of the visuals on Page 7. By way of reminder, we have generated positive year-over-year growth in dividends and core FFO per share each and every year since our IPO in 2004, and the great financial crisis was no exception. 
Our total shareholder return in 2008 and 2009 also compared quite favorably to the REIT index as well as the broader market. During that capital-constrained environment, it was corporate outsourcing of data center requirements along with a prudently managed balance sheet that was responsible for our outperformance. In the current environment, cloud adoption is the next generation of corporate outsourcing writ large. The cloud is gaining traction because it enables corporate enterprise end users to achieve efficiencies and contain costs. During a downturn, this becomes even more appealing. In addition, our target cloud service providers are generally mature, well-capitalized tech companies, and the cloud platforms are among their fastest-growing business segments. Consequently, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver steady per-share growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

Let's begin with an update on Telx here on Page 9. As you know, we closed the transaction in early October. I'm pleased to report that we reached our commitment for $15 million of expense synergies during the fourth quarter, and we expect to realize the full run rate benefit of these savings in 2016. We also reached retention agreements with key personnel, and we are well on our way to integrating the 2 platforms. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, Telx generated $89 million of revenue, an 11% increase compared to the prior year period. Revenues are split roughly 50-50 between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $33 million of cash EBITDA during the fourth quarter. 
Telx performed at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts. That momentum has carried on into 2016, and we remain on track to meet our underwriting targets. Bill has already alluded to more than 1,000 new customers with whom we are able to establish a relationship as a result of the Telx transaction. Separately, Telx brought an additional 27 new logos into the fold during the fourth quarter as well, including new subsea cable systems, mobile operators and content suppliers. The total number of cross connects for the combined organization is now more than 60,000, and we believe that connectivity represents a significant opportunity for cross-fertilization. 
We told you on our last earnings call that the next order of business for Telx will be to transfer our existing colocation business at 365 Main along with turning over pockets of available inventory within our Internet gateways. I'm pleased to report that the transfer of 365 Main was completed earlier this month and the buildout and transfer of approximately 10,000 square feet at 111 8th Ave. should be online by the end of the third quarter. In addition, our investment committee recently approved allocation of capital to build out a dedicated colocation suite at Building J on our Ashburn campus. We begin to -- we expect to begin selling into that market during the second quarter and to plant the Telx flag in Ashburn during the second half of 2016. While revenue synergies will mostly be realized beyond 2016, we have begun to see some early successes through the collaboration of our scale and colocation sales force, including the recent signing by a top SMACC customer and a new location within the portfolio for that customer. 
In summary, while the integration mission is not yet fully accomplished, we are pleased with the progress and performance to date. 
Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 10. We signed leases totaling $36 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $7 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the fourth quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for more than 75% of our lease signings during the quarter. Notable highlights include a multi-megawatt lease with a hyperscale cloud service provider at our Franklin Park campus in Chicago. The weighted average lag between signings and commencements was 4.5 months, and as shown on Page 11, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence in the first half of this year. 
Turning to Page 12. The average cash re-leasing spread during the fourth quarter was a positive 15%, driven by robust mark-to-market on PBB renewals offset by a slight cash roll-down on a much smaller sample size of turnkey renewals. For the full year of 2016, we expect re-leasing spreads to be flat on a cash basis and up in the high single digits on a GAAP basis. We do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Northern New Jersey and Phoenix. And from time to time, individual leases can be large enough to swing the mark-to-market into the red in any given quarter. On balance, however, we believe we are reaching inflection point and we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by market rent growth and a steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. 
Turning to our financial results on Page 13. We reported 4Q '15 core FFO per share of $1.38, above the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance was driven by a combination of several items, including: a few cents for Telx operational outperformance during the fourth quarter and $0.01 or so for early achievement on our expense synergy plan, roughly $0.01 for lower Asia-Pacific operating expenses, and lastly, our overall G&A did come in a little lighter than we had expected. 
FX represented roughly 150 to 200 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As shown on Page 14, and we expect this to persist and represent a drag of similar magnitude in 2016. It is worth reminding everyone that we manage currency risks by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.  We are well hedged with 89% of our net assets denominated in U.S. dollars. 
You may have noticed from the press release that our guidance assumes $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion of long-term debt issuance. This may include a potential $500 million eurobond, which would further enhance our natural balance sheet hedge and increase our U.S. dollar net assets to 95%. Furthermore, we generally utilize excess cash flows to repay non-U.S. dollar debt or redeploy into local investment rather than repatriating back to the U.S. While our global portfolio exposes us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of cloud service providers and other strategic customers around the world, which represents a key competitive advantage. 
We've attempted to frame our exposure to swings in currencies, interest rates and commodities here on Page 15. The overarching theme is that we benefit from our scale as well as the diversification of our customer base and geographic footprint. 
I'd like to take a moment to highlight the long-term trend in straight-line rent shown here on Page 16. A portion of decline in the fourth quarter was due to the elimination of the straight-line rental revenue that Digital previously recognized under our long-term lease agreements with Telx. The longer-term trend, however, also reflects the improved underwriting discipline we've instilled over the past 2 years as well as the consistently improving data center fundamental landscape. 
Our 2016 guidance calls for $10 million to $20 million of net noncash rent adjustments, including straight-line rental revenue, straight-line rent expense and FAS 141 adjustments. Straight-line rental revenue and FAS 141 adjustments are fairly ordinary course for our REIT investors. These items represent noncash revenue that is recognized on our books and is deducted from core FFO to arrive at AFFO. We expect these 2 line items together to total $35 million to $40 million in 2016. This would be down considerably from $87 million in 2014 and $60 million in 2015, but does not get you all the way down to our $10 million to $20 million guidance. The offset is $20 million to $25 million of straight-line rent expense that Telx recognizes on long-term leases with third-party landlords. In contrast to straight-line rental revenue, this is a noncash expense that runs through the P&L and is added back rather than deducted from our core FFO to arrive at AFFO. 
When we first announced the Telx transaction, we stated it would be 1% accretive to FFO per share in 2016 but 3% accretive to AFFO per share. These straight-line rent adjustments are the primary reason why Telx is more accretive to AFFO than FFO and also a -- are a meaningful contributor to our forecast for double-digit AFFO per-share growth in 2016. 
In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, same capital occupancy slipped sequentially -- 60 bps sequentially, primarily due to a PBB move-out in Phoenix. Same capital cash NOI was up 3.4% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, same capital cash NOI would have been up 4.9%. As you may have seen from the press release, we guided to 0% to 3% same capital cash NOI growth in 2016, which is net of the foreign currency headwinds. The 2016 forecast comes with a major caveat, however. Telx greatly complicates the composition of our same-store pool since they were previously a customer in 11 of our locations. These locations are mostly Internet Gateways and represent a big chunk of our stabilized portfolio, so carving them out of the same-store pool will result in a much smaller sample size. 
At the end of the day, we decided to continue to report same capital results for 2016 as if our leases with Telx were still in place. Beginning in 2017, Telx will be included in the same-store pool and we will revert to a less theoretical presentation. In the meantime, however, same capital results should be taken with a grain of salt. 
Telx have a similar impact on our reported occupancy statistics. We previously reflected space leased to Telx as 100% occupied. Now however, this space is shown on a look-through basis, reflecting Telx's utilization of the space. A look-through treatment results in a lower reported occupancy across the 12 properties where Telx has a presence due to Telx lower utilization and embedded lease-up potential within those -- that space. 
Irrespective of the complexities of portfolio reporting, we remain keenly focused on organic growth. We will be aggressively attempting to renew expiring leases at higher rates, keeping our operating expenses in check and being mindful of our cost structure. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 17. In January, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than 2 years and upsize the term loan facilities by $550 million. We also established access to a new tenor within the bank loan market with a $300 million 7-year term loan. The facilities were well oversubscribed and we like to thank our entire bank group for their support. 
I mentioned earlier in the midpoint of our guidance -- excuse me, I mentioned earlier that the midpoint of our guidance assumes $1.5 billion of long-term debt issuance. I would like to clarify that this total includes the incremental $550 million of 5- and 7-year term loans, which was put to bed with this refinancing. 
As shown on Page 17, the refinancing clearly -- effectively clears up the left-hand side of the maturity schedule. We have clear runway with very modest debt maturities until 2020 with well-laddered debt maturities thereafter. In addition, floating rate debt now represents less than 15% total debt outstanding, and we currently have $1.5 billion of undrawn capacity. We also generate approximately $150 million of cash flow after dividends and we expect to realize up to $200 million in proceeds from asset sales. Consequently, we believe we have ample liquidity to fund our capital requirements. Debt to EBITDA stood at 5.2x as of year-end, and we expect to remain comfortably below our 5.5x target throughout 2016 with the balance sheet positioned for growth. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

We see that demand as well as our regular demand accelerating. But we do have to keep an eye on the hyperscale requirements and the lumpy nature of those requirements. We saw $36 million of revenue as a healthy pace for space and power in Q4. When you throw in connectivity, that gets up to about $43 million in the quarter. And I think all of that is still a reflection of our desire to remain disciplined, not just in challenging times, but to remain disciplined in good times as well. It's important to remember that we're seeing successfully signed deals at attractive cash returns. And as Andy mentioned in his remarks, we were happy to land one of those very large cloud deals at a 15-year term in Q4, and we expect to see that continue in the first quarter."

How comfortable are you right now with the exposure you have to these customers right now? And is there anything that you're doing to prevent or anything you can do to prevent any risk with these customers as you go forward? Then my second question, the $43 million of new leases including the interconnects, based on your guidance that you have now for 2016, are you expecting that number to remain relatively stable through the course of the year? Or would you expect that or does that assume -- or do you assume that in your guidance that, that ramps even further as we go into 2016?"

And then going back to your first question, and I'll let others on the team jump in, I mean, holistically, the best way is obviously to mitigate this are through diversification of your customers, your locations, your leases, maturities. We're always in constant dialogue with our customers, making sure we understand their business and where it's going and trying to help them with their space needs. I don't think there's anything on the horizon right now, be it with the Rackspace and AT&T or CenturyLink, where they're actually looking to contract from our specific footprints. I think some of the noise you're seeing in the market or on the news rags, right, is more about focusing some of them, excluding probably Rackspace, focusing on their core businesses and selling non-core businesses."

It really aligns well with our investments on the continent over there. We've done some pre-work in terms of meeting with different folks over there and fixed income investors.

And so the progress being made on the AT&T side is fantastic. And the progress on the IBM side is incredibly promising. We have a unique situation with IBM where we happen to have the core compute nodes located on our campuses. We happen to have colocation space and colocation experts in Telx right next to those core compute nodes, and we have the magic of Telx's interconnection as well as a number of products that are in the funnel to bring to market in the future to provide our customers with the ability to securely and privately connect at lower than 1.5 milliseconds, which is incredibly important for them. And we think that we are one, if not the only folks, who can provide that environment for our customers. One small thing to clear up, we don't -- NetBond is the second part of the AT&T agreement that we have. We don't manage NetBond as part of that process, but we do have a partnership with them so that they can land NetBond assets on our Connected Campuses."

We certainly don't like to pick amongst the non-SMACC verticals because we're very big fans of the SMACC verticals. But in particular, financial services for us. And to go one click deeper, financial technology, we think, is one of the places that holds a lot of promise, not just for large-scale deployments on our scale team, but colocation requirements on our colocation team and then multiple points of connectivity. It's actually probably one of the best cases you can think about where these fintech companies have to connect to other providers, have to connect to other institutions and have to connect to consumers. So fintech within finserv is one of the exciting places that we found. The Internet enterprise is another one of the verticals that we really like to have a focus on, not just because of our historical performance in those particular verticals, but because of the necessary growth that's coming out of some of the activities. So some of the both -- the M&A activity that we see happening here as well as some of the divestitures creates for us an incredible opportunity when one of our great customers decides to split into 2 large companies, sometimes we get double the opportunity. And I know I wasn't supposed to talk about anything inside SMACC, but we think the mobile vertical for us is one that's incredibly ready for us to continue to exploit. And with the expertise of Telx now on board, we're well situated to be able to do that."

So -- and just let me go back to your first question because I think I might miss a piece of it. Just to make sure we're all in the same page, the decrease in the total portfolio is occupancy by 140 bps or so as of this quarter. That was due to a look-through on Telx. So 11 or 12 locations were 100% occupied at 3Q '15. And we then -- we bought their business and they were not 100% utilized within their 4 walls. So that was a step down there. So I just want to make sure we didn't miscommunicate on that front. Going back to cost of capital, the base plan which we put out in our guidance roughly 7 weeks ago has a source and uses plan that was funded through retained cash flow, a little bit from dispo proceeds and kept us below our 5.5x debt to EBITDA while at the same time funding a pretty large investment in our development pipeline. That's the base case plan. It doesn't require equity. I think you could expect us to follow our past track record if an opportunistic investment came about, whether it's some large-scale increase in our development from landing a hyperscale deal or some M&A or other acquisition.

I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our fourth quarter highlights as outlined here on Page 18 of the deck. 
First and foremost, we closed on the acquisition of Telx in what was truly a transformational transaction for our company. Telx checked all the boxes for us. It was highly strategic and extremely complementary to our existing platform. It was accretive to FFO and AFFO per share in year 1, and it was prudently financed. We reported fourth quarter results that were well ahead of the high end of our guidance range. The quality of our earnings is improving with the burn off of straight-line rent and the contribution from Telx. Growth in cash flow is accelerating, and we are poised to deliver double-digit growth in AFFO per share. We also took deliberate steps to secure our supply chain with the acquisition of a highly desirable land parcel in Ashburn. We also entered the Frankfurt market, a long-standing target. Last, but not least, we also raised the dividend for the 11th consecutive year. We've grown the dividend each and every year since our IPO in 2004, and we remain committed to delivering superior risk-adjusted total returns to our shareholders. 
Finally, I'd like to thank -- say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. That concludes our fourth quarter call. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida over the next several weeks."

I'd like to begin on Page 2 of our presentation by reminding you that delivering superior risk-adjusted returns is our guiding principle. That applies to the investment decisions under our control and it also holds for the investment opportunity we expect to provide shareholders. 
In terms of our capital allocation decisions, that means mitigating risk on development by requiring significant levels of pre-leasing and building only in the markets where we have high visibility on demand. It means emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We are highly focused on the accretive deployment of capital and we decline deals that do not provide us sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We emphasize growth in our bottom line on a per-share basis. 
In terms of the investment profile that we offer to shareholders, it means delivering consistent uninterrupted growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends per share throughout the business cycle, firmly supported by the underlying value of owned real estate. 
Let's turn now to our platform on Page 3. We have made a very conscious decision not to directly pursue the enterprise vertical with few exceptions, such as our traditional bread-and-butter customers like financial services companies. We aim to enable our partners to service enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide. In early December, we announced a colocation resale alliance with AT&T as well as a direct link colocation partnership with IBM SoftLayer. I'm pleased to report that our partners and alliances program continues to gain momentum and that these partnerships have already begun to bear fruit, contributing meaningfully to our fourth quarter signing total. 
Through these strategic initiatives, we have on-boarded some new target customers such as a large and growing Asian multinational communications networking company. These wins certainly speak to our approach of supporting partners as they grow their business while simultaneously leveraging a broader, collective sales engine. This pipeline is also growing significantly, including international opportunities and several large expansions for deals signed in 2015 as well as numerous enterprise logos not pursued by Digital Realty's direct sales force, highlighting the value proposition of this partnership model. 
Turning now to capital recycling on Page 4. We closed on the sale of a vacant industrial building in Franklin Township, New Jersey during the fourth quarter. This property had previously been held for redevelopment, but market conditions were unlikely to justify construction any time soon. And we determined to sell the property to an owner user and move on. Subsequent to year-end, we sold the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $188 per square foot at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. This former R&D manufacturing campus was likewise vacant until we were able to successfully re-lease it last year, significantly enhancing the execution we were able to achieve on the sale of this non-core asset. 
We are now also under contract on the national 4-property data center portfolio that we mentioned on our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. There are no financing contingencies, and we expect to close during the first half of the year. We've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of these non-core assets, and this portfolio sale will substantially conclude our capital recycling program. We do, however, continue to believe that culling the asset base represents prudent real estate portfolio management. And you can reasonably expect us to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly non-data center properties or one-off assets that no longer fit our Connected Campus strategy. 
We've begun to shift from a harvesting mode to selectively investing to secure our supply chain and to carefully position the company for future growth. As previously announced, during the fourth quarter, we acquired a land parcel in Ashburn less than a mile away from our existing campus. This is one of the few remaining greenfield sites suitable for data center development in Loudon County. It will support the development of approximately 2 million square feet and the buildout of roughly 150 megawatts and will facilitate our customers' growth for the next several years upon completion of our existing Ashburn campus. 
We also established a foothold in Germany, a long-time target market, with the acquisition of a 6-acre parcel in Frankfurt during the fourth quarter for $6 million. This parcel will support the development of a 3-building campus, totaling approximately 340,000 square feet and roughly 27 megawatts of critical load. We have begun the local entitlement process and expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first suite in the second half of next year subject to market demand. 
Moving on to market fundamentals on Page 5. Most markets continue to gradually tighten. The data center demand backdrop remains incredibly healthy, driven largely by our target verticals, namely social, mobile, big data, cloud and content, along with financial and IT services. We've seen a significant uptick in the size of the average scale requirement, particularly from the hyperscale cloud service providers. The caveat here is that these requirements can be quite lumpy and timing can be hard to predict. The lumpiness of the large footprint business is complemented perfectly by the consistent cadence of the colocation and interconnection contribution from our Telx line of business. Andy will provide an update on performance against our underwriting targets, but suffice it to say, the integration is proceeding smoothly. We are pleased by the contribution Telx is already making to our quarterly bookings, and we expect it will accelerate the overall growth rate of our organization. 
The Telx acquisition has introduced us to over 1,000 new logos, and the combined organization is developing strong relationships with these new accounts. Over the past 2 years, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, highlighting the value of these new customer relationships and further underscoring the complementary nature of the Telx acquisition. 
And now let's turn to the macro environment on Page 6. Global economic growth has decelerated over the last 90 days, while volatility and uncertainty have increased. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation or even the price of oil, although the drop over the last 18 months is striking. We have the good fortune to be levered to secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing faster than GDP. 
It's worth pausing here to reflect on our performance during the last downturn, which you can see represented in some of the visuals on Page 7. By way of reminder, we have generated positive year-over-year growth in dividends and core FFO per share each and every year since our IPO in 2004, and the great financial crisis was no exception. 
Our total shareholder return in 2008 and 2009 also compared quite favorably to the REIT index as well as the broader market. During that capital-constrained environment, it was corporate outsourcing of data center requirements along with a prudently managed balance sheet that was responsible for our outperformance. In the current environment, cloud adoption is the next generation of corporate outsourcing writ large. The cloud is gaining traction because it enables corporate enterprise end users to achieve efficiencies and contain costs. During a downturn, this becomes even more appealing. In addition, our target cloud service providers are generally mature, well-capitalized tech companies, and the cloud platforms are among their fastest-growing business segments. Consequently, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver steady per-share growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

Let's begin with an update on Telx here on Page 9. As you know, we closed the transaction in early October. I'm pleased to report that we reached our commitment for $15 million of expense synergies during the fourth quarter, and we expect",1933,"Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx here on Page 9. As you know, we closed the transaction in early October. I'm pleased to report that we reached our commitment for $15 million of expense synergies during the fourth quarter, and we expect to realize the full run rate benefit of these savings in 2016. We also reached retention agreements with key personnel, and we are well on our way to integrating the 2 platforms. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, Telx generated $89 million of revenue, an 11% increase compared to the prior year period. Revenues are split roughly 50-50 between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $33 million of cash EBITDA during the fourth quarter. 
Telx performed at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts. That momentum has carried on into 2016, and we remain on track to meet our underwriting targets. Bill has already alluded to more than 1,000 new customers with whom we are able to establish a relationship as a result of the Telx transaction. Separately, Telx brought an additional 27 new logos into the fold during the fourth quarter as well, including new subsea cable systems, mobile operators and content suppliers. The total number of cross connects for the combined organization is now more than 60,000, and we believe that connectivity represents a significant opportunity for cross-fertilization. 
We told you on our last earnings call that the next order of business for Telx will be to transfer our existing colocation business at 365 Main along with turning over pockets of available inventory within our Internet gateways. I'm pleased to report that the transfer of 365 Main was completed earlier this month and the buildout and transfer of approximately 10,000 square feet at 111 8th Ave. should be online by the end of the third quarter. In addition, our investment committee recently approved allocation of capital to build out a dedicated colocation suite at Building J on our Ashburn campus. We begin to -- we expect to begin selling into that market during the second quarter and to plant the Telx flag in Ashburn during the second half of 2016. While revenue synergies will mostly be realized beyond 2016, we have begun to see some early successes through the collaboration of our scale and colocation sales force, including the recent signing by a top SMACC customer and a new location within the portfolio for that customer. 
In summary, while the integration mission is not yet fully accomplished, we are pleased with the progress and performance to date. 
Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 10. We signed leases totaling $36 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $7 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the fourth quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for more than 75% of our lease signings during the quarter. Notable highlights include a multi-megawatt lease with a hyperscale cloud service provider at our Franklin Park campus in Chicago. The weighted average lag between signings and commencements was 4.5 months, and as shown on Page 11, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence in the first half of this year. 
Turning to Page 12. The average cash re-leasing spread during the fourth quarter was a positive 15%, driven by robust mark-to-market on PBB renewals offset by a slight cash roll-down on a much smaller sample size of turnkey renewals. For the full year of 2016, we expect re-leasing spreads to be flat on a cash basis and up in the high single digits on a GAAP basis. We do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Northern New Jersey and Phoenix. And from time to time, individual leases can be large enough to swing the mark-to-market into the red in any given quarter. On balance, however, we believe we are reaching inflection point and we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by market rent growth and a steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. 
Turning to our financial results on Page 13. We reported 4Q '15 core FFO per share of $1.38, above the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance was driven by a combination of several items, including: a few cents for Telx operational outperformance during the fourth quarter and $0.01 or so for early achievement on our expense synergy plan, roughly $0.01 for lower Asia-Pacific operating expenses, and lastly, our overall G&A did come in a little lighter than we had expected. 
FX represented roughly 150 to 200 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As shown on Page 14, and we expect this to persist and represent a drag of similar magnitude in 2016. It is worth reminding everyone that we manage currency risks by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. We are well hedged with 89% of our net assets denominated in U.S. dollars. 
You may have noticed from the press release that our guidance assumes $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion of long-term debt issuance. This may include a potential $500 million eurobond, which would further enhance our natural balance sheet hedge and increase our U.S. dollar net assets to 95%. Furthermore, we generally utilize excess cash flows to repay non-U.S. dollar debt or redeploy into local investment rather than repatriating back to the U.S. While our global portfolio exposes us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of cloud service providers and other strategic customers around the world, which represents a key competitive advantage. 
We've attempted to frame our exposure to swings in currencies, interest rates and commodities here on Page 15. The overarching theme is that we benefit from our scale as well as the diversification of our customer base and geographic footprint. 
I'd like to take a moment to highlight the long-term trend in straight-line rent shown here on Page 16. A portion of decline in the fourth quarter was due to the elimination of the straight-line rental revenue that Digital previously recognized under our long-term lease agreements with Telx. The longer-term trend, however, also reflects the improved underwriting discipline we've instilled over the past 2 years as well as the consistently improving data center fundamental landscape. 
Our 2016 guidance calls for $10 million to $20 million of net noncash rent adjustments, including straight-line rental revenue, straight-line rent expense and FAS 141 adjustments. Straight-line rental revenue and FAS 141 adjustments are fairly ordinary course for our REIT investors. These items represent noncash revenue that is recognized on our books and is deducted from core FFO to arrive at AFFO. We expect these 2 line items together to total $35 million to $40 million in 2016. This would be down considerably from $87 million in 2014 and $60 million in 2015, but does not get you all the way down to our $10 million to $20 million guidance. The offset is $20 million to $25 million of straight-line rent expense that Telx recognizes on long-term leases with third-party landlords. In contrast to straight-line rental revenue, this is a noncash expense that runs through the P&L and is added back rather than deducted from our core FFO to arrive at AFFO. 
When we first announced the Telx transaction, we stated it would be 1% accretive to FFO per share in 2016 but 3% accretive to AFFO per share. These straight-line rent adjustments are the primary reason why Telx is more accretive to AFFO than FFO and also a -- are a meaningful contributor to our forecast for double-digit AFFO per-share growth in 2016. 
In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, same capital occupancy slipped sequentially -- 60 bps sequentially, primarily due to a PBB move-out in Phoenix. Same capital cash NOI was up 3.4% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, same capital cash NOI would have been up 4.9%. As you may have seen from the press release, we guided to 0% to 3% same capital cash NOI growth in 2016, which is net of the foreign currency headwinds. The 2016 forecast comes with a major caveat, however. Telx greatly complicates the composition of our same-store pool since they were previously a customer in 11 of our locations. These locations are mostly Internet Gateways and represent a big chunk of our stabilized portfolio, so carving them out of the same-store pool will result in a much smaller sample size. 
At the end of the day, we decided to continue to report same capital results for 2016 as if our leases with Telx were still in place. Beginning in 2017, Telx will be included in the same-store pool and we will revert to a less theoretical presentation. In the meantime, however, same capital results should be taken with a grain of salt. 
Telx have a similar impact on our reported occupancy statistics. We previously reflected space leased to Telx as 100% occupied. Now however, this space is shown on a look-through basis, reflecting Telx's utilization of the space. A look-through treatment results in a lower reported occupancy across the 12 properties where Telx has a presence due to Telx lower utilization and embedded lease-up potential within those -- that space. 
Irrespective of the complexities of portfolio reporting, we remain keenly focused on organic growth. We will be aggressively attempting to renew expiring leases at higher rates, keeping our operating expenses in check and being mindful of our cost structure. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 17. In January, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than 2 years and upsize the term loan facilities by $550 million. We also established access to a new tenor within the bank loan market with a $300 million 7-year term loan. The facilities were well oversubscribed and we like to thank our entire bank group for their support. 
I mentioned earlier in the midpoint of our guidance -- excuse me, I mentioned earlier that the midpoint of our guidance assumes $1.5 billion of long-term debt issuance. I would like to clarify that this total includes the incremental $550 million of 5- and 7-year term loans, which was put to bed with this refinancing. 
As shown on Page 17, the refinancing clearly -- effectively clears up the left-hand side of the maturity schedule. We have clear runway with very modest debt maturities until 2020 with well-laddered debt maturities thereafter. In addition, floating rate debt now represents less than 15% total debt outstanding, and we currently have $1.5 billion of undrawn capacity. We also generate approximately $150 million of cash flow after dividends and we expect to realize up to $200 million in proceeds from asset sales. Consequently, we believe we have ample liquidity to fund our capital requirements. Debt to EBITDA stood at 5.2x as of year-end, and we expect to remain comfortably below our 5.5x target throughout 2016 with the balance sheet positioned for growth. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

This is Matt. Yes, I think Bill nailed it in his opening remarks and good focus on the hyperscale activity because those requirements really sort of form the foundation of what the demand is, was in Q4 and is and will be as we move forward in 2016. We see that demand as well as our regular demand accelerating. But we do have to keep an eye on the hyperscale requirements and the lumpy nature of those requirements. We saw $36 million of revenue as a healthy pace for space and power in Q4. When you throw in connectivity, that gets up to about $43 million in the quarter. And I think all of that is still a reflection of our desire to remain disciplined, not just in challenging times, but to remain disciplined in good times as well. It's important to remember that we're seeing successfully signed deals at attractive cash returns. And as Andy mentioned in his remarks, we were happy to land one of those very large cloud deals at a 15-year term in Q4, and we expect to see that continue in the first quarter."

We're always in constant dialogue with our customers, making sure we understand their business and where it's going and trying to help them with their space needs. I don't think there's anything on the horizon right now, be it with the Rackspace and AT&T or CenturyLink, where they're actually looking to contract from our specific footprints.

It's actually probably one of the best cases you can think about where these fintech companies have to connect to other providers, have to connect to other institutions and have to connect to consumers. So fintech within finserv is one of the exciting places that we found. The Internet enterprise is another one of the verticals that we really like to have a focus on, not just because of our historical performance in those particular verticals, but because of the necessary growth that's coming out of some of the activities. So some of the both -- the M&A activity that we see happening here as well as some of the divestitures creates for us an incredible opportunity when one of our great customers decides to split into 2 large companies, sometimes we get double the opportunity.

So -- and just let me go back to your first question because I think I might miss a piece of it. Just to make sure we're all in the same page, the decrease in the total portfolio is occupancy by 140 bps or so as of this quarter. That was due to a look-through on Telx. So 11 or 12 locations were 100% occupied at 3Q '15. And we then -- we bought their business and they were not 100% utilized within their 4 walls. So that was a step down there. So I just want to make sure we didn't miscommunicate on that front. Going back to cost of capital, the base plan which we put out in our guidance roughly 7 weeks ago has a source and uses plan that was funded through retained cash flow, a little bit from dispo proceeds and kept us below our 5.5x debt to EBITDA while at the same time funding a pretty large investment in our development pipeline. That's the base case plan. It doesn't require equity. I think you could expect us to follow our past track record if an opportunistic investment came about, whether it's some large-scale increase in our development from landing a hyperscale deal or some M&A or other acquisition. We look to go to the capital markets to keep our leverage stats in line and equity as time and time again it had been a part of that."

I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our fourth quarter highlights as outlined here on Page 18 of the deck. 
First and foremost, we closed on the acquisition of Telx in what was truly a transformational transaction for our company. Telx checked all the boxes for us. It was highly strategic and extremely complementary to our existing platform. It was accretive to FFO and AFFO per share in year 1, and it was prudently financed. We reported fourth quarter results that were well ahead of the high end of our guidance range. The quality of our earnings is improving with the burn off of straight-line rent and the contribution from Telx. Growth in cash flow is accelerating, and we are poised to deliver double-digit growth in AFFO per share. We also took deliberate steps to secure our supply chain with the acquisition of a highly desirable land parcel in Ashburn. We also entered the Frankfurt market, a long-standing target. Last, but not least, we also raised the dividend for the 11th consecutive year. We've grown the dividend each and every year since our IPO in 2004, and we remain committed to delivering superior risk-adjusted total returns to our shareholders. 
Finally, I'd like to thank -- say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. That concludes our fourth quarter call. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida over the next several weeks."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. We had another very productive first quarter, characterized by a solid execution against our strategic plan. In particular, we deliberately advanced our global footprint during the quarter",1031,"Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. We had another very productive first quarter, characterized by a solid execution against our strategic plan. In particular, we deliberately advanced our global footprint during the quarter, the second of the 4 guiding principles that we laid out at our Investor Day last October and shown here on Page 2 of our earnings presentation. I'm very pleased to announce that we signed a multi-megawatt acre lease with a hyperscale cloud service provider in Osaka, fully pre-leasing phase 1 of our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month and delivery is scheduled for the fourth quarter of next year. We also announced that we established a foothold in Germany with the acquisition of a land parcel in Frankfurt. We have begun the entitlement process, and we expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first week in the second half of next year, subject to market demand. 
As you may recall, Germany and Japan have been our top 2 target markets, and we're very pleased that our progress during the first quarter, particularly in a manner that this consistent with our overarching objective of delivering superior risk-adjusted returns. We also delivered solid current period financial results. Andy will take you through the details in his prepared remarks, but the outperformance during the first quarter reflects consistent execution on the fourth objective here on Page 2, achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in both cash flow and value per share.
As we've explained, we've made a conscious decision not to go up the stack or compete with our customers or offer managed services, nor do we intend to directly market to the broader array of enterprise customers and incur the overhead associated with building out the massive Salesforce necessary to target corporate enterprise directly. We aim instead to enable our partners to service enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide. 
Our partners and alliances program continue to build momentum during the first quarter, adding Sungard Availability services as a global partner. We are very excited about this partnership as it highlights our strategy of charging enterprise via our partners by combining our best-in-class infrastructure with our partners best-in-class services. We are in discussions with several other parties about joining our partners and alliances program, and we've added more resources to the team to support the growth of the program. 
In terms of capital recycling, during the first quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California, to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $108 per square foot at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. We are still under contract on a national for property data center portfolio that we mentioned on our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. Due diligence is underway, and we expect to close within the next several months.
Let's now turn to market fundamentals. As you can see from the charts on Page 3, current construction activity, represented by the green bars, is most prevalent in Chicago, Dallas and Northern Virginia. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, absolute levels of supply should also be considered in context, which we provide here on Page 4. First of all, current construction pipelines are generally concentrated in top-tier national markets with high visibility on demand and pre-leasing levels are healthy. In addition, market vacancy rates within these markets are in the single digits, and our own portfolios in these same markets are likewise north of 90% lease. These markets have also been characterized by robust levels of leasing activity. And in each case, the level of 2015 absorption represents a multiple of 2 to 3 times the level of current supply. Within the context of our own portfolio, we have delivered 38 megawatts of new product into these 3 markets over the last 12 months, and our deliveries were over 94% leased on average. We would expect a similar level of leasing on our current crop of property development projects upon delivery.
And now let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. Global economic growth has stabilized somewhat over the last 90 days although the rate of growth still remain subdued. Growth of total IT spending is likewise lackluster. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation or the price of oil, and even the growth of total IT spending paints an incomplete picture. We have a good fortune to be levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy, as well as the broader IT industry. Current industry trends are very favorable to our core strategy. Rather than spending more, CIOs, chief information officers, are looking to stress their IT dollar further. Narrowing the focus to core competencies is the order of the day, and outsourcing the corporate IT function is being embraced as the more efficient model. The rapid growth of cloud adoption is reflection of these same trends. IDC estimates that by 2018, 65% of companies IT assets are expected to be located off-site in colocation, hosting and cloud data centers, while 1/3 of IT staff are expected to be employees of third-party service providers. Similarly, IDC predicts that more than 80% of enterprise IT organizations will commit to a hybrid cloud architectures by 2017. These hybrid architectures require a colocation presence as well as close proximity to multiple clouds. Along with our partners, we provide the trusted real estate foundation for these deployments. 
The major cloud service providers are rapidly building out their compute note footprint to meet this demand. With our global foundation of data center solutions, we are uniquely positioned to support this rapid growth as we are one of the very few providers with the ability to meet these large scale requirements on a global basis. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

Let's begin with an update on Telx here on Page 7. Telx generated $92 million of revenue during the first quarter, representing 10% growth  year-over-year. Revenues remain split, roughly 50-50 between colocation and interconnection. From",1991,"Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx here on Page 7. Telx generated $92 million of revenue during the first quarter, representing 10% growth  year-over-year. Revenues remain split, roughly 50-50 between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $38 million of cash EBITDA during the first quarter.
Telx continues to perform at or slightly better than plan on all fronts, and we remain on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets. Over the past 90 days, the Telx team has been focused on a few key areas within the business. First is our customers, where we continue to grow and expand our key communities and verticals within our Internet Gateways. Second is cash flow where we have been focused on the development of our commercial management team to drive additional revenue. Third is systems. We are in the process of integrating systems between the 2 organizations which will include a combined customer portal. 
With respect to expanding our customer base and nurturing our colocation ecosystem, we have emphasize the continued development of target verticals and communities. During the first quarter, Telx added 35 new logos, a 30% uptick from the number of new logos added during the prior quarter. In addition to our focus on cloud service providers, we continue to see growth within our Internet Gateways in areas such as content, wireless and mobility services, undersea cable systems and many other vertical that drive connectivity growth. We have been successful in enhancing the appeal of our facilities by attracting numerous undersea cable systems. We announced the faster and [indiscernible] cable systems last year, and we plan to announce the signing of an additional undersea cable system within the next few weeks. We expect these efforts to continue to drive interconnection growth and offer customer base continue diversity and global connectivity options from within our facilities. 
With regard to the commercial management team, we have been very focused on revenue optimization to ensure accurate and timely billing and collection for space, power and connectivity within our facilities. This team has increased its focus on pursuing contractual annual REIT increases from our colocation customers while within their term, and we're working to consolidate legacy contractual agreements across our data center platform. 
With respect to systems, we identified our target IT architecture during the first quarter, and we are working quickly to consolidate these platforms. But we want to be sure that we deliver seamless customer experience before introducing additional complexity to our systems' landscape. We're making solid headway, and we expect this effort to continue as a top priority for the next few quarters. 
Finally, we recognize that our customer portal is 1 of the top drivers for improving customer satisfaction to our 1,600 customers. Telx introduced a world-class portal over 4 years ago to improve service capabilities to drive revenue, as well as functionality line customers to easily discover and connect to each other. We believe the self-service storefront capabilities in this system marketplace will help retain existing customers while growing the installed base with new entrants seeking to benefit from this developing ecosystem. We hope many of you will be able to attend marketplace live in New York City on September 22, where we plan to unveil several new additions and upgrades to the portal. In summary, while integration is still underway, we remain pleased with the progress and the performance to date.
Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed new leases, totaling $39 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $8 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the first quarter. 
Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for approximately 80% of our leases signed during the quarter. And over 90% was repeat business with existing customers. The combined organization added a total of 41 new logos during the quarter.
The weighted average lag between signings and commencements was 8 months, driven primarily by the pre-lease Bill alluded to on our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month and delivery is scheduled for next fall. Excluding the new build in Osaka, the lag between signings and commencements was 5 months, in line with our customary activity. As shown on Page 9, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced now stands at $90 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence this year. I would also like to point out here on Page 9 that in response to feedback from analysts and investors, we have provided a bridge to reconcile the prior quarter backlog to the $90 million current backlog.
Turning to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed a little over $50 million of leasing renewals during the first quarter, in addition to new leases signed up. The average cash releasing spread was up 2% with a positive cash mark-to-market on turnkey and colocation renewals laid down a bit by a modest cash rental down on a relatively small sample size and the PBB renewals during the first quarter. 
As mentioned on previous calls, we do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Phoenix and in pockets of our East Coast portfolio, and we expect a couple of those to hit during the second quarter, which will likely result in a cash rent roll down during the second quarter. We expect to see positive cash flow releasing spread in the second half of the year. And for the full year, we still expect to be roughly flat on a cash basis and up in the high single digits on a GAAP basis. In general, we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and a steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations.
Turning to our financial results on Page 11. We reported 1Q '16 core FFO per share of $1.42, $0.07 ahead of consensus estimates. Several initiatives we outlined in our Investor Day designed to drive additional cash flow from our properties and leverage our scale to achieving operating efficiencies are beginning to bear fruit. And the upside during the first quarter was driven by operating outperformance as well as interest savings. Specifically, one penny was due to outperformance from the Digital Realty portfolio, another penny was due to the Telx outperformance during the quarter. $0.02 were due to lower-than-expected overhead. And lastly, interest expense was $0.03 lower than expected do primarily to the timing and the pricing achieved on the term loan in January and the eurobond in April. 
AFFO per share was likewise well ahead of plan, partially driven by the BFFO line, along with a further reduction straight-line rental revenue. Recurring FX was also down significantly, although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending, and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up over the course of the year.
As you may have seen from the press release, we raised our core FFO per share guidance from $5.45 to $5.60 to a range of $5.55 to $5.65. We raised the projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points, again reflecting the benefit of the operating efficiencies we've been able to achieve. This is reflected on the G&A line as well as the property level, and we raised both ends of the range for our 2016 same-capital cash NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points from 0 to 3% to 1% to 4%, or roughly 2% to 5% on a constant-currency basis. 
Finally, interest rates on the term loan as well as the Eurobond both came in tighter than expected. And we have revised our financings assumption to reflect actual capital raise to date. The forecast does still include a potential $300 million to $400 million bond offering later this year. 
FX represented a roughly 100 to 150 basis point drag on the year-to-year growth on our reported results to the top to the bottom line as shown here on Page 12. Although foreign currency headwinds are abating somewhat, the U.K. represents our largest concentration outside the U.S. The dollar is currently strong compared to 2015 average sterling exchange rate and our 2016 outlook contemplates a continued drag of similar magnitude for the remainder of the year. 
I would like to remind you that we manage currency risks by issuing a locally-denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. I would also like to point out that we completed our inaugural eurobond offering in early April. We raised EUR 600 million, further enhancing our natural hedge and reducing our non-U.S. dollar nominated net asset exposure to less than 10%. 
Finally, I would like to point out that while our global footprint exposes us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe represents a key competitive advantage.
In terms of our first quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy slipped 10 basis points sequentially, same-capital cash NOI was up 4.3% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would have been up approximately 5%. I would like to -- I would also like to remind everyone that our 2016 same-store presentation is somewhat theoretical, since we have elected to report same-capital results for 2016 as if our leases with Telx were still in place. Given the Telx was previously a customer in 11 of our properties, most of which are Internet Gateways that comprise a huge chunk of our stabilized portfolio.
Let's turn to balance sheet on Page 13. As previously announced, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities in January. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than 2 years and upsize the term loan facilities by $550 million, including $300 million of 7-year paper. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, the refinancing effectively clears the left-hand side of the maturity schedule. We have just under $300 million or less than 5% of total debt coming due before 2020. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we priced our inaugural $600 million eurobond offering at a 2.625% coupon in early April. Just to be clear, since it may not have been for everyone, 2 5/8 with the all-in pricing, not just the spread. We were fortunate to price within 1 basis point of the all-time low in the benchmark 8-year mid-swap rate. And needless to say, we were pleased with the execution. We presented the pro forma impact of the eurobond issuance here on Page 14 of the presentation. And as you can see, the 8-year term fit perfectly in the 1 open [indiscernible] in our debt maturity ladder in 2024. 
Proceeds were used to refinance and term out borrowings on the line of credit, and the current balance on the line is less than $100 million with over $1.9 billion of availability. Floating rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding.
In addition, as you can see from the colo box in the left-hand side of the chart, the weighted average debt maturity is now 6.8 years. 2, full years longer than a weighted average maturity as at the end of 1Q '15. Terming out over $1 billion of long-term debt does have a dilutive earnings impact, but we believe locking in long-term fixed rate financing from a new source of institutional capital providers is proven financial management. Consistent with our financial strategy, we are maintaining our balance sheet well positioned for new investment opportunities. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Amy, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

Now with regard to the quarter, of course, my team -- my global team is very pleased with our most recent quarter coming in around a $40 million design is kind of as you've mentioned, not to mentioned he will come revenue contribution of $8 million coming from our interconnection business. It is important to remember when we talked about the current leasing environment out in the industry that we aren't really new to this hyperscale cloud game. In fact, while we talked in the opening remarks about the 1 deal that was in Anchor in Osaka, we've done more deals in Q1 with hyperscale cloud providers as well. And we've been addressing this demand for more than a few years now successfully. And during that time period, as well as Q1, we captured multiple multi-megawatt requirements from various, not just 1, but various hyperscale cloud service providers around the world. And from our perspective, these requirements may be a little less than conspicuous in our quarterly leasing results given the diverse nature of what has become a consistent $30 million to $40 million contribution of quarter leasing activities. So for instance, this quarter, Jordan, about 30% of our signings came from the top 3 cloud service providers. About an additional 20% came from targeted cloud providers outside of those top 3. And then, a bit more than 30% came from our diversified stack of a social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content comps. It's important that we keep in mind that in addition to our quarterly when here in the U.S., we're also successfully landing requirements in our target global markets, not simply in Japan, in London as well, which tend to be comparatively bluer oceans, where our publicly traded domestic data center peers may not have a dominant presence. And the final piece of my response would be that my team, as you know remains intently committed to strong leasing fundamentals as beneficial to shareholders while we keep our eye on driving this growing hyperscale demand."

And then on the top line, we did have some mark-to-market outcomes that were a little bit better than we planned, which is driving some of the increase in the same-store cash NOI growth."

We've got a really good process actually in place to understand the production capabilities that we have and how those production capabilities match up to what our customers really need. I'll talk about what our customers need, and I'll turn it over to Jarrett to talk about the production sizes and the production capabilities that we have. In terms of the way our customers look at this, they still sort of look at it as having a foot in each of these markets and each of these buildings, and each of these facilities that usually comes in the shape of at least 1, what we used to call POD, but 1 scale oriented POD. Sometimes 2 scale oriented-POD that we needed short quarter. One is generally the size that they need up-front, and they need to have visibility so that they're not then outgrow their needs and they're not going to outgrow the colo needs that they know their customers are going to need in the hybrid cloud environment.

So the Digital Realty NOI, Telx EBITDA. G&A, there may be some timing elements to it as part of our non-comp related travel consulting fees like that. So if budget people exceeds budget in subsequent quarters essentially using budget used in the first quarter. And then the lower interest expense. I mean that's a product of 2 things. The timing and when we did our capital raises and actually our execution on the capital raises. The one thing I would caveat, it's not as simple as just taking the far right bar and times it by 4 to get our full year number. The -- we do have some items that will reduce that full year number and offset our increases in revenue. One of those is that portfolio of data centers that we have under contract and to sell, hopefully, the next month or so, that will obviously be diluted out of the gates when we sell $120-ish million of assets that are income-producing. And in the second item is we basically had a revolver balance at $600 million, $700 million for most of the quarter and then did a $600 million eurobond. Subsequent to quarter end and now the fixed rate 8-year piece of paper which is obviously good for the balance sheet locks in long-dated hedged debt that but is not as low as a floating rate revolver debt."

But I'd be interested, I guess, sort of on the the opposite side as to hear about the enterprises coming in to connect with the scale cloud guys. And you did call out the $7.5 million of incremental interconnection fee that you were able book off of [indiscernible] quarter.

I think you can expect some additional new market expansion to unfold throughout the remainder of the year. On the West Coast, well, I'd be fortunate enough to sign subsea cable, a which we think will enhance our Telx -- attractiveness of our Telx footprint and the entire footprint in the market. We're also looking -- we're expanding our footprint in Atlanta where we've been very successful in [indiscernible]. So so far so good as it relates to Telx. Just to jump around. But from interconnection revenue line item, we're tracking year-over-year on just that revenue component north of 10%, I think it was close to 11%.

Jonathan, whatever your name is today. Real quick on the first part of your question. Hopefully, to give you a little color on what Andy said and some pretty concrete examples of where we see the combination really coming together quite impressively. We've been through a number of events where we bring both teams together to address customers. Start -- I'd would say it started very actively with PDC [ph]. We've got ITW [ph] coming up and we've been in a number of events in between. And what's interesting is the reaction from our customers has been absolutely fantastic. So not only have they thanked us for coming together for giving them in essence, one [indiscernible] for all of their scale colo cross connect and other services needs, but we've seen a number of them actually start to change their own individual organization structure to come to us in the same way that we're now coming to them all in 1. So we've seen -- and I've now seen this last week, the fourth large cloud service provider making decision to consolidate their network folks with their data center folks to make sure that they're coming to market the right way. So I don't know -- I'm not claiming of credit to that because of what we did, but I'm letting you know that it's landing pretty well, the Telx and large campus together. Let me get to the heart of what I think Andy turn it over to me for, which is the why hyperscale is coming into Digital Realty, in particular with our set of assets. There's a couple that Jarrett has talked about individually. One is first of all, we get hyperscale. We've been doing hyperscale before someone fully turned it hyperscale. We've been doing large deployment, and we figured out how to make a fairly profitable business out of it from the beginning. So these folks are comfortable that we know what we're doing, and we've got the size and scale, no pun intended, to have a good counterparty on the other side of the transaction for their large compute node need. But they also know that their customers need more than simply the ability to provide cloud services through 1 data center, 5 data centers throughout the world. They also need to have colocation availability so that those folks have the ability to land what they cannot put into public cloud, cannot maybe put into a private cloud and have to put into their enterprise class data center, and then they need connectivity to bring them all together. We just came from our final advisory board, and several of them came to us and said, ""We love the idea that we can now get this at the 1 organization."" They're looking for ease. They're looking to take the complexity out of the IP transactions that they have in front of them, and we're able to act as that vehicle that takes that complexity away. I would say in the future, we've had some future-oriented conversations about where they're taking the business into the future with their platforms as a service offerings, and they're very interested in being involved with the companies that has now 1,600 customers, many of them are IT service providers, many of them providing the service component that they're putting together into the applications delivering into the future, and they want to be able to offer that to their end customers. And Digital is uniquely situated to be able to provide that value proposition where nobody else can."

I think during last earnings call, we have just come from a meeting with 1 of our top 5 customers, and the reception from us having a conversation with those C level of folks and talking to them about not competing with them and asking for their support and signing up for the partnership program and being actively involved in helping us pass lead back and forth and being through partners gives me a great deal of confidence. And then secondly, nothing brings confidence like pipeline, and especially in my particular world. And so the guys this year, in the first quarter, have already generated a $40.1 million and pipeline insight G&A to date. Now obviously, we don't close all of that pipeline, and we're starting small and learning and making sure we get it right, and we're growing the program as we may been before, added other programs in the reseller partners are program.

And we continue to see tremendous successes be that in [indiscernible] or 56 Marriott and Atlanta or Newark city trifecta. So I can't tell you 1 asset as kind of pulling far, far ahead in terms of percentage it from the orders. So we can a fairly broad-based. And then, your second question was about CapEx. I think it's really just timing-related and you can see from our AFFO reconciliation, if you take those last 3 line items before AFFO, there are some less than $26 million of recurring CapEx and commission to compensation for the quarter. If you multiply that by 4, that's like just 100-ish million dollars of recovering CapEx. And we have affirmed our guidance stable with north of $145 million for the full year.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. We had another very productive first quarter, characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. In particular, we deliberately advanced our global footprint during the quarter",1027,"Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. We had another very productive first quarter, characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. 
In particular, we deliberately advanced our global footprint during the quarter, the second of the 4 guiding principles that we laid out at our Investor Day last October and shown here on Page 2 of our earnings presentation. 
I'm very pleased to announce that we signed a multi-megawatt anchor lease with a hyperscale cloud service provider in Osaka, fully pre-leasing Phase 1 of our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month, and delivery is scheduled for the fourth quarter of next year. 
We also announced that we established a foothold in Germany with the acquisition of a land parcel in Frankfurt. We have begun the local entitlement process, and we expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first suite in the second half of next year, subject to market demand. 
As you may recall, Germany and Japan have been our top 2 target markets, and we're very pleased with our progress during the first quarter, particularly in a manner that is consistent with our overarching objective of delivering superior risk-adjusted returns. 
We also delivered solid current-period financial results. Andy will take you through the details in his prepared remarks, but the outperformance during the first quarter reflects consistent execution on the fourth objective here on Page 2, achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in both cash flow and value per share.
As we've explained, we've made a conscious decision not to go up the stack or compete with our customers or offer managed services nor do we intend to directly market to the broader array of enterprise customers and incur the overhead associated with building out the massive sales force necessary to target corporate enterprise directly. We aim instead to enable our partners to service enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide. 
Our partners and alliances program continue to build momentum during the first quarter, adding Sungard Availability services as a global partner. We are very excited about this partnership as it highlights our strategy of charging enterprise via our partners by combining our best-in-class infrastructure with our partners' best-in-class services. We are in discussions with several other parties about joining our partners and alliances program, and we've added more resources to the team to support the growth of the program. 
In terms of capital recycling, during the first quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California, to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $108 per square foot at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. We are still under contract on a national 4-property data center portfolio that we mentioned on our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. Due diligence is underway, and we expect to close within the next several months.
Let's now turn to market fundamentals. As you can see from the charts on Page 3, current construction activity, represented by the green bars, is most prevalent in Chicago, Dallas and Northern Virginia. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, absolute levels of supply should also be considered in context, which we provide here on Page 4. 
First of all, current construction pipelines are generally concentrated in top-tier national markets with high visibility on demand, and pre-leasing levels are healthy. In addition, market vacancy rates within these markets are in the single digits, and our own portfolios in these same markets are likewise north of 90% leased. These markets have also been characterized by robust levels of leasing activity. And in each case, the level of 2015 absorption represents a multiple of 2 to 3x the level of current supply. 
Within the context of our own portfolio, we have delivered 38 megawatts of new product into these 3 markets over the last 12 months, and our deliveries were over 94% leased on average. We would expect a similar level of leasing on our current crop of development projects upon delivery.
And now let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. Global economic growth has stabilized somewhat over the last 90 days although the rate of growth still remains subdued. Growth of total IT spending is likewise lackluster. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation or the price of oil, and even the growth of total IT spending paints an incomplete picture. We have the good fortune to be levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy as well as the broader IT industry. 
Current industry trends are very favorable to our core strategy. Rather than spending more, CIOs, chief information officers, are looking to stretch their IT dollar further. Narrowing the focus to core competencies is the order of the day, and outsourcing the corporate IT function is being embraced as the more efficient model. 
The rapid growth of cloud adoption is a reflection of these same trends. IDC estimates that by 2018, 65% of companies' IT assets are expected to be located off-site in colocation, hosting and cloud data centers, while 1/3 of IT staff are expected to be employees of third-party service providers. 
Similarly, IDC predicts that more than 80% of enterprise IT organizations will commit to hybrid cloud architectures by 2017. These hybrid architectures require a colocation presence as well as close proximity to multiple clouds. Along with our partners, we provide the trusted real estate foundation for these deployments. 
The major cloud service providers are rapidly building out their compute node footprint to meet this demand. With our global foundation of data center solutions, we are uniquely positioned to support this rapid growth as we are one of the very few providers with the ability to meet these large-scale requirements on a global basis. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."
11041860,329823972,966871,"Digital Realty Trust Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx here on Page 7. Telx generated $92 million of revenue during the first quarter, representing 10% growth year-over-year. Revenues remain split, roughly 50-50, between colocation and interconnection. From",1996,"Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx here on Page 7. Telx generated $92 million of revenue during the first quarter, representing 10% growth year-over-year. Revenues remain split, roughly 50-50, between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $38 million of cash EBITDA during the first quarter. Telx continues to perform at or slightly better than plan on all fronts, and we remain on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets. 
Over the past 90 days, the Telx team has been focused on a few key areas within the business. First is our customers where we continue to grow and expand our key communities and verticals within our Internet Gateways. Second is cash flow where we have been focused on the development of a commercial management team to drive additional revenue. Third is systems. We are in the process of integrating systems between the 2 organizations, which will include a combined customer portal. 
With respect to expanding our customer base and nurturing our colocation ecosystem, we have emphasized the continued development of target verticals and communities. During the first quarter, Telx added 35 new logos, a 30% uptick from the number of new logos added during the prior quarter. 
In addition to our focus on cloud service providers, we continue to see growth within our Internet Gateways in areas such as content, wireless and mobility services, undersea cable systems and many other verticals that drive connectivity growth. 
We have been successful in enhancing the appeal of our facilities by attracting numerous undersea cable systems. We announced the FASTER and Aqua Comms cable systems last year, and we plan to announce the signing of an additional underseas cable system within the next few weeks. We expect these efforts to continue to drive interconnection growth and offer our customer base continued diversity and global connectivity options from within our facilities. 
With regard to the commercial management team, we have been very focused on revenue optimization to ensure accurate and timely billing and collection for space, power and connectivity within our facilities. This team has increased its focus on pursuing contractual annual REIT increases from our colocation customers while within their term. And we are working to consolidate legacy contractual agreements across our data center platform. 
With respect to systems, we identified our target IT architecture during the first quarter, and we are working quickly to consolidate these platforms. But we want to be sure that we deliver a seamless customer experience before introducing additional complexity to our systems landscape. We're making solid headway, and we expect this effort to continue as a top priority for the next few quarters. 
Finally, we recognize that our customer portal is one of the top drivers for improving customer satisfaction to our over 1,600 customers. Telx introduced a world-class portal over 4 years ago to improve service capabilities to drive revenue as well as functionality, allowing customers to easily discover and connect to each other. We believe the self-service storefront capabilities in this system marketplace will help retain existing customers while growing the installed base, with new entrants seeking to benefit from this developing ecosystem. 
We hope many of you will be able to attend Marketplace Live in New York City on September 22, where we plan to unveil several new additions and upgrades to the portal. 
In summary, while integration is still underway, we remain pleased with the progress and the performance to date.
Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed new leases totaling $39 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $8 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the first quarter. 
Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for approximately 80% of our leases signed during the quarter, and over 90% was repeat business with existing customers. The combined organization added a total of 41 new logos during the quarter.
The weighted average lag between signings and commencements was 8 months, driven primarily by the pre-lease Bill alluded to on our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month, and delivery is scheduled for next fall. Excluding the new build in Osaka, the lag between signing and commencements was 5 months, in line with our customary activity. 
As shown on Page 9, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced now stands at $90 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence this year. I would also like to point out here on Page 9 that in response to feedback from analysts and investors, we have provided a bridge to reconcile the prior quarter backlog to the $90 million current backlog.
Turning to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed a little over $50 million of lease renewals during the first quarter, in addition to new leases signed. The average cash re-leasing spread was up 2%, with a positive cash mark-to-market on turnkey and colocation renewals, weighed down a bit by a modest cash rent rolldown on a relatively small sample size of PBB renewals during the first quarter. 
As mentioned on previous calls, we do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Phoenix and in pockets of our East Coast portfolio, and we expect a couple of those to hit during the second quarter, which will likely result in a cash rent rolldown during the second quarter. We expect to see positive cash re-leasing spreads in the second half of the year. And for the full year, we still expect to be roughly flat on a cash basis and up in the high single digits on a GAAP basis. 
In general, we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and the steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations.
Turning to our financial results on Page 11. We reported 1Q '16 core FFO per share of $1.42, $0.07 ahead of consensus estimates. Several of the initiatives we outlined in our Investor Day, designed to drive additional cash flow from our properties and leverage our scale to achieving operating efficiencies, are beginning to bear fruit. And the upside during the first quarter was driven by operating outperformance as well as interest savings. Specifically, $0.01 was due to outperformance from the Digital Realty portfolio, another $0.01 was due to the Telx outperformance during the quarter, $0.02 were due to lower-than-expected overhead, and lastly, interest expense was $0.03 later than expected due primarily to the timing and the pricing achieved on the term loan in January and the eurobond in April. 
AFFO per share was likewise well ahead of plan, partially driven by the FFO line, along with a further reduction in straight-line rental revenue. 
Recurring CapEx was also down significantly although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending, and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up over the course of the year.
As you may have seen from the press release, we raised our core FFO per share guidance from $5.45 to $5.60 to a range of $5.55 to $5.65. We raised the projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points, again reflecting the benefit of the operating efficiencies we've been able to achieve. This is reflected on the G&A line as well as the property level. And we raised both ends of the range for our 2016 same-capital cash NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points, from 0 to 3% to 1% to 4% or roughly 2% to 5% on a constant currency basis. 
Finally, interest rates on the term loan as well as the eurobond both came in tighter than expected. And we have revised our financings assumptions to reflect the actual capital raise to date. The forecast does still include a potential $300 million to $400 million bond offering later this year. 
FX represented a roughly 100 to 150 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown here on Page 12. Although foreign currency headwinds are abating somewhat, the U.K. represents our largest concentration outside the U.S. The dollar is currently stronger compared to 2015 average sterling exchange rate, and our 2016 outlook contemplates a continued drag of similar magnitude for the remainder of the year. 
I would like to remind you that we manage currency risk by issuing a locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
I would also like to point out that we completed our inaugural eurobond offering in early April. We raised EUR 600 million, further enhancing our natural hedge and reducing our non-U.S. dollar-denominated net asset exposure to less than 10%. 
Finally, I would like to point out that while our global footprint exposes us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe represents a key competitive advantage.
In terms of our first quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy slipped 10 basis points sequentially. Same-capital cash NOI was up 4.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would have been up approximately 5%. 
I would like to -- I would also like to remind everyone that our 2016 same-store presentation is somewhat theoretical since we have elected to report same-capital results for 2016 as if our leases with Telx were still in place given that Telx was previously a customer in 11 of our properties, most of which are Internet Gateways that comprise a huge chunk of our stabilized portfolio.
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 13. As previously announced, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities in January. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than 2 years and upsize our term loan facilities by $550 million, including $300 million of 7-year paper. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, the refinancing effectively clears the left-hand side of the maturity schedule. We have just under $300 million or less than 5% of total debt coming due before 2020. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we priced our inaugural $600 million eurobond offering at a 2.625% coupon in early April. Just to be clear, since it may not have been for everyone, 2 5/8 was the all-in pricing, not just the spread. We were fortunate to price within 1 basis point of the all-time low in the benchmark 8-year mid-swaps rate, and needless to say, we were pleased with the execution. 
We presented the pro forma impact of the eurobond issuance here on Page 14 of the presentation. And as you can see, the 8-year term fit perfectly in the one open slot in our debt maturity ladder in 2024. Proceeds were used to refinance and term out borrowings on the line of credit, and the current balance on the line is less than $100 million, with over $1.9 billion of availability. Floating-rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding.
In addition, as you can see from the callout box on the left-hand side of the chart, the weighted average debt maturity is now 6.8 years, 2 full years longer than the weighted average maturity as of the end of 1Q '15. Terming out over $1 billion of long-term debt does have a dilutive earnings impact, but we believe locking in long-term fixed-rate financing from a new source of institutional capital providers is prudent financial management. Consistent with our financial strategy, we are maintaining our balance sheet well positioned for new investment opportunities. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Amy, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

But this is not -- haven't -- we haven't really seen a spike in overall leasing volume from you guys, yet you do have some availability and obviously a sizable global footprint.

And with regard to the quarter, of course, my team, my global team is very pleased with our most recent quarter coming in around a $40 million design is kind of as you mentioned, not to mention the welcome revenue contribution of $8 million coming from our interconnection business. It is important to remember when we talk about the current leasing environment out in the industry that we aren't really new to this hyperscale cloud game. In fact, while we talked in the opening remarks about the one deal that was an anchor in Osaka, we've done more deals in Q1 with hyperscale cloud providers as well. And we've been addressing this demand for more than a few years now successfully. And during that time period as well as Q1, we captured multiple multi-megawatt requirements from various, not just one but various hyperscale cloud service providers around the world. And from our perspective, these requirements may be a little less conspicuous in our quarterly leasing results given the diverse nature of what has become a consistent $30 million to $40 million contribution of quarter leasing activities. So for instance, this quarter, Jordan, about 30% of our signings came from the top 3 cloud service providers, about an additional 20% came from targeted cloud providers outside of those top 3, and then a bit more than 30% came from our diversified stack of social, mobile, analytic, cloud and content accounts. It's important that we keep in mind that in addition to our quarterly wins here in the U.S., we're also successfully landing requirements in our target global markets, not simply in Japan, in London as well, which tend to be comparatively bluer oceans, where our publicly traded domestic data center REIT peers may not have a dominant presence. And the final piece of my response would be that my team, as you know, remains intently committed to strong leasing fundamentals beneficial to shareholders while we keep our eye on driving this growing hyperscale demand."

Great question. And there was a good deal of leasing in particular in one of our markets in the Central Region, one of our great campuses in Chicago, where it was power -- we'll call it power enhancement but basically driving additional density into the floor space that's already taken by an individual customer. We think these are fantastic wins for us. From an economic perspective, they're fantastic for us. From a power perspective, they're very good for us. Even from a relationship with the utilities that we do business with, it increases the utilization of the power that's committed by those individual utilities. And we do see density plays continue to play out throughout our portfolio where we can increase the stickiness of those individual customers in our facilities by bringing them additional power. It's also a great signal that our customers are doing well. In this case, this customer is doing extremely well and is taking power at a rate that we didn't anticipate, but it actually ended up helping a great deal."

The one point I would clarify though is while we have $540 million of remaining spend for these projects, that -- some of these it will pre-leased, over half of it actually, and some of it is speculative. We're actually only contractually committed to fill -- finish roughly $380 million of that. So if the music did stop and we -- there was oversupply delivered to any market that represent like 0.3 turns of debt to EBITDA, so our balance sheet leverage will still be in check.

A number of them have had advanced plans and is meets with their advance planning. A number of them have seen a radical shift in terms of the demand coming to them. And so in their hot markets, which happen to line up with some of our hot markets, they want to occupy as much space and power as they can because they know that they will burn through it and utilize it. So it really does depend. I would say about half and half amongst the cloud providers in terms of the current large amount of deployments that they're going through to hit their current set of demand but also to make sure that they understand they can cover demand that they historically might have missed because they didn't have inventory in market."

In terms of the way our customers look at this, they still sort of look at it as having a foot in each of these markets and each of these buildings and each of these facilities that usually comes in the shape of at least one -- what we used to call POD, but one scale-oriented POD. Sometimes 2 scale-oriented PODs that they need in short order.

So if people exceed budgets in subsequent quarters are essentially using budget they didn't use in the first quarter and then the lower interest expense, I mean, that's a product of 2 things. The timing and -- of when we did our capital raises and actually our execution on the capital raises. But one thing I would caveat, it's not as simple as just taking the far-right bar and times it by 4 to get our full year number. The -- we do have some items that will reduce that full year number and offset our increases in revenue. One of those is that portfolio of data centers that we have under contract and to sell hopefully in the next month or so. That will obviously be diluted out of the gates when we sell $120-ish million of assets that are income-producing. And then the second item is we basically had a revolver balance at $600 million, $700 million for most of the quarter and then did a $600 million eurobond subsequent to quarter end, and that was a fixed-rate, 8-year piece of paper which is obviously good for the balance sheet, locks in long-dated FX hedged debt but is not as low as a floating rate revolver debt."

So I guess I ask almost the same question last quarter, but I'm still very interested and really understand about the progress. We keep getting another quarter under the belts of having both Telx and also the sort of large campus data centers and the interplay there, particularly in driving the cloud enterprise ecosystem. So I'd love to get a little perspective on how that's coming along. And I guess as a sort of sub-question there, Jarrett gave some good color, I think, in an earlier response about why the hyperscale guys are interested in your assets, given the ability to drive that connectivity there as well. But I'd be interested, I guess, sort of on the opposite side as to hear about the enterprises coming in to connect with the scale cloud guys. And you did call out the $7.5 million of incremental interconnection fee that you were able to book off of Telx this quarter. And it would be good to get some perspective. I don't know whether it was in the fourth quarter or what it might have looked like a year ago. But is this a number that was in acceleration, in line, et cetera?"

We -- as we previously mentioned on our prior call about our investor community approving a Telx expansion under our Ashburn campus. We've now started the presale activity, and we should have the doors open there come September. I think you can expect some additional new market expansion to unfold throughout the remainder of the year. On the West Coast, we've been fortunate enough to sign a subsea cable which we think will enhance our Telx -- the attractiveness of our Telx footprint and our entire footprint in that market. We're also looking at -- we're expanding our footprint in Atlanta, where we've been very successful, 56 Marietta. So, so far so good as it relates to Telx. Just -- not to jump around, but from a interconnection revenue line item, we're tracking year-over-year on just that revenue component, north of 10%. I think it was close to 11%. And then quarter-over-quarter, I think it's about 2-ish percent just for interconnection revenue. And then I'll turn it over to the team to answer, I think, your middle question."

Real quick on the first part of your question hopefully to give you a little color on what Andy said and some pretty concrete examples of where we see the combination really coming together quite impressively. We've been through a number of events where we bring both teams together to address customers. Start -- I would say it started very actively with PTC. We've got ITW coming up, and we've been in a number of events in between. And what's interesting is the reaction from our customers has been absolutely fantastic. So not only have they thanked us for coming together, for giving them, in essence, one throat to choke for all of their scale colo cross-connect and other services needs, but we've seen a number of them actually start to change their own individual organization structure to come to us in the same way that we're now coming to them all in one. So we've seen -- and I have now seen this last week, the fourth large cloud service provider make a decision to consolidate their network folks with their data center folks to make sure that they're coming to market the right way. So I don't know that -- I'm not claiming credit to that because of what we did, but I'm letting you know that it's landing pretty well, that Telx and large campus together. Let me get to the heart of what I think Andy turned it over to me for, but -- which is the -- why hyperscale is coming into Digital Realty in particular with our set of assets. There's a couple that Jarrett has talked about individually. One is, first of all, we get hyperscale. We've been doing hyperscale before someone fully turned it hyperscale. We've been doing large deployments, and we figured out how to make a fairly profitable business out of it from the beginning. So these folks are comfortable that we know what we're doing and that we've got the size and scale, no pun intended, to have a good counterparty on the other side of the transaction for their large compute node needs. But they also know that their customers need more than simply the ability to provide cloud services through 1 data center, 5 data centers throughout the world. They also need to have co-location availability so that those folks have the ability to land what they cannot put in the public cloud, cannot maybe put into a private cloud, would have to put into their enterprise class data center, and then they need connectivity to bring them all together. We just came from our client advisory board, and several of them came to us and said, ""We love the idea that we can now get this at one organization."" They're looking for ease. They're looking to take the complexity out of the IT transactions that they have in front of them, and we are able to act as that vehicle that takes that complexity away. I would say in the future, we've had some future-oriented conversations about where they're taking the business into the future with their platform-as-a-service offerings, and they're very interested in being involved with a company that has now 1,600 customers, many of them IT service providers, many of them providing the service component they're putting together into the applications they're delivering into the future, and they want to be able to offer that to their end customers. And Digital is uniquely situated to be able to provide that value proposition where nobody else can."

First of all, Bill and Andrew won't let me build out the sales force to address that potential demand, and I am happily compliant with not building it out. And just to be clear, right, it was -- it clearly is a differentiator between us and other folks in this industry. So it was not that we didn't have some trepidation in making the decision to address a large segment of the potential revenue in what amounts to an entirely different way for us as a company. So that was not without personal risk on my side but also just a little bit of risk on our side. But it's a great question. How do we feel confident that it's going? Two main components make me feel confident. And the first, it always starts with our customers. I think during last earnings call, we had just come from a meeting with 1 of our top 5 customers. And the reception from us having a conversation with those C-level folks and talking to them about not competing with them and asking for their support and signing up for the partnership program and being actively involved in helping us pass lead back and forth and being through partners gives me a great deal of confidence. And then secondly, nothing brings confidence like pipeline, especially in my particular world. And so the guys this year, in the first quarter, have already generated $40.1 million in pipeline inside P&A to date. Now obviously, we don't close all of that pipeline, and we're starting small and learning and making sure we get it right, and we're growing the program as even before, added another program to the reseller partnership program. This particular quarter, we'll continue doing that with some of our key partners moving forward. But nothing gives me peace of mind like having $40 million in pipe in a brand-new program."

So I can't tell you one asset has kind of pulled far, far ahead in terms of percent change from others, so it's been kind of fairly broad-based. And then your second question was about CapEx. I think it's really just timing-related and if -- you can see from our AFFO reconciliation, if you take those last 3 line items before AFFO, there are some less than $26 million of recurring CapEx and commissions and compensation for the quarter. If you multiply that by 4, that's like just 100-ish million dollars of recurring CapEx. And we have affirmed our guidance table with -- north of $145 million for the full year. So I think it's just a function of timing and didn't want anyone to think that, that lower number could be truly run rated throughout the rest of the year."

Andy will take you through the details in his prepared remarks, but the outperformance during the first quarter reflects consistent execution on the fourth objective here on Page 2, achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in both cash flow and value per share.
As we've explained, we've made a conscious decision not to go up the stack or compete with our customers or offer managed services, nor do we intend to directly market to the broader array of enterprise customers and incur the overhead associated with building out the massive sales force necessary to target corporate enterprise directly. We aim instead to enable our partners to service enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide. 
Our partners and alliances program continue to build momentum during the first quarter, adding Sungard Availability services as a global partner. We are very excited about this partnership as it highlights our strategy of targeting enterprise via our partners by combining our best-in-class infrastructure with our partners' best-in-class services. We are in discussions with several other parties about joining our partners and alliances program, and we've added more resources to the team to support the growth of the program. 
In terms of capital recycling, during the first quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California, to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $108 per square foot at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. We are still under contract on a national 4-property data center portfolio that we mentioned on our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. Due diligence is underway, and we expect to close within the next several months.
Let's now turn to market fundamentals. As you can see from the charts on Page 3, current construction activity, represented by the green bars, is most prevalent in Chicago, Dallas and Northern Virginia. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, absolute levels of supply should also be considered in context, which we provide here on Page 4. 
First of all, current construction pipelines are generally concentrated in top-tier national markets with high visibility on demand, and pre-leasing levels are healthy. In addition, market vacancy rates within these markets are in the single digits, and our own portfolios in these same markets are likewise north of 90% leased. These markets have also been characterized by robust levels of leasing activity. And in each case, the level of 2015 absorption represents a multiple of 2 to 3x the level of current supply. 
Within the context of our own portfolio, we have delivered 38 megawatts of new product into these 3 markets over the last 12 months, and our deliveries were over 94% leased on average. We would expect a similar level of leasing on our current crop of development projects upon delivery.
And now let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. Global economic growth has stabilized somewhat over the last 90 days although the rate of growth still remains subdued. Growth of total IT spending is likewise lackluster. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation or the price of oil, and even the growth of total IT spending paints an incomplete picture. We have the good fortune to be levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy as well as the broader IT industry. 
Current industry trends are very favorable to our core strategy. Rather than spending more, CIOs, chief information officers, are looking to stretch their IT dollar further. Narrowing the focus to core competencies is the order of the day, and outsourcing the corporate IT function is being embraced as the more efficient model. 
The rapid growth of cloud adoption is a reflection of these same trends. IDC estimates that by 2018, 65% of companies' IT assets are expected to be located off-site in colocation, hosting and cloud data centers, while 1/3 of IT staff are expected to be employees of third-party service providers. 
Similarly, IDC predicts that more than 80% of enterprise IT organizations will commit to hybrid cloud architectures by 2017. These hybrid architectures require a colocation presence as well as close proximity to multiple clouds. Along with our partners, we provide the trusted real estate foundation for these deployments. 
The major cloud service providers are rapidly building out their compute node footprint to meet this demand. With our global foundation of data center solutions, we are uniquely positioned to support this rapid growth as we are one of the very few providers with the ability to meet these large-scale requirements on a global basis. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."
11041860,329823972,966893,"Digital Realty Trust Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx here on Page 7. Telx generated $92 million of revenue during the first quarter, representing 10% growth year-over-year. Revenues remain split, roughly 50-50, between colocation and interconnection. From",1997,"Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx here on Page 7. Telx generated $92 million of revenue during the first quarter, representing 10% growth year-over-year. Revenues remain split, roughly 50-50, between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $38 million of cash EBITDA during the first quarter. Telx continues to perform at or slightly better than plan on all fronts, and we remain on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets. 
Over the past 90 days, the Telx team has been focused on a few key areas within the business. First is our customers where we continue to grow and expand our key communities and verticals within our Internet Gateways. Second is cash flow where we have been focused on the development of a commercial management team to drive additional revenue. Third is systems. We are in the process of integrating systems between the 2 organizations, which will include a combined customer portal. 
With respect to expanding our customer base and nurturing our colocation ecosystem, we have emphasized the continued development of target verticals and communities. During the first quarter, Telx added 35 new logos, a 30% uptick from the number of new logos added during the prior quarter. 
In addition to our focus on cloud service providers, we continue to see growth within our Internet Gateways in areas such as content, wireless and mobility services, undersea cable systems and many other verticals that drive connectivity growth. 
We have been successful in enhancing the appeal of our facilities by attracting numerous undersea cable systems. We announced the FASTER and Aqua Comms cable systems last year, and we plan to announce the signing of an additional underseas cable system within the next few weeks. We expect these efforts to continue to drive interconnection growth and offer our customer base continued diversity and global connectivity options from within our facilities. 
With regard to the commercial management team, we have been very focused on revenue optimization to ensure accurate and timely billing and collection for space, power and connectivity within our facilities. This team has increased its focus on pursuing contractual annual REIT increases from our colocation customers while within their term. And we are working to consolidate legacy contractual agreements across our data center platform. 
With respect to systems, we identified our target IT architecture during the first quarter, and we are working quickly to consolidate these platforms. But we want to be sure that we deliver a seamless customer experience before introducing additional complexity to our systems landscape. We're making solid headway, and we expect this effort to continue as a top priority for the next few quarters. 
Finally, we recognize that our customer portal is one of the top drivers for improving customer satisfaction to our over 1,600 customers. Telx introduced a world-class portal over 4 years ago to improve service capabilities to drive revenue as well as functionality, allowing customers to easily discover and connect to each other. We believe the self-service storefront capabilities in this system marketplace will help retain existing customers while growing the installed base, with new entrants seeking to benefit from this developing ecosystem. 
We hope many of you will be able to attend Marketplace Live in New York City on September 22, where we plan to unveil several new additions and upgrades to the portal. 
In summary, while integration is still underway, we remain pleased with the progress and the performance to date.
Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed new leases totaling $39 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $8 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the first quarter. 
Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for approximately 80% of our leases signed during the quarter, and over 90% was repeat business with existing customers. The combined organization added a total of 41 new logos during the quarter.
The weighted average lag between signings and commencements was 8 months, driven primarily by the pre-lease Bill alluded to on our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month, and delivery is scheduled for next fall. Excluding the new build in Osaka, the lag between signing and commencements was 5 months, in line with our customary activity. 
As shown on Page 9, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced now stands at $90 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence this year. I would also like to point out here on Page 9 that in response to feedback from analysts and investors, we have provided a bridge to reconcile the prior quarter backlog to the $90 million current backlog.
Turning to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed a little over $50 million of lease renewals during the first quarter, in addition to new leases signed. The average cash re-leasing spread was up 2%, with a positive cash mark-to-market on turnkey and colocation renewals weighed down a bit by a modest cash rent rolldown on a relatively small sample size of PBB renewals during the first quarter. 
As mentioned on previous calls, we do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Phoenix and in pockets of our East Coast portfolio, and we expect a couple of those to hit during the second quarter, which will likely result in a cash rent rolldown during the second quarter. We expect to see positive cash re-leasing spreads in the second half of the year. And for the full year, we still expect to be roughly flat on a cash basis and up in the high single digits on a GAAP basis. 
In general, we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and the steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations.
Turning to our financial results on Page 11. We reported 1Q '16 core FFO per share of $1.42, $0.07 ahead of consensus estimates. Several of the initiatives we outlined in our Investor Day, designed to drive additional cash flow from our properties and leverage our scale to achieving operating efficiencies are beginning to bear fruit. And the upside during the first quarter was driven by operating outperformance as well as interest savings. Specifically, $0.01 was due to outperformance from the Digital Realty portfolio, another $0.01 was due to the Telx outperformance during the quarter, $0.02 were due to lower-than-expected overhead, and lastly, interest expense was $0.03 lighter than expected due primarily to the timing and the pricing achieved on the term loan in January and the eurobond in April. 
AFFO per share was likewise well ahead of plan, partially driven by the FFO line, along with a further reduction in straight-line rental revenue. 
Recurring CapEx was also down significantly although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending, and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up over the course of the year.
As you may have seen from the press release, we raised our core FFO per share guidance from $5.45 to $5.60 to a range of $5.55 to $5.65. We raised the projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points, again reflecting the benefit of the operating efficiencies we've been able to achieve. This is reflected on the G&A line as well as the property level. And we raised both ends of the range for our 2016 same-capital cash NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points, from 0 to 3% to 1% to 4% or roughly 2% to 5% on a constant currency basis. 
Finally, interest rates on the term loan as well as the eurobond both came in tighter than expected. And we have revised our financings assumptions to reflect the actual capital raised to date. The forecast does still include a potential $300 million to $400 million bond offering later this year. 
FX represented a roughly 100 to 150 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown here on Page 12. Although foreign currency headwinds are abating somewhat, the U.K. represents our largest concentration outside the U.S. The dollar is currently stronger compared to the 2015 average sterling exchange rate, and our 2016 outlook contemplates a continued drag of similar magnitude for the remainder of the year. 
I would like to remind you that we manage currency risk by issuing a locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
I would also like to point out that we completed our inaugural eurobond offering in early April. We raised EUR 600 million, further enhancing our natural hedge and reducing our non-U.S. dollar-denominated net asset exposure to less than 10%. 
Finally, I would like to point out that while our global footprint exposes us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe represents a key competitive advantage.
In terms of our first quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy slipped 10 basis points sequentially. Same-capital cash NOI was up 4.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would have been up approximately 5%. 
I would like to -- I would also like to remind everyone that our 2016 same-store presentation is somewhat theoretical since we have elected to report same-capital results for 2016 as if our leases with Telx were still in place given that Telx was previously a customer in 11 of our properties, most of which are Internet Gateways that comprise a huge chunk of our stabilized portfolio.
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 13. As previously announced, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities in January. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than 2 years and upsize our term loan facilities by $550 million, including $300 million of 7-year paper. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, the refinancing effectively clears the left-hand side of the maturity schedule. We have just under $300 million or less than 5% of total debt coming due before 2020. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we priced our inaugural $600 million eurobond offering at a 2.625% coupon in early April. Just to be clear, since it may not have been for everyone, 2 5/8 was the all-in pricing, not just the spread. We were fortunate to price within 1 basis point of the all-time low in the benchmark 8-year mid-swaps rate, and needless to say, we were pleased with the execution. 
We presented the pro forma impact of the eurobond issuance here on Page 14 of the presentation. And as you can see, the 8-year term fit perfectly in the one open slot in our debt maturity ladder in 2024. Proceeds were used to refinance and term out borrowings on the line of credit, and the current balance on the line is less than $100 million, with over $1.9 billion of availability. Floating-rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding.
In addition, as you can see from the callout box on the left-hand side of the chart, the weighted average debt maturity is now 6.8 years, 2 full years longer than the weighted average maturity as of the end of 1Q '15. Terming out over $1 billion of long-term debt does have a dilutive earnings impact, but we believe locking in long-term fixed-rate financing from a new source of institutional capital providers is prudent financial management. Consistent with our financial strategy, we are maintaining our balance sheet well positioned for new investment opportunities. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Amy, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

I guess you announced one that sounds like will commence some time later next year in Osaka. But just curious overall, the trend has been for pretty significant leasing across the board amongst your peers. You guys had an above-average quarter relative to the last couple. But this is not -- haven't -- we haven't really seen a spike in overall leasing volume from you guys, yet you do have some availability and obviously a sizable global footprint.

And with regard to the quarter, of course, my team, my global team is very pleased with our most recent quarter coming in around a $40 million design kind of as you mentioned, not to mention the welcome revenue contribution of $8 million coming from our interconnection business. It is important to remember when we talk about the current leasing environment out in the industry that we aren't really new to this hyperscale cloud game. In fact, while we talked in the opening remarks about the one deal that was an anchor in Osaka, we've done more deals in Q1 with hyperscale cloud providers as well. And we've been addressing this demand for more than a few years now successfully. And during that time period as well as Q1, we captured multiple multi-megawatt requirements from various -- not just one but various hyperscale cloud service providers around the world. And from our perspective, these requirements may be a little less conspicuous in our quarterly leasing results given the diverse nature of what has become a consistent $30 million to $40 million contribution of quarter leasing activities. So for instance, this quarter, Jordan, about 30% of our signings came from the top 3 cloud service providers; about an additional 20% came from targeted cloud providers outside of those top 3, and then a bit more than 30% came from our diversified stack of social, mobile, analytic, cloud and content accounts. It's important that we keep in mind that in addition to our quarterly wins here in the U.S., we're also successfully landing requirements in our target global markets, not simply in Japan, in London as well, which tend to be comparatively bluer oceans, where our publicly traded domestic data center REIT peers may not have a dominant presence. And the final piece of my response would be that my team, as you know, remains intently committed to strong leasing fundamentals that are beneficial to shareholders while we keep our eye on driving this growing hyperscale demand."

In terms of total size of the pipeline, we haven't seen anything right now that's going to have a massive shift or increase in our pipeline. We still -- that's consistent amount of annual spend. The one point I would clarify though is while we have $540 million of remaining spend for these projects, that -- some of this is pre-leased, over half of it actually, and some of it is speculative. We're actually only contractually committed to fill -- finish roughly $380 million of that. So if the music did stop and we -- there was oversupply delivered to any market that would represent like 0.3 turns of debt to EBITDA, so our balance sheet leverage will still be in check. And as I mentioned before, we have $1.9 billion of availability on our revolver, so no crisis would ensue."

And it depends on which one of the hyperscale providers we're talking to and how far along they are in their planned execution, and then what type of visibility they have into their own demand. And that really is a little bit different from -- how do you say it, from cloud service provider to cloud service provider. A number of them have had advanced plans and this meets with their advance planning. A number of them have seen a radical shift in terms of the demand coming to them. And so in their hot markets, which happen to line up with some of our hot markets, they want to occupy as much space and power as they can because they know that they will burn through it and utilize it. So it really does depend. I would say about half and half amongst the cloud providers in terms of the current large amount of deployments that they're going through to hit their current set of demand but also to make sure that they understand they can cover demand that they historically might have missed because they didn't have inventory in market."

I'll talk about what our customers need, and I'll turn it over to Jarrett to talk about the production sizes and the production capabilities that we have. In terms of the way our customers look at this, they still sort of look at it as having a foot in each of these markets and each of these buildings, each of these facilities that usually comes in the shape of at least one -- what we used to call POD, but one scale-oriented POD. Sometimes 2 scale-oriented PODs that they need in short order. One is generally the size that they need up front, and then they need to have visibility so that they're not going to outgrow their needs and they're not going to outgrow the colo needs that they know their customers are going to need in the hybrid cloud environment.

The -- I would say that most of these are flow-through to the rest of the year. So the Digital Realty NOI, Telx EBITDA, G&A, there may be some timing elements to it because part of that's non-comp-related travel consulting fees like that. So if a bunch of people exceed budgets in subsequent quarters, they're essentially using budget they didn't use in the first quarter. And then the lower interest expense, I mean, that's a product of 2 things, the timing and -- of when we did our capital raises and actually our execution on the capital raises. But one thing I would caveat, it's not as simple as just taking the far-right bar and times it by 4 to get our full year number. The -- we do have some items that will reduce that full year number and offset our increases in revenue. One of those is that portfolio of data centers that we have under contract and to sell hopefully in the next month or so. That will obviously be diluted out of the gates when we sell $120-ish million of assets that are income-producing. And then the second item is we basically had a revolver balance at $600 million, $700 million for most of the quarter and then did a $600 million eurobond subsequent to quarter end, and that was a fixed-rate, 8-year piece of paper which is obviously good for the balance sheet, locks in long-dated FX hedged debt but is not as low as a floating rate revolver debt."

So we've seen -- and I have now seen this last week, the fourth large cloud service provider make a decision to consolidate their network folks with their data center folks to make sure that they're coming to market the right way. So I don't know that -- I'm not claiming credit that, that's because of what we did, but I'm letting you know that it's landing pretty well, that Telx and large campus together. Let me get to the heart of what I think Andy turned it over to me for, but -- which is the -- why hyperscale is coming into Digital Realty in particular with our set of assets. There's a couple that Jarrett has talked about individually. One is, first of all, we get hyperscale. We've been doing hyperscale before someone coolly termed it hyperscale. We've been doing large deployments, and we figured out how to make a fairly profitable business out of it from the beginning. So these folks are comfortable that we know what we're doing and that we've got the size and scale, no pun intended, to have a good counterparty on the other side of the transaction for their large compute node needs. But they also know that their customers need more than simply the ability to provide cloud services through 1 data center, 5 data centers throughout the world. They also need to have co-location availability so that those folks have the ability to land what they cannot put in the public cloud, cannot maybe put into a private cloud, would have to put into their enterprise class data center, and then they need connectivity to bring them all together. We just came from our client advisory board, and several of them came to us and said, ""We love the idea that we can now get this at one organization."" They're looking for ease. They're looking to take the complexity out of the IT transactions that they have in front of them, and we are able to act as that vehicle that takes that complexity away. I would say in the future, we've had some future-oriented conversations about where they're taking the business into the future with their platform-as-a-service offerings, and they're very interested in being involved with a company that has now 1,600 customers, many of them IT service providers, many of them providing the service component they're putting together into the applications they're delivering into the future, and they want to be able to offer that to their end customers. And Digital is uniquely situated to be able to provide that value proposition where nobody else can."

First of all, Bill and Andrew won't let me build out the sales force to address that potential demand, and I am happily compliant with not building it out. And just to be clear, right, it was -- it clearly is a differentiator between us and other folks in this industry. So it was not that we didn't have some trepidation in making the decision to address a large segment of the potential revenue in what amounts to an entirely different way for us as a company. So that was not without personal risk on my side but also just a little bit of risk on our side. But it's a great question. How do we feel confident that it's going? Two main components make me feel confident. And the first, it always starts with our customers. I think during last earnings call, we had just come from a meeting with 1 of our top 5 customers. And the reception from us having a conversation with those C-level folks and talking to them about not competing with them and asking for their support and signing up for the partnership program and being actively involved in helping us pass leads back and forth and being true partners gives me a great deal of confidence. And then secondly, nothing brings confidence like pipeline, especially in my particular world. And so the guys this year, in the first quarter, have already generated $40.1 million in pipeline inside P&A to date. Now obviously, we don't close all of that pipeline, and we're starting small and learning and making sure we get it right, and we're growing the program as we move forward, added another program to the reseller partnership program. This particular quarter, we'll continue doing that with some of our key partners moving forward. But nothing gives me peace of mind like having $40 million in pipe in a brand-new program."

I know we see a lot of demand pointed at our Telx location in Santa Clara, and we continue to see tremendous successes, be it at Cermak or 56 Marietta in Atlanta or in the New York City trifecta. So I can't tell you one asset has kind of pulled far, far ahead in terms of percent change from others, so it's been kind of fairly broad-based. And then your second question was about CapEx. I think it's really just timing-related and if -- you can see from our AFFO reconciliation, if you take those last 3 line items before AFFO, there's some less than $26 million of recurring CapEx and commissions and compensation for the quarter. If you multiply that by 4, that's like just 100-ish million dollars of recurring CapEx. And we have affirmed our guidance table with -- north of $145 million for the full year. So I think it's just a function of timing and I didn't want anyone to think that, that lower number could be truly run rated throughout the rest of the year."

We had another very productive first quarter, characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. 
In particular, we deliberately advanced our global footprint during the quarter, the second of the 4 guiding principles that we laid out at our Investor Day last October and shown here on Page 2 of our earnings presentation. 
I'm very pleased to announce that we signed a multi-megawatt anchor lease with a hyperscale cloud service provider in Osaka, fully pre-leasing Phase 1 of our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month, and delivery is scheduled for the fourth quarter of next year. 
We also announced that we established a foothold in Germany with the acquisition of a land parcel in Frankfurt. We have begun the local entitlement process, and we expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first suite in the second half of next year, subject to market demand. 
As you may recall, Germany and Japan have been our top 2 target markets, and we're very pleased with our progress during the first quarter, particularly in a manner that is consistent with our overarching objective of delivering superior risk-adjusted returns. 
We also delivered solid current-period financial results. Andy will take you through the details in his prepared remarks, but the outperformance during the first quarter reflects consistent execution on the fourth objective here on Page 2, achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in both cash flow and value per share.
As we've explained, we've made a conscious decision not to go up the stack or compete with our customers or offer managed services, nor do we intend to directly market to the broader array of enterprise customers and incur the overhead associated with building out the massive sales force necessary to target corporate enterprise directly. We aim instead to enable our partners to service enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide. 
Our partners and alliances program continue to build momentum during the first quarter, adding Sungard Availability services as a global partner. We are very excited about this partnership as it highlights our strategy of targeting enterprise via our partners by combining our best-in-class infrastructure with our partners' best-in-class services. We are in discussions with several other parties about joining our partners and alliances program, and we've added more resources to the team to support the growth of the program. 
In terms of capital recycling, during the first quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California, to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $108 per square foot at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. We are still under contract on a national 4-property data center portfolio that we mentioned on our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. Due diligence is underway, and we expect to close within the next several months.
Let's now turn to market fundamentals. As you can see from the charts on Page 3, current construction activity, represented by the green bars, is most prevalent in Chicago, Dallas and Northern Virginia. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, absolute levels of supply should also be considered in context, which we provide here on Page 4. 
First of all, current construction pipelines are generally concentrated in top-tier national markets with high visibility on demand, and pre-leasing levels are healthy. In addition, market vacancy rates within these markets are in the single digits, and our own portfolios in these same markets are likewise north of 90% leased. These markets have also been characterized by robust levels of leasing activity. And in each case, the level of 2015 absorption represents a multiple of 2 to 3x the level of current supply. 
Within the context of our own portfolio, we have delivered 38 megawatts of new product into these 3 markets over the last 12 months, and our deliveries were over 94% leased on average. We would expect a similar level of leasing on our current crop of development projects upon delivery.
And now let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. Global economic growth has stabilized somewhat over the last 90 days although the rate of growth still remains subdued. Growth of total IT spending is likewise lackluster. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation or the price of oil, and even the growth of total IT spending paints an incomplete picture. We have the good fortune to be levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy as well as the broader IT industry. 
Current industry trends are very favorable to our core strategy. Rather than spending more, CIOs, chief information officers, are looking to stretch their IT dollar further. Narrowing the focus to core competencies is the order of the day, and outsourcing the corporate IT function is being embraced as the more efficient model. 
The rapid growth of cloud adoption is a reflection of these same trends. IDC estimates that by 2018, 65% of companies' IT assets are expected to be located off-site in colocation, hosting and cloud data centers, while 1/3 of IT staff are expected to be employees of third-party service providers. 
Similarly, IDC predicts that more than 80% of enterprise IT organizations will commit to hybrid cloud architectures by 2017. These hybrid architectures require a colocation presence as well as close proximity to multiple clouds. Along with our partners, we provide the trusted real estate foundation for these deployments. 
The major cloud service providers are rapidly building out their compute node footprint to meet this demand. With our global foundation of data center solutions, we are uniquely positioned to support this rapid growth as we are one of the very few providers with the ability to meet these large-scale requirements on a global basis. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results."

First is our customers where we continue to grow and expand our key communities and verticals within our Internet Gateways. Second is cash flow where we have been focused on the development of a commercial management team to drive additional revenue. Third is systems. We are in the process of integrating systems between the 2 organizations, which will include a combined customer portal. 
With respect to expanding our customer base and nurturing our colocation ecosystem, we have emphasized the continued development of target verticals and communities. During the first quarter, Telx added 35 new logos, a 30% uptick from the number of new logos added during the prior quarter. 
In addition to our focus on cloud service providers, we continue to see growth within our Internet Gateways in areas such as content, wireless and mobility services, undersea cable systems and many other verticals that drive connectivity growth. 
We have been successful in enhancing the appeal of our facilities by attracting numerous undersea cable systems. We announced the FASTER and Aqua Comms cable systems last year, and we plan to announce the signing of an additional underseas cable system within the next few weeks. We expect these efforts to continue to drive interconnection growth and offer our customer base continued diversity and global connectivity options from within our facilities. 
With regard to the commercial management team, we have been very focused on revenue optimization to ensure accurate and timely billing and collection for space, power and connectivity within our facilities. This team has increased its focus on pursuing contractual annual REIT increases from our colocation customers while within their term. And we are working to consolidate legacy contractual agreements across our data center platform. 
With respect to systems, we identified our target IT architecture during the first quarter, and we are working quickly to consolidate these platforms. But we want to be sure that we deliver a seamless customer experience before introducing additional complexity to our systems landscape. We're making solid headway, and we expect this effort to continue as a top priority for the next few quarters. 
Finally, we recognize that our customer portal is one of the top drivers for improving customer satisfaction to our over 1,600 customers. Telx introduced a world-class portal over 4 years ago to improve service capabilities to drive revenue as well as functionality, allowing customers to easily discover and connect to each other. We believe the self-service storefront capabilities in this system marketplace will help retain existing customers while growing the installed base, with new entrants seeking to benefit from this developing ecosystem. 
We hope many of you will be able to attend Marketplace Live in New York City on September 22, where we plan to unveil several new additions and upgrades to the portal. 
In summary, while integration is still underway, we remain pleased with the progress and the performance to date.
Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed new leases totaling $39 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $8 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the first quarter. 
Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for approximately 80% of our leases signed during the quarter, and over 90% was repeat business with existing customers. The combined organization added a total of 41 new logos during the quarter.
The weighted average lag between signings and commencements was 8 months, driven primarily by the pre-lease Bill alluded to on our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month, and delivery is scheduled for next fall. Excluding the new build in Osaka, the lag between signing and commencements was 5 months, in line with our customary activity. 
As shown on Page 9, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced now stands at $90 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence this year. I would also like to point out here on Page 9 that in response to feedback from analysts and investors, we have provided a bridge to reconcile the prior quarter backlog to the $90 million current backlog.
Turning to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed a little over $50 million of lease renewals during the first quarter, in addition to new leases signed. The average cash re-leasing spread was up 2%, with a positive cash mark-to-market on turnkey and colocation renewals weighed down a bit by a modest cash rent rolldown on a relatively small sample size of PBB renewals during the first quarter. 
As mentioned on previous calls, we do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Phoenix and in pockets of our East Coast portfolio, and we expect a couple of those to hit during the second quarter, which will likely result in a cash rent rolldown during the second quarter. We expect to see positive cash re-leasing spreads in the second half of the year. And for the full year, we still expect to be roughly flat on a cash basis and up in the high single digits on a GAAP basis. 
In general, we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and the steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations.
Turning to our financial results on Page 11. We reported 1Q '16 core FFO per share of $1.42, $0.07 ahead of consensus estimates. Several of the initiatives we outlined in our Investor Day, designed to drive additional cash flow from our properties and leverage our scale to achieving operating efficiencies are beginning to bear fruit. And the upside during the first quarter was driven by operating outperformance as well as interest savings. Specifically, $0.01 was due to outperformance from the Digital Realty portfolio, another $0.01 was due to the Telx outperformance during the quarter, $0.02 were due to lower-than-expected overhead, and lastly, interest expense was $0.03 lighter than expected due primarily to the timing and the pricing achieved on the term loan in January and the eurobond in April. 
AFFO per share was likewise well ahead of plan, partially driven by the FFO line, along with a further reduction in straight-line rental revenue. 
Recurring CapEx was also down significantly although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending, and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up over the course of the year.
As you may have seen from the press release, we raised our core FFO per share guidance from $5.45 to $5.60 to a range of $5.55 to $5.65. We raised the projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points, again reflecting the benefit of the operating efficiencies we've been able to achieve. This is reflected on the G&A line as well as the property level. And we raised both ends of the range for our 2016 same-capital cash NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points, from 0 to 3% to 1% to 4% or roughly 2% to 5% on a constant currency basis. 
Finally, interest rates on the term loan as well as the eurobond both came in tighter than expected. And we have revised our financings assumptions to reflect the actual capital raised to date. The forecast does still include a potential $300 million to $400 million bond offering later this year. 
FX represented a roughly 100 to 150 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown here on Page 12. Although foreign currency headwinds are abating somewhat, the U.K. represents our largest concentration outside the U.S. The dollar is currently stronger compared to the 2015 average sterling exchange rate, and our 2016 outlook contemplates a continued drag of similar magnitude for the remainder of the year. 
I would like to remind you that we manage currency risk by issuing a locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
I would also like to point out that we completed our inaugural eurobond offering in early April. We raised EUR 600 million, further enhancing our natural hedge and reducing our non-U.S. dollar-denominated net asset exposure to less than 10%. 
Finally, I would like to point out that while our global footprint exposes us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe represents a key competitive advantage.
In terms of our first quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy slipped 10 basis points sequentially. Same-capital cash NOI was up 4.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would have been up approximately 5%. 
I would like to -- I would also like to remind everyone that our 2016 same-store presentation is somewhat theoretical since we have elected to report same-capital results for 2016 as if our leases with Telx were still in place given that Telx was previously a customer in 11 of our properties, most of which are Internet Gateways that comprise a huge chunk of our stabilized portfolio.
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 13. As previously announced, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities in January. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than 2 years and upsize our term loan facilities by $550 million, including $300 million of 7-year paper. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, the refinancing effectively clears the left-hand side of the maturity schedule. We have just under $300 million or less than 5% of total debt coming due before 2020. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we priced our inaugural $600 million eurobond offering at a 2.625% coupon in early April. Just to be clear, since it may not have been for everyone, 2 5/8 was the all-in pricing, not just the spread. We were fortunate to price within 1 basis point of the all-time low in the benchmark 8-year mid-swaps rate, and needless to say, we were pleased with the execution. 
We presented the pro forma impact of the eurobond issuance here on Page 14 of the presentation. And as you can see, the 8-year term fit perfectly in the one open slot in our debt maturity ladder in 2024. Proceeds were used to refinance and term out borrowings on the line of credit, and the current balance on the line is less than $100 million, with over $1.9 billion of availability. Floating-rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding.
In addition, as you can see from the callout box on the left-hand side of the chart, the weighted average debt maturity is now 6.8 years, 2 full years longer than the weighted average maturity as of the end of 1Q '15. Terming out over $1 billion of long-term debt does have a dilutive earnings impact, but we believe locking in long-term fixed-rate financing from a new source of institutional capital providers is prudent financial management. Consistent with our financial strategy, we are maintaining our balance sheet well positioned for new investment opportunities. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Amy, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

But this is not -- haven't -- we haven't really seen a spike in overall leasing volume from you guys, yet you do have some availability and obviously a sizable global footprint.

And with regard to the quarter, of course, my team, my global team is very pleased with our most recent quarter coming in around a $40 million design kind of as you mentioned, not to mention the welcome revenue contribution of $8 million coming from our interconnection business. It is important to remember when we talk about the current leasing environment out in the industry that we aren't really new to this hyperscale cloud game. In fact, while we talked in the opening remarks about the one deal that was an anchor in Osaka, we've done more deals in Q1 with hyperscale cloud providers as well. And we've been addressing this demand for more than a few years now successfully. And during that time period as well as Q1, we captured multiple multi-megawatt requirements from various -- not just one but various hyperscale cloud service providers around the world. And from our perspective, these requirements may be a little less conspicuous in our quarterly leasing results given the diverse nature of what has become a consistent $30 million to $40 million contribution of quarter leasing activities. So for instance, this quarter, Jordan, about 30% of our signings came from the top 3 cloud service providers; about an additional 20% came from targeted cloud providers outside of those top 3, and then a bit more than 30% came from our diversified stack of social, mobile, analytic, cloud and content accounts. It's important that we keep in mind that in addition to our quarterly wins here in the U.S., we're also successfully landing requirements in our target global markets, not simply in Japan, in London as well, which tend to be comparatively bluer oceans, where our publicly traded domestic data center REIT peers may not have a dominant presence. And the final piece of my response would be that my team, as you know, remains intently committed to strong leasing fundamentals that are beneficial to shareholders while we keep our eye on driving this growing hyperscale demand."

The one point I would clarify though is while we have $540 million of remaining spend for these projects, that -- some of this is pre-leased, over half of it actually, and some of it is speculative. We're actually only contractually committed to fill -- finish roughly $380 million of that. So if the music did stop and we -- there was oversupply delivered to any market that would represent like 0.3 turns of debt to EBITDA, so our balance sheet leverage will still be in check.

A number of them have had advanced plans and this meets with their advance planning. A number of them have seen a radical shift in terms of the demand coming to them. And so in their hot markets, which happen to line up with some of our hot markets, they want to occupy as much space and power as they can because they know that they will burn through it and utilize it. So it really does depend. I would say about half and half amongst the cloud providers in terms of the current large amount of deployments that they're going through to hit their current set of demand but also to make sure that they understand they can cover demand that they historically might have missed because they didn't have inventory in market."

So while they may have hit a gap with their own builds, they all have sort of come to the realization that leasing is something that they need to not just explore, but execute on. Jarrett?"

I'll talk about what our customers need, and I'll turn it over to Jarrett to talk about the production sizes and the production capabilities that we have. In terms of the way our customers look at this, they still sort of look at it as having a foot in each of these markets and each of these buildings, each of these facilities that usually comes in the shape of at least one -- what we used to call POD, but one scale-oriented POD. Sometimes 2 scale-oriented PODs that they need in short order. One is generally the size that they need up front, and then they need to have visibility so that they're not going to outgrow their needs and they're not going to outgrow the colo needs that they know their customers are going to need in the hybrid cloud environment.

So the $135 million was roughly around our internal projections. So we're right in line, so we weren't trying to -- these step functions kind of mirror what our internal results look like. The -- I would say that most of these are flow-through to the rest of the year. So the Digital Realty NOI, Telx EBITDA, G&A, there may be some timing elements to it because part of that's non-comp-related travel consulting fees like that. So if a bunch of people exceed budgets in subsequent quarters, they're essentially using budget they didn't use in the first quarter. And then the lower interest expense, I mean, that's a product of 2 things, the timing and -- of when we did our capital raises and actually our execution on the capital raises. But one thing I would caveat, it's not as simple as just taking the far-right bar and times it by 4 to get our full year number. The -- we do have some items that will reduce that full year number and offset our increases in revenue. One of those is that portfolio of data centers that we have under contract and to sell hopefully in the next month or so. That will obviously be diluted out of the gates when we sell $120-ish million of assets that are income-producing. And then the second item is we basically had a revolver balance at $600 million, $700 million for most of the quarter and then did a $600 million eurobond subsequent to quarter end, and that was a fixed-rate, 8-year piece of paper which is obviously good for the balance sheet, locks in long-dated FX hedged debt but is not as low as a floating rate revolver debt."

Real quick on the first part of your question hopefully to give you a little color on what Andy said and some pretty concrete examples of where we see the combination really coming together quite impressively. We've been through a number of events where we bring both teams together to address customers. Start -- I would say it started very actively with PTC. We've got ITW coming up, and we've been at a number of events in between. And what's interesting is the reaction from our customers has been absolutely fantastic. So not only have they thanked us for coming together, for giving them, in essence, one throat to choke for all of their scale colo cross-connect and other services needs, but we've seen a number of them actually start to change their own individual organization structure to come to us in the same way that we're now coming to them, all in one. So we've seen -- and I have now seen this last week, the fourth large cloud service provider make a decision to consolidate their network folks with their data center folks to make sure that they're coming to market the right way. So I don't know that -- I'm not claiming credit that, that's because of what we did, but I'm letting you know that it's landing pretty well, that Telx and large campus together. Let me get to the heart of what I think Andy turned it over to me for, but -- which is the -- why hyperscale is coming into Digital Realty in particular with our set of assets. There's a couple that Jarrett has talked about individually. One is, first of all, we get hyperscale. We've been doing hyperscale before someone coolly termed it hyperscale. We've been doing large deployments, and we figured out how to make a fairly profitable business out of it from the beginning. So these folks are comfortable that we know what we're doing and that we've got the size and scale, no pun intended, to have a good counterparty on the other side of the transaction for their large compute node needs. But they also know that their customers need more than simply the ability to provide cloud services through 1 data center, 5 data centers throughout the world. They also need to have co-location availability so that those folks have the ability to land what they cannot put in the public cloud, cannot maybe put into a private cloud, would have to put into their enterprise class data center, and then they need connectivity to bring them all together. We just came from our client advisory board, and several of them came to us and said, ""We love the idea that we can now get this at one organization."" They're looking for ease. They're looking to take the complexity out of the IT transactions that they have in front of them, and we are able to act as that vehicle that takes that complexity away. I would say in the future, we've had some future-oriented conversations about where they're taking the business into the future with their platform-as-a-service offerings, and they're very interested in being involved with a company that has now 1,600 customers, many of them IT service providers, many of them providing the service component they're putting together into the applications they're delivering into the future, and they want to be able to offer that to their end customers. And Digital is uniquely situated to be able to provide that value proposition where nobody else can."

And then the last part of the development question, the cost went up $10 million on Singapore and you delayed it a quarter. Can you just comment on that one?"

The timing for the annual SKO, or Sales Kickoff, and marketing of sales initiatives around that event actually moved it. Last year, it was in the first quarter. We actually pulled it forward and did it in December of this past year. So again, that's probably not a number you can necessarily just annualize to get the run rate.

First of all, Bill and Andrew won't let me build out the sales force to address that potential demand, and I am happily compliant with not building it out. And just to be clear, right, it was -- it clearly is a differentiator between us and other folks in this industry. So it was not that we didn't have some trepidation in making the decision to address a large segment of the potential revenue in what amounts to an entirely different way for us as a company. So that was not without personal risk on my side but also just a little bit of risk on our side. But it's a great question. How do we feel confident that it's going? Two main components make me feel confident. And the first, it always starts with our customers. I think during last earnings call, we had just come from a meeting with 1 of our top 5 customers. And the reception from us having a conversation with those C-level folks and talking to them about not competing with them and asking for their support and signing up for the partnership program and being actively involved in helping us pass leads back and forth and being true partners gives me a great deal of confidence. And then secondly, nothing brings confidence like pipeline, especially in my particular world. And so the guys this year, in the first quarter, have already generated $40.1 million in pipeline inside P&A to date. Now obviously, we don't close all of that pipeline, and we're starting small and learning and making sure we get it right, and we're growing the program as we move forward, added another program to the reseller partnership program. This particular quarter, we'll continue doing that with some of our key partners moving forward. But nothing gives me peace of mind like having $40 million in pipe in a brand-new program."

I know we see a lot of demand pointed at our Telx location in Santa Clara, and we continue to see tremendous successes, be it at Cermak or 56 Marietta in Atlanta or in the New York City trifecta. So I can't tell you one asset has kind of pulled far, far ahead in terms of percent change from others, so it's been kind of fairly broad-based. And then your second question was about CapEx. I think it's really just timing-related and if -- you can see from our AFFO reconciliation, if you take those last 3 line items before AFFO, there's some less than $26 million of recurring CapEx and commissions and compensation for the quarter. If you multiply that by 4, that's like just 100-ish million dollars of recurring CapEx. And we have affirmed our guidance table with -- north of $145 million for the full year. So I think it's just a function of timing and I didn't want anyone to think that, that lower number could be truly run rated throughout the rest of the year."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin today with a discussion on governance. We recently announced that Laurence Chapman has been named Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors in keeping with our commitment to sound corporate governance practices and longer-term succession planning. The board expects to point Laurence as Chairman of the Board at its next Annual Meeting in May 2017. 
Many of you have had the opportunity to interact with Dennis Singleton, who has served as our Chairman since April 2012 when the company's founder resigned from the board. Dennis led the board during a period of significant transition, including a change in CEO as well as several other executives, a change in board composition and 2 strategic acquisitions that have meaningfully enhanced the company's growth profile and product mix. It is expected that Dennis will continue to serve on the company's Board of Directors after he steps down as Chairman. 
In addition, I'm pleased to announce that Mark Patterson has joined our board effective yesterday. Many of you may also be familiar with Mark. He was formerly the Global Head of Real Estate Banking at Merrill Lynch. And prior to that, he was the Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking at Citigroup. He serves on the board of GDR as well as General Growth. We are absolutely delighted to welcome Mark to our board.
The governance principle behind these changes is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity. I would also like to remind you that we maintain a destaggered board, the majority of our directors fees are paid in stock. Each of our directors maintains a sizable investment in the company. The board and senior management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements. And finally, since 2014, 100% of the senior management teams long-term incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder performance.
We believe in eating our own cooking and we manage the business to maximize sustainable long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Along those lines, we announced several industry-leading sustainability initiatives earlier this month, including a long-term agreement to procure wind power, offsetting 100% of our U.S. colocation and interconnection energy footprint.
Let's turn to Page 2 of our presentation to recap the guide post of our strategic plan. Delivering superior risk-adjusted returns is our guiding principle. This entails emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We're focused on the accretive deployment of capital and we are willing to turn down deals that do not provide a sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We also execute when we can achieve the best long-term outcome for shareholders, irrespective of short-term reporting requirements. 
In terms of capital allocation, the highlight of the second quarter was the agreement that we reached to acquire a portfolio of 8 highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, 3 of the most important interconnection hubs in Europe as shown here on Page 3. This transactions met all of our acquisition criteria. It's a strategic and complimentary to our existing business, financially accretive and prudently financed. 
These 8 data centers are highly complementary to our European platform. The portfolio serves more than 650 customers predominantly concentrated in the network, cloud and IT services, content and digital media and financial services verticals. The concentration lines up very well with our target customer verticals and more than 80% of these customers are new relationships to Digital Realty. 
In addition, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, underscoring the value of these new customer relationships. As you know, this sales process was dictated by the European Commission with the clear objective of standing up a business that will be immediately competitive in the marketplace. What you may not know is that this business came staffed with 130 employees, including 16 sales and marketing professionals. In contrast to the Telx acquisition, we have not written -- underwritten any expense synergies in this acquisition. 
We are very pleased with the caliber of the personnel as well as the properties that we've acquired with this transaction and we welcome these new employees to the Digital Realty family. In terms of integration, it's still early days but we are actively working to ensure a smooth transition for the acquired business into the Digital Realty platform, and we are leveraging the lessons learned from the Telx integration to create a seamlessly repeatable process. 
Our teams are focused on communicating with our customers and employees, and we're executing on short-term objectives for the business, moving people, integrating processes and standardizing reporting. Over the next quarter, we'll finalize the plan to extend our colocation and interconnection platform and we'll communicate it as appropriate. 
I should pause here for a moment to address the impact of Brexit. We did anticipate a potential Brexit scenario in our underwriting and we did hedge the purchase price. But we have not altered our global strategy. Fundamentally, we do not believe the EBIT [ph] referendum will materially impact global data center demand or our global portfolio as the secular demand drivers remain intact, and the transatlantic cable landings have not moved. We believe our global platform is one of our key competitive advantages and we do not plan to exit either the U.K. or Continental Europe regardless of the outcome of the EU referendum.
Early in the third quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell our fully leased Saint-Denis data center in Paris, Equinix for approximately $210 million or $575 per square foot. Also, early in the third quarter, we closed on a sale of a 4-property data center portfolio as shown here on Page 4. The sales price was $115 million or roughly $250 per square foot. Excluding 2 5 1 exchange, where the sole tenant is moving out this month, the portfolio cap rate is in the low 6s on forward contractual cash NOI and in the mid-7s, assuming the near-term expirations were to renew.
Since embarking on our capital recycling program in the second quarter of 2014, we have sold 10 properties and 1 investment, generating net proceeds of $420 million, not including the Paris property now under contract. As I've said previously, we've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of our noncore assets. And this portfolio sales substantially concludes our capital recycling program. We do however, continue to believe that culling the asset base represents prudent real estate and portfolio management, and you can reasonably expect to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly nondata center properties or oneoff assets that no longer fit our Global Connected Campus strategy.
In terms of expanding our product offerings, we've been working closely with our customers and leveraging combined heritage of Digital Realty as a large footprint leader in addition to the Telx colocation and interconnection legacy. We are close to launching our service exchange, which will further allow us to enable customers with dynamically interconnected large footprint and colocation data center solutions on a seamless connected campus, uniquely meeting customer requirements. 
The service exchange is core to empowering hybrid cloud and IoT architectures in an extremely efficient and manner. We look forward to providing more details over the coming months and unveiling the benefits of the service exchange with our robust cloud ecosystem partners. In addition, we are continuing to make solid progress on the Telx integration. We're executing our systems road map. That work is on track and is expected to continue for the next several quarters. We plan to Sunset the Telx brand during the third quarter and we are in the process of unifying our multiproduct global sales force, which we also expect to complete during the third quarter. 
Along similar lines, our partners and alliances program continues to expand. I'm pleased to announce that CenturyLink, our largest -- second largest customer, has joined our program enhancing options for connectivity, managed services and cloud services for our customers. During the second quarter, the partners in alliances program continue to drive revenues, including for hybrid cloud deployments that highlight the benefits of our Connected Campus strategy. I'm pleased with the progress that we are making. In addition to adding CenturyLink to our partners and alliances program during the second quarter, we have begun executing on transactions for hybrid cloud deployments with one of our best customers and partners in advance of our formal go-to-market campaign, which is set to begin shortly. As a result, we have already begun to realize revenue from this partnership, and we expect to see even greater uptake once we formally launch the campaign. 
For the first half of the year, the partners and alliances group increased the total contract value of deals executed by more than 20%, albeit on a homogenous base. The pipeline remains robust as approximately $40 million, even after several deals were executed during the second quarter. Now let's turn to market fundamentals on Page 5. New supplies picked up in Dallas and Northern Virginia over the past 90 days. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, demand is robust in both of these markets and pre-leasing levels on development pipelines are healthy. In addition, current market legacy rates are low and our own portfolios in these markets are likewise, north of 90% leased. Northern Virginia and Dallas are both national data center markets characterized by robust leasing velocity and solidly positive net absorption. 
Now let's turn to the macro environment on Page 6. The global economic outlook has deteriorated slightly over the past 90 days, primarily due to uncertainty in the wake of the Brexit referendum. The data center industry has the good fortune of being levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy. 
We believe it's still early days for cloud adoption, and the related build out of cloud service providers compute node footprints. Although cloud requirements are lumpy and price-sensitive. From where we sit, it looks like so wave of cloud service provider demand has not crested yet and we see a set wave building on the horizon from the Internet of Things and connected devices. Gartner predicts that by 2018, 30% of enterprises will use cloud service providers direct LAN cloud connectivity services up from less than 1% at the end of last year. 
Given this expected growth, strategic planners at the cloud providers are actively mapping out their approach. We believe that we are well positioned to support this continued growth as we're one of the very few providers with the ability to meet the full spectrum of our customers data center demand requirements on a global basis. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andy?"

We signed new leases totaling $15 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, including a $6 million colocation space and power contribution. Interconnection contributed an additional $8 million and our total bookings for the second quarter were a little over $22 million of annualized GAAP revenue. 
While this is towards the lower end of our recent activity levels, we are taking a much more selective approach to landing the right mix of customers to maximize the long-term value of our global connected campus footprint. We are winning diverse demand across attractive verticals, including cloud service providers both big and small, along with other growing segments of the digital economy, IT service providers and other large sophisticated users. 
You'll note the appearance of a Fortune 50 hyperscale cloud service provider on our top 20 customer list this quarter. At the same time, we also added more than 40 new logos for the second consecutive quarter. Long story short, we are focused on landing demand from a diverse and growing customer set. Along those lines, I am pleased to report that during the month of July, we have already signed an additional $20 million of total bookings, including space, power and interconnection. This activity has included significant signings across all 3 geographic regions, including a healthy mix of large enterprise software cloud providers, hyperscale cloud providers, IT service providers and financial service customers. 
The total bookings figure includes $6 million of annualized colocation and interconnection bookings. In fact, the month of July has already been the best month for Telx since our acquisition. While we are not satisfied with the level of large footprint leasing during the second quarter, the pipeline for the second half is sizable, and we are cautiously optimistic that we are back on track to return to normalized activity levels in the second half of the year. 
Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $70 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence within the next 12 months. The weighted average lag between second quarter signings and commencements was a record low at 1.5 months. 
Turning to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We retained 85% of second quarter lease expirations and we saw just under $60 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash releasing spread was up a little less than 3% overall with a positive cash mark-to-market across all property types, including another quarter of plus 5% for colocation. This was a bit better-than-expected, largely because we did not execute renewals on the above market leases in Phoenix and on the East Coast that we have called out last quarter. We do still expect to renew those leases later this year, so we may see negative cash mark-to-market on our second half renewals. 
For the full year, we now expect releasing spreads to be slightly positive on a cash basis, up from our previous guidance of flat on a cash basis. In general, we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and the steady progress we're making on peak these explorations. 
Let's turn to Telx here on Page 11. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $94 million of revenue during the second quarter, representing 9% growth year-over-year. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50, interconnection outpaced colocation with the year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 11%. From the legacy 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the second quarter. Telx continues to perform at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts and we remain on-track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets. 
We have added a number of new sales reps who have already begun contributing to the success of this business. As part of integrating our global sales force, we plan to continue to add sales resources through the end of the year, including key positions to drive our vertical ecosystem development and solutions efforts. The colocation and interconnection strategy has been to focus on key facilities and drive growth associated with our ecosystem, including multisite customer wins. We are seeing progress across 5 emerging ecosystems: Networks, subsea cable systems, mobile, digital content and over-the-top distribution and the cloud community. 
During the second quarter, we announced that we landed another undersea cable system in our Hillsboro facility. Subsea cable systems are an area of particular focus for us and we have had success today in the Pacific Northwest where there has been a heightened interest in landing cable. In mid-May, we announced that we will be launching colocation and interconnection services on our Ashburn Compass during the third quarter. We're scheduled to launch in September where the sales team have begun to pre-selling the site and we already signed a handful of new deals. 
In addition, Atlanta has showed significant growth over the past few years and we're completely sold out. So we have begun working to bring on additional capacity to accommodate our overflow from 56 Marietta and should launch early next year. As mentioned last quarter, Marketplace Live will take place in New York on September 22. We look forward to providing updates on products and services and formally introducing our revised branding. And we hope many of you will be able to join us there.
In summary, at the one year mark since a Telx acquisition announcement, we're on-track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets and complete the integration process. 
Turning to our financial results on Page 12. We reported 2Q '16 co-FFO per share of $1.42, $0.04 ahead of consensus. The outperformance was fairly broad-based with the top line OpEx, G&A, and interest expense each $0.01 ahead of expectations. AFFO per share was likewise, well ahead of plan, partially, driven by the [indiscernible] FFO line as well as accretion from Telx and a further reduction in straight-line rental revenue as shown on Page 13. 
Recurring CapEx was also down significantly again this quarter. Although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up in the second half of the year. Since a portion of the lower CapEx spending is essentially timing-related, the second quarter AFFO per share growth is somewhat inflated but nonetheless, we are well on our way to delivering the double-digit AFFO per share growth we committed to at our Investor Day last October. 
The AFFO payout ratio is now sub [ph] 17%, and while we continue to review retained earnings as our cheapest source of capital, the current payout ratio provides flexibility and room for further dividend growth. The bottom line is that the quality of earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating, reflecting the improved operating discipline we've instilled over the past 2 years along with consistently improving data center market fundamentals. 
As you may have seen from the press release, we raised our core FFO per share guidance by $0.10 at both ends of the range. We raised the full year projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points again this quarter to 57% at the midpoint. You may recall from our Investor Day presentation last October that we set out a target of a 200 basis point EBITDA margin expansion by 2018 from 55% to 57%. 
We are nowhere close to hanging out the mission accomplished banner today, and we do expect the EBITDA margin will continue to fluctuate overtime as we reinvest in the business, but we are pleased with the progress we are making towards the final objective on our 3-year guidepost, achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in cash flow and value per share.
We also raised our 2016 same capital cash NOI guidance again this quarter by 150 basis points at the low end, up to 2.5% to 4% or roughly 3.5% to 5% on a constant currency basis. FX represented roughly a 50 to 100 basis point drag on our year-over-year growth and reported results from the top to bottom line as shown on Page 14. I would like to remind you that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
As shown on Page 15, the U.K. represents approximately 13% of total revenues and approximately 5 percentage denominated in euros pro forma for the 8 property portfolio acquisition that closed in July. However, as you can see through the table in the middle of the page, we have over GBP 1 billion of debt outstanding, and we also completed our inaugural EUR 600 million bond offering earlier this year. 
We have effectively matched the currency of our assets with our liabilities in these markets. So our total European net asset exposure, including currency hedges, is less than 5%. We may tap the sterling bond market again either later this year or earlier next to further naturally hedge our sterling-denominated assets. Finally, I'd like to point out that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe is a key competitive advantage. 
In terms of our second quarter operating performance. Same capital occupancy was flat sequentially at 93%. Overall portfolio occupancy dipped 50 basis points sequentially to 90.4%, due primarily to development deliveries placed in service in our highest demand markets. We expect overall portfolio occupancy to tick back up by the end of the year. Same-capital cash NOI was up 3.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would've been up approximately 3.6%. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet beginning on Page 16. As you know, we executed 4 equity offering in mid-May to permanently finance the European portfolio acquisition. The underwriters also exercised their overlapping option in full, so we expect to receive total net proceeds of approximately 1.3 billion upon physical settlement of the 4 [ph] sale agreements. In the interest of time, I won't dwell on the mechanics today. But I would like to point out that we have included a slide here on Page 16 that does provide some detailed mechanics on the 4 [ph] sale agreements for those who may be interested. 
When we closed the portfolio acquisition in early July, we initially funded the purchase with a drawdown on our line of credit in an effort to match sources and uses, which we've attempted to lay out for you on Page 17. In addition to the proceeds from the equity offering, we expected to close the portfolio sale as well as the Paris option properties. In terms of timing for the uses. The preferred equity is not redeemable and the mortgage debt is not pre-payable until later this summer. 
Consequently, we expect to settle all or substantially all of the 4 sale agreements by the end of the third quarter as we fund the additional use of the capital laid out here on Page 17. Remember that we can flex our line of credit up or down anytime, but the Ford sale agreement is a oneway drawdowns. Finally, on Page 18. We provided a recap on our 2016 Capital Markets activity on the right as well as the pro forma impact from the equity offering and the European portfolio acquisition on the left-hand side. As you can see, we are keeping our balance sheet well positioned for new investment opportunities consistent with our financing strategy. 
This concludes our prepared remarks and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Dan, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

So we expect as this -- as the programs that we're developing right now move forward that to have even better performance from a pricing perspective as our ecosystem development work is underway right now starts to take hold. The pre-leasing rates that in these markets similarly look at internationally in particular, the rates looks fairly strong.

Given our targeted focus on continuing, social mobile, analytics cloud and content, but especially inside that cloud and social verticals, our funnel has been slightly -- it has had slightly improving margins in it currently. And I do say currently, because it's pipeline and we have to close. But we're pretty happy that we've been able to slightly expand the margin inside the funnel as we start to work together with multiple products. In addition, we've been working together very closely with multiple clouds -- large clouds service providers to make sure that we can match value for value going forward given their demand and given our capacity, and given the pipeline margins, this would give the pipeline margins for the rest of this fiscal year and moving in to Q1 of '17 potentially better outcome."

And the Salesforce oriented towards selling that small footprint, high price point, colocation and interconnection oriented offering. So that's -- what makes this one a little bit easier is that there's no expense synergies being sold here. We actually want to put additional resources to support the sales force.

So while I would certainly characterize as you did, I was not pleased with what I would call below average scale products signs in the quarter. We do think that the pace was due to a couple of things that you mentioned, but also the normal lumpiness has become part of our business especially given the new hyperscale demand that's out there. But as you said, more selective approach to making sure that we land the right mix of customers at the maximum -- to maximize the long-term value that we think we have inside of our ecosystem. So this means, as you said, one of the potential reasons for that number is our continued commitment to a disciplined approach to our underwriting criteria. And focusing really on top-tier markets and not focusing on tertiary markets where some customers may have a desire to go, and then maintaining a disciplined underwriting and pricing regimen to protect the long-term value.
And on your second question. Really, the overall demand remains strong. It's evidenced by the July that we've had so far in both sections of our global business as well as the healthy pipeline that I talked about, which has the potential for margin expansion as we move on. We do think that we're on track now to resume normal levels in the second half across all parts of the business in 2016. Specifically, though, with regard to your question about demand and cloud demand, remaining strong especially where we are in our global markets where we operate, it's important to remember that, that cloud business is still one of the fastest-growing segments lending in our industry. And from analysts, from RightScale all the way to the Gartner, they all tend to agree that we are actually in the early innings of this new cloud ecosystem breaking out. We're also starting to see the green shoots. We're seeing mass adoption of a diversity of cloud players, not just the major cloud players and early adopters that are out there, which we think, and to get to your last question, we think we're uniquely situated to be able to land. We do believe that we're the only company in this space that is very focused on providing great scale solutions for people who need scale solutions, including those cloud service providers, but also providing colocation right next to it and a latency that can't be beat as well as the security that comes with a power of private networking and our interconnection of products. So we really think that the secular demand drivers and the cloud industry are continuing to push them. And we are uniquely situated to be able to do something."

It's included hyperscale top 3 cloud providers, a sizable chunk firm other cloud providers that are not top 3, and then another chunk from the rest that we call a smack on the digital company or IT service or other transactional verticals. So we're seeing our demand signs in the second quarter in July from diverse growing customer sets. The other thing that I think -- to draw a distinction, it's not just about pricing or profitability too. We're really focused on driving long-term growth in the cash flow and the attractiveness and the value of our assets and our campuses and our gateways, with a diversity of different customers versus some of our peers who may be more focused on -- being in a noncore market to us or doing a full build-to-suits with one customer in one shot. So we always want more exposure and more signings at the right rates from these top cloud providers. But we're focused on the collective portfolio and growing that cash flow and the value of our assets."

I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our second quarter highlights as outlined here on Page 19. 
We had another very productive quarter characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. In particular, we further advanced our global footprint with the European portfolio acquisition. We also delivered solid, current period financial results. We beat The Street by $0.04 with better-than-expected results above and below the NOI line. We also delivered outsized AFFO per share growth during the quarter, the quality of our earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating. We raised guidance by $0.10 with an improving outlook for most of our key metrics and solid progress towards our 3-year target of 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet with proceeds from asset sales and a successful forward equity offering that coincided with our inclusion in the S&P 500 Index.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin today with a discussion on governance. We recently announced that Laurence Chapman has been named Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors in keeping with our commitment to sound corporate governance practices and longer-term succession planning. The board expects to appoint Laurence as Chairman of the Board at its next Annual Meeting in May 2017. 
Many of you had -- have had the opportunity to interact with Dennis Singleton, who has served as our Chairman since April 2012, when the company's founder resigned from the board. Dennis led the board during a period of significant transition, including a change in CEO as well as several other executives, a change in board composition and 2 strategic acquisitions that have meaningfully enhanced the company's growth profile and product mix. It is expected that Dennis will continue to serve on the company's Board of Directors after he steps down as Chairman. 
In addition, I'm pleased to announce that Mark Patterson has joined our board, effective yesterday. Many of you may also be familiar with Mark. He was formerly the Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking at Merrill Lynch. And prior to that, he was the Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking at Citigroup. He serves on the board of GDR as well as General Growth. We are absolutely delighted to welcome Mark to our board.
The governance principle behind these changes is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity. I would also like to remind you that we maintain a de-staggered board. The majority of our directors fees are paid in stock. Each of our directors maintains a sizable investment in the company. The board and senior management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements. And finally, since 2014, 100% of the senior management teams' long-term incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder performance.
We believe in eating our own cooking, and we manage the business to maximize sustainable long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Along those lines, we announced several industry-leading sustainability initiatives earlier this month, including a long-term agreement to procure wind power, offsetting 100% of our U.S. colocation and interconnection energy footprint.
Let's turn to Page 2 of our presentation to recap the guide process of our strategic plan. Delivering superior risk-adjusted returns is our guiding principle. This entails emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We're focused on the accretive deployment of capital, and we are willing to turn down deals that do not provide a sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We also execute when we can achieve the best long-term outcome for shareholders, irrespective of short-term reporting requirements. 
In terms of capital allocation, the highlight of the second quarter was the agreement that we reached to acquire a portfolio of 8 highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, 3 of the most important interconnection hubs in Europe, as shown here on Page 3. This transaction met all of our acquisition criteria. It was strategic and complimentary to our existing business, financially accretive and prudently financed. 
These 8 data centers are highly complementary to our European platform. The portfolio serves more than 650 customers, predominantly concentrated in the network, cloud and IT services, content and digital media and financial services verticals. The concentration lines up very well with our target customer verticals and more than 80% of these customers are new relationships to Digital Realty. 
In addition, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, underscoring the value of these new customer relationships. As you know, this sales process was dictated by the European Commission with the clear objective of standing up a business that would be immediately competitive in the marketplace. What you may not know is that this business came staffed with 130 employees, including 16 sales and marketing professionals. In contrast to the Telx acquisition, we have not written -- underwritten any expense synergies in this acquisition. 
We are very pleased with the caliber of the personnel as well as the properties that we've acquired with this transaction, and we welcome these new employees to the Digital Realty family. 
In terms of integration, it's still early days, but we are actively working to ensure a smooth transition for the acquired business into the Digital Realty platform. And we are leveraging the lessons learned from the Telx integration to create a seamlessly repeatable process. 
Our teams are focused on communicating with our customers and employees, and we're executing on short-term objectives for the business, moving people, integrating processes and standardizing reporting. Over the next quarter, we'll finalize the plan to extend our colocation and interconnection platform, and we'll communicate it as appropriate. 
I should pause here for a moment to address the impact of Brexit. We did anticipate a potential Brexit scenario in our underwriting, and we did hedge the purchase price. But we have not altered our global strategy. Fundamentally, we do not believe the EU referendum will materially impact global data center demand or our global portfolio, as the secular demand drivers remain intact and the transatlantic cable landings have not moved. We believe our global platform is one of our key competitive advantages, and we do not plan to exit either the U.K. or Continental Europe, regardless of the outcome of the EU referendum.
Early in the third quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell our fully leased Saint-Denis Data Center in Paris Equinix for approximately $210 million or $575 per square foot. Also, early in the third quarter, we closed on the sale of a 4-property data center portfolio, as shown here on Page 4. The sales price was $115 million or roughly $250 per square foot. Excluding 251 Exchange, where the sole tenant is moving out this month, the portfolio cap rate is in the low 6s on forward contractual cash NOI and in the mid-7s, assuming the near-term expirations were to renew.
Since embarking on our capital recycling program in the second quarter of 2014, we have sold 10 properties and one investment, generating net proceeds of $420 million, not including the Paris property now under contract. 
As I've said previously, we've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of our noncore assets. And this portfolio sales substantially concludes our capital recycling program. We do, however, continue to believe that culling the asset base represents prudent real estate and portfolio management, and you can reasonably expect to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly non-data center properties or one-off assets that no longer fit our Global Connected Campus strategy.
In terms of expanding our product offerings, we've been working closely with our customers and leveraging combined heritage of Digital Realty as a large footprint leader, in addition to the Telx colocation and interconnection legacy. We are close to launching our service exchange, which will further allow us to enable customers with dynamically interconnected large footprint and colocation data center solutions on a seamless connected campus, uniquely meeting customer requirements. 
The service exchange is core to empowering hybrid cloud and IoT architectures in an extremely efficient and agile manner. We look forward to providing more details over the coming months and unveiling the benefits of the service exchange with our robust cloud ecosystem partners. In addition, we are continuing to make solid progress on the Telx integration. We're executing our systems road map. That work is on track and is expected to continue for the next several quarters. We plan to Sunset the Telx brand during the third quarter, and we are in the process of unifying our multiproduct global sales force, which we also expect to complete during the third quarter. 
Along similar lines, our Partners and Alliances program continues to expand. I'm pleased to announce that CenturyLink, our largest -- second largest customer, has joined our program enhancing our options for connectivity, managed services and cloud services for our customers. During the second quarter, the partners in alliances program continue to drive revenues, including for hybrid cloud deployments that highlight the benefits of our Connected Campus strategy. I'm pleased with the progress that we are making. In addition to adding CenturyLink to our Partners and Alliances program during the second quarter, we have begun executing on transactions for hybrid cloud deployments with one of our best customers and partners in advance of our formal go-to-market campaign, which is set to begin shortly. As a result, we have already begun to realize revenue from this partnership, and we expect to see even greater uptake once we formally launch the campaign. 
During the first half of the year, the Partners and Alliances group increased the total contract value of deals executed by more than 20%, albeit on a homogenous base. The pipeline remains robust at approximately $40 million, even after several deals were executed during the second quarter. 
Now let's turn to market fundamentals, on Page 5. New supplies picked up in Dallas and Northern Virginia over the past 90 days. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, demand is robust in both of these markets and pre-leasing levels on development pipelines are healthy. In addition, current market vacancy rates are low, and our own portfolios in these markets are, likewise, north of 90% leased. Northern Virginia and Dallas are both national data center markets, characterized by robust leasing velocity and solidly positive net absorption. 
And now let's turn to the macro environment, on Page 6. The global economic outlook has deteriorated slightly over the past 90 days, primarily due to uncertainty in the wake of the Brexit referendum. The data center industry has the good fortune of being levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy. 
We believe it's still early days for cloud adoption, and the related build-out of cloud service providers compute node footprints, although cloud requirements are lumpy and price-sensitive. From where we sit, it looks like the wave of cloud service provider demand has not crested yet, and we see a set wave building on the horizon from the Internet of Things and connected devices. Gartner predicts that by 2018, 30% of enterprises will use cloud service providers' direct LAN cloud connectivity services up from less than 1% at the end of last year. 
Given this expected growth, strategic planners at the cloud providers are actively mapping out their approach. We believe that we are well positioned to support this continued growth, as we're one of the very few providers with the ability to meet the full spectrum of our customers' data center demand requirements on a global basis. 
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andy?"
11041860,339148287,1016699,"Digital Realty Trust Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity, on Page 8.

Interconnection contributed an",1983,"Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity, on Page 8. We signed new leases totaling $15 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, including a $6 million colocation space and power contribution. Interconnection contributed an additional $8 million, and our total bookings for the second quarter were a little over $22 million of annualized GAAP revenue. 
While this is towards the lower end of our recent activity levels, we are taking a much more selective approach to landing the right mix of customers to maximize the long-term value of our global connected campus footprint. We are winning diverse demand across attractive verticals, including cloud service providers, both big and small, along with other growing segments of the digital economy, IT service providers and other large sophisticated users. 
You'll note the appearance of a Fortune 50 hyperscale cloud service provider on our top 20 customer list this quarter. At the same time, we also added more than 40 new logos for the second consecutive quarter. Long story short, we are focused on landing demand from a diverse and growing customer set. Along those lines, I am pleased to report that during the month of July, we have already signed an additional $20 million of total bookings, including space, power and interconnection. This activity has included significant signings across all 3 geographic regions, including a healthy mix of large enterprise software cloud providers, hyperscale cloud providers, IT service providers and financial service customers. 
The total bookings figure includes $6 million of annualized colocation and interconnection bookings. In fact, the month of July has already been the best month for Telx since our acquisition. While we are not satisfied with the level of large footprint leasing during the second quarter, the pipeline for the second half is sizable, and we are cautiously optimistic that we are back on track to return to normalized activity levels in the second half of the year. 
Turning to our backlog, on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, stands at $70 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence within the next 12 months. The weighted average lag between second quarter signings and commencements was a record low at 1.5 months. 
Turning to renewal leasing activity, on Page 10. We retained 85% of second quarter lease expirations and we signed just under $60 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash releasing spread was up a little less than 3% overall, with a positive cash mark-to-market across all property types, including another quarter of plus 5% for colocation. This was a bit better than expected, largely because we did not execute renewals on the above market leases in Phoenix and on the East Coast that we had called out last quarter. We do still expect to renew those leases later this year. So we may see negative cash mark-to-market on our second half renewals. 
For the full year, we now expect releasing spread to be slightly positive on a cash basis, up from our previous guidance of flat on a cash basis. In general, we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and the steady progress we're making on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. 
Let's turn to Telx here on Page 11. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $94 million of revenue during the second quarter, representing 9% growth year-over-year. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50, interconnection outpaced colocation with the year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 11%. From the legacy 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the second quarter. Telx continues to perform at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts, and we remain on-track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets. 
We have added a number of new sales reps who have already begun contributing to the success of this business. As part of integrating our global sales force, we plan to continue to add sales resources through the end of the year, including key positions to drive our vertical ecosystem development and solutions efforts. The colocation and interconnection strategy has been to focus on key facilities and drive growth associated with our ecosystem, including multisite customer wins. We are seeing progress across 5 emerging ecosystems: Networks, subsea cable systems, mobile, digital content and over-the-top distribution and the cloud community. 
During the second quarter, we announced that we landed another undersea cable system in our Hillsboro, Oregon facility. Subsea cable systems are an area of particular focus for us, and we have had success to date in the Pacific Northwest where there has been a heightened interest in landing cable. In mid-May, we announced that we will be launching colocation and interconnection services on our Ashburn Compass during the third quarter. We're scheduled to launch in September, but the sales team has begun pre-selling the site and we already signed a handful of new deals. 
In addition, Atlanta had shown significant growth over the past few years and we're completely sold out. So we have begun working to bring on additional capacity to accommodate our overflow from 56 Marietta and should launch early next year. As mentioned last quarter, Marketplace Live will take place in New York on September 22. We look forward to providing updates on products and services and formally introducing our revised branding. And we hope many of you will be able to join us there.
In summary, at the one year mark since the Telx acquisition announcement, we're on-track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets and complete the integration process. 
Turning to our financial results, on Page 12. We reported 2Q '16 core FFO per share of $1.42, $0.04 ahead of consensus. The outperformance was fairly broad-based with the top line OpEx, G&A, and interest expense each $0.01 ahead of expectations. AFFO per share was, likewise, well ahead of plan, partially driven by the [indiscernible] FFO line as well as accretion from Telx and a further reduction in straight-line rental revenue, as shown on Page 13. 
Recurring CapEx was also down significantly again this quarter. Although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up in the second half of the year. Since a portion of the lower CapEx spend is essentially timing-related, the second quarter AFFO per share growth is somewhat inflated, but nonetheless, we are well on our way to delivering the double-digit AFFO per share growth we committed to at our Investor Day last October. 
The AFFO payout ratio is now sub-70%, and while we continue to view retained earnings as our cheapest source of equity capital, the current payout ratio provides flexibility and room for further dividend growth. The bottom line is that the quality of earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating, reflecting the improved underwriting discipline we've instilled over the past 2 years, along with consistently improving data center market fundamentals. 
As you may have seen from the press release, we raised our core FFO per share guidance by $0.10 at both ends of the range. We raised the full year projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points again this quarter, to 57% at the midpoint. You may recall from our Investor Day presentation last October that we set out a target of a 200-basis-point EBITDA margin expansion by 2018 from 55% to 57%. 
We are nowhere close to hanging out the mission accomplished banner today, and we do expect the EBITDA margin will continue to fluctuate over time as we reinvest in the business. But we are pleased with the progress we are making towards the final objective on our 3-year guidepost, achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in cash flow and value per share.
We also raised our 2016 same capital cash NOI growth guidance again this quarter by 150 basis points at the low end, up to 2.5% to 4% or roughly 3.5% to 5% on a constant currency basis. FX represented roughly a 50 to 100-basis-point drag on the year-over-year growth and reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on Page 14. I would like to remind you that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
As shown on Page 15, the U.K. represents approximately 13% of total revenues and approximately 5 percentage denominated in euros pro forma for the 8 property portfolio acquisition that closed in July. However, as you can see through the table in the middle of the page, we have over GBP 1 billion of debt outstanding, and we also completed our inaugural EUR 600 million bond offering earlier this year. 
We have effectively matched the currency of our assets with our liabilities in these markets. So our total European net asset exposure, including currency hedges, is less than 5%. We may tap the sterling bond market again, either later this year or earlier next, to further naturally hedge our sterling-denominated assets. 
Finally, I'd like to point out that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe is a key competitive advantage. 
In terms of our second quarter operating performance, same capital occupancy was flat sequentially at 93%. Overall portfolio occupancy dipped 50 basis points sequentially to 90.4%, due primarily to development deliveries placed in service in our highest demand markets. We expect overall portfolio occupancy to pick back up by the end of the year. Same-capital cash NOI was up 3.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would've been up approximately 3.6%. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet, beginning on Page 16. As you know, we executed forward equity offering in mid-May to permanently finance the European portfolio acquisition. The underwriters also exercised their over-allotment option in full. So we expect to receive total net proceeds of approximately 1.3 billion upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements. In the interest of time, I won't dwell on the mechanics today. But I would like to point out that we have included a slide here on Page 16 that does provide some detail on the mechanics on the forward sale agreements for those who may be interested. 
When we closed the portfolio acquisition in early July, we initially funded the purchase with a drawdown on our line of credit, in an effort to match sources and uses, which we've attempted to lay out for you on Page 17. In addition to the proceeds from the equity offering, we expected to close on the portfolio sale as well as the Paris option property. In terms of timing for the uses, the preferred equity is not redeemable and the mortgage debt is not pre-payable until later this summer. 
Consequently, we expect to settle all, or substantially all, of the forward sale agreements by the end of the third quarter, as we fund the additional use of the capital laid out here on Page 17. Remember that we can flex our line of credit up or down anytime, but the forward sale agreement is a one-way drawdown. 
Finally, on Page 18, we provided a recap of our 2016 Capital Markets activity on the right as well as the pro forma impact from the equity offering and the European portfolio acquisition on the left-hand side. As you can see, we are keeping our balance sheet well positioned for new investment opportunities consistent with our financing strategy. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Dan, would you, please, begin the Q&A session?"

So we expect as this -- as the programs that we're developing right now move forward that to have even better performance from a pricing perspective, as our ecosystem development work is underway right now starts to take hold. The pre-leasing rates in these markets similarly look, internationally in particular, the rates looks fairly strong.

Given our targeted focus on continuing social mobile, analytics cloud and content, but especially inside that cloud and social verticals, our funnel has been slightly -- it has had slightly improving margins in it currently. And I do say currently, because it's pipeline and we have to close. But we're pretty happy that we've been able to slightly expand the margin inside the funnel as we start to work together with multiple products. In addition, we've been working together very, very closely with multiple clouds -- large clouds service providers to make sure that we can match value for value going forward given their demand and given our capacity, and given the pipeline margins, this would give the pipeline margins for the rest of this fiscal year and moving in to Q1 of '17 potentially better outcome."

On the European portfolio acquisition, it's -- quite frankly, it's early days. We are delighted to receive approval from the commission and ultimately close on the acquisition what is, I guess, a handful of days or weeks ago. We think we got a really talented team, along with some very attractive assets coming on board.

I mean, quite frankly, we were fortunate, very similarly to our Telx acquisition, in buying a very strategic and complementary collection of assets and team members. In Europe previously, our position was much more, I think, around our scale leasing and more campus-oriented products. What we've closed on with the 8 assets and that team is prized assets in the dockland of London or [indiscernible] Park or Amsterdam. We're actually -- in Frankfurt, it works very well with the land we purchased and a sales force oriented towards selling that small footprint, higher price point, co-location and interconnection-oriented offering. So that's -- what makes this one a little bit easier is that there's no expense synergies being sought here. We actually want to put additional resources to support the sales force. It's very complementary with the existing team over there. We'll be moving into our office on Gracechurch Street in -- within the month, where we had little space to fit the corporate team.

So while I would certainly characterize it as you did, I was not pleased with what I'd call below-average scale product signings in the quarter. We do think that the pace was due to a couple of things that you mentioned, but also, the normal lumpiness has become part of our business, especially given the new hyper-scale demand that's out there but also, as you said, a more selective approach to making sure that we land the right mix of customers at the maximum -- to maximize the long-term value that we think we have inside of our ecosystem. So this means, as you said, one of the potential reasons for that number is our continued commitment to a disciplined approach of our -- to our underwriting criteria and focusing really on top-tier markets and not focusing on tertiary markets where some customers may have a desire to go and then maintaining a disciplined underwriting and pricing regimen to protect the long-term value. And on your second question, really, the overall demand remains strong. It's evidenced by the July that we've had so far in both sections of our global business as well as the healthy pipeline that I talked about, which has the potential for margin expansion as we move on. We do think that we are on track now to resume normal levels in the second half across all parts of the business in 2016. Specifically, though, with regard to your question about demand and cloud demand remaining strong, especially where we are in our global markets where we operate, it's important to remember that, that cloud business is still one of the fastest growing segments landing in our industry. And from analysts, from RightScale all the way through to Gartner, they all tend to agree that we are actually in the early innings of this new cloud ecosystem breaking out. We're also starting to see the green shoots. We're seeing mass adoption of a diversity of cloud players, not just the major cloud players and early adopters that are out there, which we think -- and to get to your last question, we think we're uniquely situated to be able to land. We do believe that we're the only company in this space that is very focused on providing great scale solutions for folks who need scale solutions, including those cloud service providers but also providing co-location right next to it at a latency that can't be beat as well as the security that comes with the power of private networking and our interconnection products. So we really think that the secular demand drivers in the cloud industry are continuing to push them, and we are uniquely situated to be able to address it."

While I always love to have a better fiscal second quarter, I rather have a better deal on July 1 than a less attractive deal on the 30th of June. So -- and I think you saw a little bit of that with the volume assignment that just got signed the first few days or weeks of the month of July. And just to put a little more meat on the bone, that's been from a diversity of different types of customers. It's included hyper-scale top 3 cloud providers, a sizable chunk from other cloud providers that aren't in that top 3 and then another chunk from the rest of what we call SMACC or the digital economy or IT service or other transaction verticals. So we're seeing our demand signings in the second quarter and July from diverse growing customer sets. The other thing I think that -- to draw a distinction, it's not just about pricing or profitability, too. We're really focused on driving the long-term growth in the cash flow and attractiveness and value of our assets in our campuses and our gateways with a diversity of different customers versus some of our peers who may be more focused on being in a non-core market to us or doing a full build to suit with one customer in one shot.

We had another very productive quarter characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. In particular, we further advanced our global footprint with the European portfolio acquisition. We also delivered solid current-period financial results. We beat The Street by $0.04 with better-than-expected results above and below the NOI line. We also delivered outsized AFFO per share growth during the quarter, the quality of our earnings is improving, and the growth in cash flow is accelerating. We raised guidance by $0.10 with an improving outlook for most of our key metrics and solid progress towards our 3-year target of 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet with proceeds from asset sales and a successful forward equity offering that coincided with our inclusion in the S&P 500 Index.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin today with a discussion on governance. We recently announced that Laurence Chapman has been named Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors in keeping with our commitment to sound corporate governance practices and longer-term succession planning. The board expects to appoint Laurence as Chairman of the Board at its next Annual Meeting in May 2017. 
Many of you had -- have had the opportunity to interact with Dennis Singleton, who has served as our Chairman since April 2012, when the company's founder resigned from the board. Dennis led the board during a period of significant transition, including a change in CEO as well as several other executives, a change in board composition and 2 strategic acquisitions that have meaningfully enhanced the company's growth profile and product mix. It is expected that Dennis will continue to serve on the company's Board of Directors after he steps down as Chairman. 
In addition, I'm pleased to announce that Mark Patterson has joined our board, effective yesterday. Many of you may also be familiar with Mark. He was formerly the Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking at Merrill Lynch. And prior to that, he was the Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking at Citigroup. He serves on the board of GDR as well as General Growth. We are absolutely delighted to welcome Mark to our board.
The governance principle behind these changes is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity. I would also like to remind you that we maintain a de-staggered board. The majority of our directors fees are paid in stock. Each of our directors maintains a sizable investment in the company. The board and senior management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements. And finally, since 2014, 100% of the senior management teams' long-term incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder performance.
We believe in eating our own cooking, and we manage the business to maximize sustainable long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Along those lines, we announced several industry-leading sustainability initiatives earlier this month, including a long-term agreement to procure wind power, offsetting 100% of our U.S. colocation and interconnection energy footprint.
Let's turn to Page 2 of our presentation to recap the guideposts of our strategic plan. Delivering superior risk-adjusted returns is our guiding principle. This entails emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We're focused on the accretive deployment of capital, and we are willing to turn down deals that do not provide a sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We also execute when we can achieve the best long-term outcome for shareholders, irrespective of short-term reporting requirements. 
In terms of capital allocation, the highlight of the second quarter was the agreement that we reached to acquire a portfolio of 8 highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, 3 of the most important interconnection hubs in Europe, as shown here on Page 3. This transaction met all of our acquisition criteria. It was strategic and complimentary to our existing business, financially accretive and prudently financed. 
These 8 data centers are highly complementary to our European platform. The portfolio serves more than 650 customers, predominantly concentrated in the network, cloud and IT services, content and digital media and financial services verticals. The concentration lines up very well with our target customer verticals and more than 80% of these customers are new relationships to Digital Realty. 
In addition, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, underscoring the value of these new customer relationships. As you know, this sales process was dictated by the European Commission with the clear objective of standing up a business that would be immediately competitive in the marketplace. What you may not know is that this business came staffed with 130 employees, including 16 sales and marketing professionals. In contrast to the Telx acquisition, we have not written -- underwritten any expense synergies in this acquisition. 
We are very pleased with the caliber of the personnel as well as the properties that we've acquired with this transaction, and we welcome these new employees to the Digital Realty family. 
In terms of integration, it's still early days, but we are actively working to ensure a smooth transition for the acquired business into the Digital Realty platform. And we are leveraging the lessons learned from the Telx integration to create a seamlessly repeatable process. 
Our teams are focused on communicating with our customers and employees, and we're executing on short-term objectives for the business, moving people, integrating processes and standardizing reporting. Over the next quarter, we'll finalize the plan to extend our colocation and interconnection platform, and we'll communicate it as appropriate. 
I should pause here for a moment to address the impact of Brexit. We did anticipate a potential Brexit scenario in our underwriting, and we did hedge the purchase price. But we have not altered our global strategy. Fundamentally, we do not believe the EU referendum will materially impact global data center demand or our global portfolio, as the secular demand drivers remain intact and the transatlantic cable landings have not moved. We believe our global platform is one of our key competitive advantages, and we do not plan to exit either the U.K. or Continental Europe, regardless of the outcome of the EU referendum.
Early in the third quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell our fully leased Saint-Denis Data Center in Paris Equinix for approximately $210 million or $575 per square foot. Also, early in the third quarter, we closed on the sale of a 4-property data center portfolio, as shown here on Page 4. The sales price was $115 million or roughly $250 per square foot. Excluding 251 Exchange, where the sole tenant is moving out this month, the portfolio cap rate is in the low 6s on forward contractual cash NOI and in the mid-7s, assuming the near-term expirations were to renew.
Since embarking on our capital recycling program in the second quarter of 2014, we have sold 10 properties and one investment, generating net proceeds of $420 million, not including the Paris property now under contract. 
As I've said previously, we've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of our noncore assets. And this portfolio sales substantially concludes our capital recycling program. We do, however, continue to believe that culling the asset base represents prudent real estate portfolio management, and you can reasonably expect to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly non-data center properties or one-off assets that no longer fit our Global Connected Campus strategy.
In terms of expanding our product offerings, we've been working closely with our customers and leveraging combined heritage of Digital Realty as a large footprint leader, in addition to the Telx colocation and interconnection legacy. We are close to launching our service exchange, which will further allow us to enable customers with dynamically interconnected large footprint and colocation data center solutions on a seamless connected campus, uniquely meeting customer requirements. 
The service exchange is core to empowering hybrid cloud and IoT architectures in an extremely efficient and agile manner. We look forward to providing more details over the coming months and unveiling the benefits of the service exchange with our robust cloud ecosystem partners. In addition, we are continuing to make solid progress on the Telx integration. We're executing our systems road map. That work is on track and is expected to continue for the next several quarters. We plan to Sunset the Telx brand during the third quarter, and we are in the process of unifying our multiproduct global sales force, which we also expect to complete during the third quarter. 
Along similar lines, our Partners and Alliances program continues to expand. I'm pleased to announce that CenturyLink, our largest -- second largest customer, has joined our program enhancing our options for connectivity, managed services and cloud services for our customers. During the second quarter, the partners in alliances program continue to drive revenues, including for hybrid cloud deployments that highlight the benefits of our Connected Campus strategy. I'm pleased with the progress that we are making. In addition to adding CenturyLink to our Partners and Alliances program during the second quarter, we have begun executing on transactions for hybrid cloud deployments with one of our best customers and partners in advance of our formal go-to-market campaign, which is set to begin shortly. As a result, we have already begun to realize revenue from this partnership, and we expect to see even greater uptake once we formally launch the campaign. 
During the first half of the year, the Partners and Alliances group increased the total contract value of deals executed by more than 20%, albeit on a homogenous [ph] base. The pipeline remains robust at approximately $40 million, even after several deals were executed during the second quarter. 
Now let's turn to market fundamentals on Page 5. New supplies picked up in Dallas and Northern Virginia over the past 90 days. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, demand is robust in both of these markets and pre-leasing levels on development pipelines are healthy. In addition, current market vacancy rates are low, and our own portfolios in these markets are, likewise, north of 90% leased. Northern Virginia and Dallas are both national data center markets, characterized by robust leasing velocity and solidly positive net absorption. 
And now let's turn to the macro environment on Page 6. The global economic outlook has deteriorated slightly over the past 90 days, primarily due to uncertainty in the wake of the Brexit referendum. The data center industry has the good fortune of being levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy. 
We believe it's still early days for cloud adoption, and the related build-out of cloud service providers compute node footprints, although cloud requirements are lumpy and price-sensitive. From where we sit, it looks like the wave of cloud service provider demand has not crested yet, and we see a set wave building on the horizon from the Internet of Things and connected devices. Gartner predicts that by 2018, 30% of enterprises will use cloud service providers' direct LAN cloud connectivity services up from less than 1% at the end of last year. 
Given this expected growth, strategic planners at the cloud providers are actively mapping out their approach. We believe that we are well positioned to support this continued growth, as we're one of the very few providers with the ability to meet the full spectrum of our customers' data center demand requirements on a global basis. 
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andy?"
11041860,339148287,1016737,"Digital Realty Trust Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill.

We signed new leases totaling $15 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, including a $6 million colocation space and power contribution. Interconnection contributed an additional $8 million, and our total bookings for the second quarter were a little over $22 million of annualized GAAP revenue. 
While this is towards the lower end of our recent activity levels, we are taking a much more selective approach to landing the right mix of customers to maximize the long-term value of our global connected campus footprint. We are winning diverse demand across attractive verticals, including cloud service providers, both big and small, along with other growing segments of the digital economy, IT service providers and other large sophisticated users. 
You'll note the appearance of a Fortune 50 hyperscale cloud service provider on our top 20 customer list this quarter. At the same time, we also added more than 40 new logos for the second consecutive quarter. Long story short, we are focused on landing demand from a diverse and growing customer set. Along those lines, I am pleased to report that during the month of July, we have already signed an additional $20 million of total bookings, including space, power and interconnection. This activity has included significant signings across all 3 geographic regions, including a healthy mix of large enterprise software cloud providers, hyperscale cloud providers, IT service providers and financial service customers. 
The total bookings figure includes $6 million of annualized colocation and interconnection bookings. In fact, the month of July has already been the best month for Telx since our acquisition. While we are not satisfied with the level of large footprint leasing during the second quarter, the pipeline for the second half is sizable, and we are cautiously optimistic that we are back on track to return to normalized activity levels in the second half of the year. 
Turning to our backlog, on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, stands at $70 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence within the next 12 months. The weighted average lag between second quarter signings and commencements was a record low at 1.5 months. 
Turning to renewal leasing activity, on Page 10. We retained 85% of second quarter lease expirations and we signed just under $60 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash releasing spread was up a little less than 3% overall, with a positive cash mark-to-market across all property types, including another quarter of plus 5% for colocation. This was a bit better than expected, largely because we did not execute renewals on the above market leases in Phoenix and on the East Coast that we had called out last quarter. We do still expect to renew those leases later this year. So we may see negative cash mark-to-market on our second half renewals. 
For the full year, we now expect releasing spreads to be slightly positive on a cash basis, up from our previous guidance of flat on a cash basis. In general, we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and the steady progress we're making on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. 
Let's turn to Telx here on Page 11. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $94 million of revenue during the second quarter, representing 9% growth year-over-year. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50, interconnection outpaced colocation with the year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 11%. From the legacy 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the second quarter. Telx continues to perform at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts, and we remain on-track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets. 
We have added a number of new sales reps who have already begun contributing to the success of this business. As part of integrating our global sales force, we plan to continue to add sales resources through the end of the year, including key positions to drive our vertical ecosystem development and solutions efforts. The colocation and interconnection strategy has been to focus on key facilities and drive growth associated with our ecosystem, including multisite customer wins. We are seeing progress across 5 emerging ecosystems: Networks, subsea cable systems, mobile, digital content and over-the-top distribution and the cloud community. 
During the second quarter, we announced that we landed another undersea cable system in our Hillsboro, Oregon, facility. Subsea cable systems are an area of particular focus for us, and we have had success to date in the Pacific Northwest where there has been a heightened interest in landing cables. In mid-May, we announced that we will be launching colocation and interconnection services on our Ashburn Compass during the third quarter. We're scheduled to launch in September, but the sales team has begun pre-selling the site and we already signed a handful of new deals. 
In addition, Atlanta had shown significant growth over the past few years and we're completely sold out. So we have begun working to bring on additional capacity to accommodate our overflow from 56 Marietta and should launch early next year. As mentioned last quarter, Marketplace Live will take place in New York on September 22. We look forward to providing updates on products and services and formally introducing our revised branding. And we hope many of you will be able to join us there.
In summary, at the one year mark since the Telx acquisition announcement, we're on-track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets and complete the integration process. 
Turning to our financial results, on Page 12. We reported 2Q '16 core FFO per share of $1.42, $0.04 ahead of consensus. The outperformance was fairly broad-based with the top line OpEx, G&A, and interest expense each $0.01 ahead of expectations. AFFO per share was, likewise, well ahead of plan, partially driven by the [indiscernible] FFO line as well as accretion from Telx and a further reduction in straight-line rental revenue, as shown on Page 13. 
Recurring CapEx was also down significantly again this quarter. Although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up in the second half of the year. Since a portion of the lower CapEx spend is essentially timing-related, the second quarter AFFO per share growth is somewhat inflated, but nonetheless, we are well on our way to delivering the double-digit AFFO per share growth we committed to at our Investor Day last October. 
The AFFO payout ratio is now sub-70%, and while we continue to view retained earnings as our cheapest source of equity capital, the current payout ratio provides flexibility and room for further dividend growth. The bottom line is that the quality of earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating, reflecting the improved underwriting discipline we've instilled over the past 2 years, along with consistently improving data center market fundamentals. 
As you may have seen from the press release, we raised our core FFO per share guidance by $0.10 at both ends of the range. We raised the full year projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points again this quarter, to 57% at the midpoint. You may recall from our Investor Day presentation last October that we set out a target of a 200-basis-point EBITDA margin expansion by 2018 from 55% to 57%. 
We are nowhere close to hanging out the mission accomplished banner today, and we do expect the EBITDA margin will continue to fluctuate over time as we reinvest in the business. But we are pleased with the progress we are making towards the final objective on our 3-year guidepost, achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in cash flow and value per share.
We also raised our 2016 same capital cash NOI growth guidance again this quarter by 150 basis points at the low end, up to 2.5% to 4% or roughly 3.5% to 5% on a constant currency basis. FX represented roughly a 50 to 100-basis-point drag on the year-over-year growth and reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on Page 14. I would like to remind you that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
As shown on Page 15, the U.K. represents approximately 13% of total revenues and approximately 5 percentage denominated in euros pro forma for the 8 property portfolio acquisition that closed in July. However, as you can see through the table in the middle of the page, we have over GBP 1 billion of debt outstanding, and we also completed our inaugural EUR 600 million bond offering earlier this year. 
We have effectively matched the currency of our assets with our liabilities in these markets. So our total European net asset exposure, including currency hedges, is less than 5%. We may tap the sterling bond market again, either later this year or earlier next, to further naturally hedge our sterling-denominated assets. 
Finally, I'd like to point out that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe is a key competitive advantage. 
In terms of our second quarter operating performance, same capital occupancy was flat sequentially at 93%. Overall portfolio occupancy dipped 50 basis points sequentially to 90.4%, due primarily to development deliveries placed in service in our highest demand markets. We expect overall portfolio occupancy to pick back up by the end of the year. Same-capital cash NOI was up 3.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would've been up approximately 3.6%. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet, beginning on Page 16. As you know, we executed forward equity offering in mid-May to permanently finance the European portfolio acquisition. The underwriters also exercised their over-allotment option in full. So we expect to receive total net proceeds of approximately 1.3 billion upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements. In the interest of time, I won't dwell on the mechanics today. But I would like to point out that we have included a slide here on Page 16 that does provide some detail on the mechanics on the forward sale agreements for those who may be interested. 
When we closed the portfolio acquisition in early July, we initially funded the purchase with a drawdown on our line of credit, in an effort to match sources and uses, which we've attempted to lay out for you on Page 17. In addition to the proceeds from the equity offering, we expected to close on the portfolio sale as well as the Paris option property. In terms of timing for the uses, the preferred equity is not redeemable and the mortgage debt is not pre-payable until later this summer. 
Consequently, we expect to settle all, or substantially all, of the forward sale agreements by the end of the third quarter, as we fund the additional use of the capital laid out here on Page 17. Remember that we can flex our line of credit up or down anytime, but the forward sale agreement is a one-way drawdown. 
Finally, on Page 18, we provided a recap of our 2016 Capital Markets activity on the right as well as the pro forma impact from the equity offering and the European portfolio acquisition on the left-hand side.

And yes, in keeping in alignment with what Andy stated in his opening remarks and especially in our core markets, but more broadly as well, we see stable to slightly improving rates, which also happened to be coupled with some of the great work that Jarrett's team is involved with and focused on, cost containment and designing construction. So we expect as this -- as the programs that we're developing right now move forward that to have even better performance from a pricing perspective, as our ecosystem development work that's underway right now starts to take hold. The pre-leasing rates in these markets similarly look, internationally in particular, the rates looks fairly strong. So strength in Chicago, in Ashburn, in Dallas and in Singapore, which is great given the new facility that we just launched."

And really since before the acquisition of Telx, but really with the acquisition of Telx and working closely with that team, we've been focused on making sure that the funnel is not just full, but it's full of the right opportunities and the right target accounts. Given our targeted focus on continuing social mobile, analytics cloud and content, but especially inside that cloud and social verticals, our funnel has been slightly -- it has had slightly improving margins in it currently. And I do say currently, because it's pipeline and we have to close. But we're pretty happy that we've been able to slightly expand the margin inside the funnel as we start to work together with multiple products. In addition, we've been working together very, very closely with multiple clouds -- large clouds service providers to make sure that we can match value for value going forward given their demand and given our capacity, and given the pipeline margins, this would give the pipeline margins for the rest of this fiscal year and moving in to Q1 of '17 potentially better outcome."

I think in terms of facing the customer and driving more revenue, these 2 that we mentioned on this call are the biggest that are kind of nearing the end zone. On the European portfolio acquisition, it's -- quite frankly, it's early days. We are delighted to receive approval from the commission and ultimately close on the acquisition what is, I guess, a handful of days or weeks ago. We think we got a really talented team, along with some very attractive assets coming on board.

I mean, quite frankly, we were fortunate, very similarly to our Telx acquisition, in buying a very strategic and complementary collection of assets and team members. In Europe previously, our position was much more anchored, I think, around our scale leasing and more campus-oriented products. What we've closed on with the 8 assets and that team is prized assets in the dockland of London or [indiscernible] Park or Amsterdam. Or actually -- in Frankfurt, it works very well with the land we purchased and a sales force oriented towards selling that small footprint, higher price point, colocation and interconnection-oriented offering. So that's -- what makes this one a little bit easier is that there's no expense synergies being sought here. We actually want to put additional resources to support the sales force. It's very complementary with the existing team over there. We'll be moving into our office on Gracechurch Street in -- within the month, where we had little space to fit the corporate team. And so I don't have a date definitive, but I think this one could actually integrate more efficiently or more timely than Telx.

So while I would certainly characterize it as you did, I was not pleased with what I'd call below-average scale product signings in the quarter. We do think that the pace was due to a couple of things that you mentioned, but also, the normal lumpiness has become part of our business, especially given the new hyper-scale demand that's out there but also, as you said, a more selective approach to making sure that we land the right mix of customers at the maximum -- to maximize the long-term value that we think we have inside of our ecosystem. So this means, as you said, one of the potential reasons for that number is our continued commitment to a disciplined approach of our -- to our underwriting criteria and focusing really on top-tier markets and not focusing on tertiary markets where some customers may have a desire to go and then maintaining a disciplined underwriting and pricing regimen to protect the long-term value. And on your second question, really, the overall demand remains strong. It's evidenced by the July that we've had so far in both sections of our global business as well as the healthy pipeline that I talked about, which has the potential for margin expansion as we move on. We do think that we are on track now to resume normal levels in the second half across all parts of the business in 2016. Specifically, though, with regard to your question about demand and cloud demand remaining strong, especially where we are in our global markets where we operate, it's important to remember that, that cloud business is still one of the fastest growing segments landing in our industry. And from analysts, from RightScale all the way through to Gartner, they all tend to agree that we are actually in the early innings of this new cloud ecosystem breaking out. We're also starting to see the green shoots. We're seeing mass adoption of a diversity of cloud players, not just the major cloud players and early adopters that are out there, which we think -- and to get to your last question, we think we're uniquely situated to be able to land. We do believe that we're the only company in this space that is very focused on providing great scale solutions for folks who need scale solutions, including those cloud service providers but also providing colocation right next to it at a latency that can't be beat as well as the security that comes with the power of private networking and our interconnection products. So we really think that the secular demand drivers in the cloud industry are continuing to push them, and we are uniquely situated to be able to address it."

While I always love to have a better fiscal second quarter, I rather have a better deal on July 1 than a less attractive deal on the 30th of June. So -- and I think you saw a little bit of that with the volume assignment that just got signed the first few days or weeks of the month of July. And just to put a little more meat on the bone, that's been from a diversity of different types of customers. It's included hyper-scale top 3 cloud providers, a sizable chunk from other cloud providers that aren't in that top 3 and then another chunk from the rest of what we call SMACC or the digital economy or IT service or other transaction verticals. So we're seeing our demand signings in the second quarter and July from diverse growing customer sets. The other thing I think that -- to draw a distinction, it's not just about pricing or profitability, too. We're really focused on driving the long-term growth in the cash flow and attractiveness and value of our assets in our campuses and our gateways with a diversity of different customers versus some of our peers who may be more focused on being in a non-core market to us or doing a full build to suit with one customer in one shot.

I could say at the larger end of the scale, the biggest buyers that buy in bulk and taking on numerous megawatts have the greatest pricing power, and their rates are certainly flat. They're not seeing any type of rent spike. If you walk down to the other side of the spectrum and look at our smallest footprint, colocation, I think you can look at the cash releasing spread, which is up now 5% for the second quarter, and it was a fairly sizable this quarter actually amount of leases [ph] just in terms of colocation that rolled up. So when we're able to roll these customers up 5%, we are able to generate some pricing power. Between those 2 goalposts, it's very market and customer episodic."

We had another very productive quarter characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. In particular, we further advanced our global footprint with the European portfolio acquisition. We also delivered solid current-period financial results. We beat The Street by $0.04 with better-than-expected results above and below the NOI line. We also delivered outsized AFFO per share growth during the quarter, the quality of our earnings is improving, and the growth in cash flow is accelerating. We raised guidance by $0.10 with an improving outlook for most of our key metrics and solid progress towards our 3-year target of 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet with proceeds from asset sales and a successful forward equity offering that coincided with our inclusion in the S&P 500 Index.
In conclusion, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan. Thank you all for joining us, and have a great summer."

Good afternoon, and thank you, all for joining us. We had another very productive quarter characterized by healthy leasing activity and solid execution against virtually every objective of our strategic plan, laid out here on Page 2 of our earnings deck. 
As you may have seen, we announced this afternoon that we've appointed Dan Paipes [ph] as Senior Vice President, Global Sales and Marketing. Dan was most recently President of Unified North America, formerly Siemens Networking Systems where he had responsibility for managing all aspects of the business with total ownership of the P&L. 
Dan is a technology industry veteran with a 27-year career with our largest customer, primarily in the outsourcing and managed services business, including roles as Vice President of Global Cloud Services Sales and Vice President of Global Telecommunications Industry Sales. He has experience leading global sales organizations and he has been responsible for driving significant growth revenues, deal volume and profitability. We are delighted to welcome Dan to the team. And we are confident that he is the right choice to help lead our global sales engine to the next level. 
I would like to take a moment here to thank Andrew Schaaf, who ran our Scale Sales team on an interim basis, along with Tony Resadi [ph] who continues to lead our Colocation and Interconnection line of business for their leadership and professionalism while we ran the search for a permanent sales and marketing leader. They are both key assets to our organization and the solid rebound in bookings during the third quarter is a direct testament to their capabilities and the depth of our talent. 
The third quarter capital allocation highlight was closing on the acquisition of a portfolio of 8 highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt as shown here on Page 3. This transaction was strategic and complimentary to our existing business. It was financially accretive and prudently financed. In terms of integration. We are underway towards a smooth transition of the acquired business into Digital Realty. 
In late September, we announced the appointment of Rob Copeland as Managing Director for the region. Rob previously served as Chief Operating Officer for Telecity, and we are delighted that he accepted our offer to stay on after the acquisition and lead our expanded regional platform. Also in September, we officially opened our Amsterdam data tower. The 72-meter high tower was designed and built using the latest advanced technologies and has over 5,000 square meters of space and will have fully build out IT load of 9 megawatts. 
Based on its location at the Amsterdam Science Park, our customers will have the ability to interconnect within a rich ecosystem of telecom organizations, Internet service providers and cable companies. In addition, we're on track to deliver the first of 3 phases of our 27-megawatt campus in Frankfurt in the second half of 2017 where we've seen significant demand from several customers, including the major global cloud service providers. We've also recently completed ISO certification of the newly acquired sites. 
Over the next quarter, we will be stabilizing our operations in the region and executing our business objectives. We also closed on the sale of our fully leased Saint-Denis data center in Paris during the third quarter as well as the previously announced sale of a 4 property domestic data center portfolio. We do still have 3 small assets held for sale on the balance sheet, but the completion of the portfolio sale substantially concludes the capital recycling program we embarked upon in the second quarter of 2014. 
As I've said on several occasions, we've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott Peterson and his team have achieved on the sale of our noncore assets. 
Let's turn to the expansion of our product offerings on Page 4. We announced the launch of our service exchange at marketplace live in September. The service exchange is an interconnection platform that facilitates direct, private and secure connections to multiple cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud platform and Microsoft Azure as well as telecommunications providers and other Digital Realty customers worldwide. 
Service exchange simplifies interconnection and makes access between interconnected services, providers and businesses more flexible, more scalable and easier to use than ever before. Upon launching in November, service exchange will offer significantly greater performance, reliability and security for cloud services and data center access in the public Internet. Service exchange is powered by Megaport, combining our respective core strengths. Digital Reality's high availability data center offerings cover the spectrum from single rack colocation to multiple megawatt deployments around the world to suit our customers current needs and to enable their future growth. 
Megaport, a leading provider of elastic interconnection, has developed a platform that will keep pace with innovative cloud technologies and continue to expand new markets. Service exchange is critical to our customers. A recent survey from Rightscale reports that 82% of enterprises are adopting a multi-cloud strategy citing security, managing multiple clouds and the lack of resources as the top 3 challenges of leveraging the cloud effectively. Service exchange accelerates adoption of public and hybrid cloud architectures by simplifying private access to multiple clouds. 
Our partners and alliances program continues to grow with several of our important partners sponsoring and participating in our very successful Marketplace Live event, highlighting the value of our ecosystem to our partners. During the third quarter, we executed hybrid cloud transactions with one of the best partners that highlights the value of our Global Connected Campus strategy. This program is expected to ramp up with our partner in the fourth quarter as we launch our go-to-market campaign in several markets. 
In addition, with the announcement of service exchange, we are seeing tremendous enthusiasm from our partners as well as several potential new partners seeking to incorporate the capabilities of service exchange into their own offerings. We're very excited about the expanded opportunities service exchange brings to our partnerships. Our pipeline via our partners and alliances program remains robust at approximately $40 million, and deals executed during the quarter through our bookings by nearly 20% since the launch of our partners and alliances program in early 2015. 
Let's turn now to market fundamentals on Page 5. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center markets, but so does net absorption as well as the level of pre-leasing on development pipelines. Demand is outpacing supply. Competitors are behaving rationally. New entrants remain few and far between. And we are seeing healthy consolidation. In addition to our solid leasing volume during the third quarter, our forward funnel is similarly robust. Based on the current sales pipeline, there's a good chance we will be completely sold out of the remaining inventory on our existing campuses in Ashburn, Virginia as well as Franklin Park in Chicago within the next couple of quarters. 
Given the current pace of absorption in the remaining inventory on our major connected campuses, we took steps to secure our supply chain and supply our customers future growth during the third quarter as shown here on Page 6 with the acquisition of land parcels adjacent to our existing campuses in Ashburnham and Chicago, as well as the site of a future campus in Garland Texas, once our Richardson campus is fully sold out. 
And now, let's turn to the macro environment on Page 7. The global economic outlook remains uncertain whereas we appear to be edging closer to an interest rate tightening cycle in the U.S. As I've said many times before, the drivers underpinning data center demand are secular in nature and growing faster than the broader economy. Similarly, we have built our organization to thrive regardless of our environment with irreplaceable global platform, a fortress balance sheet and a deep bench of incredibly talented, hard-working employees. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results."
11041860,403302114,1064189,"Digital Realty Trust Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity on Page 9. Our total bookings for the third quarter were a little over $55 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a 9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space a",2283,"Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity on Page 9. Our total bookings for the third quarter were a little over $55 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a 9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $46 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter, including an 8 million colocation contribution. Our third quarter signings speak to our ability to leverage our competitive advantages to win robust yet profitable demand from a diverse global customer set. 
Third quarter wins included top cloud service providers, signing across multiple locations and multiple continents. They also include a smaller but rapidly growing new customers signing across 4 different locations within North America alone. In addition, the team delivered an 18% increase in colocation and interconnection signings in the U.S. with our interconnection bookings, representing a record quarterly performance since our acquisition of Telx and 1 of the top 3 quarters in Telx's history. I would like to pause here to point out that we have revised our headline total bookings presentation to include the contribution from interconnection. We will continue to provide precisely the same information and the same level of granularity, but we will now be including the interconnection contribution in our total bookings to more closely align our presentation with our peers. 
At the market level, there's a lot of excitement in Chicago these days and I'm not just talking about the Cubbies. As Bill mentioned, we are nearing delivery and leasing of the last few megawatts on our Franklin Park campus, and we have secured the adjacent land parcel to support our continued growth. Subsequent to quarter end, we took assignment of a bespoke colocation reseller customers PBB lease for 83,000 rentable square feet at 350 SMACC in downtown Chicago, and we also took ownership of data center improvements and infrastructure with a total of nearly 6 megawatts of capacity, and original cost basis of approximately $85 million and a current fair market value of approximately $35 million. 
As part of this transaction, we took assignment of 15 colocation customer leases and entered into a new agreement with a reseller to maintain a smaller footprint in the building. This transaction did not require us to make any material payment to the reseller and provides us with more than 4.5 megawatts of immediately available IT load and customer-ready space in our flagship Internet Gateway, which has remained north of 96% leased for the past 6 years. 
Finally, we recently kicked off a marketing and pre-leasing campaign to lineup anchor tenants for a potential data center development project at 330 Cermak on a land parcel adjacent to our existing property 350 at Cermak. Turning to our backlog on Page 10. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, up $14 million from the prior quarter. The weighted average lag between third quarter signings and commencements, remain healthy at 4 months below the historical average of roughly 6 months. 
Turning to renewal leasing activity on Page 11. We retained 82% of the third quarter lease expirations and we signed $44 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash releasing spread was slightly positive with healthy cash mark-to-market on PBB, colo and non-technical space offset by a roll down on turnkey renewals. As expected, we did execute renewals on the above market leases in Phoenix that we have called out for the last couple of quarters, we started the rolldown on the third quarter turnkey renewals. We do still have several book market leases remaining now primarily in the Northeast region, so we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter. 
On balance however, we still expect releasing spreads will be slightly positive on a cash basis for full year 2016. In addition, we expect cash releasing spreads will also be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak finish lease expirations. 
In terms of our third quarter operating performance. Overall portfolio occupancy is down 50 basis points sequentially to 89.9%. As you can see from the occupancy bridge we provided here on Page 12, the primary driver of the dip in portfolio occupancy was the acquisition of the subs 70% lease portfolio in Europe, along with recent completions in space previously held for development that was placed in service during the third quarter. It's important to note that portfolio occupancy as measured on the basis of square footage, which does not always directly correspond to invested capital. 
If we turn to the next slide on Page 13, you'll see that the balance of available fully built out inventory relative to total inventory as measured on the y-axis has been reduced more than half. This dramatic reduction in our finished inventory has been directly responsible for the 140-basis-point improvement we have achieved in our return on invested capital over the same period, which we believe is truly remarkable achievement for a portfolio of our size. 
Let's turn to Telx here on Page 14. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $97 million of revenue during the third quarter. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50, interconnection outpaced colocation with the year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10%. From the legacy 20 locations and prior year expense synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the third quarter. While the quarterly increase in revenue continued to accelerate, EBITDA remained relatively flat due to timing of spend related to marketing activities around marketplace live and other initiatives as well as some costs associated with the final stages of our integration. 
We do expect enhanced revenue flow through going forward and incremental growth in EBITDA during the fourth quarter and on into next year. Key initiatives during the quarter, included the launch of colocation at our Ashburn campus, expansion underway at multiple new locations in North America as well as marketplace live. The strategy of the colocation and interconnection product line continues to be focused on key facilities both interconnection hubs and connected campuses to drive growth, and nurture awareness and understanding of the identified ecosystems. Many colocation customers may not be aware of key customers, vendors or partners that may be easily accessed within the same building or connected campus. Identifying these natural magnets and leveraging their position within the connectivity ecosystem attracts and breeds growth. 
With respect to expanding our customer base. We have emphasized the continued development of target verticals and communities. During the third quarter, colocation and interconnection -- the colocation interconnection team added 34 new customers across a variety of market segments. Year-to-date through September, 113 new customers have been added. In terms of market expansions. Our colocation and interconnection team is in the process of expanding its footprint across 8 markets in North America, representing more than 5 megawatts of incremental capacity not including the full transfer of 365 main in San Francisco completed earlier this year. 
We launched colocation services on our campus in Ashburn, Virginia during the third quarter. Funnel activity has met expectations and new sales bookings have been positive. The past expansion is also underway in Atlanta and will leverage the existing connected customer base at 56 Marietta, allowing customers to reach a robust media connectivity from the launch date through the use of diverse fiber extensions. Available capacity of 56 Marietta will be sufficient in the interim or customers may prepurchase facing power as needed. 
Finally, marketplace live 2016 was an overwhelming success with attendance at record levels. The enhanced format and expanded venue were well received by customers and provided an excellent backdrop for the announcement of the launch of our new service exchange in partnership with Megaport. In summary, we are pleased with the performance of the colocation and interconnection product line and look forward to continuing progress as we refine our go-to-market strategy to incorporate the ecosystem model, expand capacity and extend our colocation reach in North America and globally. 
As the one year mark postclosing, we are on-track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets and conclude the integration process. The volatility in currency during the quarter and in recent weeks continues to create a headwind with regard to growth. FX represented 100 to 200 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on Page 15. I would like to remind everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we look to continue this FX hedging strategy by issuing Sterling denominated debt over the next several months as part of our corporate funding plan to term out our balance outstanding under our revolver at that time. This financing will further reduce our exposure to currency fluctuation as we head into 2017. I would like to remind everyone that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy the data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe is a key competitive advantage. 
Same-capital cash NOI was up a little less than 1% on a reported basis and up a little more than 2% on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, same-capital cash NOI growth is positive 3.6% on a reported basis, and we still expect to be well within the guidance range of 2.5% to 4% for the full year. As you may have seen from the press release, we reported core FFO per share of $1.44 for the third quarter, an increase of 9% on a reported basis and up 11% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, we reiterated core FFO per share guidance of $5.65 to $5.75 on a reported basis and constant currency guidance of $5.70 to $5.90, representing 8% and 10% growth, respectively. 
Turning to the longer-term outlook on Page 16 that we introduced in our Investor Day last October. You may recall that we guided to a mid to high single-digit FFO per share growth and double-digit AFFO per-share growth in 2016. We're certainly tracking ahead of plan on both fronts. But notably, AFFO per-share growth that has been driven by year-to-date operating outperformance, accretion from Telx, the continued reduction in straight-line rental revenue and lower-than-expected recurring CapEx spend. 
For the full year, we now expect to deliver 20% growth in AFFO per share. Longer term, we do expect both FFO and AFFO per share growth to converge in the mid- to high single digits and we plan to give formal guidance for 2017 early next year. By way of preview, we do expect continued headwinds from the strong dollar and tougher comps to do a full year contribution from Telx as well the of the onetime benefits from AFFO in 2016. After external growth from acquisitions, which are inherently difficult to predict, we would expect to see somewhat slower growth in 2017 -- 2016 in both earnings and cash flow per share. 
That being said, we have delivered positive year-over-year growth in core FFO per share and dividends per share, each and every year as a public company and we do not expect 2017 will be any exception. Let's turn to the balance sheet beginning on Page 17. As anticipated on our last call in July, we settled the bulk of our forward sale agreements during the third quarter, issuing 12 million shares and generating net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion. A portion of the net proceeds were used to permanently finance the European acquisition portfolio for approximately $874 million. 
We also generated net proceeds of approximately $320 million from the asset sales Bill described earlier and we recognized a gain on sale on $169 [ph] million during the third quarter. We also redeemed our 7% series D [ph] preferred stock during the third quarter for approximately $290 million. We recognize a $10 million noncash top D-42 charge for the write-off the original issuance cost, which is an add back to core FFO. 
We also prepaid $136 million of mortgage debt, a 5.9% weighted average rate during the third quarter. We expect to retire an additional $108 million at an average coupon a little north of 6% during the fourth quarter. We expect to fund this paydown by settling the remaining 2.4 million shares, subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into this past May. Upon retirement of the mortgage debt prepayable during the fourth quarter, we will have just $3 million of secured debt remaining or well under 1% of total debt outstanding. We have also practically termed out short-term variable rate debt or longer-term fixed-rate financing, and as shown on Page 18, $40 million debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding. 
Even in a rising rate environment, a 100-basis-point move in LIBOR would impact full year FFO per share by roughly $0.03 or less than 1%. Our leverage is likewise
[Audio Gap]
on target with net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.1x at September 30, pro forma for the settlement of the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements debt-to-EBITDA will be less than 5x. Our balance sheet is poised

For new investment opportunities consistent with our long-term financing strategy.

There were some slight adjustments to some of the assumptions. We increased the EBITDA margin, I think 50 basis points in the low end, 30 basis points [indiscernible] on the SG&A. The change to the year-end portfolio occupancy to being down was really a product of a few things. One, we're absorbing obviously the European portfolio assets into the total portfolio occupancy and that number. And that number includes existing vacancy, that portfolio is roughly 66% leased as of the third quarter. Plus in addition to that, as you may have saw, we recently opened up our data tower in Amsterdam at the Science Park, which is a brand-new up to 9-megawatt asset, which is part of this transaction will also bring some vacancy into the quarter. And then the other major driver, I'd say is in connection with the transaction in Chicago in our 350 Cermak building where we took to the assignment of a PBB lease. That will obviously -- that will go from 100% occupied, 83,000 square feet to a much lower occupied amount with the existing colocation customers in the suites. Net-net, we think I'd say it was a great transaction for not only for the banks and customer but really, for digital in terms of getting our hands on very valuable, market-ready space in an incredibly hot market that's been -- north of 96% for numerous years now. And then going to your second question. Overall, the quarter, I think depending on whose metrics we either beat by $0.01 or met consensus estimates. But it's pretty much inline with our forecast. I think there was a handful of positive things that you thought worth highlighting. But one thing I'd say not negative, but something that may be put a little bit of a drag on our third quarter growth was the increase in the G&A, which was partly related to onboarding the European portfolio, which is what's expected. And I think an unexpected growth component of the G&A was some of the overall integration-related work on the onboarding from that acquisition, which closed in early July and travel and work to bring to that team to the fold.

Their interconnection model had a very significant portion of recurring revenue spend or similar -- not exact type of product position. But similar recurring revenue model. There will be further alignment across a global portfolio in terms of our interconnection services as we move forward. We've experienced, as you saw, a very strong quarter for our Internet connection signings quarter-over-quarter. And I think that is hopefully going to continue.

We weren't counting on 1 single customer to do a single 10 Meg deal. We had numerous customers the cloud service providers other parts of SMACC IT service. The demand was in North America but also in Europe. It was probably one of our best signings quarter in Europe for several quarters now. A good chunk of those signings were actually in the one to market post the Brexit vote. And those signings came from not only cloud service providers, they came from a disaster recovery firm. They came from an IT service firm. So lots of different demand drivers fueling our existing it signings and the final going into the fourth quarter.

But on an apples to apples basis, I wouldn't say we're seeing tremendous pricing pressure. The rates are held in relatively flat and the 1 20 is due to concentration in North America in those lower priced points market. And at those rates, those signs are still as you can see from an active development pipeline and generating returns on our invested capital unlevered returns right in our targeted thresholds of 10.5% to 12.5%."

We -- again, we're in -- have a fairly targeted approach to our colocation attraction efforts. We're not in all 50 states or 100 countries.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. We had another very productive quarter characterized by healthy leasing activity and solid execution against virtually every objective of our strategic plan laid out here on Page 2 of our earnings deck. 
As you may have seen, we announced this afternoon that we've appointed Dan Papes as Senior Vice President, Global Sales and Marketing. Dan was most recently President of Unify, North America, formerly Siemens Networking Systems where he had responsibility for managing all aspects of the business with total ownership of the P&L. 
Dan is a technology industry veteran with a 27-year career with our largest customer, primarily in the outsourcing and managed services business, including roles as Vice President of Global Cloud Services Sales and Vice President of Global Telecommunications Industry Sales. He has experience leading global sales organizations, and he has been responsible for driving significant growth in revenues, deal volume and profitability. We are delighted to welcome Dan to the team, and we are confident that he is the right choice to help lead our global sales engine to the next level. 
I would like to take a moment here to thank Andrew Schaap, who ran our scale sales team on an interim basis, along with Tony Rossabi, who continues to lead our colocation and interconnection line of business for their leadership and professionalism while we ran the search for a permanent sales and marketing leader. They are both key assets to our organization, and the solid rebound in bookings during the third quarter is a direct testament to their capabilities and the depth of our talent. 
The third quarter capital allocation highlight was closing on the acquisition of a portfolio of 8 highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt as shown here on Page 3. This transaction was strategic and complementary to our existing business. It was financially accretive and prudently financed. In terms of integration, we are underway towards a smooth transition of the acquired business into Digital Realty. 
In late September, we announced the appointment of Rob Coupland as Managing Director for the region. Rob previously served as Chief Operating Officer for Telecity, and we are delighted that he accepted our offer to stay on after the acquisition and lead our expanded regional platform. 
Also in September, we officially opened our Amsterdam Data Tower. The 72-meter high tower was designed and built using the latest advanced technologies and has over 5,000 square meters of space and will have fully built-out IT load of 9 megawatts. 
Based on its location at the Amsterdam Science Park, our customers will have the ability to interconnect within a rich ecosystem of telecom organizations, Internet service providers and cable companies. In addition, we are on track to deliver the first of 3 phases of our 27-megawatt campus in Frankfurt in the second half of 2017 where we've seen significant demand from several customers, including the major global cloud service providers. We've also recently completed ISO certification of the newly acquired sites. 
Over the next quarter, we'll be stabilizing our operations in the region and in executing on our business objectives. We also closed on the sale of our fully-leased Saint Denis data center in Paris during the third quarter as well as the previously announced sale of a 4-property domestic data center portfolio. We do still have 3 small assets held for sale on the balance sheet, but the completion of the portfolio sale substantially concludes the capital recycling program we embarked upon in the second quarter of 2014. As I've said on several occasions, we've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott Peterson and his team have achieved on the sale of our noncore assets. 
Let's turn to the expansion of our product offerings on Page 4. We announced the launch of our Service Exchange at MarketplaceLIVE in September. The Service Exchange is an interconnection platform that facilitates direct, private and secure connections to multiple cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure as well as telecommunications providers and other Digital Realty customers worldwide. 
Service Exchange simplifies the interconnection and makes access between interconnected services, providers and businesses more flexible more scalable and easier to use than ever before. Upon launching in November, Service Exchange will offer significantly greater performance, reliability and security for cloud services and data center access and the public Internet. Service Exchange is powered by Megaport, combining our respective core strengths. Digital Realty's high-availability data center offerings cover the spectrum from single-rack colocation to multiple-megawatt deployments around the world to suit our customers' current needs and to enable their future growth. 
Megaport, a leading provider of elastic interconnection, has developed a platform that will keep pace with innovative cloud technologies and continue to expand new markets. Service Exchange is critical to our customers. A recent survey from Rightscale reports that 82% of enterprises are adopting a multicloud strategy, citing security, managing multiple clouds and the lack of resources as the top 3 challenges of leveraging the cloud effectively. Service Exchange accelerates adoption of public and hybrid cloud architectures by simplifying private access to multiple clouds. 
Our partners and alliances program continues to grow, with several of our important partners sponsoring and participating in our very successful MarketplaceLIVE event, highlighting the value of our ecosystem to our partners. During the third quarter, we executed hybrid cloud transactions with one of the best partners that highlights the value of our global Connected Campus strategy. This program is expected to ramp up with our partner in the fourth quarter as we launch our go-to-market campaign in several markets. 
In addition, with the announcement of Service Exchange, we are seeing tremendous enthusiasm from our partners as well as several potential new partners seeking to incorporate the capabilities of Service Exchange into their own offerings. We're very excited about the expanded opportunities Service Exchange brings to our partnerships. Our pipeline via our partners and alliances program remains robust at approximately $40 million and deals executed during the quarter through our bookings by nearly 20% since the launch of our partners and alliances program in early 2015. 
Let's turn now to market fundamentals on Page 5. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center markets, but so does net absorption as well as the level of preleasing on development pipelines. Demand is outpacing supply. Competitors are behaving rationally. New entrants remain few and far in between, and we are seeing healthy consolidation. 
In addition to our solid leasing volume during the third quarter, our forward funnel is similarly robust. Based on the current sales pipeline, there's a good chance we will be completely sold out of the remaining inventory on our existing campuses in Ashburn, Virginia as well as Franklin Park in Chicago within the next couple of quarters. 
Given the current pace of absorption of remaining inventory on our major connected campuses, we took steps to secure our supply chain and supply our customers' future growth during the third quarter as shown here on Page 6 with the acquisition of land parcels adjacent to our existing campuses in Ashburn and Chicago as well as the site of a future campus in Garland, Texas, once our Richardson campus is fully sold out. 
And now let's turn to the macroenvironment on Page 7. The global economic outlook remains uncertain whereas we appear to be edging closer to an interest rate tightening cycle in the U.S. As I've said many times before, the drivers underpinning data center demand are secular in nature and growing faster than the broader economy. Similarly, we have built our organization to thrive regardless of our environment with irreplaceable global platform, a fortress balance sheet and a deep bench of incredibly talented, hardworking employees. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results."
11041860,403302114,1064573,"Digital Realty Trust Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity on Page 9. Our total bookings for the third quarter were a little over $55 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a 9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space a",2284,"Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity on Page 9. Our total bookings for the third quarter were a little over $55 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a 9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $46 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter, including an 8 million colocation contribution. Our third quarter signings speak to our ability to leverage our competitive advantages to win robust yet profitable demand from a diverse global customer set. 
Third quarter wins included top cloud service providers signing across multiple locations and multiple continents. They also include a smaller but rapidly growing new customer signing across 4 different locations within North America alone. In addition, the team delivered an 18% increase in colocation and interconnection signings in the U.S., with our interconnection bookings representing a record quarterly performance since our acquisition of Telx and 1 of the top 3 quarters in Telx' history. I would like to pause here to point out that we have revised our headline total bookings presentation to include the contribution from interconnection. We will continue to provide precisely the same information and the same level of granularity, but we will now be including the interconnection contribution in our total bookings to more closely align our presentation with our peers. 
At the market level, there's a lot of excitement in Chicago these days, and I'm not just talking about the Cubbies. As Bill mentioned, we are nearing delivery and leasing of the last few megawatts on our Franklin Park campus, and we have secured the adjacent land parcel to support our continued growth. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we took assignment of a bespoke colocation reselling a customer's PBB lease for 83,000 rentable square feet at 350 East Cermak in downtown Chicago, and we also took ownership of data center improvements and infrastructure with a total of nearly 6 megawatts of capacity, an original cost basis of approximately $85 million and a current fair market value of approximately $35 million. 
As part of this transaction, we took assignment of 15 colocation customer leases and entered into a new agreement with the reseller to maintain a smaller footprint in the building. This transaction did not require us to make any material payment to the reseller and provides us with more than 4.5 megawatts of immediately available IT load and customer-ready space in our flagship Internet Gateway, which has remained north of 96% leased for the past 6 years. 
Finally, we recently kicked off a marketing and preleasing campaign to line up anchor tenants for a potential data center development project at 330 East Cermak on a land parcel adjacent to our existing property 350 East Cermak. 
Turning to our backlog on Page 10. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, up $14 million from the prior quarter. The weighted average lag between third quarter signings and commencements remains healthy at 4 months, below the historical average of roughly 6 months. 
Turning to renewal leasing activity on Page 11. We retained 82% of the third quarter lease expirations, and we signed $44 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash releasing spread was slightly positive with healthy cash mark-to-market on PBB, colo and nontechnical space, offset by a roll-down on turnkey renewals. As expected, we did execute renewals on the above-market leases in Phoenix that we have called out for the last couple of quarters, which drove the roll-down on the third quarter turnkey renewals. We do still have several above-market leases remaining, now primarily in the Northeast region, so we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter. 
On balance, however, we still expect releasing spreads will be slightly positive on a cash basis for full year 2016. In addition, we expect cash releasing spreads will also be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak finish lease expirations. 
In terms of our third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy is down 50 basis points sequentially to 89.9%. As you can see from the occupancy bridge we provided here on Page 12, the primary driver of the dip in portfolio occupancy was the acquisition of the sub-70% leased portfolio in Europe along with recent completions in space previously held for development that was placed in service during the third quarter. It's important to note that portfolio occupancy is measured on the basis of square footage, which does not always directly correspond to invested capital. 
If we turn to the next slide on Page 13, you'll see that the balance of available fully built-out inventory relative to total inventory as measured on the y-axis has been reduced more than half. This dramatic reduction in our finished inventory has been directly responsible for the 140 basis point improvement we have achieved in our return on invested capital over the same period, which we believe is truly a remarkable achievement for a portfolio of our size. 
Let's turn to Telx here on Page 14. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $97 million of revenue during the third quarter. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50, interconnection outpaced colocation with year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10%. 
From the legacy 20 locations and prior year expense synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the third quarter. While the quarterly increase in revenue continued to accelerate, EBITDA remained relatively flat due to timing of spend related to marketing activities around MarketplaceLIVE and other initiatives as well as some costs associated with the final stages of our integration. 
We do expect enhanced revenue flow-through going forward and incremental growth in EBITDA during the fourth quarter and on into next year. Key initiatives during the quarter included the launch of colocation at our Ashburn campus, expansion underway at multiple new locations in North America as well as MarketplaceLIVE. The strategy of the colocation and interconnection product line continues to be a focus on key facilities, both interconnection hubs and connected campuses, to drive growth and nurture awareness and understanding of the identified ecosystems. 
Many colocation customers may not be aware of key customers, vendors or partners that may be easily accessed within the same building or connected campus. Identifying these natural magnets and leveraging their position within the connectivity ecosystem attracts and breeds growth. 
With respect to expanding our customer base. We have emphasized the continued development of target verticals and communities. During the third quarter, colocation and interconnection -- the colocation interconnection team added 34 new customers across a variety of market segments. Year-to-date through September, 113 new customers have been added. In terms of market expansions. Our colocation and interconnection team is in the process of expanding its footprint across 8 markets in North America, representing more than 5 megawatts of incremental capacity not including the full transfer of 365 Main in San Francisco completed earlier this year. 
We launched colocation services on our campus in Ashburn, Virginia during the third quarter. Funnel activity has met expectations, and new sales bookings have been positive. Capacity expansion is also underway in Atlanta and will leverage the existing meet-me-room of connected customer base at 56 Marietta, allowing customers to reach a robust media connectivity from the launch date through the use of diverse fiber extensions. Available capacity at 56 Marietta will be sufficient in the interim or customers may prepurchase space and power as needed. 
Finally, MarketplaceLIVE 2016 was an overwhelming success, with attendance at record levels. The enhanced format and expanded venue were well received by customers and provided an excellent backdrop for the announcement of the launch of our new Service Exchange in partnership with Megaport. 
In summary, we are pleased with the performance of the colocation and interconnection product line and look forward to continued progress as we refine our go-to-market strategy to incorporate the ecosystem model, expand capacity and extend our colocation reach in North America and globally. At the 1-year mark postclosing, we are on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets and conclude the integration process. 
The volatility in currencies during the quarter and in recent weeks continues to create a headwind with regard to growth. FX represented 100 to 200 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on Page 15. I would like to remind everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. 
Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will look to continue this FX hedging strategy by issuing sterling-denominated debt over the next several months as part of our corporate funding plan to term out our balance outstanding under our revolver at that time. This financing will further reduce our exposure to currency fluctuation as we head into 2017. I 
would like to remind everyone that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy the data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe is a key competitive advantage. 
Same-capital cash NOI was up a little less than 1% on a reported basis and up a little more than 2% on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, same-capital cash NOI growth is positive 3.6% on a reported basis, and we still expect to be well within the guidance range of 2.5% to 4% for the full year. As you may have seen from the press release, we reported core FFO per share of $1.44 for the third quarter, an increase of 9% on a reported basis and up 11% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, we reiterated core FFO per share guidance of $5.65 to $5.75 on a reported basis and constant currency guidance of $5.70 to $5.90, representing 8% and 10% growth, respectively. 
Turning to the longer-term outlook on Page 16 that we introduced on our Investor Day last October. You may recall that we guided to a mid to high single-digit FFO per share growth and double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2016. We're certainly tracking ahead of plan on both fronts but, notably, AFFO per share growth that has been driven by year-to-date operating outperformance, accretion from Telx, the continued reduction in straight-line rental revenue and lower-than-expected recurring CapEx spend. 
For the full year, we now expect to deliver 20% growth in AFFO per share. Longer term, we do expect both FFO and AFFO per share growth to converge in the mid- to high single digits, and we plan to give formal guidance for 2017 early next year. 
By way of preview, we do expect continued headwinds from the strong dollar and tougher comps due to a full year contribution from Telx as well the burn-off of the onetime benefits to AFFO in 2016. 
Absent external growth from acquisitions, which are inherently difficult to predict, we would expect to see somewhat slower growth in 2017 than in 2016 in both earnings and cash flow per share. That being said, we have delivered positive year-over-year growth in core FFO per share and dividends per share each and every year as a public company, and we do not expect 2017 will be any exception. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet beginning on Page 17. As anticipated on our last call in July, we settled the bulk of our forward sale agreements during the third quarter, issuing 12 million shares and generating net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion. A portion of the net proceeds was used to permanently finance the European acquisition portfolio for approximately $874 million. 
We also generated net proceeds of approximately $320 million from the asset sales Bill described earlier, and we recognized a gain on sale of $169 million during the third quarter. We also redeemed our 7% series E preferred stock during the third quarter for approximately $290 million. We recognized a $10 million noncash Topic D-42 charge for the write-off of the original issuance cost, which is an add-back to core FFO. 
We also prepaid $136 million of mortgage debt at a 5.9% weighted average interest rate during the third quarter. We expect to retire an additional $108 million at an average coupon a little north of 6% during the fourth quarter. We expect to fund this pay-down by settling the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into this past May. Upon retirement of the mortgage debt prepayable during the fourth quarter, we will have just $3 million of secured debt remaining or well under 1% of total debt outstanding. We have also practically termed out short-term variable rate debt or longer-term fixed-rate financing. And as shown on Page 18, floating-rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding. 
Even in a rising rate environment, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would impact full year FFO per share by roughly $0.03 or less than 1%. Our leverage is likewise on target, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.1x at September 30. Pro forma for the settlement of the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements, debt-to-EBITDA will be less than 5x. Our balance sheet is poised for new investment opportunities consistent with our long-term financing strategy. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be please to take your questions. Ed, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

There were some slight adjustments to some of the assumptions. We increased the EBITDA margin, I think, 50 basis points in the low end, a 30 basis point tweak on the G&A. The change to the year-end portfolio occupancy to being down was really a product of a few things. One, we're absorbing the -- obviously, the European portfolio assets into the total portfolio occupancy in that number. And that number includes the existing vacancy. That portfolio is roughly 66% leased as of the third quarter. Plus in addition to that, as you may have saw, we recently opened up our Data Tower in Amsterdam at the Science Park, which is a brand-new up to 9 megawatts asset, which is part of this transaction. It will also bring some vacancy into the quarter. And then the other major driver I'd say is in connection with the transaction in Chicago in our 350 Cermak building where we took to the assignment of a PBB lease. That will -- obviously, that will go from 100% occupied, 83,000 square feet, to a much lower occupied amount with the existing colocation customers in the suite. Net-net, we think that's a -- it was a great transaction for -- not only for the exiting customer but really, for digital in terms of getting our hands on very valuable market-ready space in an incredibly hot market that's been -- that asset's been north of 96% for numerous years now. And then going to your second question. Overall, the quarter, I think depending on whose metrics we either beat by $0.01 or net consensus estimates, but it was pretty much in line with our forecast. I think there was a handful of positive things that you probably were highlighting. The one thing I'd say, not negative, but something that maybe put a little bit of a drag on our third quarter growth was the increase in the G&A, which was partly related to onboarding the European portfolio, which is what's expected. I think an unexpected growth component of the G&A was some of the overall integration-related work on the onboarding from that acquisition, which closed in early July and travel and work to bring to that team into the fold and some -- probably some other activity around the -- or seasonally-related activity around our MarketplaceLIVE initiative and other events. And the last thing -- I'm thinking on the top of my head -- we did bring on 2 new board members during the quarter, which has a little bit of incremental cost to the company. But I think they will be well worth it in the long run."

Their interconnection model had a very significant portion of recurring revenue spend or similar -- not exact type of productization but similar recurring revenue model. There will be further alignment across the global portfolio in terms of our interconnection services as we move forward. We've experienced, as you saw, a very strong quarter for our interconnection signings quarter-over-quarter. And I think that is hopefully going to continue, and I think we will find this continue, those 8 parts of the portfolio.

I'm -- net-net, I was pretty happy where the third quarter came out. I think there's some key takeaways that, when I look through it, it was somewhat in our script. The demand was robust and diverse. We weren't counting on one single customer to do a single 10-MW deal. We had numerous customers, be it cloud service providers, other parts of SMACC, IT service. The demand was in North America but also in Europe. It was probably one of our best signings quarter in Europe for several quarters now. A good chunk of those signings were actually in the London market post the Brexit vote, and those signings came from not only cloud service providers. They came from a disaster recovery firm. They came from an IT service firm. So lots of different demand drivers fueling our existing signings in our funnel going into the fourth quarter. I wouldn't tell you I could bank on $55 million again in the fourth quarter, but I think we'll have that pretty steady-Eddie run rate trend.

Or is it perhaps even just a mix shift in terms of the assets you have now versus what you may have had going into 2016.

So the Turn-Key Flex product is what we'd call scale or previously called the wholesale. The bulk of the active in North America are Northern Virginia, Chicago and Dallas, was soft actually with Silicon Valley kind of following after that in terms of demand. And it's been -- it was a robust quarter, and the pipeline for the fourth quarter remains robust as well. It's a significant amount of repeat business. It's a significant amount of multisite business. It's business where customer's signing at one time on multiple continents with us. The size of the deals most recently kind of range from, call it, almost 1 MW to almost 4 MWs in terms of size of scale deal. So there's some variability in that. Some of the bigger customers are taking bigger deployments. I already touched on some of the pricing trends there. On the colocation, interconnection side, you're really seeing, I think -- so the combinations of success really is strategic Internet Gateway assets, a talented sales and marketing organization around them executing on filling those assets up, and these assets command higher prices given what they offer to the customers that decide to deploy in these locations. We -- again, we are in -- we're -- have a fairly targeted approach to our colocation, interconnection efforts. We're not in all 50 states or 100 countries. We picked our spots to be in the Internet Gateways, the Internet hubs or in select connected campuses, which have connectivity to the cloud service providers for the enterprise. So I think where we've picked our spots and how we've tackled, it's been able to generate pretty strong volumes at attractive rates that have increased in the -- over last quarter on the colo front."

He has experience leading global sales organizations, and he has been responsible for driving significant growth in revenues, deal volume and profitability. We are delighted to welcome Dan to the team, and we are confident that he is the right choice to help lead our global sales engine to the next level. 
I would like to take a moment here to thank Andrew Schaap, who ran our scale sales team on an interim basis, along with Tony Rossabi, who continues to lead our colocation and interconnection line of business for their leadership and professionalism while we ran the search for a permanent sales and marketing leader. They are both key assets to our organization, and the solid rebound in bookings during the third quarter is a direct testament to their capabilities and the depth of our talent. 
The third quarter capital allocation highlight was closing on the acquisition of a portfolio of 8 highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt as shown here on Page 3. This transaction was strategic and complementary to our existing business. It was financially accretive and prudently financed. In terms of integration, we are underway towards a smooth transition of the acquired business into Digital Realty. 
In late September, we announced the appointment of Rob Coupland as Managing Director for the region. Rob previously served as Chief Operating Officer for Telecity, and we are delighted that he accepted our offer to stay on after the acquisition and lead our expanded regional platform. 
Also in September, we officially opened our Amsterdam Data Tower. The 72-meter high tower was designed and built using the latest advanced technologies and has over 5,000 square meters of space and will have fully built-out IT load of 9 megawatts. 
Based on its location at the Amsterdam Science Park, our customers will have the ability to interconnect within a rich ecosystem of telecom organizations, Internet service providers and cable companies. In addition, we are on track to deliver the first of 3 phases of our 27-megawatt campus in Frankfurt in the second half of 2017 where we've seen significant demand from several customers, including the major global cloud service providers. We've also recently completed ISO certification of the newly acquired sites. 
Over the next quarter, we'll be stabilizing our operations in the region and executing on our business objectives. We also closed on the sale of our fully-leased Saint Denis data center in Paris during the third quarter as well as the previously announced sale of a 4-property domestic data center portfolio. We do still have 3 small assets held for sale on the balance sheet, but the completion of the portfolio sale substantially concludes the capital recycling program we embarked upon in the second quarter of 2014. As I've said on several occasions, we've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott Peterson and his team have achieved on the sale of our noncore assets. 
Let's turn to the expansion of our product offerings on Page 4. We announced the launch of our Service Exchange at MarketplaceLIVE in September. The Service Exchange is an interconnection platform that facilitates direct, private and secure connections to multiple cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure as well as telecommunications providers and other Digital Realty customers worldwide. 
Service Exchange simplifies the interconnection and makes access between interconnected services, providers and businesses more flexible, more scalable and easier to use than ever before. Upon launching in November, Service Exchange will offer significantly greater performance, reliability and security for cloud services and data center access than the public Internet. Service Exchange is powered by Megaport, combining our respective core strengths. Digital Realty's high-availability data center offerings cover the spectrum from single-rack colocation to multiple-megawatt deployments around the world to suit our customers' current needs and to enable their future growth. 
Megaport, a leading provider of elastic interconnection, has developed a platform that will keep pace with innovative cloud technologies and continue to expand to new markets. Service Exchange is critical to our customers. A recent survey from Rightscale reports that 82% of enterprises are adopting a multicloud strategy, citing security, managing multiple clouds and a lack of resources as the top 3 challenges of leveraging the cloud effectively. Service Exchange accelerates adoption of public and hybrid cloud architectures by simplifying private access to multiple clouds. 
Our partners and alliances program continues to grow, with several of our important partners sponsoring and participating in our very successful MarketplaceLIVE event, highlighting the value of our ecosystem to our partners. During the third quarter, we executed hybrid cloud transactions with one of the best partners that highlights the value of our global Connected Campus strategy. This program is expected to ramp up with our partner in the fourth quarter as we launch our go-to-market campaign in several markets. 
In addition, with the announcement of Service Exchange, we are seeing tremendous enthusiasm from our partners as well as several potential new partners seeking to incorporate the capabilities of Service Exchange into their own offerings. We're very excited about the expanded opportunities Service Exchange brings to our partnerships. Our pipeline via our partners and alliances program remains robust at approximately $40 million and deals executed during the quarter grew our bookings by nearly 20% since the launch of our partners and alliances program in early 2015. 
Let's turn now to market fundamentals on Page 5. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center markets, but so does net absorption as well as the level of preleasing on development pipelines. Demand is outpacing supply. Competitors are behaving rationally. New entrants remain few and far between, and we are seeing healthy consolidation. 
In addition to our solid leasing volume during the third quarter, our forward funnel is similarly robust. Based on the current sales pipeline, there's a good chance we will be completely sold out of the remaining inventory on our existing campuses in Ashburn, Virginia as well as Franklin Park in Chicago within the next couple of quarters. 
Given the current pace of absorption of the remaining inventory on our major connected campuses, we took steps to secure our supply chain and supply our customers' future growth during the third quarter as shown here on Page 6 with the acquisition of land parcels adjacent to our existing campuses in Ashburn and Chicago as well as the site of a future campus in Garland, Texas, once our Richardson campus is fully sold out. 
And now let's turn to the macroenvironment on Page 7. The global economic outlook remains uncertain whereas we appear to be edging closer to an interest rate tightening cycle in the U.S. As I've said many times before, the drivers underpinning data center demand are secular in nature and growing faster than the broader economy. Similarly, we have built our organization to thrive regardless of our environment with irreplaceable global platform, a fortress balance sheet and a deep bench of incredibly talented, hardworking employees. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results."
11041860,403302114,1064630,"Digital Realty Trust Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity on Page 9. Our total bookings for the third quarter were a little over $55 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a 9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space a",2285,"Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity on Page 9. Our total bookings for the third quarter were a little over $55 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a 9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $46 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter, including an 8 million colocation contribution. Our third quarter signings speak to our ability to leverage our competitive advantages to win robust yet profitable demand from a diverse global customer set. 
Third quarter wins included top cloud service providers signing across multiple locations and multiple continents. They also include a smaller but rapidly growing new customer signing across 4 different locations within North America alone. In addition, the team delivered an 18% increase in colocation and interconnection signings in the U.S., with our interconnection bookings representing a record quarterly performance since our acquisition of Telx and 1 of the top 3 quarters in Telx' history. I would like to pause here to point out that we have revised our headline total bookings presentation to include the contribution from interconnection. We will continue to provide precisely the same information and the same level of granularity, but we will now be including the interconnection contribution in our total bookings to more closely align our presentation with our peers. 
At the market level, there's a lot of excitement in Chicago these days, and I'm not just talking about the Cubbies. As Bill mentioned, we are nearing delivery and leasing of the last few megawatts on our Franklin Park campus, and we have secured the adjacent land parcel to support our continued growth. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we took assignment of a bespoke colocation reselling a customer's PBB lease for 83,000 rentable square feet at 350 East Cermak in downtown Chicago, and we also took ownership of data center improvements and infrastructure with a total of nearly 6 megawatts of capacity, an original cost basis of approximately $85 million and a current fair market value of approximately $35 million. 
As part of this transaction, we took assignment of 15 colocation customer leases and entered into a new agreement with the reseller to maintain a smaller footprint in the building. This transaction did not require us to make any material payment to the reseller and provides us with more than 4.5 megawatts of immediately available IT load and customer-ready space in our flagship Internet Gateway, which has remained north of 96% leased for the past 6 years. 
Finally, we recently kicked off a marketing and preleasing campaign to line up anchor tenants for a potential data center development project at 330 East Cermak on a land parcel adjacent to our existing property at 350 East Cermak. 
Turning to our backlog on Page 10. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, up $14 million from the prior quarter. The weighted average lag between third quarter signings and commencements remains healthy at 4 months, below the historical average of roughly 6 months. 
Turning to renewal leasing activity on Page 11. We retained 82% of the third quarter lease expirations, and we signed $44 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash releasing spread was slightly positive with healthy cash mark-to-market on PBB, colo and nontechnical space, offset by a roll-down on turnkey renewals. As expected, we did execute renewals on the above-market leases in Phoenix that we have called out for the last couple of quarters, which drove the roll-down on the third quarter turnkey renewals. We do still have several above-market leases remaining, now primarily in the Northeast region, so we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter. 
On balance, however, we still expect releasing spreads will be slightly positive on a cash basis for full year 2016. In addition, we expect cash releasing spreads will also be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak finish lease expirations. 
In terms of our third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy is down 50 basis points sequentially to 89.9%. As you can see from the occupancy bridge we provided here on Page 12, the primary driver of the dip in portfolio occupancy was the acquisition of the sub-70% leased portfolio in Europe along with recent completions in space previously held for development that was placed in service during the third quarter. It's important to note that portfolio occupancy is measured on the basis of square footage, which does not always directly correspond to invested capital. 
If we turn to the next slide on Page 13, you'll see that the balance of available fully built-out inventory relative to total inventory as measured on the y-axis has been reduced more than half. This dramatic reduction in our finished inventory has been directly responsible for the 140 basis point improvement we have achieved in our return on invested capital over the same period, which we believe is truly a remarkable achievement for a portfolio of our size. 
Let's turn to Telx here on Page 14. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $97 million of revenue during the third quarter. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50, interconnection outpaced colocation with year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10%. 
From the legacy 20 locations and prior year expense synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the third quarter. While the quarterly increase in revenue continued to accelerate, EBITDA remained relatively flat due to timing of spend related to marketing activities around MarketplaceLIVE and other initiatives as well as some costs associated with the final stages of our integration. 
We do expect enhanced revenue flow-through going forward and incremental growth in EBITDA during the fourth quarter and on into next year. Key initiatives during the quarter included the launch of colocation at our Ashburn campus, expansion underway at multiple new locations in North America as well as MarketplaceLIVE. The strategy of the colocation and interconnection product line continues to be a focus on key facilities, both interconnection hubs and connected campuses, to drive growth and nurture awareness and understanding of the identified ecosystems. 
Many colocation customers may not be aware of key customers, vendors or partners that may be easily accessed within the same building or connected campus. Identifying these natural magnets and leveraging their position within the connectivity ecosystem attracts and breeds growth. 
With respect to expanding our customer base. We have emphasized the continued development of target verticals and communities. During the third quarter, colocation and interconnection -- the colocation interconnection team added 34 new customers across a variety of market segments. Year-to-date through September, 113 new customers have been added. In terms of market expansions, our colocation and interconnection team is in the process of expanding its footprint across 8 markets in North America, representing more than 5 megawatts of incremental capacity not including the full transfer of 365 Main in San Francisco completed earlier this year. 
We launched colocation services on our campus in Ashburn, Virginia during the third quarter. Funnel activity has met expectations, and new sales bookings have been positive. Capacity expansion is also underway in Atlanta and will leverage the existing meet-me-room of connected customer base at 56 Marietta, allowing customers to reach a robust media connectivity from the launch date through the use of diverse fiber extensions. Available capacity at 56 Marietta will be sufficient in the interim or customers may prepurchase space and power as needed. 
Finally, MarketplaceLIVE 2016 was an overwhelming success, with attendance at record levels. The enhanced format and expanded venue were well received by customers and provided an excellent backdrop for the announcement of the launch of our new Service Exchange in partnership with Megaport. 
In summary, we are pleased with the performance of the colocation and interconnection product line and look forward to continued progress as we refine our go-to-market strategy to incorporate the ecosystem model, expand capacity and extend our colocation reach in North America and globally. At the 1-year mark postclosing, we are on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets and conclude the integration process. 
The volatility in currencies during the quarter and in recent weeks continues to create a headwind with regard to growth. FX represented 100 to 200 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on Page 15. I would like to remind everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. 
Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will look to continue this FX hedging strategy by issuing sterling-denominated debt over the next several months as part of our corporate funding plan to term out our balance outstanding under our revolver at that time. This financing will further reduce our exposure to currency fluctuation as we head into 2017. I 
would like to remind everyone that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy the data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe is a key competitive advantage. 
Same-capital cash NOI was up a little less than 1% on a reported basis and up a little more than 2% on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, same-capital cash NOI growth is positive 3.6% on a reported basis, and we still expect to be well within the guidance range of 2.5% to 4% for the full year. As you may have seen from the press release, we reported core FFO per share of $1.44 for the third quarter, an increase of 9% on a reported basis and up 11% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, we reiterated core FFO per share guidance of $5.65 to $5.75 on a reported basis and constant currency guidance of $5.70 to $5.90, representing 8% and 10% growth, respectively. 
Turning to the longer-term outlook on Page 16 that we introduced on our Investor Day last October. You may recall that we guided to a mid to high single-digit FFO per share growth and double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2016. We're certainly tracking ahead of plan on both fronts but, notably, AFFO per share growth that has been driven by year-to-date operating outperformance, accretion from Telx, the continued reduction in straight-line rental revenue and lower-than-expected recurring CapEx spend. 
For the full year, we now expect to deliver 20% growth in AFFO per share. Longer term, we do expect both FFO and AFFO per share growth to converge in the mid- to high single digits, and we plan to give formal guidance for 2017 early next year. 
By way of preview, we do expect continued headwinds from the strong dollar and tougher comps due to a full year contribution from Telx as well the burn-off of the onetime benefits to AFFO in 2016. 
Absent external growth from acquisitions, which are inherently difficult to predict, we would expect to see somewhat slower growth in 2017 than in 2016 in both earnings and cash flow per share. That being said, we have delivered positive year-over-year growth in core FFO per share and dividends per share each and every year as a public company, and we do not expect 2017 will be any exception. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet beginning on Page 17. As anticipated on our last call in July, we settled the bulk of our forward sale agreements during the third quarter, issuing 12 million shares and generating net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion. A portion of the net proceeds was used to permanently finance the European acquisition portfolio for approximately $874 million. 
We also generated net proceeds of approximately $320 million from the asset sales Bill described earlier, and we recognized a gain on sale of $169 million during the third quarter. We also redeemed our 7% series E preferred stock during the third quarter for approximately $290 million. We recognized a $10 million noncash Topic D-42 charge for the write-off of the original issuance cost, which is an add-back to core FFO. 
We also prepaid $136 million of mortgage debt at a 5.9% weighted average interest rate during the third quarter. We expect to retire an additional $108 million at an average coupon a little north of 6% during the fourth quarter. We expect to fund this pay-down by settling the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into this past May. Upon retirement of the mortgage debt prepayable during the fourth quarter, we will have just $3 million of secured debt remaining or well under 1% of total debt outstanding. We have also practically termed out short-term variable rate debt or longer-term fixed-rate financing. And as shown on Page 18, floating-rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding. 
Even in a rising rate environment, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would impact full year FFO per share by roughly $0.03 or less than 1%. Our leverage is likewise on target, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.1x at September 30. Pro forma for the settlement of the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements, debt-to-EBITDA will be less than 5x. Our balance sheet is poised for new investment opportunities consistent with our long-term financing strategy. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Ed, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

There were some slight adjustments to some of the assumptions. We increased the EBITDA margin, I think, 50 basis points in the low end, a 30 basis point tweak on the G&A. The change to the year-end portfolio occupancy to being down was really a product of a few things. One, we're absorbing the -- obviously, the European portfolio assets into the total portfolio occupancy in that number. And that number includes the existing vacancy. That portfolio is roughly 66% leased as of the third quarter. Plus in addition to that, as you may have saw, we recently opened up our Data Tower in Amsterdam at the Science Park, which is a brand-new up to 9 megawatts asset, which is part of this transaction. It will also bring some vacancy into the quarter. And then the other major driver I'd say is in connection with the transaction in Chicago in our 350 Cermak building where we took to the assignment of a PBB lease. That will -- obviously, that will go from a 100% occupied, 83,000 square feet, to a much lower occupied amount with the existing colocation customers in the suite. Net-net, we think that's a -- it was a great transaction for -- not only for the exiting customer but really, for digital in terms of getting our hands on very valuable market-ready space in an incredibly hot market that's been -- that asset's been north of 96% for numerous years now. And then going to your second question. Overall, the quarter, I think depending on whose metrics we either beat by $0.01 or met consensus estimates, but it was pretty much in line with our forecast. I think there was a handful of positive things that you probably were highlighting. The one thing I'd say, not negative, but something that maybe put a little bit of a drag on our third quarter growth was the increase in the G&A, which was partly related to onboarding the European portfolio, which is what's expected. I think an unexpected growth component of the G&A was some of the overall integration-related work on the onboarding from that acquisition, which closed in early July and travel and work to bring to that team into the fold and some -- probably some other activity around the -- or seasonally-related activity around our MarketplaceLIVE initiative and other events. And the last thing -- I'm thinking on the top of my head -- we did bring on 2 new board members during the quarter, which adds a little bit of incremental cost to the company. But I think they will be well worth it in the long run."

It's quite rapid, but I think the key is continuing to bring on space at these various interconnection-dense locations as one part to spur additional interconnection revenue. So -- and I think we're doing that by expanding in the likes of 56 Marietta, expanding of -- getting additional inventory in Cermak and other locations. And then I think the next leg of it will be leveraging the interconnection revenue that will come from the enterprise to cloud coming off of the Service Exchange.

Given the fact that you now have some additional availability here in Chicago, you've got a new Head of Sales in place, some other development availability in the European portfolio as well, then I guess, should we expect some steady increases in those bookings numbers?

But if you look at the third quarter, which is a quarter that quite frankly, we were without a Global Head of Sales for 2/3 of it and had a tremendous effort by both Andrew Schaap and Tony Rossabi stepping up to deliver for us. I'm -- net-net, I was pretty happy where the third quarter came out. I think there's some key takeaways that, when I look through it, it was somewhat in our script. The demand was robust and diverse. We weren't counting on one single customer to do a single 10-MW deal. We had numerous customers, be it cloud service providers, other parts of SMACC, IT service. The demand was in North America but also in Europe. It was probably one of our best signings quarter in Europe for several quarters now. A good chunk of those signings were actually in the London market post the Brexit vote, and those signings came from not only cloud service providers, they came from a disaster recovery firm. They came from an IT service firm. So lots of different demand drivers fueling our existing signings and our funnel going into the fourth quarter. I wouldn't tell you I could bank on $55 million again in the fourth quarter, but I think we've got that pretty steady-Eddie run rate trend.  If you look back, I think we have in our slide deck a rolling LTM number that kind of looks how our trends are fairly smooth if you look over a long time period."

It's a significant amount of multisite business. It's business where customer's signing at one time on multiple continents with us. The size of the deals most recently kind of range from, call it, almost 1 MW to almost 4 MWs in terms of size of scale deal. So there's some variability in that. Some of the bigger customers are taking bigger deployments. I already touched on some of the pricing trends there. On the colocation, interconnection side, you're really seeing, I think, the combinations of success really strategic Internet Gateway assets, a talented sales and marketing organization around them executing on filling those assets up. And these assets command higher prices given what they offer the customers that decide to deploy in these locations. We -- again, we are in -- we have a fairly targeted approach to our colocation, interconnection efforts. We're not in all 50 states or 100 countries. We picked our spots to be in the Internet Gateways, the Internet hubs or in select connected campuses, which have connectivity to the cloud service providers for the enterprise. So I think where we've picked our spots and how we've tackled, it's been able to generate pretty strong volumes at attractive rates that have increased in the -- over last quarter on the colo front."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. We had another very productive quarter characterized by healthy leasing activity and solid execution against virtually every objective of our strategic plan laid out here on Page 2 of our earnings deck. 
As you may have seen, we announced this afternoon that we've appointed Dan Papes as Senior Vice President, Global Sales and Marketing. Dan was most recently President of Unify, North America, formerly Siemens Networking Systems where he had responsibility for managing all aspects of the business with total ownership of the P&L. 
Dan is a technology industry veteran with a 27-year career with our largest customer, primarily in the outsourcing and managed services business, including roles as Vice President of Global Cloud Services Sales and Vice President of Global Telecommunications Industry Sales. He has experience leading global sales organizations, and he has been responsible for driving significant growth in revenues, deal volume and profitability. We are delighted to welcome Dan to the team, and we are confident that he is the right choice to help lead our global sales engine to the next level. 
I would like to take a moment here to thank Andrew Schaap, who ran our scale sales team on an interim basis, along with Tony Rossabi, who continues to lead our colocation and interconnection line of business for their leadership and professionalism while we ran the search for a permanent sales and marketing leader. They are both key assets to our organization, and the solid rebound in bookings during the third quarter is a direct testament to their capabilities and the depth of our talent. 
The third quarter capital allocation highlight was closing on the acquisition of a portfolio of 8 highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt as shown here on Page 3. This transaction was strategic and complementary to our existing business. It was financially accretive and prudently financed. In terms of integration, we are underway towards a smooth transition of the acquired business into Digital Realty. 
In late September, we announced the appointment of Rob Coupland as Managing Director for the region. Rob previously served as Chief Operating Officer for Telecity, and we are delighted that he accepted our offer to stay on after the acquisition and lead our expanded regional platform. 
Also in September, we officially opened our Amsterdam Data Tower. The 72-meter high tower was designed and built using the latest advanced technologies and has over 5,000 square meters of space and will have fully built-out IT load of 9 megawatts. 
Based on its location at the Amsterdam Science Park, our customers will have the ability to interconnect within a rich ecosystem of telecom organizations, Internet service providers and cable companies. In addition, we are on track to deliver the first of 3 phases of our 27-megawatt campus in Frankfurt in the second half of 2017 where we've seen significant demand from several customers, including the major global cloud service providers. We've also recently completed ISO certification of the newly acquired sites. 
Over the next quarter, we'll be stabilizing our operations in the region and executing on our business objectives. We also closed on the sale of our fully-leased Saint Denis data center in Paris during the third quarter as well as the previously announced sale of a 4-property domestic data center portfolio. We do still have 3 small assets held for sale on the balance sheet, but the completion of the portfolio sale substantially concludes the capital recycling program we embarked upon in the second quarter of 2014. As I've said on several occasions, we've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott Peterson and his team have achieved on the sale of our noncore assets. 
Let's turn to the expansion of our product offerings on Page 4. We announced the launch of our Service Exchange at MarketplaceLIVE in September. The Service Exchange is an interconnection platform that facilitates direct, private and secure connections to multiple cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure as well as telecommunications providers and other Digital Realty customers worldwide. 
Service Exchange simplifies the interconnection and makes access between interconnected services, providers and businesses more flexible, more scalable and easier to use than ever before. Upon launching in November, Service Exchange will offer significantly greater performance, reliability and security for cloud services and data center access than the public Internet. Service Exchange is powered by Megaport, combining our respective core strengths. Digital Realty's high-availability data center offerings cover the spectrum from single-rack colocation to multiple-megawatt deployments around the world to suit our customers' current needs and to enable their future growth. 
Megaport, a leading provider of elastic interconnection, has developed a platform that will keep pace with innovative cloud technologies and continue to expand to new markets. Service Exchange is critical to our customers. A recent survey from Rightscale reports that 82% of enterprises are adopting a multicloud strategy, citing security, managing multiple clouds and a lack of resources as the top 3 challenges of leveraging the cloud effectively. Service Exchange accelerates adoption of public and hybrid cloud architectures by simplifying private access to multiple clouds. 
Our partners and alliances program continues to grow, with several of our important partners sponsoring and participating in our very successful MarketplaceLIVE event, highlighting the value of our ecosystem to our partners. During the third quarter, we executed hybrid cloud transactions with one of the best partners that highlights the value of our global Connected Campus strategy. This program is expected to ramp up with our partner in the fourth quarter as we launch our go-to-market campaign in several markets. 
In addition, with the announcement of Service Exchange, we are seeing tremendous enthusiasm from our partners as well as several potential new partners seeking to incorporate the capabilities of Service Exchange into their own offerings. We're very excited about the expanded opportunities Service Exchange brings to our partnerships. Our pipeline via our partners and alliances program remains robust at approximately $40 million and deals executed during the quarter grew our bookings by nearly 20% since the launch of our partners and alliances program in early 2015. 
Let's turn now to market fundamentals on Page 5. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center markets, but so does net absorption as well as the level of preleasing on development pipelines. Demand is outpacing supply. Competitors are behaving rationally. New entrants remain few and far between, and we are seeing healthy consolidation. 
In addition to our solid leasing volume during the third quarter, our forward funnel is similarly robust. Based on the current sales pipeline, there's a good chance we will be completely sold out of the remaining inventory on our existing campuses in Ashburn, Virginia as well as Franklin Park in Chicago within the next couple of quarters. 
Given the current pace of absorption of the remaining inventory on our major connected campuses, we took steps to secure our supply chain and supply our customers' future growth during the third quarter as shown here on Page 6 with the acquisition of land parcels adjacent to our existing campuses in Ashburn and Chicago as well as the site of a future campus in Garland, Texas, once our Richardson campus is fully sold out. 
And now let's turn to the macroenvironment on Page 7. The global economic outlook remains uncertain whereas we appear to be edging closer to an interest rate tightening cycle in the U.S. As I've said many times before, the drivers underpinning data center demand are secular in nature and growing faster than the broader economy. Similarly, we have built our organization to thrive regardless of our environment with irreplaceable global platform, a fortress balance sheet and a deep bench of incredibly talented, hardworking employees. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results."
11041860,403302114,1066395,"Digital Realty Trust Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity on Page 9. Our total bookings for the third quarter were a little over $55 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a 9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space a",2285,"Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity on Page 9. Our total bookings for the third quarter were a little over $55 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a 9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $46 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter, including an 8 million colocation contribution. Our third quarter signings speak to our ability to leverage our competitive advantages to win robust yet profitable demand from a diverse global customer set. 
Third quarter wins included top cloud service providers signing across multiple locations and multiple continents. They also include a smaller but rapidly growing new customer signing across 4 different locations within North America alone. In addition, the team delivered an 18% increase in colocation and interconnection signings in the U.S., with our interconnection bookings representing a record quarterly performance since our acquisition of Telx and 1 of the top 3 quarters in Telx' history. I would like to pause here to point out that we have revised our headline total bookings presentation to include the contribution from interconnection. We will continue to provide precisely the same information and the same level of granularity, but we will now be including the interconnection contribution in our total bookings to more closely align our presentation with our peers. 
At the market level, there's a lot of excitement in Chicago these days, and I'm not just talking about the Cubbies. As Bill mentioned, we are nearing delivery and leasing of the last few megawatts on our Franklin Park campus, and we have secured the adjacent land parcel to support our continued growth. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we took assignment of a bespoke colocation reselling a customer's PBB lease for 83,000 rentable square feet at 350 East Cermak in downtown Chicago, and we also took ownership of data center improvements and infrastructure with a total of nearly 6 megawatts of capacity, an original cost basis of approximately $85 million and a current fair market value of approximately $35 million. 
As part of this transaction, we took assignment of 15 colocation customer leases and entered into a new agreement with the reseller to maintain a smaller footprint in the building. This transaction did not require us to make any material payment to the reseller and provides us with more than 4.5 megawatts of immediately available IT load and customer-ready space in our flagship Internet Gateway, which has remained north of 96% leased for the past 6 years. 
Finally, we recently kicked off a marketing and preleasing campaign to line up anchor tenants for a potential data center development project at 330 East Cermak on a land parcel adjacent to our existing property at 350 East Cermak. 
Turning to our backlog on Page 10. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, up $14 million from the prior quarter. The weighted average lag between third quarter signings and commencements remains healthy at 4 months, below the historical average of roughly 6 months. 
Turning to renewal leasing activity on Page 11. We retained 82% of the third quarter lease expirations, and we signed $44 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash releasing spread was slightly positive with healthy cash mark-to-market on PBB, colo and nontechnical space, offset by a roll-down on turnkey renewals. As expected, we did execute renewals on the above-market leases in Phoenix that we have called out for the last couple of quarters, which drove the roll-down on the third quarter turnkey renewals. We do still have several above-market leases remaining, now primarily in the Northeast region, so we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter. 
On balance, however, we still expect releasing spreads will be slightly positive on a cash basis for full year 2016. In addition, we expect cash releasing spreads will also be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak finish lease expirations. 
In terms of our third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy is down 50 basis points sequentially to 89.9%. As you can see from the occupancy bridge we provided here on Page 12, the primary driver of the dip in portfolio occupancy was the acquisition of the sub-70% leased portfolio in Europe along with recent completions in space previously held for development that was placed in service during the third quarter. It's important to note that portfolio occupancy is measured on the basis of square footage, which does not always directly correspond to invested capital. 
If we turn to the next slide on Page 13, you'll see that the balance of available fully built-out inventory relative to total inventory as measured on the y-axis has been reduced more than half. This dramatic reduction in our finished inventory has been directly responsible for the 140 basis point improvement we have achieved in our return on invested capital over the same period, which we believe is truly a remarkable achievement for a portfolio of our size. 
Let's turn to Telx here on Page 14. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $97 million of revenue during the third quarter. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50, interconnection outpaced colocation with year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10%. 
From the legacy 20 locations and prior year expense synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the third quarter. While the quarterly increase in revenue continued to accelerate, EBITDA remained relatively flat due to timing of spend related to marketing activities around MarketplaceLIVE and other initiatives as well as some costs associated with the final stages of our integration. 
We do expect enhanced revenue flow-through going forward and incremental growth in EBITDA during the fourth quarter and on into next year. Key initiatives during the quarter included the launch of colocation at our Ashburn campus, expansion underway at multiple new locations in North America as well as MarketplaceLIVE. The strategy of the colocation and interconnection product line continues to be a focus on key facilities, both interconnection hubs and connected campuses, to drive growth and nurture awareness and understanding of the identified ecosystems. 
Many colocation customers may not be aware of key customers, vendors or partners that may be easily accessed within the same building or connected campus. Identifying these natural magnets and leveraging their position within the connectivity ecosystem attracts and breeds growth. 
With respect to expanding our customer base. We have emphasized the continued development of target verticals and communities. During the third quarter, colocation and interconnection -- the colocation interconnection team added 34 new customers across a variety of market segments. Year-to-date through September, 113 new customers have been added. In terms of market expansions, our colocation and interconnection team is in the process of expanding its footprint across 8 markets in North America, representing more than 5 megawatts of incremental capacity not including the full transfer of 365 Main in San Francisco completed earlier this year. 
We launched colocation services on our campus in Ashburn, Virginia during the third quarter. Funnel activity has met expectations, and new sales bookings have been positive. Capacity expansion is also underway in Atlanta and will leverage the existing meet-me-room of connected customer base at 56 Marietta, allowing customers to reach a robust media connectivity from the launch date through the use of diverse fiber extensions. Available capacity at 56 Marietta will be sufficient in the interim or customers may prepurchase space and power as needed. 
Finally, MarketplaceLIVE 2016 was an overwhelming success, with attendance at record levels. The enhanced format and expanded venue were well received by customers and provided an excellent backdrop for the announcement of the launch of our new Service Exchange in partnership with Megaport. 
In summary, we are pleased with the performance of the colocation and interconnection product line and look forward to continued progress as we refine our go-to-market strategy to incorporate the ecosystem model, expand capacity and extend our colocation reach in North America and globally. At the 1-year mark postclosing, we are on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets and conclude the integration process. 
The volatility in currencies during the quarter and in recent weeks continues to create a headwind with regard to growth. FX represented 100 to 200 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on Page 15. I would like to remind everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. 
Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will look to continue this FX hedging strategy by issuing sterling-denominated debt over the next several months as part of our corporate funding plan to term out our balance outstanding under our revolver at that time. This financing will further reduce our exposure to currency fluctuation as we head into 2017. I 
would like to remind everyone that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy the data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe is a key competitive advantage. 
Same-capital cash NOI was up a little less than 1% on a reported basis and up a little more than 2% on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, same-capital cash NOI growth is positive 3.6% on a reported basis, and we still expect to be well within the guidance range of 2.5% to 4% for the full year. As you may have seen from the press release, we reported core FFO per share of $1.44 for the third quarter, an increase of 9% on a reported basis and up 11% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, we reiterated core FFO per share guidance of $5.65 to $5.75 on a reported basis and constant currency guidance of $5.70 to $5.90, representing 8% and 10% growth, respectively. 
Turning to the longer-term outlook on Page 16 that we introduced on our Investor Day last October. You may recall that we guided to a mid to high single-digit FFO per share growth and double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2016. We're certainly tracking ahead of plan on both fronts but, notably, AFFO per share growth that has been driven by year-to-date operating outperformance, accretion from Telx, the continued reduction in straight-line rental revenue and lower-than-expected recurring CapEx spend. 
For the full year, we now expect to deliver 20% growth in AFFO per share. Longer term, we do expect both FFO and AFFO per share growth to converge in the mid- to high single digits, and we plan to give formal guidance for 2017 early next year. 
By way of preview, we do expect continued headwinds from the strong dollar and tougher comps due to a full year contribution from Telx as well the burn-off of the onetime benefits to AFFO in 2016. 
Absent external growth from acquisitions, which are inherently difficult to predict, we would expect to see somewhat slower growth in 2017 than in 2016 in both earnings and cash flow per share. That being said, we have delivered positive year-over-year growth in core FFO per share and dividends per share each and every year as a public company, and we do not expect 2017 will be any exception. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet beginning on Page 17. As anticipated on our last call in July, we settled the bulk of our forward sale agreements during the third quarter, issuing 12 million shares and generating net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion. A portion of the net proceeds was used to permanently finance the European acquisition portfolio for approximately $874 million. 
We also generated net proceeds of approximately $320 million from the asset sales Bill described earlier, and we recognized a gain on sale of $169 million during the third quarter. We also redeemed our 7% series E preferred stock during the third quarter for approximately $290 million. We recognized a $10 million noncash Topic D-42 charge for the write-off of the original issuance cost, which is an add-back to core FFO. 
We also prepaid $136 million of mortgage debt at a 5.9% weighted average interest rate during the third quarter. We expect to retire an additional $108 million at an average coupon a little north of 6% during the fourth quarter. We expect to fund this pay-down by settling the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into this past May. Upon retirement of the mortgage debt prepayable during the fourth quarter, we will have just $3 million of secured debt remaining or well under 1% of total debt outstanding. We have also practically termed out short-term variable rate debt or longer-term fixed-rate financing. And as shown on Page 18, floating-rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding. 
Even in a rising rate environment, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would impact full year FFO per share by roughly $0.03 or less than 1%. Our leverage is likewise on target, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.1x at September 30. Pro forma for the settlement of the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements, debt-to-EBITDA will be less than 5x. Our balance sheet is poised for new investment opportunities consistent with our long-term financing strategy. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Ed, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

And then on the other side of things, it seems like you were ahead on a number of metrics, and I would've thought ultimately that, that would've contributed to better FFO growth on the year on a core basis at least. Can you maybe just speak to those 2 points?"

There were some slight adjustments to some of the assumptions. We increased the EBITDA margin, I think, 50 basis points in the low end, a 30 basis point tweak on the G&A. The change to the year-end portfolio occupancy to being down was really a product of a few things. One, we're absorbing the -- obviously, the European portfolio assets into the total portfolio occupancy in that number. And that number includes the existing vacancy. That portfolio is roughly 66% leased as of the third quarter. Plus in addition to that, as you may have saw, we recently opened up our Data Tower in Amsterdam at the Science Park, which is a brand-new up to 9 megawatts asset, which is part of this transaction. It will also bring some vacancy into the quarter. And then the other major driver I'd say is in connection with the transaction in Chicago in our 350 Cermak building where we took to the assignment of a PBB lease. That will -- obviously, that will go from a 100% occupied, 83,000 square feet, to a much lower occupied amount with the existing colocation customers in the suite. Net-net, we think that's a -- it was a great transaction for -- not only for the existing customer but really, for digital in terms of getting our hands on very valuable market-ready space in an incredibly hot market that's been -- that asset's been north of 96% for numerous years now. And then going to your second question. Overall, the quarter, I think depending on whose metrics we either beat by $0.01 or met consensus estimates, but it was pretty much in line with our forecast. I think there was a handful of positive things that you probably were highlighting. The one thing I'd say, not negative, but something that maybe put a little bit of a drag on our third quarter growth was the increase in the G&A, which was partly related to onboarding the European portfolio, which is what's expected. I think an unexpected growth component of the G&A was some of the overall integration-related work on the onboarding from that acquisition, which closed in early July and travel and work to bring to that team into the fold and some -- probably some other activity around the -- or seasonally-related activity around our MarketplaceLIVE initiative and other events. And the last thing -- I'm thinking on the top of my head -- we did bring on 2 new board members during the quarter, which adds a little bit of incremental cost to the company. But I think they will be well worth it in the long run."

Their interconnection model had a very significant portion of recurring revenue spend or similar -- not exact type of productization but similar recurring revenue model. There will be further alignment across the global portfolio in terms of our interconnection services as we move forward. We've experienced, as you saw, a very strong quarter for our interconnection signings quarter-over-quarter.

I'm -- net-net, I was pretty happy where the third quarter came out. I think there's some key takeaways that, when I look through it, it was somewhat in our script. The demand was robust and diverse. We weren't counting on one single customer to do a single 10-MW deal. We had numerous customers, be it cloud service providers, other parts of SMACC, IT service. The demand was in North America but also in Europe. It was probably one of our best signings quarter in Europe for several quarters now. A good chunk of those signings were actually in the London market post the Brexit vote, and those signings came from not only cloud service providers, they came from a disaster recovery firm. They came from an IT service firm. So lots of different demand drivers fueling our existing signings and our funnel going into the fourth quarter. I wouldn't tell you I could bank on $55 million again in the fourth quarter, but I think we've got that pretty steady-Eddie run rate trend. If you look back, I think we have in our slide deck a rolling LTM number that kind of looks how our trends are fairly smooth if you look over a long time period."

But really, it's -- foreign currency is the biggest headwind. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we obviously look to hedge out with issuing sterling bonds, euro bonds, multicurrency revolver and term loan. But there's obviously a spread between the yields on our assets and the cost of that debt and that's -- again, it's earnings translation risk, not economic risk. We are not repatriating capital in a meaningful way that we're having losses. But the FX, I'd say, is the largest driver to that I'd say, sentiment preview. And then on the 8 or so -- on the 8 European assets, 5 in London, 2 in Amsterdam, 1 in Frankfurt, I'm going to let -- give Scott a chance to jump in on performance versus underwriting."

So the performance since acquisition, it's only been a short time, and so we've been very pleased with that performance. We're on track. If you looked at the performance prior to the acquisition you saw, I think your question was performance and, specifically, vacancy. You saw the vacancy there tick up a little bit, and that was primarily the result of 2 large tenants migrating -- customers migrating out of the portfolio, one of which came to us in our portfolio. And the other one actually left and went to a -- it was gaming company. They went closer to their corporate headquarters, geographically far away. But other than that, the stickiness there has been pretty good, and the velocity's been good too."

We had a significant amount of signings from several customers in, I would say our -- one of our lower price point markets, be it Northern Virginia or Chicago, versus prior periods where we might've had more signings in the Silicon Valley or other higher priced markets. I wouldn't -- it's tough to take the signings from the second quarter as a great comparable data point. That was, obviously, a very small sample set in terms of signings. But on an apples-to-apples basis, I wouldn't say we're seeing tremendous pricing pressure. The rates are held and relatively flat and the $120 is due to the concentration in North America in those lower priced point markets. And at those rates, those signings are still, as you can see from our active development pipeline, generating returns on our invested capital, unlevered returns right in our targeted thresholds of 10.5% to 12.5%."

Obviously, a substantial amount of our external growth had been acquisition of colocation-oriented, interconnection-oriented facilities over the last few years, which obviously just moved that needle in addition to the organic growth associated with those acquisitions. But at the same time, a large chunk of our active development pipeline is developing scale projects, be it on our campus in North America, in Asia, Australia or in Europe. And that is still a significant component to the growth. So I'm not sure I could tell you the percentages are going to diverge one way or another. We're very focused and having the right assets and the right capabilities across all 4 continents to capture robust and profitable demand."

So the Turn-Key Flex product is what we'd call scale or previously called the wholesale. The bulk of the activity in North America are Northern Virginia, Chicago and Dallas, with Silicon Valley kind of following after that in terms of demand. And it's been -- it was a robust quarter, and the pipeline for the fourth quarter remains robust as well. It's a significant amount of repeat business. It's a significant amount of multisite business. It's business where customer's signing at one time on multiple continents with us. The size of the deals most recently kind of range from, call it, almost 1 MW to almost 4 MWs in terms of size of scale deal. So there's some variability in that. Some of the bigger customers are taking bigger deployments. I already touched on some of the pricing trends there. On the colocation, interconnection side, you're really seeing, I think, the combinations of success really strategic Internet Gateway assets, a talented sales and marketing organization around them executing on filling those assets up. And these assets command higher prices given what they offer the customers that decide to deploy in these locations. We -- again, we are in -- we have a fairly targeted approach to our colocation, interconnection efforts. We're not in all 50 states or 100 countries. We picked our spots to be in the Internet Gateways, the Internet hubs or in select connected campuses, which have connectivity to the cloud service providers for the enterprise. So I think where we've picked our spots and how we've tackled, it's been able to generate pretty strong volumes at attractive rates that have increased in the -- over last quarter on the colo front."
