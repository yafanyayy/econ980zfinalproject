So last night's press release reported our second quarter and first half fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12 and 24 week periods ended February 14 as well as our monthly sales results for the 4 week reporting in the month of February, which ended this past Sunday, February 28. For the quarter reported earnings came in at $1.24 a share compared to last year's second quarter earnings per share of $1.35. Note that last year's earnings were positively impacted by 2 disparate income tax items that together benefited last year's second quarter earnings by $43 million or $0.10 a share and that excluding these 2 items, earnings for the same quarter last year would have been $1.25 a share. 
Among the factors that impacted our second quarter year-over-year earnings comparison, foreign-exchange impacts as compared to a year ago. During the quarter, the foreign currencies where we operate continues to weaken versus the U.S. dollar in all countries, but primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea, resulting in our foreign earnings in the second quarter when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $32 million or $0.07 a share and exchange rate to be flat year-over-year. 
Second item of comparison is our co-branded credit card transition in the U.S. that relates to that. As you know, we're transitioning to a new co-branded credit card relationship in the U.S. this year. As we wind down our current relationship, new co-branded credit cards sign-up stops several months ago. The short-term negative earnings impact to the loss co-branded credit card sign-ups was $18 million pretax or a $0.03 per share hit to the second quarter. Recall that the earnings impact was $15 million pretax or $0.02 a share last fiscal quarter and will continue to impact earnings in Q3 and a little even into the first month of Q4. As of today, we expect to have the new co-branded Visa cards in the hands of our members in May with a go live transition date in June. Now while I can't give you any specifics regarding the new card, contractually, I can't do that yet. I do look forward to sharing more details with you at that time. 
Third item, IT modernization. Our major IT modernization efforts continue to impact SG&A expense percentages especially as depreciation begins on the new systems that are now being placed into service. In the second quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by about $10 million or an estimated 3 basis points -- 2 basis points without the gas deflation, which was about $0.01 a share. There is a light at the end of this tunnel with the SG&A headwinds. Based on our current estimates, we expect the year-over-year basis point impact SG&A is likely to be just a couple of additional basis points in fiscal year '17 and then flattened out and hopefully a little better than flattening out over the next couple of years after that. Stock compensation expense was higher year-over-year in the second quarter by $14 million or $0.02 a share. And lastly in terms of the year-over-year comparison, LIFO, last year, in the second quarter, we had -- we recorded a pretax LIFO credit of $4 million. This year, in the second quarter, with deflation being a little bit more impactful than the past couple of months, we've had a LIFO -- we had a LIFO pretax credit of $15 million, resulting in a year-over-year delta of $11 million or $0.02 a share. 
Now turning to our second quarter sales. Reported sales were up 3% and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was up 1%. For the quarter, sales negatively impacted by gasoline price deflations to the tune of 80 basis points and by weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar by minus 340 basis points. Such that excluding gas deflation, the reported plus 3% U.S. comp for the second quarter would have been a plus 4. The reported Canadian comp of a minus 7 in the second quarter would be a plus 10, excluding both gas deflation and assuming flat FX rates year-over-year. And the reported minus 3% international comp figure for the quarter, excluding gas and FX, would have been a plus 6. Total comps again reported 1% for the quarter and, excluding gas and events, would have been up 5. For the 4 week month of February, which again ended this past Sunday, reported comps came in at flat at 0%. That consisted of a plus 2 comp on a reported basis in the U.S., a minus 2 reported in Canada and a minus 8 on our international. As we discussed last month, the calendar shift of Super Bowl moved sales out of January reporting current end of February. We estimated that this shift benefited our U.S. sales in the month of February by about three quarters of a percent and a total company by about half a percent. Sales were negatively impacted by again, gas deflation, which started to head down again during the month by about 850 basis point negative impact to the comp -- to the number. And also by weakening FX, currency foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar to the tune of 250 basis points. Excluding gas deflation in the U.S., the reported plus 2% U.S. comp for February would have been a plus 4. Excluding gas deflationary effects [indiscernible] February minus 2% comp in Canada would've been a plus 10. And the reported minus 8 international comp would have been flat year-over-year ex gas and FX. Our total company comps reported, again, 0 for the month, would've been a plus 4, excluding gas and FX. I might mention that the Other International normalized number, in other words, ex gas and FX was 0. Mostly related to the timing of the Chinese lunar year holidays. We don't think that will be an issue after the timing of that. 
A final comment on deflation. Beyond gasoline price deflation that we've always pointed out each month, we have seen a little additional deflation across many merchandise categories such as sales have been impacted a bit by a little bit more in the past couple of months. In terms of new openings, opening activities and plans, we plan -- we opened 30 units new units in Q1, including 2 [indiscernible] for a net of 11 new locations in the first quarter. In Q2, we opened 1 new business center in Westminster, California. For all fiscal 2016, we're still on target to do 30 net new locations, 21 of which will be in the U.S, 3 in Canada, 2 in Japan and 1 each in the U.K, Taiwan, Australia and Spain. 
Also this morning, I'll review with you our e-commerce activities, membership trends and renewal formation, additional discussion of course of margins and SG&A and a couple of other items of note. 
Okay, in terms of FX quarter results. Sales for the quarter were $27.57 billion, up 3% from last year. On a reported comp basis, Q2 comps were up 1 for the quarter, up 5 x gas and FX. For the quarter, our plus 1 reported comp was a combination with an average transaction decrease of minus 2.5% and an average shopping frequency increase of just over 3%. Now the minus 2.5% average transaction decrease, again, taking FX and gas out of that number, that minus 2.5% would have been a positive number that would be just under plus 2%. 
In terms of sales comparisons geographically, in the U.S., the Midwest Texas California regions were the strongest. Internationally, in Q2, in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, Canada, Australia and Taiwan. In terms of merchandising categories for the quarter for the same quarter within food and sundries, overall flattish meat deli and a sundries were the leaders. Tobacco, negative in the low double digits as we continue to eliminate tobacco SKUs from various locations. For hardlines, overall, the mid-single digit range, department strongest results for consumer electronics, which was up at the low to mid-teens, sporting goods, loading Garp and tires. Within low to mid-single digits [indiscernible] and apparel's were standouts and in fresh foods, our comp sales were in the low single-digit range with produce showing the best results among the 4 main fresh foods categories. 
Lastly, as we've mentioned, during the December and January sales calls and the U.S, we're seeing deflation in the low single-digit range for food and sundries and for food sundries and fresh foods and now, again a little bit lower on the food side as well. In terms of February, traffic was up a little over 3.5% while the average transaction was down a little under 4%, about three and three quarters percent. Again, gas, as I mentioned earlier, fell again a little more dramatically in February. The average sale price year-over-year of gas was down 21% for the month, which is a bigger decline year-over-year than we saw in the quarter overall. In terms of geographic regions, again, in -- for February, taxes of these has been blessed regions were strongest and internationally come in local currencies, Mexico and Canada, where at the top. From our merchandise category standpoint, ex FX, all categories, food, sundries, hardlines, soft lines, fresh foods were in the mid-single digit range for February reporting period, again, little inflation impacting these and it's a little deflation, but it's more than what we had seen historically of recent history. 
Moving down to line items in the income statement. Membership fees, we came in for this fiscal year at 603 million, up 4% or $21 million or 582 million a year ago and up 2 basis points as a percent of sales. Again, that $21 million increase and 4 percent dollar increase, if you assumed flat FX, the $21 million would have been a $40 million increase and the 4% increase ex FX would have been a 7% increase. And in terms of membership, renewal rates remain strong, 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% rounded up to worldwide. Continuing increasing penetration is executive member I think helps that. New membership sign-ups in Q2 company-wide were up 4%. I will point out last month, the early part of February and into the second week of February, for 12 days we ran a new membership promotion of LivingSocial. I'll recall that we also run a membership promotion with LivingSocial about 18 months ago. Like that one, it went well and we don't do it too often and I don't want to get people used to it, but it was a good result. In terms of new members at Q2 end, Gold Star members at Q2 end was 35.4 million, up from 34.7 million in Q1 and 12 weeks earlier. Business primary remained at 7.2 million. Business add-ons remained at 3.5 million. So all total, at Q2 end, we were 46 1 -- 46.1 million versus 45.4 million at Q1 end up. And total cardholders would be 84.0 million, up from 82.7 million. 
As of the end of the second quarter, paid executive memberships totaled 16.6 million of our members, an increase of 214,000 over the 12-week month or about 18,000 a week increase in the quarter. And as I mentioned before, executive members are a little more than 1/3 of our membership base and about 2/3 of our sales results. 
In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, thanks to strong business in U.S. and Canada, it was 94.5%, same as it was a quarter ago. Gold Star was 89.7%, same as a quarter ago. Total U.S. and Canada, 19.5%, same as a quarter ago. Worldwide at 87.7%, down a tick [ph] from 87.8%  at Q1 end, a little bit of rounding and as you know, all new markets we generally have in the first year lower renewal rates -- second year to first year of renewals. 
I've mentioned I thinkl the last couple of months that in Canada, when we did the credit card conversion, it was a little different than the one that we're doing here. It was referred to as the de novo thing where everybody had a sign up for new credit card and applied and what have you and so you're renewal rates related to auto renewals, which by definition our high. It comes down a little. That will be anniversary-ing after next quarter. So we saw a little tick down in Canada at this quarter year-over-year as we had in the last couple of quarters as well. That should be one more quarter of that, again, not terribly meaningful, but we've been asked. 
Going down the our gross margin line. Our gross margin in the second quarter was higher year-over-year on a reported basis by 17 basis points. As always, we'll jot down 4 columns of numbers with 6 line items. The first 2 columns are Q1 '16 and Q1 '16. [ph] The columns would be reported, column 1, column 2 would be without gas deflation. Then, we'd have Q2 '16, 2 columns, reported and without gas deflation. Reading across core merchandising Q1 on a reported basis was up 24 basis points. Ex gas deflation was down 3 basis points year-over-year. For Q2 '16, reported was plus 5 and without deflation, minus 3. Ancillary, plus 11 and plus 4 in the first quarter year-over-year, plus 9 and plus 7 in Q2. 2% reward, minus 3 and minus 1. Q2, minus 1 and 0. LIFO, plus 1 and plus 1 and in Q2, plus 4 and plus 4. Other was minus 7 and minus 7 a year ago and not an issue [ph], 0 and 0 in Q2. Such that total reported year-over-year in Q1, we were up 26 basis points gross margin without gas deflation down 6 basis points. And in Q2, we were up 17 and up 8 ex gas deflation. As you can see, the core component of gross margin was higher by 5, 3, excluding gas deflation in the quarter. Core gross margins, food sundries, hardlines, softlines in fresh foods as a percentage of their own sales were positive year-over-year in Q1 by 11 basis points with food sundries and hardlines showing higher year-over-year gross margins as a percentage of their own sales while softlines and fresh foods are a little lower year-over-year as a percent of sales. But again, the net of those 4 major categories as a percent of their own sales was up year-over-year in the quarter by 11 basis points. Ancillary and other business gross margins were up 9 basis points, 7 without gas, both in terms of ancillary ancillary business, our gas business, our food courts, our hearing aid centers, our tire shops one of our mini labs all showed higher gross margins year-over-year as a percentage of their own sales. Again, executive membership, not an issue. Without deflation, 0 impact year-over-year. And again, LIFO was 4 basis point benefit to the gross margin year-over-year. 
Moving to reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentage in Q2 was higher or worse year-over-year by 34 basis points on a reported basis, and higher or up by 27 basis points ex deflation. Let me again give you this tabular numbers and then I'll give you some text around those. Again, the 4 columns would be reported Q1 first columns will be Q1 '16 year-over-year reported and without gas and deflation and Q2 reported without gas. Those will be the 4 columns. First line item, operations, would be 0 basis points in Q1 reported and plus 26 without gas deflation or plus meeting lower or better. In Q2, minus 22 and minus 16. Central, minus 8 and minus 6 and Q1 and Q2, minus 8 and minus 7. Stock expense, minus 12 and minus 10 and Q1 and Q2, minus 4 and minus 4. And quarterly adjustments or unusual items, minus 8 and minus 8 in Q1 and no unusual items to point out, 0 and 0 in Q2. Such that in Q1 year-over-year, on a reported basis, SG&A was a minus 28 basis points or higher by 28 basis points. In Q1 ex gas, it was better or lower by 2 basis points. So a plus 2. In Q2, it was minus 34 as I mentioned and minus 27 ex gas deflation. So higher by 27. Now, the core operations against component, minus 22. Again, minus 16 ex gas, ex the impact of gas deflation. Of that minus 16, payroll was about minus 2. Benefits and workers comp were minus 8 with the remaining 6 minus 6 basis points being a variety of items including bank fees, depreciation and other items. Again, I think a few of those things relates us fight others like change in sales increases and a couple of things just going basis points in the wrong correction. I also point out that within the benefits of workers comp, about -- one thing that stood out is that just in January, we had referred to as high cost, a high cost claims for employee benefits -- benefit claims. Typically, it averages over the last 2 years U.S. about $6 million or $7 million. And a year ago, it was a little lower than that. It was about 3.5. This year, it was about 13. So nothing unusual and we thought we refer to as high cost [indiscernible] over $100,000, but it just spiked and that's a few basis points there. But again, that will come and go in both directions. 
In terms of central expense, higher year-over-year in Q2 by 8 basis points, 7 without gas. As I mentioned earlier, IT was 3 basis points of that or 2 without deflation -- without gas deflation. In addition, we had several onetime items, which should total represented about $9 million. Again, we always have a few onetime of these that go either way. We had 3 items that together totaled $9 million, but they are what they are and they did impact our SG&A. And lastly, the stock compensation expense is 4 basis points. 
But before I move on to SG&A, I do want to mention 1 additional headwind that is just starting. In March, every 3 years, we review our pace scales that impact our entire employee agreement. We always review top of scale and historically increased the top of scale every year in March where they're roughly 60%, 65% of our employees that are on top of scale already. In addition, this year, we're also changing the starting level, our entry-level hourly wages. This is the first change in the entry level wages in 9 years. Since 2007, our entry-level wage in U.S. and Canada was $11.50 or $12 an hour. Effective this month, in the U.S. and Canada, we're increasing our starting wages from $11.50 and $12 to $13 and 13.5. So up $1.5. We estimate that this will cost us about $0.01 a share in Q3 year-over-year and about $0.02 a share in each of the next 3 fiscal quarters. Again, it's part of what we do and as -- yes, there are a few warehouses that we've already started people at a higher level simply markets like Bay Area or some limited markets like that, but at the end of the day, it'll be about the numbers that I mentioned in terms of the impact to our earnings. 
Next to the income statement is preopening expense. Pretty much the same year-over-year at $9 million last year and $10 million this year. Last year, we had no actual openings in the quarter, but a lot of that relates to openings that are just getting ready to occur or just occurred as well as 1 opening this year. Our total operating income in Q2 came in at $856 million, down 2% from a year ago's $877 million. 
Below the operating income line, reported interest expense in Q2 came in at $31 million. That's up $4 million from last year's $27 million -- excuse me, the increase is primarily due to interest on the billion dollar debt offering that was depleted in Q3 last year related to our special dividend -- onetime special dividend that we did back in February a year ago. Interest income in other was lower year-over-year by $4 million, coming in at $20 million last year and only $16 million this year. Actual interest income for the quarter was lower year-over-year by about $8 million, primarily a factor of less cash on hand this year's compared to a year earlier. This is a result again of our 2 things. We had a $1.2 billion debt payoff last December as well as we used about $1 billion of our cash towards paying that $5 share special dividend last February 27 a year ago. Overall, pretax income was lower by 3% or $29 million in Q2 going from 870 million a year ago to 8 41. In terms of income taxes, we got a little help there. Our company income tax rate this quarter came in right at 34%, up from a little over 30% a year ago in the quarter. The income tax line on this year's Q2 benefited from a few positive discrete items resulting in a -- in the 34% range. At normalized rate would have been a shade over 35. While last year's income tax line benefited from a, as I mentioned earlier, a $43 million benefit and the core primary relating to our $5 special cash dividend. Overall imported net income of $598 million last year in Q2 compares to $546 million of net income this year in Q2 on a reported basis. 
I've rundown a few other items. Balance sheet is included in this morning's press release. A couple of things I always point out on this call. Depreciation and amortization for Q2 totaled $285 million for the quarter and $556 million year-to-date. Our AP ratio and accounts payable as a percent of payables, last year, in Q2, on a reported basis, it was 97% and this year, 5 percentage points lower at 92. That includes construction and other payables. So if you just look at merchandise payables as a percent of inventories, it would be 87% a year ago and 4% lower or 83% this year. Last year, being higher by 4% to 5% a year is actually the anomaly. A couple of factors. Part of it was last year's West Coast port slow downs. You had a lot less inventory a year ago on some big-ticket low turn items like electronics. Just that one department was 120 plus million of higher inventory and only a few millions dollars of higher accounts payable. And then gas payables again was $230 million [indiscernible] in the wrong side of this AP calculation as we try to keep our tanks a little full, more full when prices decline. And so again, that's running the business and nothing per se exceptional there. 
In terms of average inventory through warehouse, pretty much flat year-over-year coming in just $6,000 higher this year and average inventory per warehouse of 12,761,000,000, up from 12,755,000 a year ago. Actual FX year-over-year inventory levels were up more than the $6,000 they were up 286,000 or up 2%, but that again in a normalized I think is one of the small increases with seen year-over-year in that. Overall, inventories in good shape, not only in a good shape, we've just completed the midyear fiscal inventories and it's our best trip results ever by a basis point plus. So again, I think it's indicative of running a clean shop there. 
In terms of CapEx. In Q1, we spent $715 million. In Q2, we spent an approximately $650 million more. We're still on track this year for fiscal '16 CapEx to be in the range of 2.8 plus billion, maybe as high as $3 billion, about $2.8 billion to $3 billion. That compares to $2.4 billion in CapEx in fiscal '15. 
Next, Costco e-commerce, Costco online, we're now in 6 countries, having recently opened in 3 in Taiwan. We're also, of course, in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. For Q2, sales and profits were up over last year. Our total sales were up 90% in the quarter, up 22% ex FX and on a comp basis, up 18% reported and up 21% ex FX. So continued good results in terms of growing our e-commerce efforts. 
In terms of expansion. Fiscal '16, again, we opened ahead of 11 units in Q1, 1 new unit in Q2. So 12 through midyear. We planned 7 net openings in Q3, 9 openings including 2 reloads [ph] so 7 of that. And in Q4, we're on task to do 11. So that would give us the 30 total for the fiscal year. If you go back a year ago in fiscal '15, we added 23 net new units on the basis of what was then beginning base of 6 53. So about 3.5 percent square footage growth. Now this year, assuming we get to the 30, that will be about 4.5 percent square footage growth. Again the new locations by country, if we do the 30, 21 in U.S, 3 in Canada, 1 in the U.K. and 3 into Asia, 1 in Taiwan and 2 in Japan, 1 more in Australia and 1 more in the one in Spain. At Q2 end, total square footage stood at 100.7 million square feet. 
In terms of stock buybacks. In Q1, as I mentioned a quarter ago, we spent about $130 million of buying 898,000 shares back. So an average price of just under $145 a share. In Q2, we spent $80 million on 531,000 shares. So an average of price at just over $150 a share. During the first 5 weeks of the past quarter, very little stock was repurchased. In fact, of the total 80 million, 3 of the 80 million was purchased in the first 5 weeks and the remainder, the vast majority, was in the last 7 weeks. And that's clearly a function of how we do it. We look at kind of a matrix pricing as it goes up a little, we buy a little less. And as it comes down a little, we buy a little more. As long as we feel comfortable about our runway, I think we'll continue to do that. In terms of dividends, our first quarterly dividend stands at $0.40 a share. So $1.60 annualized, which on an annual basis is about $700 million number. 
That's the quick and dirty of how Q2 went. We -- I'll turn it back to Britney now and be happy to answer any questions. Britney?"

That's what -- one of the -- in my view, one of the 2 or 3 main factors that get people in there in a more frequent basis. We also have small business numbers were buying a lot of things, not necessarily fresh foods. Obviously, some restaurants, they can buy some of that, but in terms of maxing out, I've said it before. I continue to be surprised how many more executive members we are getting even among the existing longer tenured members. And so luck, we've got to keep doing what you're doing in terms of being good merchants and constantly improving the value. There's always saturation in everything you do. We're pretty good at figuring out ways to offset that. In the last year or 2, certainly, organics has helped, not only bringing arguably some doer, perhaps, younger members, but taking existing members who love Costco, but there's certainly things they didn't buy at Costco Wholesale because there an organic family.

And the answer is yes, first of all, but there's different ways to measure measure deflation. If I look at it, first, just from a LIFO index, which is U.S. inventories, if everything started at a cost -- everything that we had in our [indiscernible] had a cost of 100.0, that was the baseline, at the end of Q1, so it's late November, that LIFO index was 99.49. So a half a percent lower on average, that's that inventory LIFO calculation. In the last 8 weeks, the 99.5 is going to 99.06. So down 44 more basis points. So yes, that continues. So that's where I got this little lower. We're seeing more deflation particularly saying seeing this and not food categories. When I look at the 85 plus percent of our goods that go through our depot operations, again, this is just one parameter. The number of pounds being shipped through with the dollar value, that dollar value is down a little over 1% year-over-year. Now if year-over-year, not from the beginning of this fiscal year. So again, that would indicate to me again we're seeing a little more deflation. I can give you crazy numbers on a given items on a year-over-year basis when you look down just at candy, M&Ms, down 10% year-over-year. American single slices of cheese, down 15%, bacon down 20%. Look, there were also inflationary items, but also, I think the LIFO index, technical calculation although it it's not on a per bit calculation, would indicate we're seeing a little bit more depreciation we and particular, then, I think that you're seeing. And I think I mentioned a quarter or 2 ago when asked about that with our pricing coming down, what about the nonfood items like plastic bags and things that require a lot of petroleum-based products? And the answer I got back and I showed with everybody was yes, you're seeing it, but you got to ask for it more frequently and more strongly. And even then, it took a little longer because sometimes, you got vendors that are committed out several months not a year, and raw material prices, and we're going to work with them. We're not going to dread this room, but it do what we can, but we're not going to create hurt and so again, we're starting to feel a little bit of that. But that's retail."

In fact, a moment and has labor. We've done that at times at the front end to drive more business. And so I think the bottom of scale increase, that's easy, that's quantifiable. A few of the moves lined up on a few items. I mentioned the high cost claims was 3 or 4 basis points. I mentioned there are 3 other items that usually 2 of them go one way and one go the other way. And so it's a couple of million or a quarter a half a penny impact to the quarter. This time it was all in one direction.

I know that during the 4 weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's, Thanksgiving and Christmas, we had outsized TV sales dollars into every major supplier that we buy from relative to everybody else online and offline.

We don't want somebody to come by necessarily to pick it up. Maybe that would change if we were having minus 3% comps in their lives. And so we want to do everything possible to get them in this or, not just give pick somebody up. I don't see that as being as strategic focus of ours at least in the near term. That -- we also -- part of the things were tried to the people in the store with treasure hunt items, with fresh foods, with gas, so we'll keep driving that. As we've done, our relationship would like in 6 markets with Google shopping and I think 16 markets with Instacart. my there are people that want things delivered to them and were selling it, but we're selling it, but we're doing it that way. So I thinks them with you could do we are getting better and again, some out there would say were gone from enough to see or an activity as some would say that begun to a B+. I would like to think of ourselves we still have some things to do, but we've improved our mobile apps. We've gotten a little smarter about how we do it. We know that when you come in store, you're going to write a lot more than you shop online in general and recognizing our average online transaction is actually higher than our in-store revisit, but that's because we started with just a big ticket items. It's just recently give a we put on some other smaller ticket items. But we know that compared to let's say, an Instacard or a Google experience, the in-store visit is 2.5 to 3x. It's not little more than that. Now what we're finding is that that customer comes in a little less frequency, does the online several times and that too is aggregate improvement in their comp. So that works. But we're still taking it slowly in terms of I don't see us doing pick up at store at least in the near -- in the next year or 2 because we've got enough traffic there. When tried to figure out how to keep driving that."

So last night's press release reported our second quarter and first half fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12- and 24-week periods ended February 14 as well as our monthly sales results for the 4-week reporting in the month of February, which ended this past Sunday, February 28.
For the quarter, reported earnings came in at $1.24 a share as compared to last year's second quarter earnings per share of $1.35. Note that last year's earnings were positively impacted by 2 discrete income tax items that, together, benefited last year's second quarter earnings by $43 million or $0.10 a share, and that excluding these 2 items, earnings for the same quarter last year would have been $1.25 a share.
Among the factors that impacted our second quarter year-over-year earnings comparison, foreign exchange effects as compared to a year ago. During the quarter, the foreign currencies where we operate continue to weaken versus the U.S. dollar in all countries, but primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea, resulting in our foreign earnings in the second quarter when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $32 million or $0.07 a share and exchange rates have been flat year-over-year.
Second item of comparison is our co-branded credit card transition in the U.S. that relates to that. As you know, we are transitioning to a new co-branded credit card relationship in the U.S. this year. As we wind down our current relationship, new co-branded credit cards sign-ups stopped several months ago. The short-term negative earnings impact to the lost co-branded credit card sign-ups was $18 million pretax or a $0.03 per share hit to the second quarter. Recall that the earnings impact was $15 million pretax or $0.02 a share last fiscal quarter and will continue to impact earnings in Q3 and a little even into the first month of Q4. As of today, we expect to have the new co-branded Visa cards in the hands of our members in May with a go-live transition date in June. Now while I can't give you any specifics regarding the new card, contractually, I can't do that yet, I do look forward to sharing more details with you at that time.
Third item, IT modernization. Our major IT modernization efforts continue to impact SG&A expense percentages, especially as depreciation begins on the new systems that are now being placed into service. In the second quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by about $10 million or an estimated 3 basis points -- 2 basis points without the gas deflation, which was about $0.01 a share.
There is a light at the end of this tunnel with the SG&A headwinds. Based on our current estimates, we expect the year-over-year basis point impact to SG&A is likely to be just a couple of additional basis points in fiscal year '17 and then flattened out and hopefully a little better than flattening out over the next couple of years after that.
Stock compensation expense was higher year-over-year in the second quarter by $14 million or $0.02 a share. And lastly, in terms of the year-over-year comparison, LIFO, last year, in the second quarter, we had a -- we recorded a pretax LIFO credit of $4 million. This year, in the second quarter, with deflation being a little bit more impactful than in the past couple of months, we've had a LIFO -- we had a LIFO pretax credit of $15 million, resulting in a year-over-year delta of $11 million or $0.02 a share.
Now turning to our second quarter sales. Reported sales were up 3%, and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was up 1%. For the quarter, sales was negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation to the tune of 80 basis points and by weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar by minus 340 basis points. Such that excluding gas deflation, the reported plus 3% U.S. comp for the second quarter would have been a plus 4%. The reported Canadian comp of a minus 7% in the second quarter would be a plus 10%, excluding both gas deflation and assuming flat FX rates year-over-year. And the reported minus 3% International comp figure for the quarter, excluding gas and FX, would have been a plus 6%. Total comps, again, reported 1% for the quarter and excluding gas and events, would have been up 5%. 
For the 4-week month of February, which, again, ended this past Sunday, reported comps came in at flat at 0%. That consisted of a plus 2% comp on a reported basis in the U.S., a minus 2% reported in Canada and a minus 8% Other International.
As we discussed last month, the calendar shift of Super Bowl moved sales out of January reporting period into February. We estimated that this shift benefited our U.S. sales for the month of February by about 0.75% and the total company by about 0.5%. 
Sales were negatively impacted by, again, gas deflation, which started to head down again during the month, by an 850 basis point negative impact to the comp -- to the number; and also by weakening FX, currency -- foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar to the tune of 250 basis points. Excluding gas deflation in the U.S., the reported plus 2% U.S. comp for February would have been a plus 4%. Excluding gas deflation and FX in February, minus 2% comp in Canada would have been a plus 10%. And the reported minus 8% International comp would have been flat year-over-year, ex gas and FX. Total company comps reported, again, 0 for the month would have been a plus 4%, excluding gas and FX.
I might mention that the Other International normalized number, in other words, ex gas and FX, of 0 mostly related to the timing of the Chinese Lunar Year holidays. We don't think that will be an issue after the timing of that.
A final comment on deflation. Beyond gasoline price deflation that we've always pointed out each month, we have seen a little additional deflation across many merchandise categories such as sales have been impacted a bit by -- a little bit more in the past couple of months.
In terms of new openings, our opening activities and plans, we planned -- we opened 30 units -- new units in Q1, including 2 relos, so a net of 11 new locations in the first quarter. In Q2, we opened 1 new business center in Westminster, California. For all of fiscal 2016, we're still on target to do 30 net new locations, 21 of which will be in the U.S, 3 in Canada, 2 in Japan and 1 each in the U.K, Taiwan, Australia and Spain.
Also this morning, I'll review with you our e-commerce activities, membership trends and renewal information, additional discussion, of course, of margins and SG&A and a couple of other items of note.
Okay. In terms of the second quarter results. Sales for the quarter were $27.57 billion, up 3% from last year. On a reported comp basis, Q2 comps were up 1% for the quarter, up 5% ex gas and FX. For the quarter, our plus 1% reported comp was a combination of an average transaction decrease of minus 2.5% and an average shopping frequency increase of just over 3%. Now the minus 2.5% average transaction decrease, again, taking FX and gas out of that number, that minus 2.5% would have been a positive number that would be just under plus 2%.
In terms of sales comparisons geographically, in the U.S., the Midwest, Texas and California regions were strongest. Internationally, in Q2, in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, Canada, Australia and Taiwan.
In terms of merchandising categories for the quarter, for the same quarter within food and sundries, overall, flattish. Meat, deli and sundries were the leaders. Tobacco, negative in the low double digits as we continue to eliminate tobacco SKUs for various locations. For hardlines, overall, in the mid-single-digit range. Departments with the strongest results were consumer electronics, which was up in the low to mid-teens; sporting goods; lawn and garden; and tires. Within the low to mid-single-digit softlines, domestics and apparel were the standouts. And in fresh foods, our comp sales were in the low single-digit range, with produce showing the best results among the 4 main fresh foods categories.
Lastly, as we've mentioned, during the December and January sales calls, in the U.S., we're seeing deflation in the low single-digit range for food and sundries -- for food, sundries and fresh foods. And now, again, a little bit lower on the nonfood side as well.
In terms of February, traffic was up a little over 3.5%, while the average transaction was down a little under 4%, about 3.75%. Again, gas, as I mentioned earlier, fell again a little more dramatically in February. The average sale price year-over-year in gas was down 21% for the month, which is a bigger decline year-over-year than we saw in the quarter overall.
In terms of geographic regions, again, for February, Texas, Southeast and Midwest regions were strongest. And internationally, in local currencies, Mexico and Canada were at the top.
From a merchandise category standpoint, ex FX, all categories, food, sundries, hardlines, softlines, fresh foods, were in the mid-single-digit range for February reporting period, again, a little deflation impacting these. And it's a little deflation, but it's more than we have seen historically -- of recent history.
Moving down to line items in the income statement. Membership fees, we came in for this fiscal year at $603 million, up 4% or $21 million from $582 million a year ago and up 2 basis points as a percent of sales. Again, that $21 million increase and 4% dollar increase, if you assumed flat FX, the $21 million would have been a $40 million increase, and the 4% increase, ex FX, would have been a 7% increase. And in terms of membership, renewal rates remained strong, 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% rounded up to -- in worldwide. Continuing increasing penetration of executive member I think helps that. New membership sign-ups in Q2 company-wide were up 4%. I will point out, last month, the early part of February and into the second week of February, for 12 days, we ran a new membership promotion of LivingSocial. Recall that we also ran a membership promotion with LivingSocial about 18 months ago. Like that one, it went well. And we don't do it too often, and I don't want to get people used to it, but it was a good result.
In terms of new members at Q2 end, Gold Star members at Q2 end was 35.4 million, up from 34.7 million at Q1 end 12 weeks earlier. Business Primary remained at 7.2 million. Business add-ons remained at 3.5 million. So in total, at Q2 end, we were 46.1 million versus 45.4 million at Q1 end. And total cardholders would be 84.0 million, up from 82.7 million.
As of the end of the second quarter, paid executive memberships totaled 16.6 million of our members, an increase of 214,000 over the 12-week month or about 18,000-a-week increase in the quarter. And as I've mentioned before, executive members are a little more than 1/3 of our membership base and about 2/3 of our sales results.
In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, thanks to the strong business. In U.S. and Canada, it was at 94.5%, same as it was a quarter ago. Gold Star was 89.7%, same as a quarter ago. Total U.S. and Canada at 19.5%, same as a quarter ago. Worldwide at 87.7%, down a tick from 87.8% at Q1 end. A little bit of rounding, and as you know, in all new markets, we generally have in the first year lower renewal rates -- second year, the first year of renewals.
I'd mentioned, I think, the last couple of months that in Canada, when we did the credit card conversion, it was a little different than the one we're doing here. It was referred to as the de novo thing, where everybody had to sign up for a new credit card and apply and what have you. And so your renewal rates related to auto renewals, which is by definition are high. It comes down a little. That will be anniversary-ing after next quarter. So we saw a little tick down in Canada in this quarter year-over-year as we had in the last couple of quarters as well. That should be 1 more quarter of that, again, not terribly meaningful, but we've been asked.
Going down the gross margin line. Our gross margin in the second quarter was higher year-over-year on a reported basis by 17 basis points. As always, we'll jot down 4 columns of numbers with 6 line items. The first 2 columns are Q1 '16 and Q1 '16. The columns would be reported, column 1; column 2 would be without gas deflation. Then we'd have Q2 '16, 2 columns, reported and without gas deflation. Reading across, core merchandising in Q1 on a reported basis was up 24 basis points. Ex gas deflation, it was down 3 basis points year-over-year. For Q2 '16, reported was plus 5; and without deflation, minus 3. Ancillary, plus 11 and plus 4 in the first quarter year-over-year; plus 9 and plus 7 in Q2. 2% Reward, minus 3 and minus 1; Q2, minus 1 and 0. LIFO, plus 1 and plus 1; and in Q2, plus 4 and plus 4. Other was minus 7 and minus 7 a year ago; and not an issue, 0 and 0 in Q2. Such that total reported year-over-year in Q1, we were up 26 basis points gross margin; without gas deflation, down 6 basis points. And in Q2, we were up 17 and up 8, ex gas deflation.
As you can see, the core component of gross margin was higher by 5; 3, excluding gas deflation in the quarter. Core gross margins, food, sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales were positive year-over-year in Q1 by 11 basis points, with food, sundries and hardlines showing higher year-over-year gross margins as a percentage of their own sales, while softlines and fresh foods are a little lower year-over-year as a percent of sales. But again, the net of those 4 major categories as a percent of their own sales was up year-over-year in the quarter by 11 basis points.
Ancillary and other business gross margins were up 9 basis points, 7 without gas, both -- in terms of ancillary businesses, our gas business, our food courts, our hearing aid centers, our tire shops and our -- we now have our mini labs, all showed higher gross margins year-over-year as a percentage of their own sales. Again, Executive Membership, not an issue, without deflation, 0 impact year-over-year. And again, LIFO was 4 basis point benefit to the gross margin year-over-year.
Moving to reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentage in Q2 was higher or worse year-over-year by 34 basis points on a reported basis and higher or up by 27 basis points ex deflation. Let me again give you these tabular numbers, and then I'll give you some text around those. Again, the 4 columns would be reported Q1 -- first columns will be Q1 '16 year-over-year reported and without gas and deflation and Q2 reported, without gas. Those will be the 4 columns. The first line item, operations, would be 0 basis points in Q1 reported and plus 26 without gas deflation, the plus meaning lower or better. In Q2, minus 22 and minus 16. Central, minus 8 and minus 6 in Q1; in Q2, minus 8 and minus 7. Stock expense, minus 12 and minus 10 in Q1; and Q2, minus 4 and minus 4. And quarterly adjustments or unusual items, minus 8 and minus 8 in Q1 and no unusual items to point out, 0 and 0 in Q2. Such that in Q1 year-over-year, on a reported basis, SG&A was minus 28 basis points or higher by 28 basis points. In Q1, ex gas, it was better or lower by 2 basis points. So a plus 2. In Q2, it was minus 34, as I mentioned, and minus 27 ex gas deflation. So higher by 27. Now the core operations against component, minus 22. Again, minus 16 ex gas -- ex the impact of gas deflation. Of that minus 16, payroll was about minus 2. Benefits and workers' comp were minus 8, with the remaining 6 -- minus 6 basis points being a variety of items, including bank fees, depreciation and the various other items. Again, I think a few of those things relate to a slight -- a very slight change in sales increases and a couple of things just going a basis point in the wrong direction.
I also point out that within the benefits of workers' comp, about -- one thing that stood out is just in January, we had what's referred to as a high-cost claims for employee benefits, medical claims. Typically, it averages over the last 2 years, just U.S., about $6 million or $7 million. A year ago, it was a little lower than that. It was about $3.5 million. This year, it was about $13 million. So nothing unusual, and then we thought we'd refer to it as high-cost claims benefits over $100,000, but it just spiked, and that's a few basis points there. But again, that will come and go in both directions.
In terms of central expense, higher year-over-year in Q2 by 8 basis points, 7 without gas. As I mentioned earlier, IT was 3 basis points of that or 2 without deflation -- without gas deflation. In addition, we had several onetime items, which the total represented about $9 million. Again, we always have a few onetime of these that go either way. We had 3 items that, together, totaled $9 million. But they are what they are and didn't impact our SG&A. And lastly, the stock compensation expense is 4 basis points.
But before I move on from SG&A, I do want to mention one additional expense headwind that is just starting. In March, every 3 years, we review our pace scales that impact our entire employee agreement. We always review top of scale and historically increased the top of scale every year in March, where they're roughly 60%, 65% of our employees that are at top of scale already. In addition, this year, we're also changing the starting level -- our entry-level hourly wages. This is the first change to the entry-level wages in 9 years. Since 2007, our entry-level wage in U.S. and Canada was $11.50 or $12 an hour. Effective this month, in the U.S. and Canada, we're increasing our starting wages from $11.50 and $12 to $13 and $13.50, so up $1.50. We estimate that this will cost us about $0.01 a share in Q3 year-over-year and about $0.02 a share in each of the next 3 fiscal quarters. Again, it's part of what we do and as -- yes, there are a few warehouses that we've already started people at a higher level, simply markets like Bay Area or some limited markets like that. But at the end of the day, it'll be about the numbers that I mentioned in terms of the impact to earnings.
Next to the income statement is preopening expense. Pretty much the same year-over-year at $9 million last year and $10 million this year. Last year, we had no actual openings in the quarter, but a lot of that relates to openings that are just getting ready to occur or just occurred as well as one opening this year. Our total operating income in Q2 came in at $856 million, down 2% from a year ago's $877 million.
Below the operating income line, reported interest expense in Q2 came in at $31 million. That's up $4 million from last year's $27 million. The increase is primarily due to interest on the billion dollar debt offering that was completed in Q3 last year related to our special -- onetime special dividend that we did back in February a year ago. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $4 million, coming in at $20 million last year and only $16 million this year. Actual interest income for the quarter was lower year-over-year by about $8 million, primarily a factor of less cash on hand this year as compared to a year earlier. This is a result, again, of our -- 2 things, we had a $1.2 billion debt payoff last December as well as we used about $1 billion of our cash towards paying that $5 share special dividend last February 27 a year ago.
Overall pretax income was lower by 3% or $29 million in Q2 going from $870 million a year ago to $841 million.
In terms of income taxes, we got a little help there. Our company income tax rate this quarter came in right at 34%, up from a little over 30% a year ago in the quarter. The income tax line on this year's Q2 benefited from a few positive discrete items resulting in a -- in the 34% rate. Our normalized rate would have been a shade over 35%. Well, last year's income tax line benefited from, as I mentioned -- well, I mentioned earlier a $43 million benefit in the call primarily relating to our $5 special cash dividend. Overall reported net income of $598 million last year in Q2 compares to $546 million of net income this year in Q2 on a reported basis.
Rundown of a few other items. Balance sheet is included in this morning's press release. A couple of things I always point out on this call. Depreciation and amortization for Q2 totaled $285 million for the quarter and $556 million year-to-date. Our AP ratio, accounts payable as a percent of payables, last year, in Q2, on a reported basis, it was 97%; and this year, 5 percentage points lower at 92%. That includes construction and other payables. So if you just look at merchandise payables as a percent of inventories, it would be 87% a year ago and 4% lower or 83% this year. Last year being higher by 4% or 5% a year is actually the anomaly. A couple of factors. Part of it was last year's West Coast port slowdowns. You had a lot less inventory a year ago on some big-ticket low-turn items like electronics. Just that one department was $120-plus million of higher inventory and only a few millions dollars of higher accounts payable. And then gas payables, again, was $230 million on the wrong side of this AP calculation as we try to keep our tanks a little full -- or more full when prices decline. So again, that's the rundown of the business and nothing per se exceptional there.
In terms of average inventory per warehouse, pretty much flat year-over-year, coming in just $6,000 higher this year our average inventory per warehouse of $12,761,000,000, up from $12,755,000 a year ago. Ex FX, year-over-year inventory levels per warehouse were up -- more than the $6,000, they were up $286,000 or up 2%. But that, again, on a normalized basis, I think, is one of the smaller increases we've seen year-over-year in that. Overall inventory is in a good shape, not only in a good shape, we just completed the midyear -- our midyear fiscal inventories, and it's our best Street results ever by a basis point plus. So again, I think it's indicative of running a clean shop there.
In terms of CapEx. In Q1, we spent $715 million. In Q2, we spent an approximately $650 million more. We're still on track this year for fiscal '16 CapEx to be in the range of $2.8-plus billion, maybe as high as $3 billion, about $2.8 billion to $3 billion. That compares to $2.4 billion CapEx in fiscal '15.
Next, Costco e-commerce, Costco online. We're now in 6 countries, having recently opened in 3 in Taiwan. We're also, of course, in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. For Q2, sales and profits were up over last year. Our total sales were up 19% in the quarter, up 22% ex FX, and on a comp basis, up 18% reported and up 21% ex FX. So continued good results in terms of growing our e-commerce efforts.
In terms of expansion. Fiscal '16, again, we opened ahead of 11 units in Q1, 1 new unit in Q2, so 12 through midyear. We planned 7 net openings in Q3, 9 openings including 2 relos, so 7 of that. And in Q4, we're on task to do 11. So that would give us the 30 total for the fiscal year. If you go back a year ago in fiscal '15, we added 23 net new units on a base of -- what was then beginning base of 653, so about 3.5% square footage growth. Now this year, assuming we get to the 30, that will be about 4.5% square footage growth. Again, the new locations by country, if we do the 30, 21 in the U.S; 3 in Canada; 1 in the U.K.; and 3 into Asia, 1 in Taiwan and 2 in Japan; 1 more in Australia; and 1 more in the -- and 1 in Spain. At Q2 end, total square footage stood at 100.7 million square feet.
And next, in terms of stock buybacks. In Q1, as I had mentioned a quarter ago, we spent about $130 million buying 898,000 shares back, so on an average price of just under $145 a share. In Q2, we spent $80 million on 531,000 shares, so an average price at just over $150 a share. During the first 5 weeks of the past quarter, very little stock was repurchased. In fact, of the total 80 million, 3 million of the 80 million was purchased in the first 5 weeks, and the remainder, the vast majority, was in the last 7 weeks. And that's clearly a function of how we do it. We look at kind of a matrix pricing. As it goes up a little, we buy a little less. If it comes down a little, we buy a little more. As long as we feel comfortable about our runway, I think we'll continue to do that.
In terms of dividends, our first quarterly dividend stands at $0.40 a share. So $1.60 annualized, which, on an annual basis, is about a $700 million number.
That's the quick and dirty of how Q2 went. We -- I'll turn it back to Britney now. I'd be happy to answer any questions. Britney?"

They're the ones that you've mentioned that would -- shopping more frequency as families on a regular basis, and certainly, food is a meaningful part of that. That's what -- one of the -- in my view, one of the 2 or 3 main factors that get people in door on a more frequent basis. You also have small business members who were buying a lot of things, not necessarily fresh foods. Obviously, some restaurants, give me [indiscernible] by some of that, but in terms of maxing out, I've said it before, I continue to be surprised how many more executive members we're getting even among the existing longer tenured members. And so we got to -- look, we got to keep doing what we're doing in terms of being good merchants and constantly improving the value. There's always saturation in everything you do. We're pretty good at figuring out ways to offset that. In the last year or 2, certainly, organics has helped, not only bringing arguably some doer, perhaps, younger members, but taking existing members who love Costco, but there are certain things they didn't buy at Costco because they're an organic family. So I think we'll keep coming up with stuff. But I don't -- I would bet that -- logically, that makes a little sense, but I bet you, it's not that big of a factor, that concern."

That would be -- it's going to be harder and harder to do. But again, we're pretty good at figuring out the reason why they maybe come back. And we're getting more -- we feel good about the fact that in the last couple of years, our average members' age, which a half a dozen years ago was about a 4 year -- they were 4 years older than the U.S. population, that's now just under 2. So that's going in the right direction for a lot of reasons. The fact that we keep adding some gas stations is driving frequency. I remember, years ago, I've heard -- over 30 years, what's -- now that this thing is maxing out, fresh foods or gas stations, whatever it is, we keep figuring out new things. And I feel good about some of the things we're doing in a lot of the nonfoods categories. Fresh foods never ceases to amaze me. And we'll keep going."

We're excited about the value proposition to our members where -- that we think it'll be a net positive long term. Like anything, when we could say, that money, we want to get most of it to our members, and this will be like that as well. We'll get a little benefit from it. As it relates to the fee increase, we really haven't made any decisions, which would be consistent with the 6 times we did it in the past. History has shown, if you just dotted it out chronologically, it's about every 5.5 to 6 years -- 5 to 6 years. The last time we did it was in January of '12. So 5 years would be January of '17, and the 6 years will be a year later. I can only tell you that logically, what they tell you, we certainly wouldn't do anything during the transition. We've got enough going on this year, in midyear when we were doing credit card transition. And so all those align to a possible answer. At the end of the day, I don't know when we'll do it. I can tell you that we feel as comfortable today as ever about the loyalty of our members, and we feel as comfortable as ever that today, that we feel that we've approved the value on that membership way more than the likely increases that you've seen in the past."

The Executive Membership from its inception was $100, and our view at the time was let's build it. And in theory, every time -- for every 5 -- if you think about when we originally did the Executive, I think the Gold Star was $45, and so there was a $55 delta, if you will. And $55 assuming a 2% Reward breakeven, if you will, between do I stay a regular member or become an executive was an incremental $2,750 of annual purchases. And as the $45 went to $50 and to $55, that delta became less. So in theory, another bucket of -- I think it was 2 plus million additional members that fell into that bucket of being above breakeven than below breakeven. And so we wanted to grow it. As we decided to raise it, 5 -- almost 5 years ago, 4 -- plus years ago from -- not only from $50 to $55 but $100 to $110, I think delta, we've gotten a lot of that benefit, and certainly, there's a lot more benefit incrementally than $10.

Overseas, when we first opened in Korea, Taiwan and Japan, and as we've opened new units in new geographic markets in those countries, we might see in the first year our renewal rates in the high 50s to low 60s, and it grows from there. So our renewal rates -- and that's why you see that we separate U.S. and Canada, which is the most mature, that number is a little higher than the worldwide number for that very reason.

And I remember, years ago, when we were always have the -- asked the question, ""How -- what sales -- comp sales number you need to get any leverage at all or to be consistent?"" and our guesstimate at the time, this has been years ago, was something in the 5 -- 4% or 5% range as kind of an underlying comp. And -- but my stronger and more confident portion of the response was, ""Whatever other companies do to be able to better leverage, if sales showed a little weakness, we're not going to be as good because we're not going to do some things."" And we're going to still clean the bathrooms every hour, and we're going to still make sure all the carts are inside and not sitting out there. We're not going to cut labor. And in fact, we'll enhance labor. We've done that at times at the front end to drive more business. And so I think, again, the bottom-of-scale increase, that's easy. That's quantifiable. A few of the moods lined up on a few items. I mentioned the high-cost claims was 3 or 4 basis points. I mentioned there were 3 other items that usually 2 of them go one way and one go the other way. And so it's a couple million or a $0.0025 or a $0.005 impact to the quarter. This time, it was all in one direction. And so you're always going to have that, but I guess I do get a little more defensive when we miss the number. Some of it was we could have done a little better job. And so directionally, we're going to try do a better job. We're going to hope that the moods line up 2 to 1 to the positive, not 3 to 0 in the other way. And we know that we're getting a little less hit from IT modernization, a year or 2 hits. Other than that, that's what we do for a living. I think the other thing is to drive more business, and we're pretty good at that. Oh, and by the way then, the credit card. You've heard it before. I've said it before. Whatever this additional bucket of potential money is, we're going to give most of it to the customer in the form of a co-brand offering, but we're going to keep a little of it.

It's still in the -- it's less than 1%. Maybe it's 0.5% to 1% instead of 0.25% to 0.5%, but I'm guessing there. And then in terms of electronics, I think a couple of things. I think arguably, if we have a higher-end member, that probably helps. We certainly over-indexed on bigger TVs. I know that, during the 4 weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's -- Thanksgiving and Christmas, we had outsized TV sales dollars in talking to every major supplier that we buy from relative to everybody else online and offline.

And even the U.S. economy, while good, there's not a big engine driving it necessarily. So there's a lot going on out there. I think our -- I'm comforted by our consistency even if it's come down a little bit in the last couple of months. And again, I can explain some of that with the strength in frequency a year ago, but look, it's we'd still like an extra 0.5 points or 1 point there. In terms of what keeps me up at night, what do I get -- what do we as a company; and does Craig get -- our CEO, get? And what do we -- what am I -- Bob and I and Jeff ask about? A lot of it centers around dot-com and what are you going to do. And we try to not avoid it or be arrogant about it but also recognize we try not to freak out about it. So I think, in my older age, I'm -- I lose sleep for age-related issues, not the company-related issues. I really feel pretty good fundamentally about our company; and what we've got going on, what we're doing in terms of global sourcing, what we do -- we're doing in terms of the strengths of our signature brands. And things could change, but we're -- we'll keep trying to do a few things on the Internet more, but we're going to take it steady."

We have traffic that's kind of come down a little bit, not a great environment. And so it seems again that maybe something has to give here. I mean, is the wage inflation going to finally pick up demand? I mean, where does this, in your opinion, kind of end?

So other than everybody in the world never wanting to leave their house and only typing stuff to order and get it at the front door, other than that risk, I think that our -- the strength of our merchandising, the strength of our competitiveness, the fact that we're able to be successful in other countries -- I come to every 4-week budget meeting and listen to merchants and some of the things they're doing, and I go out and feel better about what we've got going on. So I -- in terms of -- I think, by the way, when it is tougher for everybody else, everybody else does it less extreme than us.

So last night's press release reported our second quarter and first half fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12- and 24-week periods ended February 14 as well as our monthly sales results for the 4-week reporting in the month of February, which ended this past Sunday, February 28.
For the quarter, reported earnings came in at $1.24 a share as compared to last year's second quarter earnings per share of $1.35. Note that last year's earnings were positively impacted by 2 discrete income tax items that, together, benefited last year's second quarter earnings by $43 million or $0.10 a share, and that excluding these 2 items, earnings for the same quarter last year would have been $1.25 a share.
Among the factors that impacted our second quarter year-over-year earnings comparison, foreign exchange effects as compared to a year ago. During the quarter, the foreign currencies where we operate continue to weaken versus the U.S. dollar in all countries, but primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea, resulting in our foreign earnings in the second quarter when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $32 million or $0.07 a share and exchange rates have been flat year-over-year.
Second item of comparison is our co-branded credit card transition in the U.S. that relates to that. As you know, we are transitioning to a new co-branded credit card relationship in the U.S. this year. As we wind down our current relationship, new co-branded credit cards sign-ups stopped several months ago. The short-term negative earnings impact to the lost co-branded credit card sign-ups was $18 million pretax or a $0.03 per share hit to the second quarter. Recall that the earnings impact was $15 million pretax or $0.02 a share last fiscal quarter and will continue to impact earnings in Q3 and a little even into the first month of Q4. As of today, we expect to have the new co-branded Visa cards in the hands of our members in May with a go-live transition date in June. Now while I can't give you any specifics regarding the new card, contractually, I can't do that yet, I do look forward to sharing more details with you at that time.
Third item, IT modernization. Our major IT modernization efforts continue to impact SG&A expense percentages, especially as depreciation begins on the new systems that are now being placed into service. In the second quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by about $10 million or an estimated 3 basis points -- 2 basis points without the gas deflation, which was about $0.01 a share.
There is a light at the end of this tunnel with the SG&A headwinds. Based on our current estimates, we expect the year-over-year basis point impact to SG&A is likely to be just a couple of additional basis points in fiscal year '17 and then flattened out and hopefully a little better than flattening out over the next couple of years after that.
Stock compensation expense was higher year-over-year in the second quarter by $14 million or $0.02 a share. And lastly, in terms of the year-over-year comparison, LIFO, last year, in the second quarter, we had a -- we recorded a pretax LIFO credit of $4 million. This year, in the second quarter, with deflation being a little bit more impactful than in the past couple of months, we've had a LIFO -- we had a LIFO pretax credit of $15 million, resulting in a year-over-year delta of $11 million or $0.02 a share.
Now turning to our second quarter sales. Reported sales were up 3%, and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was up 1%. For the quarter, sales was negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation to the tune of 80 basis points and by weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar by minus 340 basis points. Such that excluding gas deflation, the reported plus 3% U.S. comp for the second quarter would have been a plus 4%. The reported Canadian comp of a minus 7% in the second quarter would be a plus 10%, excluding both gas deflation and assuming flat FX rates year-over-year. And the reported minus 3% International comp figure for the quarter, excluding gas and FX, would have been a plus 6%. Total comps, again, reported 1% for the quarter and excluding gas and events, would have been up 5%. 
For the 4-week month of February, which, again, ended this past Sunday, reported comps came in at flat at 0%. That consisted of a plus 2% comp on a reported basis in the U.S., a minus 2% reported in Canada and a minus 8% Other International.
As we discussed last month, the calendar shift of Super Bowl moved sales out of January reporting period into February. We estimated that this shift benefited our U.S. sales for the month of February by about 0.75% and the total company by about 0.5%. 
Sales were negatively impacted by, again, gas deflation, which started to head down again during the month, by an 850 basis point negative impact to the comp -- to the number; and also by weakening FX, currency -- foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar to the tune of 250 basis points. Excluding gas deflation in the U.S., the reported plus 2% U.S. comp for February would have been a plus 4%. Excluding gas deflation and FX in February, minus 2% comp in Canada would have been a plus 10%. And the reported minus 8% International comp would have been flat year-over-year, ex gas and FX. Total company comps reported, again, 0 for the month would have been a plus 4%, excluding gas and FX.
I might mention that the Other International normalized number, in other words, ex gas and FX, of 0 mostly related to the timing of the Chinese Lunar Year holidays. We don't think that will be an issue after the timing of that.
A final comment on deflation. Beyond gasoline price deflation that we've always pointed out each month, we have seen a little additional deflation across many merchandise categories such as sales have been impacted a bit by -- a little bit more in the past couple of months.
In terms of new openings, our opening activities and plans, we planned -- we opened 13 units -- new units in Q1, including 2 relos, so a net of 11 new locations in the first quarter. In Q2, we opened 1 new business center in Westminster, California. For all of fiscal 2016, we're still on target to do 30 net new locations, 21 of which will be in the U.S, 3 in Canada, 2 in Japan and 1 each in the U.K, Taiwan, Australia and Spain.
Also this morning, I'll review with you our e-commerce activities, membership trends and renewal information, additional discussion, of course, of margins and SG&A and a couple of other items of note.
Okay. In terms of the second quarter results. Sales for the quarter were $27.57 billion, up 3% from last year. On a reported comp basis, Q2 comps were up 1% for the quarter, up 5% ex gas and FX. For the quarter, our plus 1% reported comp was a combination of an average transaction decrease of minus 2.5% and an average shopping frequency increase of just over 3%. Now the minus 2.5% average transaction decrease, again, taking FX and gas out of that number, that minus 2.5% would have been a positive number that would be just under plus 2%.
In terms of sales comparisons geographically, in the U.S., the Midwest, Texas and California regions were strongest. Internationally, in Q2, in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, Canada, Australia and Taiwan.
In terms of merchandising categories for the quarter, for the same quarter within food and sundries, overall, flattish. Meat, deli and sundries were the leaders. Tobacco, negative in the low double digits as we continue to eliminate tobacco SKUs for various locations. For hardlines, overall, in the mid-single-digit range. Departments with the strongest results were consumer electronics, which was up in the low to mid-teens; sporting goods; lawn and garden; and tires. Within the low to mid-single-digit softlines, domestics and apparel were the standouts. And in fresh foods, our comp sales were in the low single-digit range, with produce showing the best results among the 4 main fresh foods categories.
Lastly, as we've mentioned, during the December and January sales calls, in the U.S., we're seeing deflation in the low single-digit range for food and sundries -- for food, sundries and fresh foods. And now, again, a little bit lower on the nonfood side as well.
In terms of February, traffic was up a little over 3.5%, while the average transaction was down a little under 4%, about 3.75%. Again, gas, as I mentioned earlier, fell again a little more dramatically in February. The average sale price year-over-year in gas was down 21% for the month, which is a bigger decline year-over-year than we saw in the quarter overall.
In terms of geographic regions, again, for February, Texas, Southeast and Midwest regions were strongest. And internationally, in local currencies, Mexico and Canada were at the top.
From a merchandise category standpoint, ex FX, all categories, food, sundries, hardlines, softlines, fresh foods, were in the mid-single-digit range for February reporting period, again, a little deflation impacting these. And it's a little deflation, but it's more than we have seen historically -- of recent history.
Moving down to line items in the income statement. Membership fees, we came in for this fiscal year at $603 million, up 4% or $21 million from $582 million a year ago and up 2 basis points as a percent of sales. Again, that $21 million increase and 4% dollar increase, if you assumed flat FX, the $21 million would have been a $40 million increase, and the 4% increase, ex FX, would have been a 7% increase. And in terms of membership, renewal rates remained strong, 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% rounded up to -- in worldwide. Continuing increasing penetration of executive member I think helps that. New membership sign-ups in Q2 company-wide were up 4%. I will point out, last month, the early part of February and into the second week of February, for 12 days, we ran a new membership promotion of LivingSocial. Recall that we also ran a membership promotion with LivingSocial about 18 months ago. Like that one, it went well. And we don't do it too often, and I don't want to get people used to it, but it was a good result.
In terms of new members at Q2 end, Gold Star members at Q2 end was 35.4 million, up from 34.7 million at Q1 end 12 weeks earlier. Business Primary remained at 7.2 million. Business add-ons remained at 3.5 million. So in total, at Q2 end, we were 46.1 million versus 45.4 million at Q1 end. And total cardholders would be 84.0 million, up from 82.7 million.
As of the end of the second quarter, paid executive memberships totaled 16.6 million of our members, an increase of 214,000 over the 12-week month or about 18,000-a-week increase in the quarter. And as I've mentioned before, executive members are a little more than 1/3 of our membership base and about 2/3 of our sales results.
In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, they continue strong. Business, in U.S. and Canada, it was at 94.5%, same as it was a quarter ago. Gold Star was 89.7%, same as a quarter ago. Total U.S. and Canada at 19.5%, same as a quarter ago. Worldwide at 87.7%, down a tick from 87.8% at Q1 end. A little bit of rounding, and as you know, in all new markets, we generally have in the first year lower renewal rates -- second year, the first year of renewals.
I'd mentioned, I think, the last couple of months that in Canada, when we did the credit card conversion, which is a little different than the one we're doing here. It was referred to as the de novo thing, where everybody had to sign up for a new credit card and apply and what have you. And so your renewal rates related to auto renewals, which is by definition are high. It comes down a little. That will be anniversary-ing after next quarter. So we saw a little tick down in Canada in this quarter year-over-year as we had in the last couple of quarters as well. That should be 1 more quarter of that, again, not terribly meaningful, but we've been asked.
Going down the gross margin line. Our gross margin in the second quarter was higher year-over-year on a reported basis by 17 basis points. As always, we'll jot down 4 columns of numbers with 6 line items. The first 2 columns are Q1 '16 and Q1 '16. The columns would be reported, column 1; column 2 would be without gas deflation. Then we'd have Q2 '16, 2 columns, reported and without gas deflation. Reading across, core merchandising in Q1 on a reported basis was up 24 basis points. Ex gas deflation was down 3 basis points year-over-year. For Q2 '16, reported was plus 5; and without deflation, minus 3. Ancillary, plus 11 and plus 4 in the first quarter year-over-year; plus 9 and plus 7 in Q2. 2% Reward, minus 3 and minus 1; Q2, minus 1 and 0. LIFO, plus 1 and plus 1; and in Q2, plus 4 and plus 4. Other was minus 7 and minus 7 a year ago; and not an issue, 0 and 0 in Q2. Such that total reported year-over-year in Q1, we were up 26 basis points gross margin; without gas deflation, down 6 basis points. And in Q2, we were up 17 and up 8, ex gas deflation.
As you can see, the core component of gross margin was higher by 5; 3, excluding gas deflation in the quarter. Core gross margins, food, sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales were positive year-over-year in Q1 by 11 basis points, with food, sundries and hardlines showing higher year-over-year gross margins as a percentage of their own sales, while softlines and fresh foods are a little lower year-over-year as a percent of sales. But again, the net of those 4 major categories as a percent of their own sales was up year-over-year in the quarter by 11 basis points.
Ancillary and other business gross margins were up 9 basis points, 7 without gas, both -- in terms of various ancillary businesses, our gas business, our food courts, our hearing aid centers, our tire shops and our one hour mini labs, all showed higher gross margins year-over-year as a percentage of their own sales. Again, Executive Membership, not an issue, without deflation, 0 impact year-over-year. And again, LIFO was 4 basis point benefit to the gross margin year-over-year.
Moving to reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentage in Q2 was higher or worse year-over-year by 34 basis points on a reported basis and higher or up by 27 basis points ex deflation. Let me again give you these tabular numbers, and then I'll give you some text around those. Again, the 4 columns would be reported Q1 -- first columns will be Q1 '16 year-over-year reported and without gas and deflation and Q2 reported, without gas. Those will be the 4 columns. The first line item, operations, would be 0 basis points in Q1 reported and plus 26 without gas deflation, the plus meaning lower or better. In Q2, minus 22 and minus 16. Central, minus 8 and minus 6 in Q1; in Q2, minus 8 and minus 7. Stock expense, minus 12 and minus 10 in Q1; and Q2, minus 4 and minus 4. And quarterly adjustments or unusual items, minus 8 and minus 8 in Q1 and no unusual items to point out, 0 and 0 in Q2. Such that in Q1 year-over-year, on a reported basis, SG&A was minus 28 basis points or higher by 28 basis points. In Q1, ex gas, it was better or lower by 2 basis points. So a plus 2. In Q2, it was minus 34, as I mentioned, and minus 27 ex gas deflation. So higher by 27. Now the core operations against component, minus 22. Again, minus 16 ex gas -- ex the impact of gas deflation. Of that minus 16, payroll was about minus 2. Benefits and workers' comp were minus 8, with the remaining 6 -- minus 6 basis points being a variety of items, including bank fees, depreciation and the various other items. Again, I think a few of those things relate to a slight -- a very slight change in sales increases and a couple of things just going a basis point in the wrong direction.
I also point out that within the benefits of workers' comp, about -- one thing that stood out is just in January, we had what's referred to as a high-cost claims for employee benefits, medical claims. Typically, it averages over the last 2 years, just U.S., about $6 million or $7 million. A year ago, it was a little lower than that. It was about $3.5 million. This year, it was about $13 million. So nothing unusual, and then we thought we'd refer to it as high-cost claims benefits over $100,000, but it just spiked, and that's a few basis points there. But again, that will come and go in both directions.
In terms of central expense, higher year-over-year in Q2 by 8 basis points, 7 without gas. As I mentioned earlier, IT was 3 basis points of that or 2 without deflation -- without gas deflation. In addition, we had several onetime items, which the total represented about $9 million. Again, we always have a few onetime fees that go either way. We had 3 items that, together, totaled $9 million. But they are what they are and didn't impact our SG&A. And lastly, the stock compensation expense is 4 basis points.
But before I move on from SG&A, I do want to mention one additional expense headwind that is just starting. In March, every 3 years, we review our pace scales that impact our entire employee agreement. We always review top of scale and historically increased the top of scale every year in March, where the roughly 60%, 65% of our employees that are at top of scale already. In addition, this year, we're also changing the starting level -- our entry-level hourly wages. This is the first change to the entry-level wages in 9 years. Since 2007, our entry-level wage in U.S. and Canada was $11.50 or $12 an hour. Effective this month, in the U.S. and Canada, we're increasing our starting wages from $11.50 and $12 to $13 and $13.50, so up $1.50. We estimate that this will cost us about $0.01 a share in Q3 year-over-year and about $0.02 a share in each of the next 3 fiscal quarters. Again, it's part of what we do and as -- yes, there are a few warehouses that we've already started people at a higher level, simply markets like Bay Area or some limited markets like that. But at the end of the day, it'll be about the numbers that I mentioned in terms of the impact to earnings.
Next to the income statement is preopening expense. Pretty much the same year-over-year at $9 million last year and $10 million this year. Last year, we had no actual openings in the quarter, but a lot of that relates to openings that are just getting ready to occur or just occurred as well as one opening this year. Our total operating income in Q2 came in at $856 million, down 2% from a year ago's $877 million.
Below the operating income line, reported interest expense in Q2 came in at $31 million. That's up $4 million from last year's $27 million. The increase is primarily due to interest on the billion dollar debt offering that was completed in Q3 last year related to our special -- onetime special dividend that we did back in February, a year ago. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $4 million, coming in at $20 million last year and only $16 million this year. Actual interest income for the quarter was lower year-over-year by about $8 million, primarily a factor of less cash on hand this year as compared to a year earlier. This is a result, again, of our -- 2 things, we had a $1.2 billion debt payoff last December as well as we used about $1 billion of our cash towards paying that $5 share special dividend last February 27 a year ago.
Overall pretax income was lower by 3% or $29 million in Q2 going from $870 million a year ago to $841 million.
In terms of income taxes, we got a little help there. Our company income tax rate this quarter came in right at 34%, up from a little over 30% a year ago in the quarter. The income tax line on this year's Q2 benefited from a few positive discrete items resulting in a -- in the 34% rate. Our normalized rate would have been a shade over 35%. While last year's income tax line benefited from, as I mentioned -- I mentioned earlier a $43 million benefit in the call primarily relating to our $5 special cash dividend. Overall reported net income of $598 million last year in Q2 compares to $546 million of net income this year in Q2 on a reported basis.
Rundown of a few other items. Balance sheet is included in this morning's press release. A couple of things I always point out on this call. Depreciation and amortization for Q2 totaled $285 million for the quarter and $556 million year-to-date. Our AP ratio, accounts payable as a percent of payables, last year, in Q2, on a reported basis, it was 97%; and this year, 5 percentage points lower at 92%. That includes construction and other payables. So if you just look at merchandise payables as a percent of inventories, it would be 87% a year ago and 4% lower or 83% this year. Last year being higher by 4% or 5% a year is actually the anomaly. A couple of factors. Part of it was last year's West Coast port slowdowns. You had a lot less inventory a year ago on some big-ticket low-turn items like electronics. Just that one department was $120-plus million of higher inventory and only a few millions dollars of higher accounts payable. And then gas payables, again, was $230 million on the wrong side of this AP calculation as we try to keep our tanks a little full -- or more full when prices decline. So again, that's the rundown of the business and nothing per se exceptional there.
In terms of average inventory per warehouse, pretty much flat year-over-year, coming in just $6,000 higher this year our average inventory per warehouse of $12,761,000,000, up from $12,755,000 a year ago. Ex FX, year-over-year inventory levels per warehouse were up -- more than the $6,000, they were up $286,000 or up 2%. But that, again, on a normalized basis, I think, is one of the smaller increases we've seen year-over-year in that. Overall inventory is in a good shape, not only in a good shape, we just completed the midyear -- our midyear fiscal inventories, and it's our best shrink results ever by a basis point plus. So again, I think it's indicative of running a clean shop there.
In terms of CapEx. In Q1, we spent $715 million. In Q2, we spent an approximately $650 million more. We're still on track this year for fiscal '16 CapEx to be in the range of $2.8-plus billion, maybe as high as $3 billion, about $2.8 billion to $3 billion. That compares to $2.4 billion CapEx in fiscal '15.
Next, Costco e-commerce, Costco online. We're now in 6 countries, having recently opened in 3 in Taiwan. We're also, of course, in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. For Q2, sales and profits were up over last year. Our total sales were up 19% in the quarter, up 22% ex FX, and on a comp basis, up 18% reported and up 21% ex FX. So continued good results in terms of growing our e-commerce efforts.
In terms of expansion. Fiscal '16, again, we opened ahead of 11 units in Q1, 1 new unit in Q2, so 12 through midyear. We planned 7 net openings in Q3, 9 openings including 2 relos, so 7 net. And in Q4, we're on task to do 11. So that would give us the 30 total for the fiscal year. If you go back a year ago in fiscal '15, we added 23 net new units on a base of -- what was then beginning base of 653, so about 3.5% square footage growth. Now this year, assuming we get to the 30, that will be about 4.5% square footage growth. Again, the new locations by country, if we do the 30, 21 in the U.S; 3 in Canada; 1 in the U.K.; and 3 into Asia, 1 in Taiwan and 2 in Japan; 1 more in Australia; and 1 more in the -- and 1 in Spain. At Q2 end, total square footage stood at 100.7 million square feet.
And next, in terms of stock buybacks. In Q1, as I had mentioned a quarter ago, we spent about $130 million buying 898,000 shares back, so on an average price of just under $145 a share. In Q2, we spent $80 million on 531,000 shares, so an average price at just over $150 a share. During the first 5 weeks of the past quarter, very little stock was repurchased. In fact, of the total 80 million, 3 million of the 80 million was purchased in the first 5 weeks, and the remainder, the vast majority, was in the last 7 weeks. And that's clearly a function of how we do it. We look at kind of a matrix pricing. As it goes up a little, we buy a little less. If it comes down a little, we buy a little more. As long as we feel comfortable about our runway, I think we'll continue to do that.
In terms of dividends, our first quarterly dividend stands at $0.40 a share. So $1.60 annualized, which, on an annual basis, is about a $700 million number.
That's the quick and dirty of how Q2 went. We -- I'll turn it back to Britney now. I'd be happy to answer any questions. Britney?"

They're the ones that you've mentioned that would -- shopping more frequency as families on a regular basis, and certainly, food is a meaningful part of that. That's what -- one of the -- in my view, one of the 2 or 3 main factors that get people in door on a more frequent basis. You also have small business members who were buying a lot of things, not necessarily fresh foods. Obviously, some restaurants, give me [indiscernible] by some of that, but in terms of maxing out, I've said it before, I continue to be surprised how many more executive members we're getting even among the existing longer tenured members. And so we got to -- look, we got to keep doing what we're doing in terms of being good merchants and constantly improving the value. There's always saturation in everything you do. We're pretty good at figuring out ways to offset that. In the last year or 2, certainly, organics has helped, not only bringing arguably some newer, perhaps, younger members, but taking existing members who love Costco, but there are certain things they didn't buy at Costco because they're an organic family. So I think we'll keep coming up with stuff. But I don't -- I would bet that -- logically, that makes a little sense, but I bet you, it's not that big of a factor, that concern."

And we're getting more -- we feel good about the fact that in the last couple of years, our average members' age, which a half a dozen years ago was about a 4 year -- they were 4 years older than the U.S. population, that's now just under 2. So that's going in the right direction for a lot of reasons. The fact that we keep adding some gas stations is driving frequency. I remember, years ago, I've heard -- over 30 years, what's -- now that this thing is maxing out, fresh foods or gas stations, whatever it is, we keep figuring out new things. And I feel good about some of the things we're doing in a lot of the non-foods categories. Fresh foods never ceases to amaze me. And we'll keep going."

We'll see. And in terms of transition, there's not a lot contractually that we can do.

We're excited about the value proposition to our members where -- that we think it'll be a net positive long term. Like anything, when we can save that money, we want to get most of it to our members, and this will be like that as well. We'll get a little benefit from it. As it relates to the fee increase, we really haven't made any decisions, which would be consistent with the 6 times we did it in the past. History has shown, if you just dotted it out chronologically, it's about every 5.5 to 6 years -- 5 to 6 years. The last time we did it was in January of '12. So 5 years would be January of '17, and the 6 years will be a year later. I can only tell you that logic would dictate, we certainly wouldn't do anything during the transition. We've got enough going on this year, in midyear when we were doing credit card transition. And so all those align to a possible answer. At the end of the day, I don't know when we'll do it. I can tell you that we feel as comfortable today as ever about the loyalty of our members, and we feel as comfortable as ever that today, that we feel that we've improved the value on that membership way more than the likely increases that you've seen in the past."

The Executive Membership from its inception was $100, and our view at the time was let's build it. And in theory, every time -- for every 5 -- if you think about when we originally did the Executive, I think the Gold Star was $45, and so there was a $55 delta, if you will. And $55 assuming a 2% Reward breakeven, if you will, between do I stay a regular member or become an executive was an incremental $2,750 of annual purchases. And as the $45 went to $50 and to $55, that delta became less. So in theory, another bucket of -- I think it was 2 plus million additional members that fell into that bucket of being above breakeven than below breakeven. And so we wanted to grow it. As we decided to raise it, 5 -- almost 5 years ago, 4 -- plus years ago from -- not only from $50 to $55 but $100 to $110, I think delta, we've gotten a lot of that benefit, and certainly, there's a lot more benefit incrementally than $10.

Overseas, when we first opened in Korea, Taiwan and Japan, and as we've opened new units in new geographic markets in those countries, we might see in the first year our renewal rates in the high 50s to low 60s, and it grows from there. So our renewal rates -- and that's why you see that we separate U.S. and Canada, which is the most mature, that number is a little higher than the worldwide number for that very reason. We always see a higher renewal rate among the Executive Members. They get it.

And I remember, years ago, when we were always have the -- asked the question, ""How -- what sales -- comp sales number you need to get any leverage at all or to be consistent?"" and our guesstimate at the time, this has been years ago, was something in the 5 -- 4% or 5% range as kind of an underlying comp. And -- but my stronger and more confident portion of the response was, ""Whatever other companies do to be able to better leverage, if sales showed a little weakness, we're not going to be as good because we're not going to do some things."" And we're going to still clean the bathrooms every hour, and we're going to still make sure all the carts are inside and not sitting out there. We're not going to cut labor. And in fact, we'll enhance labor. We've done that at times at the front end to drive more business. And so I think, again, the bottom-of-scale increase, that's easy. That's quantifiable. A few of the moods lined up on a few items. I mentioned the high-cost claims was 3 or 4 basis points. I mentioned there were 3 other items that usually 2 of them go one way and one go the other way. And so it's a couple million or a $0.0025 or a $0.005 impact to the quarter. This time, it was all in one direction. And so you're always going to have that, but I guess I do get a little more defensive when we miss the number. Some of it was we could have done a little better job. And so directionally, we're going to try do a better job. We're going to hope that the moods line up 2 to 1 to the positive, not 3 to 0 in the other way. And we know that we're getting a little less hit from IT modernization, a year or 2 in. Other than that, that's what we do for a living. I think the other thing is to drive more business, and we're pretty good at that. Oh, and by the way then, the credit card. You've heard it before. I've said it before. Whatever this additional bucket of potential money is, we're going to give most of it to the customer in the form of a co-brand offering, but we're going to keep a little of it.

I think arguably, if we have a higher-end member, that probably helps. We certainly over-indexed on bigger TVs. I know that, during the 4 weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's -- Thanksgiving and Christmas, we had outsized TV sales dollars in talking to every major supplier that we buy from relative to everybody else online and offline.

We know that, when you come in store, you're going to buy a lot more than when you shop online in general and recognizing our average online transaction is actually higher than our in-store visit, but that's because we started with just big ticket items. It's just recently we've put on some other smaller ticket items. But we know that, compared to, let's say, an Instacart or a Google experience, the in-store visit is 2.5 to 3 times, if not little -- more than that. Now what we're finding is that, that customer comes in a little less frequency, does the online several times. And that too is an aggregate improvement in their comp, so that works.

And even the U.S. economy, while good, there's not a big engine driving it necessarily. So there's a lot going on out there. I think our -- I'm comforted by our consistency even if it's come down a little bit in the last couple of months. And again, I can explain some of that with the strength in frequency a year ago, but look, it's we'd still like an extra 0.5 points or 1 point there. In terms of what keeps me up at night, what do I get -- what do we as a company; and does Craig get -- our CEO, get? And what do we -- what am I -- Bob and I and Jeff ask about? A lot of it centers around dot-com and what are you going to do. And we try to not avoid it or be arrogant about it but also recognize we try not to freak out about it. So I think, in my older age, I'm -- I lose sleep for age-related issues, not the company-related issues. I really feel pretty good fundamentally about our company; and what we've got going on, what we're doing in terms of global sourcing, what we do -- we're doing in terms of the strengths of our signature brands. And things could change, but we're -- we'll keep trying to do a few things on the Internet more, but we're going to take it steady."

We have traffic that's kind of come down a little bit, not a great environment. And so it seems again that maybe something has to give here. I mean, is the wage inflation going to finally pick up demand? I mean, where does this, in your opinion, kind of end?

Before I begin, please note these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, events, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. 
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. Last night's press release reported our third quarter and year-to-date fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12- and 36-week period ended this past May 8. 
For the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $1.24, up 6% over last year's third quarter earnings per share of $1.17. In comparing our third quarter results year-over-year, there are a few items of note. As usual, FX as compared to a year ago during the quarter, the foreign currencies in the countries where we operate weakened overall versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea. This resulted in our foreign earnings in Q3 when converted into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, being lower by about $15 million or $0.03 a share than they would have been had the various foreign exchange rates versus the dollar been flat year-over-year. 
Gross margins. On a reported basis, it was higher by 34 basis points. This included a $19 million benefit from non-recurring legal settlements. This represented 7 basis points of margin improvement or about $0.03 per share. 
#3, our co-branded credit card transition in the United States. With the transition to our new co-brand CE Visa card next month, co-brand AMEX credit card sign-ups start, as you know, late last calendar year, I think in October, November. The short-term negative earnings impact of the lost co-branded credit card sign-ups in the quarter or year-over-year was about $11 million or $0.02 a share to the negative. We Expect Avenue co-branded Visa cards in the hands of our members by the end of May, early June. Some of you may have already received it in the mail with a go live transition date of Monday, June 20. 
#4, wages. As I mentioned, in our last quarter's second quarter's earnings conference call back in March, in addition to what we do on top of scale increase each year, which we generate again we have done it each year each March. This year, we also increase our bottom scale hourly rates in U.S. and Canada, which is about 80% of our company. Effective this past March 14, we increased our starting wage of $1.50 to $13 and $13.50 an hour. The new bottom of scale wage increase result in a year-over-year incremental payroll expense of about $6 million or $$0.01 a share in the quarter. We estimate that this will be anywhere from $0.01 to $0.02 a quarter in each of the next 3 quarters, depending on which way it rounds. 
#5, IT modernization. IT modernization efforts negatively impacted SG&A expenses in Q3 on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $16 million, which is about 5 basis points or $0.02 a share to SG&A. I believe in second -- first and second quarter this year, that year-over-year delta of modernization expense was 7 basis points negative in Q1 and 3 in Q2, so looks like around 5 a quarter for the first quarters of the year. 
LIFO, this year in Q3 we had picked up a little bit there from LIFO credit. We recorded pretax LIFO credit of $30 million in the quarter. Last year, it was also deflationary, but as you know, deflation has continued with $7 million. So again, about a $6 million or $0.01 a share delta there. 
Those are the items I'd point out.  Turning to our third quarter sales. Total reported sales, as you know, were up -- as reported, was up 2% and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was flat or 0. Sales, of course, were negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation. That was almost 2 percentage points impact and about 190 basis points and by the weakened foreign currencies relative to the dollar that I just mention. That was about 145 basis points. So excluding gas deflation, the flat U.S. comp number we reported would have been a plus 3%. In Canada, the plus 1% reported Canadian comp would have been a plus 8 in local currency excluding gas deflation and flat FX rate. And the reported minus 2 Other international, excluding gas deflation and assumes flat year-over-year FX, that would have been a plus 3.  So all told, a reported 0 comp for the quarter, ex gas and FX, would have been a plus 3. 
In terms of new openings. In the quarter, we opened 7 locations and also completed 1 relo. So year-to-date for the first 36 weeks, we've opened a total of 19 new warehouses and 3 relos. For all of '16, we have a current plan of 29 net new locations, a little over 2/3 of them, 21 will be in the U.S. 2 in Canada, 2 in Japan and 1 each in the U.K, Taiwan, Australia and Spain. 
This morning, I'll also, of course, review with you e-commerce activities, membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussion about margins and SG&A and the quarter and a couple of other items. 
So going down the P&L, again, for sales, sales were up 2%, on a reported -- total sales were up 2%. Recorded comps, flat, reported up 3 excluding gas and FX. Now the 0 flat comp on a reported basis was a combination of an average transaction decrease of a little under 3% -- minus 2.7% on a reported basis and again, ex gas and FX, the average transaction increase would have actually been up 0.5%.  The average shopping frequency increase was up 3% for the quarter, which is most in February, all of March, all of April and a little bit of May. 
In terms of sales process by geography. In the U.S., Texas, Midwest and Southeast regions were the stronger ones. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, Canada and U.K.. In terms of merchandising categories for the quarter, within food and sundries, which was overall flattish year-over-year, sundries, foods and retail were the leaders. Tobacco, as I think I mentioned a little bit on the April sales call, was negative in the low teens as we continue to eliminate tobacco from various locations. 
From hardlines overall in the mid-single digits. The departments with the strongest results were sporting goods, toys, seasonal, automotive, consumer electronics and garden and patio. I think I'll have to go look what was down because those were all pretty good departments or within hardlines. 
Within low to mid-single-digit softlines comps, single digit softline comps, small electrics and home furnishings were the standouts. And lastly, in fresh foods, comp sales overall in the low single digits. Produce and deli showed their best results. Of course, we probably have the most deflation I think in the meal, poultry and pork areas. 
In the U.S., we continue to see deflation in the low single digit range for food and sundries and, as I mentioned, fresh foods and a little in some of the nonfoods areas as well, notably electronics. 
Moving to the income statement. Membership fees came in -- dollars were up 6% and up 7 basis points as a percent of sales, coming in up $34 million from $584 million last year to $618 million. Again, FX currencies exchange rates impact this number. Without FX, we're assuming flat year-over-year FX, the $618 million would've been up $7 million more, so 6% dollar increase year-over-year would've been up 7, same number of basis points, of course, up 7. 
In terms of renewal rates. We continue with strong renewal rates, 90%-plus in the U.S. and Canada, 88% worldwide. Continuing increasing penetration to the executive membership, and I'll talk about that in a second. New member sign-ups in the quarter, company-wide, we're up 15% year-over-year, in part driven by stronger signups in our new openings in Taiwan and Japan. The Asian openings always have outsized new sign-ups. We also had very strong sign-ups in Tulsa, for that matter. Overall, in the U.S. in fact it was up 15% as well. 
In terms of number of members in third quarter end, Gold Star was 36.2 million, up from 12 weeks earlier of 35.4 million. Primary business, the same at 7.2 million; business add-ons, the same at 3.5 million at the beginning and end of the quarter. So all told, 46.9 million member households versus up 800,000 from 46.1 million at Q2 end. 
Total cardholders is 85.5 million, up 1.5 million from 84.0 million at the end of the second quarter. Admission and executive memberships came in right at the end of Q3 with right at 17 million executive members, which is an increase of actually 402,000 over the 12-week period or 33,000 a week increase in the quarter. This tends to be at the high end of that weekly increase in many of the last recent quarters. Executive members are approximately 36% of our member base and about 2/3 of our sales and again continues to improve penetration. 
In terms of an war renewal rates, those numbers were 94.4 million at the end of the quarter, tweaked down from 94.5 million, Gold Star 89.6 million and also 89.7 million. So total U.S. and Canada, 90.4 million, down from 90.5 million. Worldwide 87.6 million at the end of the quarter, again, 1/10 [ph] down as well. Within the U.S. and Canada, of course, we've seen a bigger tick down in 10% [ph] in Canada, and that has to do as we anniversary now about 18 months when we initiated the change in credit cards up there, which was actually everybody have to sign up against. I think part of that is the auto renewal. You'll see a little of that in the U.S. since we haven't been adding on, accepting new applications for the current credit card, co-branded credit card since past October, but pretty much in line with what we've got. 
In terms of gross margin. Our reported gross margin, as I may have mentioned, was up 34 basis points, 11.43% this year versus 11.09% last year. And as usual, I'll ask you to jot down 4 columns of numbers, providing a little expectation here. The fourth column would be Q2 '16, columns 1 and 2 are both Q2 '16, these are year-over-year changes in basis points, first column will be reported figures for margin, second would be without the impact of gas deflations since that distort the numbers wildly. And then the columns 3 and 4 would be Q3 '16 both reported and in column 3 Q2 '16 without gas deflation. 
In terms of line items. First line item on your cross will be co-merchandising. So Q2 '16, we reported a plus 5 basis points year-over-year, ex gas deflation was minus 3. In Q3, reported plus 16 and ex gas minus 2. Ancillary, plus 9 and a plus 7. And in columns 3 and 4, plus 9 and a plus 4. 2% Reward, minus 1 and 0 and in Q3, reported without gas 0 and plus 2. 
LIFO in the second quarter, plus 4, plus 4; in the third quarter, plus 2, plus 2; Other, 0 and 0 in the first 2 columns and a plus 7 in columns 3 and 4, that's the -- those are non-recurring legal settlements I talked about earlier. If you add up those columns, reported in Q2 year-over-year, we had up 17 basis point margin and up 8 on an ex gas deflation basis. And again, while we reported a plus 34, it's a plus 13 ex gas deflation. 
In terms of the quarter merchandise component which again reported plus 16 but minus 2. If you look at the 4 key categories, which is 80-plus percent of our business, sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods. As a percentage of their own sales, they were positive year-over-year by 16 basis points with food and sundries, hardlines and softlines all being up year-over-year and fresh foods being slightly down during the quarter -- year-over-year. Ancillary and other business -- and by the way, those numbers exclude that non-recurring items that I mentioned. 
Ancillary and other businesses margins were up 9 basis points, up 4 without gas and within the quarter on their own sales, gas, optical and hearing aids all showed higher margins year-over-year as a percentage of their own sales. I mentioned LIFO already, it was a 2-basis point benefit year-over-year and other, again, the 7-basis point improvement year-over-year. So even ex that on an ex gas deflation basis, margins were up on a few basis points year-over-year. 
Moving down to expenses. SG&A on a reported basis were higher by 33 basis points coming in at 10.44 compared to 10.11 a year ago. Again, we'll do the same 4 columns. Q2 reported and without gas and then Q3 reported without gas. Core operations, minus 22 reported year-over-year. The minus means higher year-over-year. Gas was up -- ex gas on Q2 was minus 16; columns 3 and 4, minus 24 and minus 8; central in Q2 was minus 8, minus 7; Q3, minus 6 and minus 4; stock compensation, minus 4 and minus 4 and then a minus 3 and a minus 2; and no quarterly adjustments. So all told, reported year-over-year in Q2 SG&A higher by 34 basis points on a reported basis and 27 ex gas. This quarter Q3 reported higher SG&A by 33, 14 higher ex gas. Basically if you go back to the core operations or core operations, the ex gas deflation, the 8 basis point year-over-year higher, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits year-over-year, which impacted that minus 8 by minus 12, so more than the minus 8. These items were somewhat offset by a variety of other controllable expense items. Q2 is, of course, always the lowest volume quarter and of course, as we know, sales were a little weaker for a variety of reasons including some deflation. 
Central expense was higher year-over-year in the quarter by 6, ex gas by 4, IT is the 4 on an ex-gas bases and as I mentioned, it was minus 500 recorded but essentially out ex that central. I think we did a pretty good job in the quarter particularly in that. I guess stock compensation, no surprise there. 
Next on income statement preopening. A little higher year-over-year, $18 million from the quarter versus $14 million a year ago. So up by a basis point. This year, we had 8 openings including 1 relo. Last year in the quarter, we had 4 opening and 1 relo, including 1 relo. And again, some of that is not just related to the specific openings and it may include some right before the quarter opened as well. All told, operating income came in at $858 million for the 12-week quarter, up $37 million or up 5% year-over-year from last year's $821 million. 
Below the operating income interest expense. Interest expense came in at $30 million this year versus $31 million a year ago, essentially flat. No surprises there. Interest income and other this year was $7 million, lower by $2 million versus last year's $9 million. Actual interest income within interest income and other was essentially similar year-over-year at about $10 million. The balance of that delta was year-over-year was the Other category coming from small foreign exchange adjustments and a slight year-over-year changes and whatever other is -- other earnings.  No big surprises there. 
Overall pretax income was higher by 4.5%, so $36 million coming in at $835 million, up from $799 million a year earlier. Our tax rate was a little lower or better year-over-year coming in at 34.02, down from 35.0 last year in the third quarter. Basically, this year's third quarter income tax percentage benefited from, again, just a few discrete items going our way and that's why it was a little lower. Our normalized rate is actually just a shade of over 35% in both of those quarters. 
Overall, reported net income of $545 million for the quarter compared to last year's $516 million or up 5.5%. For a quick rundown of other topics, well, the balance sheet is included in this morning's press release. A couple of balance sheet items that you may not see there. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $291 million and $847 million year-to-date. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories, on a reported basis, it was 99%, a percentage point lower than a year ago of 100%. That of course includes non-merchandise payables such as construction payables. Same kind of delta, the 99 reported this year would have been an 89, the 100 would have been a 90. So again, right on the same year year-over-year. 
Average inventory for warehouse was actually down about $0.5 million or down 4%. About 1/3 of that is FX, so about almost exactly 1/3, 173,000 and 516,000. The rest is pretty much spread across many categories including the impact from deflation. If you assume, and again, you never know exactly what the deflationary cost amounts are. But if you assume a 1% deflation, you get similar, about a half of that remaining gas and the being just a little lower inventories. But again, lower year-over-year by $0.5 million. 
In Q3, in terms of CapEx, we spent $460 million during the 12-week period and essentially year-to-date we're right at $1.8 billion. The estimate for the year will come in around $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion compared to fiscal '15 total expenditures of $2.4 billion, so up $100 million to $300 million from a year ago based on whatever time we have left here and what expenditures were made. 
In terms of Costco Online, as you know, we're now in 6 countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico plus the recently launched countries of Korea and Taiwan. In the quarter, sales and profits were up. Sales were up on a reported basis 14%. In the quarter up about 15.5% ex FX. On a comp basis, it would be 13% and 14% ex FX. 
In terms of expansion, again, I mentioned in the quarter that we're now a 16-week quarter. We would expect to open 10 new openings plus 1 relo. And again, that would put us at 29 net new openings -- 33 openings but 4 of those relos are 29 overall. In fiscal '15, we added 23 net new units on a base of 653, so about 3.5% square footage growth. In '16, 29 on the new base would be about 4.5% square footage growth, slightly lower unit growth, but if you open a little bit [indiscernible] relos as well. 
New locations by country, again, 21 in U.S., 2 in Canada, 1 each in the U.K, Taiwan, Australia and Spain and 2 in Japan. As of third quarter end, our total square footage was right above 100 million and 101.7 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks, if you recall in Q1, we repurchased $130 million of our common stock. In Q2, $80 million. Both of those are, of course, 12-week quarters as well. And then the 12-week third quarter, we purchased $136 million. So year-to-date, we spent about $346 million with an average price per share of $148.64 million. If you annualize those quarters and, again, we'll see what we'll do this quarter, but if you analyze it, we'll be right at $0.5 billion for the year. We'd be right at $.05 billion for the year [indiscernible]. 
In terms of dividends, as you know, last quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend rate year-over-year to quarterly amount of $0.45. We know it's up from $0.40 for the prior year each quarter. That $1.80 a share annualized dividend represents total cost of company around $790 million. 
Before I turn the call back to Karen for Q&A, I want to mention a slight timing change each quarter when we report our quarter results. Many of you have asked about the fact that we report earnings the night before, usually around 6:00 Pacific time and then you get late the next morning to hear the call. Beginning with our fourth quarter earnings release, we're going to change the timing of that release in the conference call such that in the fourth quarter, we'll issue results after the market closes on Thursday, September 29th, followed up shortly thereafter with a live conference call that afternoon and the Q&A session at the end of that call. This schedule would be our plan for any releases going forward, and I think it will be helpful certainly in response to several of your comments out there. 
The last quick item, next week, we report the 4 weeks of calendar May sales. This is the 4 weeks ending this coming Sunday, May 29. I'll mention to you that based on how our Memorial Day falls year-over-year, this year, Memorial falls on day 1 of the June retail calendar month. So this year we have 28 days, next year versus last year is 27 days. So that would be a little benefit. I need to point that out. June, there's really a wash, while you've got a detriment related to Memorial Day, you've got a day pickup on the other end of June with July 4th and then finally we'll get through that silliness in July when we report high sales. 
With that, I will open up to Q&A and I'll turn it back to you, Karen."

Maybe you have asked questions and some concern about traffic coming down from this 4-plus percent number over 7 years. We feel pretty good about where numbers are. We don't really see a lot of different changes. Interestingly, when you look at nondiscretionary items like food and sundries versus discretionary items across the nonfoods categories including big-ticket items like furniture, electronics and the like, we'd actually had, relatively speaking, a little more strength and some of the nonfood category. So that, I think, at least some or any concerns that some people have had. But generally speaking, I have to say our customers are still pretty healthy and still getting good renewal rates, notwithstanding a very small impact from some of the credit card transitions. So we feel pretty good at this point about that. Certainly, I feel good about some of the merchandises going on. 
By the way, one of the other kind I data points I've been asked several times in the last few weeks each time we reported sales in the last couple of months is, is it deflation? Is it weakness? Is that.com? Whatever. The fact to the matter is if you look at during the 12-week quarter on a year-over-year basis, if we just take the average item per unit in the basket going through the front end. U.S. only, it was up 1.4%. So we're getting people to buy more items, if you will. The average basket value is up 4/10 of a percent. The simplification there is as you got deflation presumably, deflationary pressures of about 1%. Now that's a good educated guess. There could be other impacts of sizes, but we go into bigger sizes, not smaller sizes, bigger pack sizes. So I think overall there's probably still more in deflation than we've seen in the last couple of quarters, spread to other items in the nonfood category as well as we've seen. In terms of third party partnerships, we're pretty agnostic we have good relationship with Google with regard to Google Shopping Express. We have Instacart, of course, Google is in 6 large communities in the country. Bay area, the LA area and a few others. And Instacart I think is now well over 15, maybe even 20 markets where we participate with them and also fewer of the others out there. In terms of expectations, we didn't know what to expect. I believe that we generally are the anchor tenant, if you will, in many of these opportunities where there's more than just Costco items being purchased and sold just to provide to the end consumer. And so we think it's been good. It's still small relative to -- we still want you to come into the warehouse and we're still going to figure out how to do that. But it's growing nicely and it's certainly, on a small scale, a bit of a help. 
In terms of expansion plans, I think you asked about U.S. openings. It looks like our goal is still similar last year, about 30. We'll shoot for something a little over 30 and end up about 30, if history repeats itself. We probably had a few more relative to that 30 number, a few more in the U.S. of this year than we would have anticipated if you would asked me a few years ago. I think some of that is timing. We've had success in the U.S. and probably the expectations of some of the markets we've gone in to in the last couple of years, if you asked me 5 years ago, would be going into some of these markets where we have never been in and our competitors have been in for up to 30 years. We've had success in those markets, whether it's mobile, Tulsa or Toledo or Rochester and New Orleans, probably there's a few more in those markets on top of the few that we opened like whatever number we have in the future sound in LA where they are harder to find because you're in their specific locations to fill in markets. So I think that's probably one thing. Looking at the 30 next year, and this is a guess, it's probably not 2/3 and not 21 over 29. If I had to guess, it's probably about a little less than half, 50%, 52%. So again, that's a guess at this point."

It used to be something nothing until June. Other than that, we just got a lot of people on our side, on the issuer side doing a lot of work to make sure it goes as smoothly as possible. And we're excited about it. It's a great reward for our members improvement wise and we'll keep a little bit of it ourselves in terms of merchant fee reduction. And really there's not a whole lot -- cards are hitting right now, in fact. Dell continue to hit -- when you've got literally over 10 million pieces of mail going out, it's a spread over a few week period and I think they just started hitting. So cards should be in everybody's hands few days to at least a few days to a week before the June 20th D-Day here.

And it's generally 2 things, I think the bigger factor is when there's daily price changes up and down in the cost of procurement cost of both us and other gas station operators, and then when it goes down, we seem to feel that we get an extra margin in part because our competitors don't give as much back as fast as we do. So we still give more way back, but it helps us a little bit. So I think part of that new normal, if you will, in the last couple of years in that regard it's probably, on average, a little better. You'll see it in Q4 though. I think that today, day-to-day sometimes it changes relative to what -- just when we think we're smart, it goes the other way.

Our talents in beef are way up, but you've got deflation in beef more than some of the other protein category. And we are the first to go down in some of those items when there is deflation. I think our numbers were actually, the deflation of some of the fresh food category, I think, mask some of the pound strength if you will or the unit strength that we have, whether it's protein or produce. And I will never be so arrogant to say that nobody could catch us, but we've got some great things going on in terms of, again, global sourcing, working with vendor partners and we look at our produce today which I think is $6 billion business now, which is as big as protein. I think many retail food places do those kind of numbers. I think it has more to do with that than, yes, there's probably going to be a little more macro shift, whatever. I think what we do and how we do it towards those other impacts. Now there's other place coming to market. There's, I think just this week you've got 3 65 opening and you have other people coming to town with a different health-related, organic related types of retail formats. We're pretty good with that stuff, too. And again, like bigger sizes but we're pretty awesome in the fresh area and I think it will continue to be -- should be for us an increasingly -- increased sales penetration area and something that will keep driving our members."

If you think about Japan, I think there's about 18-month period a few years ago when we went from 9 to 20 units in about 1.5 years, 2 years. It's not like we're sending a bunch of experienced warehouse managers to go open and operate and be warehouse managers and Japan from different countries. So you do that at the beginning and you may do it occasionally on a onesie basis. But at the end of the day, you're going from within and developing those local country people. And first and foremost, from an international standpoint, you forgot that, that could be a little of challenge. And then you've got -- this take longer there. There's some countries that I understand are very difficult just because of zoning and restrictions that are -- not just in us, but any big box, even local company big boxes in the hyper market area and the like. So that is going to take a little longer there. The other thing -- so do I think we would yield above 30? Look, we should be low 30s and then next year you shoot for the mid-30s and I think you've certainly heard me say that we want to be around 30 in 5 years now, we should be doing 35. Maybe we'll fall short that, maybe we won't. But we've got more feet on the ground real estate wise in other countries as well as U.S. than we've ever had. It does take a little longer, but we also -- could we physically open more? Sure. But will like what we do and the way we do it. And probably we also have a comfort level that is not like we're going to miss out. We are, in our view, the preferred out there and so when the go into a market, if we take longer to get there, people are waiting for us. It may be a little harder, but fact of the matter is we feel comfortable how we're doing it. And then as traffic in the U.S. is moderated right back to what you maybe said you were at the level that couldn't be sustained, back at the level that tend to be -- are those discussions internally that it is just a natural moderation were did you talk about, within the categories of 16 basis point improvement in margin, there are things you can do proactively to give more back to the member.

We're a topline company. We want to drive sales. The fact that margins year-over-year were up on those core categories, up 16 basis points, we're not smart enough to figure out how to get there all the time. We always want to drive margin a little bit where we can, but we do it the right way by giving most of the savings back to the customer. If I look at our competitive stance, our pricing competitor stance versus our direct competitors, the gap has never been wider. We could make a little more of this, but we don't. At the end of the day, we're always looking for ways to do that. When we do membership key changes, historically, we are always looking to give some of that back. So all those things go into it, but at the end of the date, what helps margins? Private label, fresh food trade, some of the ancillary businesses, all those things are helping as well.

Over last few year, you have people that are retiring and their early 70s that have worked together starting 55 years ago at San Diego. I think from a merchandising operation standpoint, that's been well thought out. The first real big concern is what's going to happen in the Middle East. We were comfortable here internally, I think we have sold and certainly Craig have shown that other transition in the maintaining of the culture has continued without a single beat. In merchandising, over the last few years, we've took certain categories like what we used to be done with nonfoods, switch is combination of hard-line cents off lines and then snap always senior executive over that since retired. We bought been over 2 people and broken out hardlines and softlines. In operations, we've made several promotions and changes in people again. Typically, low tenured people like they've only been here 20 to 25 years that are going from VP to Senior VP levels, I think we got 16 senior VPs of operations in U.S. geographically and then in terms of that, Doug as you know,is head of U.S. merchandising and certainly involved in a lot of merchandising as well. Doug's great. He's leaving for -- no negative issues both internally or with himself and he's -- we're all kind of jealous. He's on the other side of the senior management team. Craig has a plan, but he's looking at a few things. Over next few months, we'll be announcing how that changes. But we've got good people in place and we don't think there's an issue at all there. In Asia, Richard Cheyne, who goes back to the price updates probably 25 years ago, have been running operations for Taiwan, which promoted a senior VP over Asia and we bought some new people in there as well, new people meaning existing Costco people of course, and from the U.S. And so I think we feel pretty good about the opportunity.

It was really California. California was about 1/3 of our U.S. company operations and it's probably a little bit more penetrated guest wise. And again, a year ago, we had gallon comps which not only drive gasoline but more importantly drives people in the parking lot and 52 or 3 of every 100 come into shop. And so that was where we saw a bit of a distortion. California versus the rest of the U.S. I believe there was -- I don't have the number in front of me, but to get to a 1, the other 1 U.S. was 2 and California was a minus 1, I'm off a little bit there but it is kind of the direction. That was a little unusual. Again, I can't predict what that means for the future, but other than that, there's some markets where, I think the positive that we see as we have been successful in some of these new medium-sized markets. We had the most signups, I believe, in many years in terms of a new market, new medium-sized markets in Tulsa. Just a few weeks ago through opening day, we have more I'm not talking about a sure, that's a story in terms of minded levels. So again, things look pretty good. I don't know if there's a lot of geographic changes other than what we called out in California. I personally believe a lot of that is related to some of the gas issues."

Our guess is it would still be slightly detrimental in fiscal '17 and technically, May is flat [indiscernible] in '17 but you have a 53-week here. So there's a little cheat there. But generally speaking, flat up a little in '17, maybe up a little in '18 or flat, maybe down a little. We don't know yet. But we're starting to get to that inflection point and my guess is that inflection point will come sometime towards the end of '17 or the '18. Keep in mind, these numbers don't assume anything.
[Audio Gap]
I don't think there is anything big out there. We just hit the bottom of scale increase which is a little unusual, not a big number, but it's $0.06 or so a year. There's no giant changes coming to healthcare. We still get great help, medical, dental and vision benefits to everybody. If we increase sales penetration outside of the U.S., certain structural expenses help us. Health care in the U.S. is easily 20 to 60 basis points as a percent of sales, higher than any country in the world. And so just by doing more elsewhere, that will help that number a little bit. Same thing with labor costs, we pay similarly great labor wages relative to whatever country norms are, but certainly the numbers in the U.S. and Canada are higher than some of the countries. And so those things will help us a little bit. I don't think -- there's nothing huge going on out there that -- I don't think we have big shocks to the system.

Last night's press release reported our third quarter and year-to-date fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12- and 36-week periods that ended this past May 8. 
For the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $1.24, up 6% over last year's third quarter earnings per share of $1.17. And comparing our third quarter results year-over-year, there are a few items of note. As usual, FX as compared to a year ago, during the quarter, the foreign currencies in the countries where we operate weakened overall versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea. This resulted in our foreign earnings in Q3 when converted into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes being lower by about $15 million or $0.03 a share than they would have been had the various foreign exchange rates versus the dollar been flat year-over-year. 
Gross margins. On a reported basis, it was higher by 34 basis points. This included a $19 million benefit from non-recurring legal settlements. This represented 7 basis points of margin improvement or about $0.03 a share. 
Number 3, our co-branded credit card transition in the United States. We will transition to our new co-brand Citi Visa card next month. Co-brand AmEx credit card sign-up stopped, as you know, late last calendar year, I think in October, November. The short-term negative earnings impact of the lost co-brand credit card sign-ups in the quarter or year-over-year was about $11 million or $0.02 a share to the negative. We expect to have a new co-brand Visa cards in the hands of our members by the end of May, early June. Some of you may have already received it in the mail with a go live transition date of June -- Monday, June 20. 
Number 4, wages. As I mentioned, our last quarter's -- second quarter's earnings conference call back in March, in addition to the -- what we do  a top of scale increase each year, which we generate again, have done every at each March, this year, we also increased our bottom of scale hourly rates in U.S. and Canada, which is about 80% of our company. Effective this past March 14, we increased our starting wage at $1.50 an hour to $13 and $13.50 an hour. The new bottom of scale wage increase results in a year-over-year incremental payroll expense of about $6 million or $$0.01 a share in the quarter. We estimate that this will be anywhere from $0.01 to $0.02 a quarter in each of the next 3 quarters, depending on which way it rounds. 
Number 5, IT modernization. IT modernization efforts negatively impacted SG&A expenses in Q3 on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $16 million, which is about 5 basis points or $0.02 a share to SG&A. I believe in a few -- second and third -- first and second quarters this year that year-over-year delta of modernization expense was 7 basis points to the negative in Q1 and 3 in Q2, so looks like it's averaging around 5 a quarter for the first 3 quarters of the year. 
LIFO. This year in Q3, we picked up a little bit there from a LIFO credit. We recorded a pretax LIFO credit of $13 million in the quarter. Last year, it was also deflationary, but as you know, deflation has continued with $7 million. So again, about a $6 million or $0.01 a share delta there.  Those are the items I'd point out 
Turning to our third quarter sales. Total reported sales, as you know, were up -- as reported was up 2%, and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was flat or 0. Sales, of course, were negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation. That was almost 2 percentage points impact and about 190 basis points and by the weakened foreign currencies relative to the dollar that I just mentioned. That was about 145 basis points. So excluding gas deflation, the flat U.S. comp number we reported would have been a plus 3%. In Canada, the plus 1% reported Canadian comp would have been a plus 8% in local currency, excluding gas deflation and flat FX rate. And the reported minus 2% Other international, excluding gas deflation and assuming flat over year FX, that would have been a plus 3%.  So all told, a reported 0 comp for the quarter, ex gas and FX, would have been a plus 3%. 
In terms of new openings. In the quarter, we opened 7 new locations and also completed 1 relo. So year-to-date for the first 36 weeks, we've opened a total of 19 new warehouses and 3 relos. For all of '16, we have a current plan of 29 net new locations. A little over 2/3 of them, 21 will be in the U.S., 2 in Canada, 2 in Japan and 1 each in the U.K, Taiwan, Australia and Spain. 
This morning, I'll also of course review with you e-commerce activities, membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussion about margins and SG&A in the quarter and a couple of other items. 
So going down the P&L. Again, for sales, sales were up 2% on a reported -- total sales were up 2%. Recorded comps, flat, reported, up 3%, excluding gas and FX. Now the 0 flat comp on a reported basis was a combination of an average transaction decrease of a little under 3% -- minus 2.7% on a reported basis. And again, ex gas and FX, the average transaction increase would have actually been up 0.5%. And the average shopping frequency increase was up 3% for the quarter, which is most of February, all of March, all of April and a little of May. 
In terms of sales comparisons by geography. In the U.S., Texas, Midwest and Southeast regions were the stronger ones. Internationally in local currencies, better-performing countries were Mexico, Canada and the U.K. 
In terms of merchandising categories for the quarter, within food and sundries, which was overall flattish year-over-year, sundries, foods and meat, deli were the leaders. Tobacco, as I think we mentioned a little bit on the April sales call, was negative in the low teens as we continue to eliminate tobacco from various locations. 
For hardlines, overall, in the mid-single digits. The departments with the strongest results were sporting goods, toys, seasonal, automotive, consumer electronics and garden, patio. I think I'll have to go look at what was down because those were all pretty good big departments within hardlines. Within low to mid-single softline comps -- single-digit softline comps, small electrics, men's apparel and home furnishings were the standouts. And lastly, in fresh foods, comp sales, overall, in the low single digits. Produce and deli showed the best results. Of course, we probably had the most deflation, I think, in the meat, poultry and pork areas. In the U.S., we continue to see deflation in the low single-digit range for food, sundries, and as I mentioned, fresh foods and a little in some of the non-foods areas as well, notably electronics. 
Moving down the income statement. Membership fees came in -- in dollars were up 6% and up 7 basis points as a percent of sales, coming in up $34 million from $584 million last year to $618 million. Again, FX currencies exchange rates impact this number. Without FX or assuming flat year-over-year FX, the $618 million would have been up $7 million more, and so the 6% dollar increase year-over-year would have been up $7 million, same number of basis points of course, up $7 million. 
In terms of renewal rates. We continue strong renewal rates, 90% plus in the U.S. and Canada, 88% worldwide. Continue increasing penetration, the executive membership, and I'll talk about that in a second. New member sign-ups in the quarter, company-wide, we're up 15% year-over-year, in part driven by strong sign-ups in our new openings in Taiwan and Japan. The Asia openings always have an outsized new sign-ups. We also had very strong sign-ups in Tulsa, for that matter. Overall, in the U.S., in fact, it was up 15% as well. 
In terms of number of members at third quarter end, Gold Star was 36.2 million, up from 12 weeks earlier at 35.4 million; Primary Business, the same at 7.2 million; business add-ons, the same at 3.5 million at the beginning and the end of the quarter. So all told, 46.9 million member households versus up 800,000 from 46.1 million at Q2 end. Total cardholders at 85.5 million, up 1.5 million from 84.0 million at the end of the second quarter. 
I mentioned the executive memberships. We came in at the end of Q3 with right at 17 million executive members, which is an increase of actually 402,000 over the 12-week period or 33,000 a week increase in the quarter. I think that tends to be on the high end of that kind of weekly increase in many of the last recent quarters. Executive members are approximately 36% of our member base and about 2/3 of our sales and again continues to improve penetration. 
In terms of renewal rates, business [ph] numbers were 94.4% at the end of the quarter, tweaked down from 94.5%; Gold Star, 89.6%, 1/10 down, so 89.7%. And -- so total U.S. and Canada, 90.4%, down from 90.5%. Worldwide at 87.6% at the end of the quarter, again, 1/10 down as well. Within the U.S. and Canada, of course, we've seen a bigger tick down than 0.10% in Canada, and that has to do as we anniversary now about 18 months when we initiated the change in credit cards up there, which was actually everybody have to sign up against. I think part of that is the auto renewal. You'll see a little of that in the U.S. since we haven't been adding on -- accepting new applications for the current credit card, co-branded credit card since past October but pretty much in line with what we thought. 
In terms of gross margin. Our reported gross margin, as I may have mentioned, was up 34 basis points, 11.43% this year versus 11.09% last year. And as usual, I'll ask you to jot down 4 columns of numbers to provide a little edification here. The 4 columns would be Q2 '16, columns 1 and 2 are both Q2 '16. These are year-over-year changes in basis points. First column would be reported figures for margin, second would be without the impact of gas deflations since that tends to distort the numbers wildly. And then the columns 3 and 4 would be Q3 '16, both reported; and then column 4, Q3 '16 without gas deflation. 
In terms of the line items. First line item going across would be core merchandising. So Q2 '16, we reported a plus 5 basis points year-over-year. Ex gas deflation was minus 3. In Q3, reported plus 16; and ex gas, minus 2. Ancillary, plus 9 and a plus 7. And in columns 3 and 4, plus 9 and a plus 4. 2% Reward, minus 1 and 0; and in Q3 reported without gas, 0 and plus 2. LIFO in the second quarter, plus 4, plus 4; in the third quarter, plus 2, plus 2. Other, no -- 0 and 0 in the first 2 columns and a plus 7 in columns 3 and 4. That's the -- those non-recurring legal settlements I talked about earlier. If you add up those columns, reported in Q2, year-over-year, we had up 17 basis point margin and up 8 on an ex gas deflation basis. And again, as -- while we reported a plus 34, it's a plus 13 ex gas deflation. 
In terms of the quarter merchandise component, which again reported plus 16 but minus 2. If you look at the 4 key categories, which is 80-plus percent of our business, sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales, they were positive year-over-year by 16 basis points with food and sundries, hardlines and softlines all being up year-over-year and fresh foods being slightly down during the quarter -- year-over-year. Ancillary and other business -- and by the way, those numbers exclude that non-recurring items that I mentioned.  Ancillary and other businesses margins were up 9 basis points, up 4 without gas. And within the quarter on their own sales, gas, optical and hearing aids all showed higher gross margins year-over-year as a percent of their own sales. I mentioned LIFO already, that was a 2 basis point benefit year-over-year. And other, again, the 7 basis point improvement year-over-year. So even ex that on an ex gas deflation basis, margins were up a few basis points year-over-year. 
Moving down to expenses. SG&A on a reported basis were higher by 33 basis points coming in at 10.44 compared to 10.11 a year ago. Again, we'll do the same 4 columns. Q2 reported and without gas and then Q3 reported without gas. Core operations, minus 22 reported year-over-year. The minus means higher year-over-year. Gas was up plus -- it was -- ex gas in Q2 was a minus 16; columns 3 and 4, minus 24 and minus 8. Central, in Q2 was minus a 8 and minus 7; Q3, minus 6 and minus 4. Stock compensation, minus 4 and minus 4 and then a minus 3 and a minus 2 and no quarterly adjustments. So all told, reported year-over-year in Q2, SG&A higher by 34 basis points on a reported basis and 27 ex gas. This quarter Q3 reported higher SG&A by 33.14 higher ex gas. Basically within the -- if you go back to the core operations or operations, the ex gas deflation, the 8 basis point year-over-year higher, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits year-over-year which impacted that minus 8 by minus 12, so more than the minus 8. These items were somewhat offset by a variety of other controllable expense items. Q2 is, of course, always the lowest volume quarter. And of course, as we know, sales were a little weaker for a variety of reasons, including some deflation. 
Central expense was higher year-over-year in the quarter by 6, ex gas by 4. IT is the 4 on an ex gas basis. And as I -- it was plus 500 -- minus 500 reported. But essentially out -- ex that, central, I think, did a pretty good job in the quarter, particularly that. And I guess stock compensations, no surprise there. 
Next on the income statement preopening, a little higher year-over-year, $18 million for the quarter versus $14 million a year ago, so up by a basis point. This year in the quarter, we had 8 openings, including 1 relo. Last year in the quarter, we had 4 openings and 1 relo -- including 1 relo. Again, some of that is not necessarily related to those specific openings as it may include some -- right before the quarter opened as well. All told, operating income came in at $858 million for the 12-week quarter, up $37 million or up 5% year-over-year from last year's $821 million. 
Below the operating income interest expense. Interest expense came in at $30 million this year versus $31 million a year ago, essentially flat. No surprises there. Interest income and other this year was $7 million, lower by $2 million versus last year's $9 million. Actual interest income within interest income and other was essentially similar year-over-year at about $10 million. The balance of that delta was year-over-year was the other category coming from small foreign exchange adjustments and a slight year-over-year changes and whatever other is -- other earnings, no big surprises there. 
Overall pretax income was higher by 4.5%, so $36 million coming in at $835 million, up from $799 million a year earlier. Our tax rate was a little lower or better year-over-year coming in, in a 34.02%, down from a 35.0% last year in the third quarter. Basically, this year's third quarter income tax percentage benefited from, again, just a few positive discrete items in the aggregate going our way, and that's why it was a little lower. Our normalized rate is actually just a shade over 35% in both of those quarters. 
Overall, reported net income of $545 million for the quarter compared to last year's $516 million or up 5.5%. 
For a quick rundown of other topics, typical topics, in terms -- well, the balance sheet is included in the morning's press release. A couple of balance sheet info items that you may not see on there, depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $291 million and $847 million year-to-date. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis, it was 99%, a percentage point lower than a year ago at 100%. That of course includes non-merchandise payables such as construction payables. Same kind of delta, the 99% reported this year would have been an 89%. The 100% would have been a 90%. So again, right around the same year-over-year. 
Average inventory for warehouse was actually down about $0.5 million or down 4%. About 1/3 of that is FX, so about -- almost exactly 1/3, $173,000 and $516,000. The rest is pretty much spread across many categories, including the impact from deflation. If you assume -- and again, you never know exactly what the deflationary cost amounts are. But if you assume a 1% deflation, you get similar, about 1/2 of that remaining being gas and the rest being just lower inventories. But again, lower year-over-year by $0.5 million. 
In Q3, in terms of CapEx. We spent $460 million during the 12-week period and year -- essentially year-to-date we're right at $1.8 billion. Estimate for the year will come in around $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion compared to fiscal '15 total expenditures of $2.4 billion, so up $100 million to $300 million from a year ago based on whatever timing we have left here and what expenditures were made. 
In terms of Costco Online, as you know, we're now in 6 countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico, plus the recently launched countries of Korea and Taiwan. In the quarter, sales and profits were up. Sales were up on a reported basis 14%; in the quarter, up about 15.5%, ex FX. On a comp basis, it'd be 13% and 14%, ex FX. 
In terms of expansion, again, I mentioned in the quarter that we're now -- it's a 16-week quarter, we would expect to open 10 new openings plus 1 relo. And again, that would put us at 29 net new openings -- 33 openings but for those relos at 29 overall. In fiscal '15, we added 23 net new units on a base of 653, so about 3.5% square footage growth. In '16, the 29 on the new base would be about 4.5% square footage growth, slightly lower unit growth. But you kind of open a little bigger units, and you've got the relos as well. 
New locations by country. Again, 21 in U.S.; 2 in Canada; 1 each in the U.K, Taiwan, Australia and Spain; and 2 in Japan. As of third quarter end, our total square footage was right above 100 million at 101.7 million square feet. 
In terms of stock buybacks, if you recall in Q1, we repurchased $130 million of our common stock. In Q2, $80 million. Both of those, of course, are 12-week quarters as well. And in the third -- 12-week third quarter, we purchased $136 million. So as to year-to-date, we spent about $346 million with an average price per share of $148.64. If you annualize those quarters, and again, we'll see what we do this quarter, but if you annualize it, we're right at $0.5 billion for the year. We'd be right at $.05 billion for the year. We'll see where we come out. 
In terms of dividends, as you know, last quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend rate year-over-year to quarterly amount of $0.45. I believe that was up from $0.40 for the prior year each quarter. That $1.80 a share annualized dividend represents the total cost of the company around $790 million. 
Before I turn the call back to Karen for Q&A, I want to mention a slight timing change each quarter when we report our quarterly results. Many of you have asked about the fact that we report earnings the night before, usually around 6:00 Pacific time and then you got -- you get to wait until the next morning to hear the call. Beginning with our fourth quarter earnings release, we're going to change the timing of that release in the conference call, such that for the fourth quarter, we'll issue results after the market closes on Thursday, September 29th, followed up shortly thereafter with a live conference call that afternoon and a Q&A session at the end of that call. This schedule will be our plan for earnings releases going forward, and I think it will be helpful and certainly response to several of your comments out there. 
The last quick item, next week, we report the 4 weeks of calendar May sales. This is the 4 weeks ending this coming Sunday, May 29. I'll mention to you that based on how Memorial Day falls year-over-year, this year, Memorial falls on day 1 of the June retail calendar month. So this year, we have 28 days, next year versus last year is 27 days, so that will be a little benefit. Again, we'll point that out. June, there's really a wash, while you've got a detriment related to Memorial Day, you've got a day pickup on the other end of June with July -- how July 4th falls. And then finally, we'll get through that silliness in July when we report July sales. 
With that, I'll open up to Q&A, and I'll turn it back to you, Karen."

Well, in terms of the customer, I mean, so far so good, and we don't see any dramatic change. Many of you have asked questions or have some concern about traffic coming down from this 4-plus percent number over 7 years. We feel pretty good about where our numbers are. We don't really see a lot of different changes. Interestingly, when you look at nondiscretionary items like food and sundries versus discretionary items across the non-foods categories, including big-ticket items like furniture and electronics and the like, we've actually had, relatively speaking, a little more strength in some of the nonfood category. So that, I think, at least some of -- any concerns that some people have had. But generally speaking, I'd have to say our customers are still pretty healthy, and we're still getting good renewal rates, notwithstanding a very small impact from some of the credit card transitions. And -- so we feel pretty good at this point about that. And certainly, I feel good about some of the merchandising stuff we've got going on. Yes, by the way, one of the other kind of data points I've been asked several times in the last few weeks each time we've reported sales in the last couple of months is that is it deflation? Is it weakness? Is it dot-com, whatever? The fact of the matter is, is if you look at during the 12-week quarter on a year-over-year basis, if we just take the average items per unit in the basket going through the front end -- U.S. only, it's a U.S. only, it was up 1.4%. So we're getting people to buy more items, if you will. The average basket value was up 4/10 of a percent. The simplification there is you got deflation presumably, deflationary pressures of about 1%. Now that's a good educated guess. There could be other impacts of sizes, but typically, we go into bigger sizes, not smaller sizes, bigger pack sizes. So I think overall, there's probably still a little bit more deflation than we've seen over the last couple of quarters spread to other items in the nonfood category as well as we've seen. In terms of third-party partnerships, we're pretty agnostic. We have good relationships with Google with regard to Google Shopping Express. We have Instacart, of course, is in a -- Google is in 6 large communities in the country. the Bay Area, the L.A. area and a few others. And Instacart, I think, is now in well over 15, maybe even 20 markets where we participate with them and also a few of the others out there. In terms of expectations, we didn't know what to expect. I believe that we generally are the anchor tenant, if you will, in many of these opportunities, where there's more than just Costco items being purchased and sold just to provide to the end consumer, and so we think it's been good. It's still small relative to -- we still want you to come into the warehouse, and we're going to still figure out how to do that. But it's growing nicely, and it's certainly, on a small scale, a bit of a help. In terms of expansion plans, I think you asked about openings. We're -- looks like our goal is still similar next year, about 30. We'll shoot for something a little over 30 and end up about 30, if history repeats itself. We probably had a few more relative to that 30 number, a few more in the U.S. this year than we would have anticipated if you would asked me a few years ago. I think some of that is timing. We've had success in the U.S. And probably the expectation of some of the markets we've gone in to in the last couple of years, if you asked me 5 years ago, would be going into some of these markets where we have never been in and our competitors have been in for up to 30 years. We've had success in those markets, whether it's Mobile or Tulsa or Toledo or Rochester and New Orleans, and so probably there's a few more in those markets on top of the few that we opened like the -- whatever TEEP number that we have in the Puget Sound or L.A. where they're harder to find because we're very specific locations to fill in markets. So I think that's probably one thing. Looking at the 30 next year, and this is a guess, it's probably not 2/3 and not 21 over 29. If I had to guess, it's probably about a little less than half, 50%, 52%. So -- and again, that's a guess at this point."

And with gas prices going up and down, like going up right now, it's been a little weaker the last couple of weeks, but it was probably a little stronger near the beginning and into the middle of the quarter than we'd anticipated. And it's generally 2 things, I think the bigger factor is, is when there's price -- daily price changes up and down and the cost of -- procurement cost of both us and other gas station operators. And then when it goes down, we seem to feel that we get a little extra margin in part because our competitors don't give as much back as fast as we do. So we still give more -- way more back, but it helps us a little bit. And so I think part of that new normal, if you will, in the last couple of years in that regard it's probably, on average, a little better. You'll see it in Q4 though. I say that today, relatively, day-to-day sometimes it changes relative to what -- when we think -- just when we think we're smart and safe to go out, it goes the other way.

And I will never be so arrogant to say that nobody could catch us, but we've got some great things going on in terms of, again, global sourcing, working with vendor partners and we look at our produce today which is,  I think, a $6 billion business now -- approaching a $6 billion business, which is as big as protein.

It was still a credit eligibility decision that the issuer made, and it will be that way in the future. The fact of the matter though is that to the extent that they signed up as a member, and again, I don't think it was that impactful, somebody walking away because they can't get Amex card.

About a little 40% of our U.S. sales were done on Amex, with I think over 2/3 of that -- a little over half to 2/3 of that being on the co-branded cards. Some people tend to have Delta points or Starwood points, so they're using a different one. Same thing will happen with Visa. Our goal is to get that co-branded card as we did successfully with our Amex co-brand card, that to be your on top-of-wallet card. We think that there's going to be a lot of things that drive that, including the people out there on blogs independently and others that look at what is currently a 3, 2, 1 is going to be a 4, 3, 2, 1.

We would argue, we have too much capital out there. We like it that way. Is it people? It is people. Years ago, I didn't appreciate as much as I do now, particularly in these countries. If you think about in Japan, I think there was about 18-month period a few years ago when we went from 9 to 20 units in about 1.5 years, 2 years. It's not like we're sending a bunch of experienced warehouse managers to go open and operate and be warehouse managers in Japan from different countries. So you do that a few at the beginning. You may do it occasionally on a onetime -- onesie basis. But at the end of the day, you're growing from within and developing those local country people. And first and foremost, from an international standpoint, you forgot that. That can be a little bit of a challenge. And then you've got -- these take longer there. There's some countries that I understand are very difficult just because of zoning and restrictions that are placed not just on us, but any big box, even local company big boxes in the hypermarket area and the like. So that is going to take a little longer there. The other thing -- so do I think we could go above 30? Look, we shoot for low 30s and then next year, we'll shoot for the mid-30s. And I think you've certainly heard me say that we want to be around 30 in 5 years now, we should be doing 35. Maybe we'll fall a little short of that, maybe we won't. But we've got more feet on the ground real estate wise in other countries as well as U.S. than we've ever had. It does take a little longer, but we also -- could we physically open more? Sure. But we like what we do and the way we do it. And probably we also have a comfort level that is not like we're going to miss out.

We're a top line company. We want to drive sales. The fact that margins year-over-year are up on those core categories, up 16 basis points, we're not smart enough to figure out how to get there all the time. We always want to drive margin a little bit where we can, but we do it the right way by giving most of any savings back to the customer. Now if I look at our competitive stance -- our pricing competitor stance versus our direct competitors, the gap has never been wider. We could make a little more of this, but we don't. At the end of the day, we're always looking for ways to do that. When we do membership fee changes, historically, we are always looking to give some of that back.

Over the last few years, you had people that are retiring in their early 70s that have worked together starting 55 years ago at FedMart in San Diego. But I think from a merchandising and operation standpoint, that's been well thought out. Let's face it. The first big concern was, what's going to happen when Jim leaves. I think, well, we were comfortable here internally, I think we've shown and certainly, Craig has shown that the transition and the maintaining of the culture has continued without missing a beat. In merchandising, over the last few years, we took certain categories like what we used to be done with non-foods, which is a combination of hardlines and softlines and Dennis Knapp, who is a senior executive over that and has since retired. We brought in 2 -- promoted 2 people and broken out hardlines and softlines. In operations, we made several promotions and changes in people again. Typically, low-tenured people like they've only been here 20 to 25 years that are going from VP to Senior VP levels. I think we've got 16 senior VPs of operations in the U.S. geographically. And in terms of Doug -- Doug, as you know, has been Head of U.S. Merchandising and certainly involved in a lot of merchandising beyond that as well. Doug's great. He's leaving for -- I mean, no negative issues both internally or with himself and he's -- we're all kind of jealous. He's on the other side of the senior management team. Craig has a plan, but he's looking at a few things. And over the next few months, we'll be announcing how that changes. But we've got good people in place, and we don't think that there's an issue at all there. In Asia, Richard Chang, who is -- goes back to the price club days probably 25-plus years ago, has been -- ran operations for Taiwan, was promoted as Senior VP over Asia, and we brought some new people in there as well, new people meaning existing Costco people, of course, and from the U.S. And so I think we feel pretty good about the change. It sped up because it was at 0 and in the last couple of years, it's been a few -- a couple and now it's a few and a few more. And I think we're pretty well positioned for that.

It was really California. California is about 1/3 of our U.S. company operations, and it's probably a little bit more penetrated gas wise. And again, a year ago, we had gallon comps which not only drives gasoline but more importantly, drives people in the parking lot in 52 or 3 of every 100 come in to shop. And so that was where we saw a bit of a distortion, California versus the rest of the U.S. I believe there was -- I don't have the number in front of me, but to get to a 1, the other U.S. was 2 and California was a minus 1. I'm off by a little bit there, but it is actually on a direction. And so that was a little unusual. Again, I can't predict what that means for the future, but other than that, there's some markets where, I think, the positive that we see is we've been successful in some of these new medium-sized markets. We had the most signups, I believe, in many years in terms of a new market -- new medium-sized market in Tulsa. Just a few weeks ago through opening day, we had more signups than we've had -- now I'm not talking about Asia, that's a story in terms of finite levels. And so again, that's -- things look pretty good. I don't know if there's a lot of geographic changes other than the thing we called out in California. I personally believe a lot of that is related to some of the gas issues."

So there's a little cheat there. But generally speaking, flat up a little in '17, maybe up a little in '18 or flat, maybe down a little. We don't know yet. But we're starting to get to that inflection point, and my guess is that inflection point will come sometime towards the end of '17 or in the '18. Keep in mind, these numbers don't assume anything.

Last night's press release reported our third quarter and year-to-date fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12- and 36-week periods that ended this past May 8. 
For the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $1.24, up 6% over last year's third quarter earnings per share of $1.17. And comparing our third quarter results year-over-year, there are a few items of note; as usual, FX. As compared to a year ago, during the quarter, the foreign currencies in the countries where we operate weakened overall versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea. This resulted in our foreign earnings in Q3, when converted into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, being lower by about $15 million or $0.03 a share than they would have been had the various foreign exchange rates versus the dollar been flat year-over-year. 
Gross margin. On a reported basis, it was higher by 34 basis points. This included a $19 million benefit from nonrecurring legal settlements. This represented 7 basis points of margin improvement or about $0.03 a share. 
Number 3, our co-branded credit card transition in the United States. We will transition to our new co-brand Citi Visa card next month. Co-brand AmEx credit card signup stopped, as you know, late last calendar year, I think in October, November. The short-term negative earnings impact of the lost co-brand credit card signups in the quarter, year-over-year, was about $11 million or $0.02 a share to the negative. We expect to have the new co-brand Visa cards in the hands of our members by the end of May, early June. Some of you may have already received it in the mail with a go-live transition date of June -- Monday, June 20. 
Number 4, wages. As I mentioned, our last quarter's -- second quarter's earnings conference call back in March, in addition to the -- what we do  a top of scale increase each year, which we generally, again, have done every at each March, this year, we also increased our bottom of scale hourly rates in U.S. and Canada, which is about 80% of our company. Effective this past March 14, we increased our starting wage at $1.50 an hour to $13 and $13.50 an hour. The new bottom of scale wage increase results in a year-over-year incremental payroll expense of about $6 million or $0.01 a share in the quarter. We estimate that this will be anywhere from $0.01 to $0.02 a quarter in each of the next 3 quarters, depending on which way it rounds. 
Number 5, IT modernization. IT modernization efforts negatively impacted SG&A expenses in Q3 on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $16 million, which is about 5 basis points or $0.02 a share to SG&A. I believe in Q -- second and third -- first and second quarters this year that year-over-year delta of modernization expense was 7 basis points to the negative in Q1 and 3 in Q2, so it looks like it's averaging around 5 a quarter for the first 3 quarters of the year. 
LIFO. This year in Q3, we picked up a little bit there from a LIFO credit. We recorded a pretax LIFO credit of $13 million in the quarter. Last year, it was also deflationary, but as you know, deflation has continued with $7 million, so again, about a $6 million or $0.01 a share delta there. Those are the items I'd point out 
Turning to our third quarter sales. Total reported sales, as you know, were up -- as reported was up 2%, and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was flat or 0. Sales, of course, were negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation. That was almost 2 percentage points impact and about 190 basis points and by the weakened foreign currencies relative to the dollar that I just mentioned. That was about 145 basis points. So excluding gas deflation, the flat U.S. comp number we reported would have been a plus 3%. In Canada, the plus 1% reported Canadian comp would have been a plus 8% in local currency, excluding gas deflation and flat FX rates. And the reported minus 2% Other international, excluding gas deflation and assuming flat over year FX, that would have been a plus 3%.  So all told, a reported 0 comp for the quarter, ex gas and FX, would have been a plus 3%. 
In terms of new openings. In the quarter, we opened 7 new locations and also completed 1 relo. So year-to-date for the first 36 weeks, we've opened a total of 19 new warehouses and 3 relos. For all of '16, we have a current plan of 29 net new locations. A little over 2/3 of them, 21 will be in the U.S., 2 in Canada, 2 in Japan and 1 each in the U.K, Taiwan, Australia and Spain. 
This morning, I'll also of course review with you e-commerce activities, membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussion about margins and SG&A in the quarter and a couple of other items. 
So going down the P&L. Again, for sales, sales were up 2% on a reported -- total sales were up 2%. Recorded comps, flat, reported, up 3%, excluding gas and FX. Now, the 0 flat comp on a reported basis was a combination of an average transaction decrease of a little under 3% -- minus 2.7% on a reported basis. And again, ex gas and FX, the average transaction increase would have actually been up 0.5%. And the average shopping frequency increase was up 3% for the quarter, which is most of February, all of March, all of April and a little of May. 
In terms of sales comparisons by geography. In the U.S., Texas, Midwest and Southeast regions were the stronger ones. Internationally in local currencies, better-performing countries were Mexico, Canada and the U.K. 
In terms of merchandising categories for the quarter, within food and sundries, which was overall flattish year-over-year, sundries, foods and meat, deli were the leaders. Tobacco, as I think we mentioned a little bit on the April sales call, was negative in the low teens as we continue to eliminate tobacco from various locations. 
For hardlines, overall, in the mid-single digits. The departments with the strongest results were sporting goods, toys, seasonal, automotive, consumer electronics and garden, patio. I think I'll have to go look at what was down because those were all pretty good big departments within hardlines. Within low to mid-single softline comps -- single-digit softline comps, small electrics, men's apparel and home furnishings were the standouts. And lastly, in fresh foods, comp sales, overall, in the low single digits. Produce and deli showed the best results. Of course, we probably had the most deflation, I think, in the meat, poultry and pork areas. In the U.S., we continue to see deflation in the low single-digit range for food and sundries, and as I mentioned, fresh foods, and a little in some of the non-foods areas as well, notably electronics. 
Moving down the income statement. Membership fees came in -- in dollars were up 6% and up 7 basis points as a percent of sales, coming in up $34 million from $584 million last year to $618 million. Again, FX currencies, exchange rates impact this number. Without FX or assuming flat year-over-year FX, the $618 million would have been up $7 million more, and so the 6% dollar increase year-over-year would have been up $7 million, same number of basis points of course, up 7.
In terms of renewal rates. We continue strong renewal rates, 90% plus in the U.S. and Canada, 88% worldwide. Continue increasing penetration, the executive membership, and I'll talk about that in a second. New member signups in the quarter, company-wide, were up 15% year-over-year, in part driven by strong signups in our new openings in Taiwan and Japan. The Asia openings always have outsized new signups. We also had very strong signups in Tulsa, for that matter. Overall, in the U.S., in fact, it was up 15% as well. 
In terms of number of members at third quarter end, Gold Star was 36.2 million, up from 12 weeks earlier at 35.4 million; Primary Business, the same at 7.2 million; business add-ons, the same at 3.5 million at the beginning and the end of the quarter. So all told, 46.9 million member households versus up 800,000 from 46.1 million at Q2 end. Total cardholders at 85.5 million, up 1.5 million from 84.0 million at the end of the second quarter. 
I mentioned the executive memberships. We came in at the end of Q3 with right at 17 million executive members, which is an increase of actually 402,000 over the 12-week period or 33,000 a week increase in the quarter. I think that tends to be on the high end of that kind of weekly increase in many of the last recent quarters. Executive members are approximately 36% of our member base and about 2/3 of our sales and again, continues to improve penetration. 
In terms of renewal rates, business members were 94.4% at the end of the quarter, tweaked down from 94.5%; Gold Star, 89.6%, 1/10 down, also 89.7%. And -- so total U.S. and Canada, 90.4%, down from 90.5%. Worldwide at 87.6% at the end of the quarter, again, 1/10 down as well. Within the U.S. and Canada, of course, we've seen a bigger tick down than 0.10% in Canada, and that has to do as we anniversary now about 18 months when we initiated the change in credit cards up there, which was actually everybody having to sign up against. So I think part of that is the auto renewal. We see a little of that in the U.S. since we haven't been adding on -- accepting new applications for the current credit card, co-branded credit card since past October but pretty much in line with what we thought. 
In terms of gross margin. Our reported gross margin, as I may have mentioned, was up 34 basis points, 11.43% this year versus 11.09% last year. And as usual, I'll ask you to jot down 4 columns of numbers to provide a little edification here. The 4 columns would be Q2 '16, columns 1 and 2 are both Q2 '16. These are year-over-year changes in basis points. First column would be reported figures for margin, second would be without the impact of gas deflations since that tends to distort the numbers wildly. And then the columns 3 and 4 would be Q3 '16, both reported; and then column 4, Q3 '16 without gas deflation. 
In terms of the line items. First line item going across would be core merchandising. So Q2 '16, we reported a plus 5 basis point year-over-year. Ex gas deflation was minus 3. In Q3, reported ,plus 16; and ex gas, minus 2; ancillary, plus 9 and a plus 7; and in columns 3 and 4, plus 9 and a plus 4. 2% Reward, minus 1 and 0; and in Q3 reported without gas, 0 and plus 2. 
LIFO in the second quarter, plus 4, plus 4; in the third quarter, plus 2, plus 2. Other, no -- 0 and 0 in the first 2 columns and a plus 7 in columns 3 and 4. That's the -- those non-recurring legal settlements I talked about earlier. If you add up those columns, reported in Q2, year-over-year, we had up a 17 basis point margin and up 8 on an ex gas deflation basis. And again, as -- while we reported a plus 34, it's a plus 13 ex gas deflation. 
In terms of the quarter merchandise component, which again reported plus 16 but minus 2. If you look at the 4 key categories, which is 80-plus percent of our business, sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales, they were positive year-over-year by 16 basis points, with food and sundries, hardlines and softlines all being up year-over-year and fresh foods being slightly down during the quarter -- year-over-year. Ancillary and other business -- and by the way, those numbers exclude that nonrecurring items that I mentioned.  
Ancillary and other businesses margins were up 9 basis points, up 4 without gas. And within the quarter on their own sales, gas, optical and hearing aids all showed higher gross margins year-over-year as a percent of their own sales. I mentioned LIFO already; that was a 2 basis point benefit year-over-year; and other, again, the 7 basis point improvement year-over-year. So even ex that on an ex gas deflation basis, margins were up a few basis points year-over-year. 
Moving down to expenses. SG&A on a reported basis were higher by 33 basis points coming in at 10.44 compared to 10.11 a year ago. Again, we'll do the same 4 columns. Q2 reported and without gas; and then Q3 reported without gas. Core operations, minus 22 reported year-over-year. And a minus means higher year-over-year. Gas was a plus -- was -- ex gas in Q2 was a minus 16; columns 3 and 4, minus 24 and minus 8. Central, in Q2 was a minus 8 and minus 7; Q3, minus 6 and minus 4. Stock compensation, minus 4 and minus 4 and then a minus 3 and a minus 2 and no quarterly adjustments. So all told, reported year-over-year in Q2, SG&A higher by 34 basis points on a reported basis and 27 ex gas. This quarter Q3 reported higher SG&A by 33.14 higher ex gas. Basically, within the -- if you go back to the core operations or operations, the ex gas deflation, the 8 basis point year-over-year higher, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits year-over-year which impacted that minus 8 by minus 12, so more than the minus 8. These items were somewhat offset by a variety of other controllable expense items. Q2 is, of course, always the lowest volume quarter. And of course, as we know, sales were a little weaker for a variety of reasons, including some deflation. 
Central expense was higher year-over-year in the quarter by 6, ex gas by 4. IT is the 4 on an ex gas basis. And as I -- it was plus 500 -- minus 500 reported. But essentially, out -- ex that, central, I think, did a pretty good job in the quarter of controlling that. And again, stock compensations, no surprise there. 
Next on the income statement preopening.   little higher year-over-year, $18 million for the quarter versus $14 million a year ago, so up by a basis point. This year in the quarter, we had 8 openings, including 1 relo. Last year in the quarter, we had 4 openings and 1 relo -- including 1 relo. Again, some of that is not necessarily related to those specific openings as it may include some -- right before the quarter opened as well. All told, operating income came in at $858 million for the 12-week quarter, up $37 million or up 5% year-over-year from last year's $821 million. 
Below the operating income interest expense. Interest expense came in at $30 million this year versus $31 million a year ago, essentially flat. No surprises there. Interest income and other this year was $7 million, lower by $2 million versus last year's $9 million. Actual interest income within interest income and other was essentially similar year-over-year at about $10 million. The balance of that delta was year-over-year was the other category coming from small foreign exchange adjustments and a slight year-over-year changes and whatever other is -- other earnings, no big surprise there. 
Overall pretax income was higher by 4.5% or $36 million coming in at $835 million, up from $799 million a year earlier. Our tax rate was a little lower or better year-over-year coming in, in a 34.02%, down from a 35.0% last year in the third quarter. Basically, this year's third quarter income tax percentage benefited from, again, just a few positive discrete items in the aggregate going our way, and that's why it was a little lower. Our normalized rate is actually just a shade over 35% in both of those quarters. 
Overall, reported net income of $545 million for the quarter compared to last year's $516 million or up 5.5%. 
For a quick rundown of other topics, typical topics, in terms -- well, the balance sheet is included in the morning's press release. A couple of balance sheet info items that you may not see on there, depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $291 million and $847 million year-to-date. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis, it was 99%, a percentage point lower than a year ago at 100%. That of course includes non-merchandise payables such as construction payables. Same kind of delta, the 99% reported this year would have been an 89%. The 100% would have been a 90%, so again, right around the same year-over-year. 
Average inventory per warehouse was actually down about $0.5 million or down 4%. About 1/3 of that is FX, so about 100 -- almost exactly 1/3, $173,000 and $516,000. The rest is pretty much spread across many categories, including the impact from deflation. If you assume -- and again, you never know exactly what the deflationary cost amounts are, but if you assume a 1% deflation, you'd get similar, about 1/2 of that remaining being gas and the rest being just lower inventories, but again, lower year-over-year by $0.5 million. 
In Q3, in terms of CapEx. We spent $460 million during the 12-week period and year -- essentially year-to-date, we're right at $1.8 billion. I'd estimate for the year we'll come in around $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion compared to fiscal '15 total expenditures of $2.4 billion, so up $100 million to $300 million from a year ago based on whatever timing we have left here and what expenditures were made. 
In terms of Costco Online, as you know, we're now in 6 countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico, plus the recently launched countries of Korea and Taiwan. In the quarter, sales and profits were up. Sales were up on a reported basis 14%; in the quarter, up about 15.5%, ex FX. On a comp basis, it'd be 13% and 14%, ex FX. 
In terms of expansion, again, I mentioned in the quarter that we're now -- which is a 16-week quarter, we would expect to open 10 new openings plus 1 relo. And again, that would put us at 29 net new openings -- 33 openings but 4 of those were relos, so 29 overall. 
In fiscal '15, we added 23 net new units on a base of 653, so about 3.5% square footage growth. In '16, the 29 on the new base would be about 4.5% square footage growth, slightly lower unit growth. But you kind of open a little bigger units, and you've got the relos as well. 
New locations by country. Again, 21 in U.S.; 2 in Canada; 1 each in the U.K, Taiwan, Australia and Spain; and 2 in Japan. As of third quarter end, our total square footage was right above 100 million at 101.7 million square feet. 
In terms of stock buybacks, if you recall in Q1, we repurchased $130 million of our common stock; in Q2, $80 million. Both of those, of course, are 12-week quarters as well. And in the third -- 12-week third quarter, we purchased $136 million. So that's the year-to-date, we spent about $346 million with an average price per share of $148.64. If you annualize those quarters, and again, we'll see what we do this quarter, but if you annualize it, we're right at $0.5 billion for the year. We'd be right at $.05 billion for the year. We'll see where we come out. 
In terms of dividends, as you know, last quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend rate year-over-year to quarterly amount of $0.45. I believe that was up from $0.40 for the prior year each quarter. That $1.80 a share annualized dividend represents a total cost of the company around $790 million. 
Before I turn the call back to Karen for Q&A, I want to mention a slight timing change each quarter when we report our quarterly results. Many of you have asked about the fact that we report earnings the night before, usually around 6:00 Pacific Time and then you've got -- you get to wait until the next morning to hear the call. 
Beginning with our fourth quarter earnings release, we're going to change the timing of that release and the conference call, such that for the fourth quarter, we'll issue results after the market closes on Thursday, September 29th, followed up shortly thereafter with a live conference call that afternoon and a Q&A session at the end of that call. This schedule will be our plan for earnings releases going forward, and I think it will be helpful and certainly in response to several of your comments out there. 
The last quick item, next week, we report the 4 weeks of calendar May sales. This is the 4 weeks ending this coming Sunday, May 29. I'll mention to you that based on how Memorial Day falls year-over-year, this year, Memorial falls on day 1 of the June retail calendar month. So this year, we have 28 days, next year -- versus last year's 27 days, so that will be a little benefit. Again, we'll point that out. June, there's really awash, while you've got a detriment related to Memorial Day, you've got a day pickup on the other end of June with how July 4th falls. And then finally, we'll get through that silliness in July when we report July sales. 
With that, I'll open up to Q&A, and I'll turn it back to you, Karen."

Well, in terms of the customer, I mean, so far so good, and we don't see any dramatic change. Many of you have asked questions or have had some concern about traffic coming down from this 4-plus percent number over 7 years. We feel pretty good about where our numbers are. We don't really see a lot of different changes. Interestingly, when you look at nondiscretionary items like food and sundries versus discretionary items across the nonfoods categories, including big-ticket items like furniture and electronics and the like, we've actually had, relatively speaking, a little more strength in some of the nonfood categories. So that, I think, allays some of any concerns that some people have had. But generally speaking, I'd have to say our customers are still pretty healthy, and we're still getting good renewal rates, notwithstanding a very small impact from some of the credit card transitions. And so we feel pretty good at this point about that. And certainly, I feel good about some of the merchandising stuff we've got going on. Yes, by the way, one of the other kind of data points I've been asked several times in the last few weeks or each time we've reported sales in the last couple of months is that is it deflation? Is it weakness? Is it dot-com, whatever? The fact of the matter is, is if you look at during the 12-week quarter on a year-over-year basis, if we just take the average items per unit in the basket going through the front end -- U.S. only, it's a U.S. only, it was up 1.4%. So we're getting people to buy more items, if you will. The average basket value was up 0.4%. The simple implication there is, is you got deflation presumably, deflationary pressures of about 1%. Now that's a good educated guess. There could be other impacts of sizes, but typically, we go into bigger sizes, not smaller sizes, bigger pack sizes. So I think overall, there's probably still a little bit more deflation that we've seen over the last couple of quarters spread to other items in the nonfood category as well as we've seen. In terms of third-party partnerships, we're pretty agnostic. We have good relationships with Google with regard to Google Shopping Express. We have Instacart, of course, is in a -- Google's in 6 large communities in the country, the Bay Area, the L.A. area and a few others. And Instacart, I think, is now in well over 15, maybe even 20 markets where we participate with them and also, a few of the others out there. In terms of expectations, we didn't know what to expect. I believe that we generally are the anchor tenant, if you will, in many of these opportunities, where there's more than just Costco items being purchased and sold just to provide to the end consumer, and so we think it's been good. It's still small relative to -- we still want you to come into the warehouse, and we're going to still figure out how to continue to do that. But it's growing nicely, and it's certainly, on a small scale, a bit of a help. In terms of expansion plans, I think you asked about openings. We're -- looks like our goal is still similar next year, about 30. We'll shoot for something a little over 30 and end up about 30, is if history repeats itself. We probably had a few more -- relative to that 30 number, a few more in the U.S. this year than we would have anticipated if you had asked me a few years ago. I think some of that is timing. We've had success in the U.S. And probably the expectation of some of the markets we've gone into in the last couple of years, if you asked me 5 years ago, would we be going into some of these markets where we had never been in and our competitors have been in for up to 30 years. We've had success in those markets, whether it's Mobile or Tulsa or Toledo or Rochester and New Orleans, and so, probably there's a few more in those markets on top of the few that we opened like the -- whatever TEEP [ph] number that we have in the Puget Sound or L.A. where they're harder to find because we're very specific locations to fill-in markets. So I think that's probably one thing. Looking at a 30 next year, and this is a guess, it's probably not 2/3 and not 21 over 29. If I had to guess, it's probably about a little less than half, 50%, 52%. So -- and again, that's a guess at this point."

And with gas prices going up and down, like going up right now, it's been a little weaker the last couple of weeks, but it was probably a little stronger near the beginning and into the middle of the quarter than we'd anticipated. And it's generally 2 things, I think the bigger factor is, is when there's price -- daily price changes up and down and the cost of -- procurement costs of both us and other gas station operators. And then when it goes down, we seem to feel that we get a little extra margin in part because our competitors don't give as much back as fast as we do. So we still give more -- way more back, but it helps us a little bit. And so I think part of that new normal, if you will, over the last couple of years in that regard it's probably, on average, a little better. You'll see it in Q4 though. I say that today; day-to-day sometimes it changes relative to what -- when we think -- just when we think we're smart and safe to go out, it goes the other way.

And I would never be as so arrogant to say that nobody can catch us, but we've got some great things going on in terms of, again, global sourcing, working with vendor partners and we looked at our produce today which is, I think, a $6 billion business now -- approaching a $6 billion business, which is as big as protein, I don't think many retail food places do those kind of numbers.

We're pretty good at that stuff, too. And again, you've got like bigger sizes, but we're pretty awesome in the fresh area and I think that'll continue to be -- should be, for us, an increasingly -- an increased sales penetration area and something that will keep driving our members."

Now, to the extent that they don't have an Amex card in their wallet, or to the extent that they -- keep in mind, not everybody that signed up for one over the last 16 years got it. It was still a credit eligibility decision that the issuer made, and it will be that way in the future. The fact of the matter though is, is that to the extent that they signed up as a member, and again, I don't think it was that impactful, somebody walking away because they can't get Amex card, they have to use a debit card in their wallet or cash or check. And on a macro basis, does that impact some of the big ticket items? Yes, it probably does, although our TV sales has been pretty darned strong.

And rest assured, there's going to be a lot of stuff happening in terms of our continued communication, of course, to our members, but there's a lot of members out there that don't have account. About a little 40% of our U.S. sales were done on Amex, with I think over 2/3 of that -- a little over half to 2/3 of that being on the co-branded cards. Some people tend to have Delta points or Starwood points, so they're using a different one. Same thing will happen with Visa. Our goal is to get that co-branded card as we did successfully with the Amex co-brand card, that could be your on top-of-wallet card. We think that there's going to be a lot of things that drive that, including the people out there on blogs independently and others that look at what is currently a 3, 2, 1 is going to be a 4, 3, 2, 1. That's huge. And so that, my personal view is, it will be something that's not going to all hit on day 1.

Some would argue we have too much capital out there. We like it that way. It's people? It is people. Years ago, I didn't appreciate as much as I do now, particularly in these countries. If you think about in Japan, I think there was about an 18-month period a few years ago where we went from 9 to 20 units in about 1.5 years, 2 years. It's not like we're sending a bunch of experienced warehouse managers to go open and operate and be warehouse managers in Japan from different countries. So you do that a few at the beginning. You may do it occasionally on a onetime -- onesie basis. But at the end of the day, you're growing from within and developing those local country people. And first and foremost, from an international standpoint, you've got that. That can be a little bit of a challenge. And then, you've got -- these take longer there. There's some countries that I understand are very difficult just because of zoning and restrictions that are placed not just on us, but any big box, even local company big boxes in the hypermarket area and the like. So it's going to take a little longer there. The other thing -- so do I think we could go above 30? Look, we shoot for low 30s and then next year, we'll shoot for the mid-30s. And I think you've certainly heard me say that we want to be around 30 and 5 years from now, we should be doing 35. Maybe we'll fall a little short of that, maybe we won't. But we've got more feet on the ground real estate-wise in other countries as well as U.S. than we've ever had. It does take a little longer, but we also -- could we physically open more? Sure. But we like what we do and the way we do it. And probably, we also have a comfort level that it's not like we're going to miss out. We're the, in our view, the preferred club out there and so when we go into a market, if we take a little longer to get there, people are waiting for us. And it might be a little harder, but the fact of the matter is, is we feel comfortable how we're doing it."

We are a top line company. We want to drive sales. The fact that margins year-over-year are up on those core categories, up 16 basis points, we're not smart enough to figure out how to get there all the time. We always want to drive margin a little bit where we can, but we do it the right way by giving most of any savings back to the customer. Now if I look at our competitive stance -- our pricing competitive stance versus our direct competitors, the gap has never been wider. We could make a little more of this, but we don't. At the end of the day, we're always looking for ways to do that. When we do membership fee changes, historically, we are always looking to give some of that back. So all those things go into it, but at the end of the day, what helps margins? Private label, fresh foods strength, some of the ancillary businesses, all those things are helping as well. And again, we feel we're not -- we don't necessarily -- I got to tell you, we don't look at it and say, ""Hey, frequency came down a little bit or the comp is a new normal, or a little bit lower."" We want to do more even when we're doing a 4% shopping you'll see how did we hit it higher, even though that was kind of tough. So we're going to continue to do things in that direction.

Over the last few years, you've had people that are retiring in their early 70s that have worked together starting 55 years ago at FedMart in San Diego. But I think from a merchandising and operation standpoint, that's been well thought out. Let's face it. The first big concern was what's going to happen when Jim leaves. I think, while we were comfortable here internally, I think we've shown and certainly, Craig has shown that the transition and the maintaining of the culture has continued without missing a beat. In merchandising, over the last few years, we've took certain categories like what used to be non -- was nonfoods, which is a combination of hardlines and softlines and Dennis Knapp, who was a senior executive over that and has since retired. We brought in 2 -- promoted 2 people and broken out hardlines and softlines. In operations, we've made several promotions and changes in people again. Typically, low-tenured people like they've only been here 20 to 25 years that are going from VP to Senior VP levels. I think we've got 16 senior VPs of operations in the U.S. geographically. And -- now, in terms of Doug, Doug, as you know, has been Head of U.S. Merchandising and certainly involved in a lot of merchandising beyond that as well. Doug's great. He's leaving for -- I mean, no negative issues both internally or with himself and he's -- we're all kind of jealous. He's on the younger side of the senior management team. Craig has a plan, but he's looking at a few things. And over the next few months, we'll be announcing how that changes. But we've got good people in place, and we don't think that there's an issue at all there. In Asia, Richard Chang, who is -- goes back to their Price Club days probably 25-plus years ago, has been -- ran operations for Taiwan, was promoted as Senior VP over Asia, and we've brought some new people in there as well, new people meaning existing Costco people, of course, and from the U.S. And so I think we feel pretty good about the change. It sped up because it was at 0. In the last couple of years, it's been a few -- a couple and now it's a few and a few more. And I think we're pretty well positioned for that.

California is about 1/3 of our U.S. company operations, and it's probably a little bit more penetrated gas-wise. And again, a year ago, we had gallon pumps which not only drives gasoline but more importantly, drives people in the parking lot in 52 or 53 of every 100 come in to shop. And so that was where we saw a bit of distortion, California versus the rest of the U.S. I believe there was -- I don't have the number in front of me, but to get to a 1, the other U.S. was a 2 and California was a minus 1. I'm off by a little bit there, but it was that kind of direction. And so that was a little unusual. Again, I can't predict what that means for the future, but other than that, there are some markets where, I think, the positive that we see is we've been successful in some of these new medium-sized markets. We had the most signups, I believe, in many years in terms of a new market -- new medium-sized market in Tulsa just a few weeks ago through opening day, we had more signups than we've had. Now I'm not talking about Asia, that's a whole different story in terms of signup levels. And so again, that's -- things look pretty good. I don't know if there's a lot of geographic changes other than the thing we called out on California. I personally believe a lot of that related to some of the gas issues."

Last night's press release reported our third quarter and year-to-date fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12- and 36-week periods that ended this past May 8. 
For the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $1.24, up 6% over last year's third quarter earnings per share of $1.17. And comparing our third quarter results year-over-year, there are a few items of note; as usual, FX. As compared to a year ago, during the quarter, the foreign currencies in the countries where we operate weakened overall versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea. This resulted in our foreign earnings in Q3, when converted into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, being lower by about $15 million or $0.03 a share than they would have been had the various foreign exchange rates versus the dollar been flat year-over-year. 
Gross margin. On a reported basis, it was higher by 34 basis points. This included a $19 million benefit from nonrecurring legal settlements. This represented 7 basis points of margin improvement or about $0.03 a share. 
Number 3, our co-branded credit card transition in the United States. We will transition to our new co-brand Citi Visa card next month. Co-brand AmEx credit card signup stopped, as you know, late last calendar year, I think in October, November. The short-term negative earnings impact of the lost co-brand credit card signups in the quarter, year-over-year, was about $11 million or $0.02 a share to the negative. We expect to have the new co-brand Visa cards in the hands of our members by the end of May, early June. Some of you may have already received it in the mail with a go-live transition date of June -- Monday, June 20. 
Number 4, wages. As I mentioned, our last quarter's -- second quarter's earnings conference call back in March, in addition to the -- what we do  a top of scale increase each year, which we generally, again, have done every at each March, this year, we also increased our bottom of scale hourly rates in U.S. and Canada, which is about 80% of our company. Effective this past March 14, we increased our starting wage at $1.50 an hour to $13 and $13.50 an hour. The new bottom of scale wage increase results in a year-over-year incremental payroll expense of about $6 million or $0.01 a share in the quarter. We estimate that this will be anywhere from $0.01 to $0.02 a quarter in each of the next 3 quarters, depending on which way it rounds. 
Number 5, IT modernization. IT modernization efforts negatively impacted SG&A expenses in Q3 on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $16 million, which is about 5 basis points or $0.02 a share to SG&A. I believe in Q -- second and third -- first and second quarters this year that year-over-year delta of modernization expense was 7 basis points to the negative in Q1 and 3 in Q2, so it looks like it's averaging around 5 a quarter for the first 3 quarters of the year. 
LIFO. This year in Q3, we picked up a little bit there from a LIFO credit. We recorded a pretax LIFO credit of $13 million in the quarter. Last year, it was also deflationary, but as you know, deflation has continued with $7 million, so again, about a $6 million or $0.01 a share delta there. Those are the items I'd point out 
Turning to our third quarter sales. Total reported sales, as you know, were up -- as reported was up 2%, and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was flat or 0. Sales, of course, were negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation. That was almost 2 percentage points impact and about 190 basis points and by the weakened foreign currencies relative to the dollar that I just mentioned. That was about 145 basis points. So excluding gas deflation, the flat U.S. comp number we reported would have been a plus 3%. In Canada, the plus 1% reported Canadian comp would have been a plus 8% in local currency, excluding gas deflation and flat FX rates. And the reported minus 2% Other international, excluding gas deflation and assuming flat over year FX, that would have been a plus 3%.  So all told, a reported 0 comp for the quarter, ex gas and FX, would have been a plus 3%. 
In terms of new openings. In the quarter, we opened 7 new locations and also completed 1 relo. So year-to-date for the first 36 weeks, we've opened a total of 19 new warehouses and 3 relos. For all of '16, we have a current plan of 29 net new locations. A little over 2/3 of them, 21 will be in the U.S., 2 in Canada, 2 in Japan and 1 each in the U.K, Taiwan, Australia and Spain. 
This morning, I'll also of course review with you e-commerce activities, membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussion about margins and SG&A in the quarter and a couple of other items. 
So going down the P&L. Again, for sales, sales were up 2% on a reported -- total sales were up 2%. Recorded comps, flat, reported, up 3%, excluding gas and FX. Now, the 0 flat comp on a reported basis was a combination of an average transaction decrease of a little under 3% -- minus 2.7% on a reported basis. And again, ex gas and FX, the average transaction increase would have actually been up 0.5%. And the average shopping frequency increase was up 3% for the quarter, which is most of February, all of March, all of April and a little of May. 
In terms of sales comparisons by geography. In the U.S., Texas, Midwest and Southeast regions were the stronger ones. Internationally in local currencies, better-performing countries were Mexico, Canada and the U.K. 
In terms of merchandising categories for the quarter, within food and sundries, which was overall flattish year-over-year, sundries, foods and meat, deli were the leaders. Tobacco, as I think we mentioned a little bit on the April sales call, was negative in the low teens as we continue to eliminate tobacco from various locations. 
For hardlines, overall, in the mid-single digits. The departments with the strongest results were sporting goods, toys, seasonal, automotive, consumer electronics and garden, patio. I think I'll have to go look at what was down because those were all pretty good big departments within hardlines. Within low to mid-single softline comps -- single-digit softline comps, small electrics, men's apparel and home furnishings were the standouts. And lastly, in fresh foods, comp sales, overall, in the low single digits. Produce and deli showed the best results. Of course, we probably had the most deflation, I think, in the meat, poultry and pork areas. In the U.S., we continue to see deflation in the low single-digit range for food and sundries, and as I mentioned, fresh foods, and a little in some of the non-foods areas as well, notably electronics. 
Moving down the income statement. Membership fees came in -- in dollars were up 6% and up 7 basis points as a percent of sales, coming in up $34 million from $584 million last year to $618 million. Again, FX currencies, exchange rates impact this number. Without FX or assuming flat year-over-year FX, the $618 million would have been up $7 million more, and so the 6% dollar increase year-over-year would have been up $7 million, same number of basis points of course, up 7.
In terms of renewal rates. We continue strong renewal rates, 90% plus in the U.S. and Canada, 88% worldwide. Continue increasing penetration, the executive membership, and I'll talk about that in a second. New member signups in the quarter, company-wide, were up 15% year-over-year, in part driven by strong signups in our new openings in Taiwan and Japan. The Asia openings always have outsized new signups. We also had very strong signups in Tulsa, for that matter. Overall, in the U.S., in fact, it was up 15% as well. 
In terms of number of members at third quarter end, Gold Star was 36.2 million, up from 12 weeks earlier at 35.4 million; Primary Business, the same at 7.2 million; business add-ons, the same at 3.5 million at the beginning and the end of the quarter. So all told, 46.9 million member households versus up 800,000 from 46.1 million at Q2 end. Total cardholders at 85.5 million, up 1.5 million from 84.0 million at the end of the second quarter. 
I mentioned the executive memberships. We came in at the end of Q3 with right at 17 million executive members, which is an increase of actually 402,000 over the 12-week period or 33,000 a week increase in the quarter. I think that tends to be on the high end of that kind of weekly increase in many of the last recent quarters. Executive members are approximately 36% of our member base and about 2/3 of our sales and again, continues to improve penetration. 
In terms of renewal rates, business members were 94.4% at the end of the quarter, tweaked down from 94.5%; Gold Star, 89.6%, 1/10 down, also 89.7%. And -- so total U.S. and Canada, 90.4%, down from 90.5%. Worldwide at 87.6% at the end of the quarter, again, 1/10 down as well. Within the U.S. and Canada, of course, we've seen a bigger tick down than 0.10% in Canada, and that has to do as we anniversary now about 18 months when we initiated the change in credit cards up there, which was actually everybody having to sign up against. So I think part of that is the auto renewal. We see a little of that in the U.S. since we haven't been adding on -- accepting new applications for the current credit card, co-branded credit card since past October but pretty much in line with what we thought. 
In terms of gross margin. Our reported gross margin, as I may have mentioned, was up 34 basis points, 11.43% this year versus 11.09% last year. And as usual, I'll ask you to jot down 4 columns of numbers to provide a little edification here. The 4 columns would be Q2 '16, columns 1 and 2 are both Q2 '16. These are year-over-year changes in basis points. First column would be reported figures for margin, second would be without the impact of gas deflations since that tends to distort the numbers wildly. And then the columns 3 and 4 would be Q3 '16, both reported; and then column 4, Q3 '16 without gas deflation. 
In terms of the line items. First line item going across would be core merchandising. So Q2 '16, we reported a plus 5 basis point year-over-year. Ex gas deflation was minus 3. In Q3, reported ,plus 16; and ex gas, minus 2; ancillary, plus 9 and a plus 7; and in columns 3 and 4, plus 9 and a plus 4. 2% Reward, minus 1 and 0; and in Q3 reported without gas, 0 and plus 2. 
LIFO in the second quarter, plus 4, plus 4; in the third quarter, plus 2, plus 2. Other, no -- 0 and 0 in the first 2 columns and a plus 7 in columns 3 and 4. That's the -- those non-recurring legal settlements I talked about earlier. If you add up those columns, reported in Q2, year-over-year, we had up a 17 basis point margin and up 8 on an ex gas deflation basis. And again, as -- while we reported a plus 34, it's a plus 13 ex gas deflation. 
In terms of the quarter merchandise component, which again reported plus 16 but minus 2. If you look at the 4 key categories, which is 80-plus percent of our business, sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales, they were positive year-over-year by 16 basis points, with food and sundries, hardlines and softlines all being up year-over-year and fresh foods being slightly down during the quarter -- year-over-year. Ancillary and other business -- and by the way, those numbers exclude that nonrecurring items that I mentioned.  
Ancillary and other businesses margins were up 9 basis points, up 4 without gas. And within the quarter on their own sales, gas, optical and hearing aids all showed higher gross margins year-over-year as a percent of their own sales. I mentioned LIFO already; that was a 2 basis point benefit year-over-year; and other, again, the 7 basis point improvement year-over-year. So even ex that on an ex gas deflation basis, margins were up a few basis points year-over-year. 
Moving down to expenses. SG&A on a reported basis were higher by 33 basis points coming in at 10.44 compared to 10.11 a year ago. Again, we'll do the same 4 columns. Q2 reported and without gas; and then Q3 reported without gas. Core operations, minus 22 reported year-over-year. And a minus means higher year-over-year. Gas was a plus -- was -- ex gas in Q2 was a minus 16; columns 3 and 4, minus 24 and minus 8. Central, in Q2 was a minus 8 and minus 7; Q3, minus 6 and minus 4. Stock compensation, minus 4 and minus 4 and then a minus 3 and a minus 2 and no quarterly adjustments. So all told, reported year-over-year in Q2, SG&A higher by 34 basis points on a reported basis and 27 ex gas. This quarter Q3 reported higher SG&A by 33.14 higher ex gas. Basically, within the -- if you go back to the core operations or operations, the ex gas deflation, the 8 basis point year-over-year higher, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits year-over-year which impacted that minus 8 by minus 12, so more than the minus 8. These items were somewhat offset by a variety of other controllable expense items. Q2 is, of course, always the lowest volume quarter. And of course, as we know, sales were a little weaker for a variety of reasons, including some deflation. 
Central expense was higher year-over-year in the quarter by 6, ex gas by 4. IT is the 4 on an ex gas basis. And as I -- it was plus 500 -- minus 500 reported. But essentially, out -- ex that, central, I think, did a pretty good job in the quarter of controlling that. And again, stock compensations, no surprise there. 
Next on the income statement preopening.   little higher year-over-year, $18 million for the quarter versus $14 million a year ago, so up by a basis point. This year in the quarter, we had 8 openings, including 1 relo. Last year in the quarter, we had 4 openings and 1 relo -- including 1 relo. Again, some of that is not necessarily related to those specific openings as it may include some -- right before the quarter opened as well. All told, operating income came in at $858 million for the 12-week quarter, up $37 million or up 5% year-over-year from last year's $821 million. 
Below the operating income interest expense. Interest expense came in at $30 million this year versus $31 million a year ago, essentially flat. No surprises there. Interest income and other this year was $7 million, lower by $2 million versus last year's $9 million. Actual interest income within interest income and other was essentially similar year-over-year at about $10 million. The balance of that delta was year-over-year was the other category coming from small foreign exchange adjustments and a slight year-over-year changes and whatever other is -- other earnings, no big surprise there. 
Overall pretax income was higher by 4.5% or $36 million coming in at $835 million, up from $799 million a year earlier. Our tax rate was a little lower or better year-over-year coming in, in a 34.02%, down from a 35.0% last year in the third quarter. Basically, this year's third quarter income tax percentage benefited from, again, just a few positive discrete items in the aggregate going our way, and that's why it was a little lower. Our normalized rate is actually just a shade over 35% in both of those quarters. 
Overall, reported net income of $545 million for the quarter compared to last year's $516 million or up 5.5%. 
For a quick rundown of other topics, typical topics, in terms -- well, the balance sheet is included in the morning's press release. A couple of balance sheet info items that you may not see on there, depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $291 million and $847 million year-to-date. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis, it was 99%, a percentage point lower than a year ago at 100%. That of course includes non-merchandise payables such as construction payables. Same kind of delta, the 99% reported this year would have been an 89%. The 100% would have been a 90%, so again, right around the same year-over-year. 
Average inventory per warehouse was actually down about $0.5 million or down 4%. About 1/3 of that is FX, so about 100 -- almost exactly 1/3, $173,000 and $516,000. The rest is pretty much spread across many categories, including the impact from deflation. If you assume -- and again, you never know exactly what the deflationary cost amounts are, but if you assume a 1% deflation, you'd get similar, about 1/2 of that remaining being gas and the rest being just lower inventories, but again, lower year-over-year by $0.5 million. 
In Q3, in terms of CapEx. We spent $460 million during the 12-week period and year -- essentially year-to-date, we're right at $1.8 billion. I'd estimate for the year we'll come in around $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion compared to fiscal '15 total expenditures of $2.4 billion, so up $100 million to $300 million from a year ago based on whatever timing we have left here and what expenditures were made. 
In terms of Costco Online, as you know, we're now in 6 countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico, plus the recently launched countries of Korea and Taiwan. In the quarter, sales and profits were up. Sales were up on a reported basis 14%; in the quarter, up about 15.5%, ex FX. On a comp basis, it'd be 13% and 14%, ex FX. 
In terms of expansion, again, I mentioned in the quarter that we're now -- which is a 16-week quarter, we would expect to open 10 new openings plus 1 relo. And again, that would put us at 29 net new openings -- 33 openings but 4 of those were relos, so 29 overall. 
In fiscal '15, we added 23 net new units on a base of 653, so about 3.5% square footage growth. In '16, the 29 on the new base would be about 4.5% square footage growth, slightly lower unit growth. But you kind of open a little bigger units, and you've got the relos as well. 
New locations by country. Again, 21 in U.S.; 2 in Canada; 1 each in the U.K, Taiwan, Australia and Spain; and 2 in Japan. As of third quarter end, our total square footage was right above 100 million at 101.7 million square feet. 
In terms of stock buybacks, if you recall in Q1, we repurchased $130 million of our common stock; in Q2, $80 million. Both of those, of course, are 12-week quarters as well. And in the third -- 12-week third quarter, we purchased $136 million. So that's the year-to-date, we spent about $346 million with an average price per share of $148.64. If you annualize those quarters, and again, we'll see what we do this quarter, but if you annualize it, we're right at $0.5 billion for the year. We'd be right at $.05 billion for the year. We'll see where we come out. 
In terms of dividends, as you know, last quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend rate year-over-year to quarterly amount of $0.45. I believe that was up from $0.40 for the prior year each quarter. That $1.80 a share annualized dividend represents a total cost of the company around $790 million. 
Before I turn the call back to Karen for Q&A, I want to mention a slight timing change each quarter when we report our quarterly results. Many of you have asked about the fact that we report earnings the night before, usually around 6:00 Pacific Time and then you've got -- you get to wait until the next morning to hear the call. 
Beginning with our fourth quarter earnings release, we're going to change the timing of that release and the conference call, such that for the fourth quarter, we'll issue results after the market closes on Thursday, September 29th, followed up shortly thereafter with a live conference call that afternoon and a Q&A session at the end of that call. This schedule will be our plan for earnings releases going forward, and I think it will be helpful and certainly in response to several of your comments out there. 
The last quick item, next week, we report the 4 weeks of calendar May sales. This is the 4 weeks ending this coming Sunday, May 29. I'll mention to you that based on how Memorial Day falls year-over-year, this year, Memorial falls on day 1 of the June retail calendar month. So this year, we have 28 days, next year -- versus last year's 27 days, so that will be a little benefit. Again, we'll point that out. June, there's really awash, while you've got a detriment related to Memorial Day, you've got a day pickup on the other end of June with how July 4th falls. And then finally, we'll get through that silliness in July when we report July sales. 
With that, I'll open up to Q&A, and I'll turn it back to you, Karen."

Well, in terms of the customer, I mean, so far so good, and we don't see any dramatic change. Many of you have asked questions or have had some concern about traffic coming down from this 4-plus percent number over 7 years. We feel pretty good about where our numbers are. We don't really see a lot of different changes. Interestingly, when you look at nondiscretionary items like food and sundries versus discretionary items across the nonfoods categories, including big-ticket items like furniture and electronics and the like, we've actually had, relatively speaking, a little more strength in some of the nonfood categories. So that, I think, allays some of any concerns that some people have had. But generally speaking, I'd have to say our customers are still pretty healthy, and we're still getting good renewal rates, notwithstanding a very small impact from some of the credit card transitions. And so we feel pretty good at this point about that. And certainly, I feel good about some of the merchandising stuff we've got going on. Yes, by the way, one of the other kind of data points I've been asked several times in the last few weeks or each time we've reported sales in the last couple of months is that is it deflation? Is it weakness? Is it dot-com, whatever? The fact of the matter is, is if you look at during the 12-week quarter on a year-over-year basis, if we just take the average items per unit in the basket going through the front end -- U.S. only, it's a U.S. only, it was up 1.4%. So we're getting people to buy more items, if you will. The average basket value was up 0.4%. The simple implication there is, is you got deflation presumably, deflationary pressures of about 1%. Now that's a good educated guess. There could be other impacts of sizes, but typically, we go into bigger sizes, not smaller sizes, bigger pack sizes. So I think overall, there's probably still a little bit more deflation that we've seen over the last couple of quarters spread to other items in the nonfood category as well as we've seen. In terms of third-party partnerships, we're pretty agnostic. We have good relationships with Google with regard to Google Shopping Express. We have Instacart, of course, is in a -- Google's in 6 large communities in the country, the Bay Area, the L.A. area and a few others. And Instacart, I think, is now in well over 15, maybe even 20 markets where we participate with them and also, a few of the others out there. In terms of expectations, we didn't know what to expect. I believe that we generally are the anchor tenant, if you will, in many of these opportunities, where there's more than just Costco items being purchased and sold just to provide to the end consumer, and so we think it's been good. It's still small relative to -- we still want you to come into the warehouse, and we're going to still figure out how to continue to do that. But it's growing nicely, and it's certainly, on a small scale, a bit of a help. In terms of expansion plans, I think you asked about openings. We're -- looks like our goal is still similar next year, about 30. We'll shoot for something a little over 30 and end up about 30, is if history repeats itself. We probably had a few more -- relative to that 30 number, a few more in the U.S. this year than we would have anticipated if you had asked me a few years ago. I think some of that is timing. We've had success in the U.S. And probably the expectation of some of the markets we've gone into in the last couple of years, if you asked me 5 years ago, would we be going into some of these markets where we had never been in and our competitors have been in for up to 30 years. We've had success in those markets, whether it's Mobile or Tulsa or Toledo or Rochester and New Orleans, and so, probably there's a few more in those markets on top of the few that we opened like the -- whatever TEEP [ph] number that we have in the Puget Sound or L.A. where they're harder to find because we're very specific locations to fill-in markets. So I think that's probably one thing. Looking at a 30 next year, and this is a guess, it's probably not 2/3 and not 21 over 29. If I had to guess, it's probably about a little less than half, 50%, 52%. So -- and again, that's a guess at this point."

And with gas prices going up and down, like going up right now, it's been a little weaker the last couple of weeks, but it was probably a little stronger near the beginning and into the middle of the quarter than we'd anticipated. And it's generally 2 things, I think the bigger factor is, is when there's price -- daily price changes up and down and the cost of -- procurement costs of both us and other gas station operators. And then when it goes down, we seem to feel that we get a little extra margin in part because our competitors don't give as much back as fast as we do. So we still give more -- way more back, but it helps us a little bit. And so I think part of that new normal, if you will, over the last couple of years in that regard it's probably, on average, a little better. You'll see it in Q4 though. I say that today; day-to-day sometimes it changes relative to what -- when we think -- just when we think we're smart and safe to go out, it goes the other way.

So I think our numbers have actually -- the deflation in some of the fresh food categories, I think, mask some of the pound strength, if you will, or the unit strength that we have, whether it's protein or produce. And I would never be as so arrogant to say that nobody can catch us, but we've got some great things going on in terms of, again, global sourcing, working with vendor partners and we looked at our produce today which is, I think, a $6 billion business now -- approaching a $6 billion business, which is as big as protein, I don't think many retail food places do those kind of numbers. And so I think it has more to do with that than -- yes, there's probably going to be a little bit of a macro shift, whatever. I think what we do and how we do it dwarfs those other impacts. Now, there's other players come in the market. There's, I think, just this week you've got a 365 opening and you've got other people coming to town with different health-related, organic-related types of retail formats. We're pretty good at that stuff, too. And again, you've got like bigger sizes, but we're pretty awesome in the fresh area and I think that'll continue to be -- should be, for us, an increasingly -- an increased sales penetration area and something that will keep driving our members."

Now, to the extent that they don't have an Amex card in their wallet, or to the extent that they -- keep in mind, not everybody that signed up for one over the last 16 years got it. It was still a credit eligibility decision that the issuer made, and it will be that way in the future. The fact of the matter though is, is that to the extent that they signed up as a member, and again, I don't think it was that impactful, somebody walking away because they can't get Amex card, they have to use a debit card in their wallet or cash or check.

And rest assured, there's going to be a lot of stuff happening in terms of our continued communication, of course, to our members, but there's a lot of members out there that don't have account. About a little 40% of our U.S. sales were done on Amex, with I think over 2/3 of that -- a little over half to 2/3 of that being on the co-branded cards. Some people tend to have Delta points or Starwood points, so they're using a different one. Same thing will happen with Visa. Our goal is to get that co-branded card as we did successfully with the Amex co-brand card, that could be your on top-of-wallet card. We think that there's going to be a lot of things that drive that, including the people out there on blogs independently and others that look at what is currently a 3, 2, 1 is going to be a 4, 3, 2, 1.

Some would argue we have too much capital out there. We like it that way. It's people? It is people. Years ago, I didn't appreciate as much as I do now, particularly in these countries. If you think about in Japan, I think there was about an 18-month period a few years ago where we went from 9 to 20 units in about 1.5 years, 2 years. It's not like we're sending a bunch of experienced warehouse managers to go open and operate and be warehouse managers in Japan from different countries. So you do that a few at the beginning. You may do it occasionally on a onetime -- onesie basis. But at the end of the day, you're growing from within and developing those local country people. And first and foremost, from an international standpoint, you've got that. That can be a little bit of a challenge. And then, you've got -- these take longer there. There's some countries that I understand are very difficult just because of zoning and restrictions that are placed not just on us, but any big box, even local company big boxes in the hypermarket area and the like. So it's going to take a little longer there. The other thing -- so do I think we could go above 30? Look, we shoot for low 30s and then next year, we'll shoot for the mid-30s. And I think you've certainly heard me say that we want to be around 30 and 5 years from now, we should be doing 35. Maybe we'll fall a little short of that, maybe we won't. But we've got more feet on the ground real estate-wise in other countries as well as U.S. than we've ever had. It does take a little longer, but we also -- could we physically open more? Sure. But we like what we do and the way we do it. And probably, we also have a comfort level that it's not like we're going to miss out. We're the, in our view, the preferred club out there and so when we go into a market, if we take a little longer to get there, people are waiting for us. And it might be a little harder, but the fact of the matter is, is we feel comfortable how we're doing it."

We are a top line company. We want to drive sales. The fact that margins year-over-year are up on those core categories, up 16 basis points, we're not smart enough to figure out how to get there all the time. We always want to drive margin a little bit where we can, but we do it the right way by giving most of any savings back to the customer. Now if I look at our competitive stance -- our pricing competitive stance versus our direct competitors, the gap has never been wider. We could make a little more of this, but we don't. At the end of the day, we're always looking for ways to do that. When we do membership fee changes, historically, we are always looking to give some of that back. So all those things go into it, but at the end of the day, what helps margins? Private label, fresh foods strength, some of the ancillary businesses, all those things are helping as well.

I think, while we were comfortable here internally, I think we've shown and certainly, Craig has shown that the transition and the maintaining of the culture has continued without missing a beat. In merchandising, over the last few years, we've took certain categories like what used to be non -- was nonfoods, which is a combination of hardlines and softlines and Dennis Knapp, who was a senior executive over that and has since retired. We brought in 2 -- promoted 2 people and broken out hardlines and softlines. In operations, we've made several promotions and changes in people again. Typically, low-tenured people like they've only been here 20 to 25 years that are going from VP to Senior VP levels. I think we've got 16 senior VPs of operations in the U.S. geographically. And -- now, in terms of Doug, Doug, as you know, has been Head of U.S. Merchandising and certainly involved in a lot of merchandising beyond that as well. Doug's great.

Craig has a plan, but he's looking at a few things. And over the next few months, we'll be announcing how that changes. But we've got good people in place, and we don't think that there's an issue at all there. In Asia, Richard Chang, who is -- goes back to their Price Club days probably 25-plus years ago, has been -- ran operations for Taiwan, was promoted as Senior VP over Asia, and we've brought some new people in there as well, new people meaning existing Costco people, of course, and from the U.S. And so I think we feel pretty good about the change. It sped up because it was at 0. In the last couple of years, it's been a few -- a couple and now it's a few and a few more. And I think we're pretty well positioned for that. And I don't see a big change in what we do and how we do it."

California is about 1/3 of our U.S. company operations, and it's probably a little bit more penetrated gas-wise. And again, a year ago, we had gallon pumps which not only drives gasoline but more importantly, drives people in the parking lot in 52 or 53 of every 100 come in to shop. And so that was where we saw a bit of distortion, California versus the rest of the U.S. I believe there was -- I don't have the number in front of me, but to get to a 1, the other U.S. was a 2 and California was a minus 1. I'm off by a little bit there, but it was that kind of direction. And so that was a little unusual. Again, I can't predict what that means for the future, but other than that, there are some markets where, I think, the positive that we see is we've been successful in some of these new medium-sized markets. We had the most signups, I believe, in many years in terms of a new market -- new medium-sized market in Tulsa just a few weeks ago through opening day, we had more signups than we've had. Now I'm not talking about Asia, that's a whole different story in terms of signup levels. And so again, that's -- things look pretty good. I don't know if there's a lot of geographic changes other than the thing we called out on California. I personally believe a lot of that related to some of the gas issues."

Today, we reported our fourth quarter and year-to-date fiscal '16 operating results for the 16- and 52-week periods ended this past August 28. For the quarter, earnings came in at $1.77 a share, up 2% or $0.04 over last year's fourth quarter earnings of $1.73 a share. 
In comparing the year-over-year fourth quarter earnings results, a couple of items of note in looking at the comparison. FX as compared to a year ago during the fourth quarter, foreign currencies in the countries and other areas where we operate were weaker overall versus the U.S. dollar and primarily in Mexico, Canada, U.K. and Korea, this resulting in foreign -- in our foreign earnings in Q4 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $13 million after tax or $0.03 a share and has been -- exchange rate's been flat year-over-year. 
Gasoline profitability. Our profits from gasoline during the quarter as compared to last year's fourth quarter were lower by about $27 million pretax or $0.04 a share, primarily a function of last year's very strong profit results in the fourth quarter. Our numbers were fine this quarter, but we did pretty well last year as well.
IT modernization, that was about a $0.02 year-over-year impact. I can go for the detail on that, but that was about $60 million pretax or 4 basis points to the -- primarily to the SG&A line.
Income taxes. Both this year and last year's fourth quarter results had several positive -- net positive tax benefits that, in the aggregate, benefited each of the fourth quarter's earnings per share figures by $0.05. Excluding those positive tax items, this year's underlying Q4 tax rate was about 6/10 of a percentage point higher than last year's. That would have been about $0.02 a share, but again, year-over-year in the quarter, each of those fiscal quarters benefited by about $0.05 a share from positive items.
LIFO, last -- this year in the fourth quarter, we reported pretax LIFO credit of $31 million. That compares to last year in the fourth quarter of $14 million so both deflationary, although we've all talked about the increased levels of deflation of recent time. So at year-over-year, delta's, $17 million or about $0.02 a share related to the higher deflation in the LIFO credit in the quarter by -- higher by that amount.
In terms of sales for the fourth quarter, total reported sales were up 2%. Our 16-week reported comparable sales figures were flat year-over-year. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation. That was a little over 200 basis points of impact to the company and by weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, the latter about 1 percentage point of impact to sales. Excluding deflation, the flat U.S. comp sales figure for the fourth quarter would have been plus 2%. The reported Canadian comp figure plus 2% would have been plus 5% ex gas and FX, and the reported minus 2% other international comp figure, ex these 2 factors, would have been plus 1%. Total comps were reported as 0 for the quarter and again, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 3%. And of course, the plus 3% adjusted figure is still being impacted by a bit of an increased general merchandise deflation outside of gasoline.
Openings in Q4, we opened 10 new locations and also completed 1 relo, and for the fiscal year, we opened 29 net new locations; on top of that, had 4 relocations, I believe 2 of them which were relocated in -- the old units converted into new business centers. Of the 29 locations, 21 were in the U.S. Two are in Canada. Two are in Japan, and 1 each were in U.K., Taiwan, Australia and Spain.
This afternoon, I'll also review with you our membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussions about margin and SG&A, talk about e-commerce and a few other items of note, including an update on our recent switch to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. This occurred on June 20 after 6 weeks into the fourth quarter.
So onto the fourth quarter results. Quickly, sales for the fourth quarter were $35.7 billion, up 2% from last year's fourth quarter sales of $35 billion, again, a flat comp on a reported basis plus 3% excluding gas deflation and FX. The flat comp sales results on a reported basis, that consisted of an average transaction decrease of 2.8%. Again, excluding gas and FX deflation -- gas deflation and FX, the average transaction was slightly positive year-over-year and an average shopping frequency increase of right around 2.5%.
In terms of sales comparisons by geography, Texas, Bay Area and the Midwest regions within the United States showed the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Canada, Mexico, Spain and the U.K.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, sales for that within food and sundries, overall slightly negative year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Within that, though, spirits, sundries and deli came in best. Tobacco was the big negative, of course, as we've talked about that. That was down 21% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. If I look at the food and sundries category, that, again, on a comp basis, was slightly negative year-over-year for the quarter. Ex the tobacco department, it was plus 3. And you can see -- continue to see tobacco impacting us into the early spring.
Hardlines, overall up mid-single digit. The departments with the strong results were majors, electronics, sporting goods, health and beauty aids, hardware and tires. Within softlines, which was in the low single digits, apparel, small electrics and home furnishings were the standouts. Within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest of the 4 departments. Of course, meat has had a lot -- meat and other types of protein had a weakness relative to deflation. In ancillary businesses, hearing aids, pharmacy and optical showed the best results. 
I had mentioned earlier we recently seen a little pickup in the level of deflation overall. Some categories in the low to mid-single digits -- in the low- to mid-single-digit range and several fresh food categories, notably meat and pork and [ph] things like, in the 5% to 10% range in some cases. Overall, though, we're seeing net increasing deflation but not in those levels and some non-food levels as well -- non-food categories as well.
Moving to the line items on the income statement. Membership fees, we saw good results for the quarter. Reported were $832 million, up 9 basis points and $47 million or up 6% in dollars versus last year's fourth quarter. It would -- the $47 million would have been up $50 million if you would adjust it for FX.
In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 90% in U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide, continuing increasing penetration of Executive Memberships as well. In terms of number of members at fourth quarter and year-end, at year-end, we had 36.8 million Gold Star members, up from 36.2 million 16 weeks earlier at the end of the third quarter. Primary Business ticked up to 7.3 million from 7.2 million. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million for a total of 47.6 million member households at Q4 end compared to 16 weeks earlier when it was 46.9 million. And including add-on cards in terms of you walking around with a Costco membership card in their wallet, 86.7 million at year-end, up from 85.5 million just 16 weeks earlier.
In terms of Executive Member sign-ups -- Executive Members we have of the 47.6 million member households, we have 17.4 million. That was an increase of 370,000 during the 16-week fourth quarter or about 23,000 a week increase. And that's a combination, of course, of new members signing up as an Executive Member as well as members converting to it. Members -- Executive Members now account for a little over 1/3 of our base and a little more than 2/3 of our sales, where Executive Membership -- Executive Members are offered.
In terms of membership renewal rates, we ended the year at 90.3% in the U.S. and Canada. That's ticked down from 90.4% at the end of Q3. In the first half, it was 90.5%; worldwide, 87.6%, which was the same at Q3 end, ticking down from 87.7% in the previous quarter, again, the second quarter.
As I've talked about in the last few quarters, in Canada, we finally, in Q4, saw a reversal of some reductions of renewal rates, which we had anticipated when we converted 1.5 years or so ago to a new program card up there. In that case, the portfolio from American Express wasn't purchased. So it was really had to start all over, and you don't have as many auto renewals to start with. But that's quickly changed, and we've -- again in Q4, we saw a slight increase in the renewal rate there. A little different reason but the same thing a little bit in the U.S. with having no new sign-ups for the last 9 months prior to June 20 as we were switching over on June 20. So overall, pretty much the same and we'll see where that goes from here.
Regarding membership fees, effective the beginning of this month, we increased membership fee -- annual membership fees by about 10% in 3 Asia locations, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, as well as in Mexico and the U.K. On an annual basis, as you know, fee increases hit the membership fee income line over about 23 months based on deferred accounting. For example, the first month, people that are seeing this in September, those are people that originally signed up presumably in September, and this is when they renew. People that don't -- didn't sign up or aren't renewing until next March, they'll be in March and for 12 months' end. So that ends [ph] the 23 months overall. That will be about $50 million pretax to the membership income line. I'm sure there will be some offset in terms of what we do in terms of competitive pricing and everything.
Before continuing down the income statement line items, let me spend a minute updating you on our transition from American Express to Citi Visa in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. As I mentioned, this took place on June 20, the beginning of the seventh week into the fiscal fourth quarter. Beginning June 20, we stopped accepting American Express at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and on costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including, of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. There was a lot of effort, and as you know, there were a few operations glitches during the first few weeks after the cutover. We're now past that, and more importantly, the new card is fantastic for our members. In terms of increased cash back rewards, the estimate is about a 40% to 50% improvement in the Reward program, which is already previously a reward program to the members using the Citi Visa Anywhere card. And it's also great for us in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years and of course, lowering our effective cost of accepting credit and debit cards.
In terms of improved cash back member rewards, our former card provided a 3% cash back on gas, 2% on restaurant and travel, and 1% everywhere else, including everywhere at Costco other than the gas. With the new Citi Visa Anywhere card, 3% on gas now is 4%. 2% on restaurant and travel is now at 3%, and probably the most significant rewards improvement in terms of the total bucket here is the previous 1% reward on all other Costco purchases doubled from the previous 1% cash back rewards now to 2%. We think this is big, and it's even bigger for our Executive Members who also are in the 2% Reward from us on most Costco purchases. So combined, an Executive Member using the new card with just a few exceptions will earn 4% back at Costco. We think this is exciting, and we think it'll be good for our business over the next several years. Now lastly for all other purchases outside of Costco on the card, it'll be -- it will remain at a 1% cash back reward.
A few basic stats on the new card. Approximately 11.4 million American Express co-branded cards, representing about just under 7.5 million accounts, were transferred over to Citi during the conversion. Nearly 85% of those cards we considered active. That is the card had been used for purchases over the previous 60 days. Currently, over 85% of the accounts transferred over have now been activated with Costco. And since June 20 and just the past many weeks, 1.1 million members have applied for the new card and over 730,000 new accounts have been activated or a little over 1 million additional Citi Visa cards in circulation. It's still early. We launched only 14 weeks ago, but so far, we're beating our initial expectations in terms of conversion, usage and new sign-ups to the card.
In terms of gross margin, our reported gross margin was higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter by 28 basis points from -- up from 11.14% [ph] a year ago to 11.42%. Let you jot down the normal numbers that I asked you to jot down. We're now [ph] 4 columns. Reported and without gas deflation Q3 '16 -- in Q3 '16 would be the first 2 columns. The third and fourth columns would both be Q4 '16 but then also reported without gas depreciation.
The core merchandise in Q3 on a reported basis was higher year-over-year by 16 basis points but without gas deflation, down 2 basis points year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, up 29 basis points of this '16 [ph] and again, ex gas deflation, up 9 basis points. Ancillary businesses in Q3, plus 9 and plus 4 reported in the [ph] deflation. And in Q4 '16, ancillary businesses reported minus 4 and minus 9 without gas deflation.
2% Reward, 0 and a plus 2 in Q3 and a minus 2 and a 0 in Q4. LIFO, plus 2 and plus 2 and in Q4 '16, plus 4 and -- I'm sorry, plus 5 and plus 4. Other, in Q3 '16, both columns had a plus 7 and Q4, no issue, a 0 and 0. So all told in reporting on a year-over-year basis in Q3 of '16 compared to the prior Q3, up 34 basis points on a reported basis and up 13 on a ex gas deflation basis. This year in the fourth quarter, of course, you saw the 28 basis point up. That would have been plus 4 ex gas deflation. I might add that the plus 7 a year ago, that was -- I'm sorry, in Q3, that was simply a onetime legal settlement that benefited Oregon [ph] .
As you can see, overall, again, our margin was higher by 28 but without gas, plus 4. The core merchandise component that you see -- that I've just mentioned, the plus 29 or the plus 9 ex gas deflation, putting up [ph] to start with, our core gross margins, which is fresh foods -- food, sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the quarter by 12 basis points with food and sundries and hardlines showing higher year-over-year gross margins slightly, softlines being about flat year-over-year and fresh foods being ever so slightly down year-over-year.
Ancillary and other business gross margins were down 4 basis points, ex gas deflation, down 9, all a function of lower year-over-year gas prices -- gas profits. And as discussed earlier in the call -- but excluding gas, all other ancillary and other businesses gross margins as a percent of their own sales were up 6 basis points. So margins were fine in the quarter overall. And again, LIFO added 4 basis points to the equation.
In terms of SG&A expenses, for the quarter year-over-year, we were up 34 basis points, coming in at 10.34 [ph] versus a 10.00 [ph] a year ago. And again, that 34 -- I'll have you jot down a couple of numbers. That 34 ex gas deflation is a minus 13 or higher by 13, not higher by 84. Again, the same 4 columns, Q3 '16 for -- reported in Q3 '16 for -- without gas and the same 2 column headings for Q4 '16 -- in Q4 '16.
Operation, core operations, minus 24 basis points, and a minus means higher, higher by 28 and 4 [ph] basis points in Q3 '16 on a reported basis, higher by 8 ex gas deflation; in the fourth quarter, higher by 24 and higher by 6; central, higher by 6 and higher by 4; in Q3 and then Q4, higher by 9 and higher by 7 ex gas deflation. Stock compensation, higher by 3 and higher by 2 in the third quarter and higher by 1 and flat in the Q4 columns. Then total, reported in Q3 '16 compared to Q3 '15 on a reported basis, SG&A was higher by 33 but really higher by 14 ex gas deflation, and the higher by 34 this time was higher by 13 so not that different on looking at it that way.
The operations component, the minus 6 core operations ex gas deflation, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits partly due to the slightly weaker sales and the deflation and particularly in fresh that impacts that number, somewhat offset by a variety of other controls and expense [ph] improvements, in particular lower year-over-year bank fees as a result of the AmEx-Citi Visa switch during the quarter.
Central expense was higher year-over-year by 9, 7 ex gas. Increased IT spending related to modernization, that was 4 of those 7, and a couple other basis points higher from a few small legal settlements in the quarter. And again, stock compensation was really not an issue year-over-year.
Next on the income statement, preopening, pretty much in line with openings themselves. Last year, we had $27 million preopening expense. This year, it's $3 million lower or $24 million. Last year in the quarter, we had 13 openings. This year in the quarter, we had 11 and which includes that relo, pretty much in line again with what we've expected -- would expect.
All told, operating income in the fourth quarter came in at $1,191,000,000, which is $35 million higher or 3% higher year-over-year than last year's $1,156,000 -- $1,156,000,000. Below the operating income line, interest expense in the fourth quarter came in at $39 million this year versus $40 million last year, essentially flat year-over-year, essentially the same amount of debt outstanding at the various interest rates. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $11 million in the quarter, coming in at $29 million versus $40 million a year ago. Actual interest income was higher year-over-year -- I'm sorry, was a little lower year-over-year. The big difference was the other category, which was $16 million, primarily various FX transactions. This year in the fourth quarter, if I added up all the various FX, which is marking to market items and FX from foreign exchange contracts, we made about $11 million pretax a year ago. It was a little outsized. We made $26 million. That generally fluctuates. Usually, it's plus or minus $5 million. Sometimes it's a little more or less.
Overall, pretax income was higher by 2% or $25 million higher, coming in at $1,181,000,000. In terms of taxes, I mentioned that earlier, both fiscal fourth quarters this year and last year each benefited by about $0.05 a share from various positive items, and excluding these items, the normalized rate this year was still up about [ph] 6/10 of a percent from the year earlier. Again, net income coming in at $779 million for the fiscal quarter was up 2% from a year ago.
A quick rundown of some other topics in this afternoon's release. We have provided you balance sheet information. One thing you'll -- that is not on the balance sheet that I'm always asked about is depreciation and amortization. For the fourth quarter, that came in at $408 million, and for the entire fiscal year, D&A came in at $1,255,000,000 million. One thing that I'll -- looked perhaps a little out on the balance sheet was cash levels and accounts payable and the like. That has to do with modernization and switching our basic accounting platform over, and this has been a 2-plus-year effort. It was installed, and it's really the platform that allows -- the [ph] legacy systems will now sit on as we continue to develop them over the next couple of years. Not only was a big effort, it was an expensive effort. But nonetheless, to make sure that we had an extra week at the beginning since the -- this new [ph] system went in on day 1, we -- anything that was set up in the system, any merchandise or other payables that were set up in our system would be paid in -- during week 1 of the new fiscal year. We prepaid a week early the prior -- 2 week [ph] early the prior Friday I believe. And so we paid about $1.7 billion extra in week 52 of this past fiscal year, and that's why you see -- you'll see the cash levels down and the payables levels down associated with that.
So again, one of those statistics we always share with you is accounts payable as a percent of inventory. Last year, fourth quarter end on a reported basis was 101%. What you'll see now it's 85%, but again, taking out that $1.7 billion, it's 104%, actually a slight improvement in our payables ratio. And excluding construction payables and other types of non-merchandise payables, last year was at 89%, again on an -- what I'll call a normalized basis. Assuming we hadn't prepaid $1.7 billion of payables, the 89% would have been up a couple percentage points to 91%, so manage -- seem to be managing that okay.
In terms of average inventory per warehouse, last year fourth quarter end, it stood at exactly $13 million per warehouse. This year, it was -- came in at just slightly over $12.5 million or about $460,000 lower or 3% lower. And really lower per warehouse [ph] inventories pretty much spread across many categories, including the impact of deflation in many of the food and fresh departments as well as electronics. A little bit of it has to do with FX, but most of it is just coming down a little bit on inventory levels.
In terms of CapEx. In Q4, we spent approximately $850 million. And for all of fiscal '16, we came in right $2.6 billion. That $2.6 billion, by the way, compares to $2.4 billion for the prior year fiscal year in '15. Our estimate for fiscal '17 CapEx is in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion so about the same level as compared to last year perhaps a little bit depends on timing. Next, Costco in line. We're currently in the United States, Canada, U.K., Mexico and recently -- more recently launched in 3 in Taiwan. For the fourth quarter, sales and profits were up year-over-year. Total sales were up 12% in the quarter, 13% x FX. For all of '16, 15% reported plus 17 x FX. On a comp basis, to the quarter, we were up 10% recorded and 11% FX -- 11% excluding FX. And for the year, are 14% and 17%. Next discussion in terms of expansion. As I mentioned, in terms of net new locations this year, we opened 29, that's up from 23 openings in all of '15. This current year we have in our budget anyone net openings before the 3 of them are relos so something certainly in the high 20s but I think something our current best guess is the [ph] 31. If you look back over the last couple of years, the 23 we opened in '15, that represented about 3.5% square growth. In fiscal '16, the 29 units, recognizing they tend to be a little bigger and we've also expand a few units, it's about 4.5% square footage growth. And in '17, as soon as we got to 31, that would be low mid-4s as well in terms of percentage per square footage growth. Our planned fiscal '17 locations assuming the 31 number, would be 17 in the U.S., 7 in Canada and 1 each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico and France, our first in France and also unit in Iceland. Both France and Iceland are currently targeted for mid-to-late spring -- late spring this calendar '17. And as we know, sometimes evasive but that's our best guess at this point. Note again, this are first locations in France and Iceland and we look forward to seeing some of the over there. As of fourth quarter end, total square footage stood at 103.2 million square feet. In terms of common stock repurchases for the fourth quarter, we purchased $131 million worth of stock or 856,000 shares at an average price just over $153 a share. For all of fiscal '16, we purchased $477 million of stock. That compares to $493 million in 2015 and $333 million in 2014. In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividends stands at $0.45 a share. We increased that this past spring a few months ago. That was 12.5% increase from the prior quarterly and annual rate. So this year at $0.45 a quarter, this yearly $1.80 a share dividend represents in the cost of the company at just under $800 million. Next Wednesday, October 5, at 6:00 p.m. Pacific time, we will announce or September sales results for the 5-week period ending Sunday, October 2, this coming Sunday. This 5-week period will include 34 selling days in the U.S. and Canada, recognizing the closing of our business in the observance of Labor Day on those 2 countries. Lastly, on fiscal '17 first quarter results, for the 12 weeks ending November 20, we will do it as we have done this time, we will report after shortly after the market close on Wednesday, December 7 with the earnings call that afternoon at 2:00. With that, Amanda, I'll turn it back to you for Q&A."

If you think back 5 or 6 years ago, or even 10 years ago and we had probably 65, 70 units, we thought the market would be 91 day, and today we have 90 or 91 and we think that those certainly",680,"Well, first of all, in Canada, I think it's a couple of reasons. If you think back 5 or 6 years ago, or even 10 years ago and we had probably 65, 70 units, we thought the market would be 91 day, and today we have 90 or 91 and we think that those certainly be over 100. And we keep adding a few to that concept. I think the fact that we're opening so many right now has to do with as much very strong sales over the last few years. We have been enjoying 5% to 9% comps in local currency in each of the last few years out there and so it keeps getting stronger. And just like in the U.S. and even in mature markets, we find that we can -- while there'll be some cannibalization, the net business that's added when we opened a unit even though it's cannibalizing, net cannibalization, we'll find it existing members will then be shopping more frequently because they're closer. And so I think it's a combination of those things. And I don't know what the new 5 or 10-year guesstimate is on Canada. I don't think we can open 7 a year but once we decided to go to look and see where we're going and how strong we've been, we've been -- this is the result of probably an effort that started over a year ago to put a few more in the pipeline up there. In terms of the U.S., I think the same story holds true If you'd ask us 5 or or so [ph] years ago by now how many would be in the U.S. versus outside the U.S., and we would have said probably would be down from 75 or 80% in the U.S. to 50 and heading south of there is we'll saturate. We found in the U.S. that we can put more units in existing markets. I think we're getting, in a couple of months, we're getting ready to open our 17th or so unit in the Houston town. Having opened our 16 or unit just less than a year ago. And so the other thing, of course, in the U.S. that we have perhaps up to our expectation is markets that 5 or so years ago didn't think we'd have any near-term interest in considering medium-sized markets where our direct competition, the direct competition was there. And what we have found is we've done pretty well when we go to these markets. Now some of these markets are smaller, it takes a lot longer, but there's clearly an opportunity for us there as we've gone into Tulsa and New Orleans and Birmingham and Rochester and lots of -- and Toledo, these are markets that, again, were higher on the radar 7 or 8 years ago. And what we're seeing is that our deal works. The last thing, of course, includes adding to some of the business centers. For many years we only had 6 or 8 or so business centers. We opened 4 last year to be at 11 and we're planning to open 4 this year to be at 15. Including our first business center in Canada. And so, again, that just adds a few in both the Canada question and the U.S. question. It includes that opportunity on a small basis. On the side on that is, I think, as I've mentioned, 2 of the 4 relos this year were -- 2 of the 4 business center openings this year were relos. One in back in many of your [indiscernible] woods when we took an older, smaller parking lot, no gas station, Hackensack Costco and relocated it to nearby with the big sized units where lots of good parking, great ingress in the U.S. and a gas station and converted the Hackensack unit into a business owner. So just a small additional benefit in terms of having a use for units as we move some of those to bigger locations. So all that's I think been part of it."

We do all of those anyway. And I think probably the best, simplest answer is that just like when we buy a physical product better lower we can buy whether it's slower rate, greater purchasing power or greater production efficiencies or whether we figure out with our supplier, we generally wanted to 80% or 90% of that, the vast majority of it given back to the customers in terms of lower price because that's what drives our business. And if we do it more next year, we'll get 80% or 90% of that back. It's not an exact number but it's well closer to 80% or 90% then on. That same MO and philosophy occurred here. So when we sat down and negotiated all the various levers that relate what I call this bucket of money, there's a lot of ways 1 can use it. Most importantly, by improving the reward on the card to the member that's going to utilize it. That will drive value to member and loyalty to us and also more business to us. And secondly, what's left over and when we originally did it, we did it such that we're going to keep a small amount of it. Now to the extent -- we're not going to change the rewards program every afternoon if we see there's more money in the bucket. So that will additionally accrue to us but it's not changing what we're doing with it. We're still going to do those other things. So again, I think, over time, we'll look at it, you can rest assure in a few years if the success of the card and the economics of the card to us, we're not going to allow ourselves to keep a lot of that extra but we started with a small amount and the big bucket is good and it is a little better because the cards working and direction so that we expected, that's good. And we're still going to do those other things anyway."

Now there's all types of movement in both directions. You had existing -- a member with existing Visa cards with his or her wallet and maybe their using that one, not ours, that's fine. We still have a negotiated good rate on certain things. You had people that were using debit their whole lives because they perhaps did not want an American Express card or they applied for 1 and did not get 1. And so for 16 years, they used cash, check and debit. Now for the first time, they can use a credit card and I'm sure that's where we saw many of these new signups as well or part of them but in terms of are they buying more with us? Anecdotally, we're hearing that from our warehouse managers who talk with their biggest wholesale customers. But it's purely anecdotal at this juncture and I think we'll see more of it.

I mean, arguably, there's probably 50 different factors that impact sales everyday and every week and every month. And we look at -- try to look at the big picture here. We feel very good about what we're doing in merchandising wise. We feel very good about what we're seeing with the crossover to this. Our view has been we don't think that many people left Costco because they can't use their American Express card. American Express is a great brand and it was a great relationship for many years. But at the end of the day, they come to Costco because of our quality value. And when we look around, and as you would well know, we get a lot of questions all the time well, Ari impacted by the Internet? Losing some? The Internet is taking from it everybody. Our view is it takes a little less from us. And interestingly, when you look at the categories within our slightly lower sales over the last couple of few months, the categories that had buffed that trend have been discretionary nonfood categories like apparel and housewares and electronics. So now and when we look at food and sundries, we absolutely do not believe it's delivery services. We do actually believe it's deflation more than anything. But again, everybody takes a little piece of something. It's a little piece we would rather have ourselves or not lose. But again, we feel good about what issues we have going on. And again, when I talk about the new card being a reward to the member based on their previous spending habits, 40% to 50% greater reward, that's big. When I talk about going from 1% to 2% on Costco purchases when they use that card, that's big. It's not big overnight where they change their habits completely. You'll see at first in business members and that's where we have seen it. Mind you, during the transition, there was probably even loss of sales for some of the business members in some cases. I'm sure American Express didn't around not doing anything, they're good at what they do. They were able to figure out how to get people, they're marketing elsewhere. But we think our members at Costco, primarily for us, I think, again it is a lot of different things, different factors and, again, having gone to our budget meeting forever but having gone every 4 weeks, just to name with the last few, some of the initiatives I see going on, merchandising wise, I think we got a lot of good things going on. Not that we're trying to solve a problem from yesterday, it's what we do everyday."

Prior to 1 year ago comparison, a few months prior to that, people are waiting for the Windows 10 launch and so you had a lot of pent-up demand and the launch itself and compared to a year later. So those 2 things alone were part of that. That's, frankly, I think one of the bigger things. But, again, I think as I've said jokingly, have seriously and half jokingly in the past, some of the things we haven't done historically gives us great opportunity to do this. There are still some buckling and tackling like couple of things that I just mentioned. We have greatly improved our delivery but it was from bad to better. It's still takes too long and again, we're not going to get something to you in 2 hours but you can see some logistically some things. And then on handling returns, particularly big ticket returns, we havenn't done a good job of that and that's already in process. So you'll see some changes that will help.

And again, I think, you're going to see, we have added items, we are items but we're not trying to figure out what 20,000 additional items because that's not what we're going to do.

Generally, when prices go down, while it impacts some of these basis point percentage calculations, we make more money. When it goes up, we make a little less money although I would say, for the last couple of years, there's been a new normal. When prices went down, our view is as retail gas, overall, the lower their prices but not as much as they could have. And we lowered it more than that and we're still able to benefit a little from it. So that was a positive. I think yes, it's the value proposition more than anything that gets people in our parking lot. And we're helped by the gas buddies out by .coms out there, the 2 years they've done it. And then the 4% rebate. There's a lot of different promotional things at the majors out there whether it's $0.10 a gallon off, 4% is big. As the price per gallon goes up, 4% gets bigger. And I think that will be positive for us as well. If you've been through a gas stations, when you've got, in some cases, 20 pumps now pumping at the same time and the lines move fast but there'll be 6 people in each each line.

And we've got some other of things, I was looking at my sheets here, hold on a second, and this was just year-over-year, this past month. Walnuts were down 47%. That's sell our price. I'm sorry, that's our, sorry, costs. Now a year ago, they had doubled from the prior year. So they were kind of back from where they were, almonds down 38%; whole eggs, down 54%; large eggs, down 53%. Just looking down the sheet of the top 50 [indiscernible] of the Dass. So those things, particularly things like eggs really add up in. On the inflation page, just for fun, nothing. Well, I mean, there's some 20s and 30s, but if I look at the top 25 or so items, just in the last 4 weeks of the fiscal year, regular unleaded gasoline was down 12.8%. It was over $3.5 million of credit, if you will, to LIFO. We don't book it every month like that, but that will be $3 million. So the biggest items in the deflation sheet add to the LIFO credit of $2 million to $3.5 million, $2 million to $4 million. Biggest items on inflationary sheet at $300,000 to $500,000 of LIFO charge. So again, it gives you a sense of where we're going. Another data point is the U.S. inventories at LIFO. That's U.S. accounting concept. That's the indices when you start off from costs of the exact items at the beginning of fiscal '16 at 100.00 and was to go to. Food is down 2.75% with half of that, about half a percent being just in the last couple of months. Sundries was about down at less than 1.5% and not totally changed in the last 3 months. Apparel, almost right at the same 100 point earlier a year ago. Almost dry there. Computers we expect down a little under 2%. So it's all over the board. Again, so you have extreme categories like meat which is high-volume but meat is also, we turn it so much faster, it has a higher churn. It turns, I would think, more than 52x a year where if you have a less deflationary item, if you have an inflationary items that is turning 8 times in nonfoods, that's going to be a different story."

I mean, we do that for a living daily and weekly and they do with your truly weekly comp shops in every market with the direct warehouse competition. Certainly, the fresh foods, people do more direct pricing competition on sale items at supermarkets, particularly on holiday week, they say that and soda pop. But at the end of the day, if anything, our view is to get bigger, in other words, our competitive position, pricing wise, it is stronger than it's ever been. But we're not resting on that. We're constantly trying to figure out how to widen it. That's what we do. As it relates to guidance, we don't give out guidance. The points of headwinds and tailwinds, anniversary of headwinds and children's, I think, we have talked about in the past we're hopeful that just from a simple FX standpoint, for 2-plus years now, the dollar has strengthened year-over-year. So it was more than 1 year anniversary. There was an inflection point of late although nobody knows what tomorrow will bring some that. But tomorrow will be impactful negative to the negative. We got through the headwind of the conversion. That should be in a net positive but I think we'll be in the positive in the next few years and probably not easily calculable, but we'll figure that, we'll try to figure that out. We know that will improve our SG&A at what I'll call percent and bank fees, and that were things that are related to new card offering. And again, we are going to be more quantitative as we get to the next couple of quarters. And it's more definable than just for 14 weeks. But again, it's good and we look forward to doing that. I mentioned the international membership fee increases in those certain areas. And that's, again, that will improve over nearly 2 year period by about $50 million pretax of the membership fee line. I imagine you'll see some of that offset some of the margin line. Although the competitive -- to be more competitive but not reacting to competition. Trying to think other things. Gas, I think there's a new role in gas. I think there's going to be swings from time to time. I think the other issue is we have, so you've heard this before, we have lots of little things that are positive for us that continue to drive value whether it's pharmacy, optical, hearing aid or whether it's Costco travel. These are all things -- these are all articulating program in the warehouse. A new program which is brand new. We're just testing it in Southern California, where testing master, you go to costcotickets.com and check it out. But again, some real savings on high-end stuff and so there's a lot of things we're doing. We seem to have gotten some breakthroughs on the cosmetic side with SK2 to. We hope that brings on others but given some of the challenges that brick-and-mortar in that area are impacted by it, we can sell the heck out of that stuff to provide great value to our members. That's kind of member we believe these manufacturers want. Now tied myself, time to myself and all talk them into it. In terms of gas stations, we continue to add gas stations and hearing aids not just a new locations but to existing locations. I would say all those things helped a little bit."

We weren't expecting that. My family has an Amazon card, not a card but an account and although I don't let them buy a lot, no, just kidding. At the end of the day, we will expect that. The other thing in general is it's going to take each percentage in different categories. It's going to impact different categories and different retailers of such categories at different levels. I read the reports that some of you have written about that we and maybe 1 or 2 other retailers out there that are unique are Amazon proof for Internet proof. We don't buy that for a minute. We do believe that we do rely and would expect a big impact loss. It also don't believe them to go crazy on the other side but we want both but our value proposition is best served for us when it's in-store getting members to come in buying when they can see everything there we have. And so we think we can -- went on both cards, how we lost our sale of something to an Internet provider out there? Whether it's Amazon or sell in those? I'm sure we have. How began, more often than not? Absolutely. As the whole media business, videos, CDs and books, many years later, books for us is a new normal. And it's still quite strong, maybe 70% or 80% of what it used to be but it is strong and willing. It the other 2 had changed for a lot of reasons including streaming.

There are certain things we're not prepared to do, again, some smaller sizes and our pricing. And have everything in the world available to you part of our fight is what we do. I think looking forward here, even with millennials when our success or again it didn't start 7 over 10 years ago sitting some you're on the table how are you going to go after this generation that one staff. We have get great merchants and grid operators in a different regions in the U.S. and elsewhere and they are trying things. And every month is -- got better, in this case, the Bay Area region, their computer it's sold another price in other regions. We turned around and nobody can benefit as much and do it as snake, as good, as well as we do and so I don't think we going after them and involve. What else can we do for them? And whether it's food items or other things. We also worked -- our membership marketing people this study recent in our presentation recently and it showed whatever the previous generation was before, it was generally averse, and I know I am one of those baby boomers which I am not a baby anymore. Our average age versus the us publish and just in 3 to 4 years has come down in 2 years from a 4 year gap to a 2-year gap. Over goal is not a necessary get it to 0 gap, our goal is to drive more business. But as we look at the age of millennials versus that same age group when the previous generation was at that age, thereby a little less but not a lot less. When we look at what we did, and this, again, data points or, what we did who we did 2.5 years ago on LivingSocial and now we have the full year renewals on them. It was very interesting. Clearly, we would have expected more of those people to be millennials to sign-up on that living networking social 10 or 12-day initiative that we did. And that was correct. What we were surprised at is that they actually shopped a little more frequently while a little less each time but aggregate of those 2 the but over the year a little more in the low single digits but there was more and they didn't have a bracket around it. And they renewed at a slightly higher rate. Than the locking people that say months that could come in to sign up us working together in the people that walked in were on average age a little older about 10 to 15 percentage point fewer penetration of millenials that was encouraging to us. So while the was certainly extreme in example in your can be there's a lot of people that's still aren't the best they shop in-store and be that a lot of reasons to get you there. I am also excited of what we see we are going to be doing on.com but I'm not suggesting it is going to be trying to get your dinner delivered to your doorstep if you were that is not going to be us."

And you think about the fact that effectively on virtually everything, you can get 4% off of Costco between if you're an executive member and use the co-branded Costco, Citi Visa anywhere card. For a company that markets it's a good up 10% or 12%, and I would think we're consider -- we could buy pretty well and put our purchasing power in 3700 items and then -- but give you back up to 4% of that.

Today, we reported our fourth quarter and year-to-date fiscal '16 operating results for the 16- and 52-week periods ended this past August 28. For the quarter, earnings came in at $1.77 a share, up 2% or $0.04 over last year's fourth quarter earnings of $1.73 a share. 
In comparing the year-over-year fourth quarter earnings results, a couple of items of note in looking at the comparison. FX as compared to a year ago during the fourth quarter, foreign currencies in the countries and other areas where we operate were weaker overall versus the U.S. dollar and primarily in Mexico, Canada, U.K. and Korea, this resulting in foreign -- in our foreign earnings in Q4 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $13 million after tax or $0.03 a share and has been -- exchange rate's been flat year-over-year. 
Gasoline profitability. Our profits from gasoline during the quarter as compared to last year's fourth quarter were lower by about $27 million pretax or $0.04 a share, primarily a function of last year's very strong profit results in the fourth quarter. Our numbers were fine this quarter, but we did pretty well last year as well.
IT modernization, that was about a $0.02 year-over-year impact. I can go for the detail on that, but that was about $60 million pretax or 4 basis points to the -- primarily to the SG&A line.
Income taxes. Both this year and last year's fourth quarter results had several positive -- net positive tax benefits that, in the aggregate, benefited each of the fourth quarter's earnings per share figures by $0.05. Excluding those positive tax items, this year's underlying Q4 tax rate was about 6/10 of a percentage point higher than last year's. That would have been about $0.02 a share, but again, year-over-year in the quarter, each of those fiscal quarters benefited by about $0.05 a share from positive items.
LIFO, last -- this year in the fourth quarter, we reported pretax LIFO credit of $31 million. That compares to last year in the fourth quarter of $14 million so both deflationary, although we've all talked about the increased levels of deflation of recent time. So at year-over-year, delta's, $17 million or about $0.02 a share related to the higher deflation in the LIFO credit in the quarter by -- higher by that amount.
In terms of sales for the fourth quarter, total reported sales were up 2%. Our 16-week reported comparable sales figures were flat year-over-year. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation. That was a little over 200 basis points of impact to the company and by weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, the latter about 1 percentage point of impact to sales. Excluding deflation, the flat U.S. comp sales figure for the fourth quarter would have been plus 2%. The reported Canadian comp figure plus 2% would have been plus 5% ex gas and FX, and the reported minus 2% other international comp figure, ex these 2 factors, would have been plus 1%. Total comps were reported as 0 for the quarter and again, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 3%. And of course, the plus 3% adjusted figure is still being impacted by a bit of an increased general merchandise deflation outside of gasoline.
Openings in Q4, we opened 10 new locations and also completed 1 relo, and for the fiscal year, we opened 29 net new locations; on top of that, had 4 relocations, I believe 2 of them which were relocated in -- the old units converted into new business centers. Of the 29 locations, 21 were in the U.S. Two are in Canada. Two are in Japan, and 1 each were in U.K., Taiwan, Australia and Spain.
This afternoon, I'll also review with you our membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussions about margin and SG&A, talk about e-commerce and a few other items of note, including an update on our recent switch to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. This occurred on June 20 after 6 weeks into the fourth quarter.
So onto the fourth quarter results. Quickly, sales for the fourth quarter were $35.7 billion, up 2% from last year's fourth quarter sales of $35 billion, again, a flat comp on a reported basis plus 3% excluding gas deflation and FX. The flat comp sales results on a reported basis, that consisted of an average transaction decrease of 2.8%. Again, excluding gas and FX deflation -- gas deflation and FX, the average transaction was slightly positive year-over-year and an average shopping frequency increase of right around 2.5%.
In terms of sales comparisons by geography, Texas, Bay Area and the Midwest regions within the United States showed the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Canada, Mexico, Spain and the U.K.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, sales for that within food and sundries, overall slightly negative year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Within that, though, spirits, sundries and deli came in best. Tobacco was the big negative, of course, as we've talked about that. That was down 21% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. If I look at the food and sundries category, that, again, on a comp basis, was slightly negative year-over-year for the quarter. Ex the tobacco department, it was plus 3. And you can see -- continue to see tobacco impacting us into the early spring.
Hardlines, overall up mid-single digit. The departments with the strong results were majors, electronics, sporting goods, health and beauty aids, hardware and tires. Within softlines, which was in the low single digits, apparel, small electrics and home furnishings were the standouts. Within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest of the 4 departments. Of course, meat has had a lot -- meat and other types of protein had a weakness relative to deflation. In ancillary businesses, hearing aids, pharmacy and optical showed the best results. 
I had mentioned earlier we recently seen a little pickup in the level of deflation overall. Some categories in the low to mid-single digits -- in the low- to mid-single-digit range and several fresh food categories, notably meat and pork and things like, in the 5% to 10% range in some cases. Overall, though, we're seeing net increasing deflation but not in those levels and some non-food levels as well -- non-food categories as well.
Moving to the line items on the income statement. Membership fees, we saw good results for the quarter. Reported were $832 million, up 9 basis points and $47 million or up 6% in dollars versus last year's fourth quarter. It would -- the $47 million would have been up $50 million if you would adjust it for FX.
In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 90% in U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide, continuing increasing penetration of Executive Memberships as well. In terms of number of members at fourth quarter and year-end, at year-end, we had 36.8 million Gold Star members, up from 36.2 million 16 weeks earlier at the end of the third quarter. Primary Business ticked up to 7.3 million from 7.2 million. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million for a total of 47.6 million member households at Q4 end compared to 16 weeks earlier when it was 46.9 million. And including add-on cards in terms of you walking around with a Costco membership card in their wallet, 86.7 million at year-end, up from 85.5 million just 16 weeks earlier.
In terms of Executive Member sign-ups -- Executive Members we have of the 47.6 million member households, we have 17.4 million. That was an increase of 370,000 during the 16-week fourth quarter or about 23,000 a week increase. And that's a combination, of course, of new members signing up as an Executive Member as well as members converting to it. Members -- Executive Members now account for a little over 1/3 of our base and a little more than 2/3 of our sales, where Executive Membership -- Executive Members are offered.
In terms of membership renewal rates, we ended the year at 90.3% in the U.S. and Canada. That's ticked down from 90.4% at the end of Q3. In the first half, it was 90.5%; worldwide, 87.6%, which was the same at Q3 end, ticking down from 87.7% in the previous quarter, again, the second quarter.
As I've talked about in the last few quarters, in Canada, we finally, in Q4, saw a reversal of some reductions of renewal rates, which we had anticipated when we converted 1.5 years or so ago to a new program card up there. In that case, the portfolio from American Express wasn't purchased. So it was really had to start all over, and you don't have as many auto renewals to start with. But that's quickly changed, and we've -- again in Q4, we saw a slight increase in the renewal rate there. A little different reason but the same thing a little bit in the U.S. with having no new sign-ups for the last 9 months prior to June 20 as we were switching over on June 20. So overall, pretty much the same and we'll see where that goes from here.
Regarding membership fees, effective the beginning of this month, we increased membership fee -- annual membership fees by about 10% in 3 Asia locations, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, as well as in Mexico and the U.K. On an annual basis, as you know, fee increases hit the membership fee income line over about 23 months based on deferred accounting. For example, the first month, people that are seeing this in September, those are people that originally signed up presumably in September, and this is when they renew. People that don't -- didn't sign up or aren't renewing until next March, they'll be in March and for 12 months' end. So that ends the 23 months overall. That will be about $50 million pretax to the membership income line. I'm sure there will be some offset in terms of what we do in terms of competitive pricing and everything.
Before continuing down the income statement line items, let me spend a minute updating you on our transition from American Express to Citi Visa in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. As I mentioned, this took place on June 20, the beginning of the seventh week into the fiscal fourth quarter. Beginning June 20, we stopped accepting American Express at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and on costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including, of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. There was a lot of effort, and as you know, there were a few operations glitches during the first few weeks after the cutover. We're now past that, and more importantly, the new card is fantastic for our members. In terms of increased cash back rewards, the estimate is about a 40% to 50% improvement in the Reward program, which is already previously a reward program to the members using the Citi Visa Anywhere card. And it's also great for us in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years and of course, lowering our effective cost of accepting credit and debit cards.
In terms of improved cash back member rewards, our former card provided a 3% cash back on gas, 2% on restaurant and travel, and 1% everywhere else, including everywhere at Costco other than the gas. With the new Citi Visa Anywhere card, 3% on gas now is 4%. 2% on restaurant and travel is now at 3%, and probably the most significant rewards improvement in terms of the total bucket here is the previous 1% reward on all other Costco purchases doubled from the previous 1% cash back rewards now to 2%. We think this is big, and it's even bigger for our Executive Members who also are in the 2% Reward from us on most Costco purchases. So combined, an Executive Member using the new card with just a few exceptions will earn 4% back at Costco. We think this is exciting, and we think it'll be good for our business over the next several years. Now lastly for all other purchases outside of Costco on the card, it'll be -- it will remain at a 1% cash back reward.
A few basic stats on the new card. Approximately 11.4 million American Express co-branded cards, representing about just under 7.5 million accounts, were transferred over to Citi during the conversion. Nearly 85% of those cards we considered active. That is the card had been used for purchases over the previous 60 days. Currently, over 85% of the accounts transferred over have now been activated with Costco. And since June 20 and just the past many weeks, 1.1 million members have applied for the new card and over 730,000 new accounts have been activated or a little over 1 million additional Citi Visa cards in circulation. It's still early. We launched only 14 weeks ago, but so far, we're beating our initial expectations in terms of conversion, usage and new sign-ups to the card.
In terms of gross margin, our reported gross margin was higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter by 28 basis points from -- up from 11.14% a year ago to 11.42%. Let you jot down the normal numbers that I asked you to jot down. We'll have 4 columns. Reported and without gas deflation Q3 '16 -- in Q3 '16 would be the first 2 columns. The third and fourth columns would both be Q4 '16 but then also reported without gas depreciation.
The core merchandise in Q3 on a reported basis was higher year-over-year by 16 basis points but without gas deflation, down 2 basis points year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, up 29 basis points of this 16 and again, ex gas deflation, up 9 basis points. Ancillary businesses in Q3, plus 9 and plus 4 reported in the deflation. And in Q4 '16, ancillary businesses reported minus 4 and minus 9 without gas deflation.
2% Reward, 0 and a plus 2 in Q3 and a minus 2 and a 0 in Q4. LIFO, plus 2 and plus 2 and in Q4 '16, plus 4 and -- I'm sorry, plus 5 and plus 4. Other, in Q3 '16, both columns had a plus 7 and Q4, no issue, a 0 and 0. So all told in reporting on a year-over-year basis in Q3 of '16 compared to the prior Q3, up 34 basis points on a reported basis and up 13 on a ex gas deflation basis. This year in the fourth quarter, of course, you saw the 28 basis point up. That would have been plus 4 ex gas deflation. I might add that the plus 7 a year ago, that was -- I'm sorry, in Q3, that was simply a onetime legal settlement that benefited margin.
As you can see, overall, again, our margin was higher by 28 but without gas, plus 4. The core merchandise component that you see -- that I've just mentioned, the plus 29 or the plus 9 ex gas deflation, putting up folks [ph] to start with, our core gross margins, which is fresh foods -- food, sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the quarter by 12 basis points with food and sundries and hardlines showing higher year-over-year gross margins slightly, softlines being about flat year-over-year and fresh foods being ever so slightly down year-over-year.
Ancillary and other business gross margins were down 4 basis points, ex gas deflation, down 9, all a function of lower year-over-year gas prices -- gas profits. And as discussed earlier in the call -- but excluding gas, all other ancillary and other businesses gross margins as a percent of their own sales were up 6 basis points. So margins were fine in the quarter overall. And again, LIFO added 4 basis points to the equation.
In terms of SG&A expenses, for the quarter year-over-year, we were up 34 basis points, coming in at 10.34 versus a 10.00 a year ago. And again, that 34 -- I'll have you jot down a couple of numbers. That 34 ex gas deflation is a minus 13 or higher by 13, not higher by 84. Again, the same 4 columns, Q3 '16 for -- reported in Q3 '16 for -- without gas and the same 2 column headings for Q4 '16 -- in Q4 '16.
Operation, core operations, minus 24 basis points, and a minus means higher, higher by 28 -- 24 basis points in Q3 '16 on a reported basis, higher by 8 ex gas deflation; in the fourth quarter, higher by 24 and higher by 6; central, higher by 6 and higher by 4; in Q3 and then Q4, higher by 9 and higher by 7 ex gas deflation. Stock compensation, higher by 3 and higher by 2 in the third quarter and higher by 1 and flat in the Q4 columns. Then total, reported in Q3 '16 compared to Q3 '15 on a reported basis, SG&A was higher by 33 but really higher by 14 ex gas deflation, and the higher by 34 this time was higher by 13 so not that different on looking at it that way.
The operations component, the minus 6 core operations ex gas deflation, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits partly due to the slightly weaker sales and the deflation and particularly in fresh that impacts that number, somewhat offset by a variety of other controllable expense improvements, in particular lower year-over-year bank fees as a result of the Amex-Citi Visa switch during the quarter.
Central expense was higher year-over-year by 9, 7 ex gas. Increased IT spending related to modernization, that was 4 of those 7, and a couple other basis points higher from a few small legal settlements in the quarter. And again, stock compensation was really not an issue year-over-year.
Next on the income statement, preopening, pretty much in line with openings themselves. Last year, we had $27 million preopening expense. This year, it's $3 million lower or $24 million. Last year in the quarter, we had 13 openings. This year in the quarter, we had 11 and which includes that relo, pretty much in line again with what we've expected -- would expect.
All told, operating income in the fourth quarter came in at $1,191,000,000, which is $35 million higher or 3% higher year-over-year than last year's $1,156,000 -- $1,156,000,000. Below the operating income line, interest expense in the fourth quarter came in at $39 million this year versus $40 million last year, essentially flat year-over-year, essentially the same amount of debt outstanding at the various interest rates. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $11 million in the quarter, coming in at $29 million versus $40 million a year ago. Actual interest income was higher year-over-year -- I'm sorry, was a little lower year-over-year. The big difference was the other category, which was $16 million, primarily various FX transactions. This year in the fourth quarter, if I added up all the various FX, which is marking to market items and FX from foreign exchange contracts, we made about $11 million pretax a year ago. It was a little outsized. We made $26 million. That generally fluctuates. Usually, it's plus or minus $5 million. Sometimes it's a little more or less.
Overall, pretax income was higher by 2% or $25 million higher, coming in at $1,181,000,000. In terms of taxes, I mentioned that earlier, both fiscal fourth quarters this year and last year each benefited by about $0.05 a share from various positive items, and excluding these items, the normalized rate this year was still up about 6/10 of a percent from the year earlier. Again, net income coming in at $779 million for the fiscal quarter was up 2% from a year ago.
A quick rundown of some other topics in this afternoon's release. We have provided you balance sheet information. One thing you'll -- that is not on the balance sheet that I'm always asked about is depreciation and amortization. For the fourth quarter, that came in at $408 million, and for the entire fiscal year, D&A came in at $1,255,000,000 million. One thing that I'll -- looked perhaps a little out on the balance sheet was cash levels and accounts payable and the like. That has to do with modernization and switching our basic accounting platform over, and this has been a 2-plus-year effort. It was installed, and it's really the platform that a lot of the legacy systems will now sit on as we continue to develop them over the next couple of years. Not only was a big effort, it was an expensive effort. But nonetheless, to make sure that we had an extra week at the beginning since this -- soon as the system went in on day 1, we -- anything that was set up in the system, any merchandise or other payables that were set up in our system would be paid in -- during week 1 of the new fiscal year. We prepaid a week early the prior -- 2 week [ph] early the prior Friday I believe. And so we paid about $1.7 billion extra in week 52 of this past fiscal year, and that's why you see -- you'll see the cash levels down and the payables levels down associated with that.
So again, one of those statistics we always share with you is accounts payable as a percent of inventory. Last year, fourth quarter end on a reported basis was 101%. What you'll see now it's 85%, but again, taking out that $1.7 billion, it's 104%, actually a slight improvement in our payables ratio. And excluding construction payables and other types of non-merchandise payables, last year was at 89%, again on an -- what I'll call a normalized basis. Assuming we hadn't prepaid $1.7 billion of payables, the 89% would have been a couple percentage points to 91%, so manage -- seem to be managing that okay.
In terms of average inventory per warehouse, last year fourth quarter end, it stood at exactly $13 million per warehouse. This year, it was -- came in at just slightly over $12.5 million or about $460,000 lower or 3% lower. And really lower per warehouse [ph] inventory is pretty much spread across many categories, including the impact of deflation in many of the food and fresh departments as well as electronics. A little bit of it has to do with FX, but most of it is just coming down a little bit on inventory levels.
In terms of CapEx, in Q4, we spent approximately $850 million, and for all of fiscal '16, we came in right at $2.6 billion. That $2.6 billion, by the way, compares to $2.4 billion for the prior year fiscal year in '15. Our estimate for fiscal '17 CapEx is in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion so about the same level as compared to last year, perhaps a little higher, depends on timing.
Next, Costco Online. We're currently in the United States, Canada, U.K., Mexico and recently -- more recently launched in Korea and Taiwan. For the fourth quarter, sales and profits were up year-over-year. Total sales were up 12% in the quarter, 13% ex FX and for all of '16, 15% reported and plus 17% ex FX. On a comp basis, for the quarter, we were up 10% reported and 11% FX -- 11% excluding FX and for the year, 14% and 17%.
Next discussion in terms of expansion, as I mentioned, in terms of net new locations this year, we opened 29. That's up from 23 openings in all of '15. This current year, we've got in our budget 31 net openings. The 4 -- about 3 of them are relos and so something certainly in the high 20s and -- but I think something -- our current best guess is the 31. If you look back over the last couple of years, the 23 we opened in '15, that represented about a 3.5% square footage growth. In fiscal '16, the 29 units, recognizing they tend to be a little bigger and we've also expand a few units, it's about 4.5% square footage growth. And in '17, assuming we got to 31, that would be in the low to mid-4s as well in terms of percentage of square footage growth.
Our planned fiscal '17 locations, assuming the 31 number, would be 17 in the U.S.; 7 in Canada; and 1 each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico, France, our first in France, and also a unit in Iceland. And both France and Iceland are currently targeted for mid- to late spring -- late spring in calendar '17. And as we know, sometimes they slip, but that's our best guess at this point. Note again, this are first locations in France and Iceland, and we look forward to seeing something over there.
As of fourth quarter end, total square footage stood at 103.2 million square feet. In terms of common stock repurchases for the fourth quarter, we purchased $131 million worth of stock or 856,000 shares at an average price just over $153 a share. For all of fiscal '16, we purchased $477 million of stock. That compares to $493 million in 2015 and $333 million in 2014. In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share. We increased that this past spring a few months ago. That was 12.5% increase from the prior quarterly and annual rate. So this year at $0.45 a quarter, this yearly $1.80 a share dividend represents an annual cost to the company of just under $800 million.
Next Wednesday, October 5 at 6:00 p.m. Pacific time, we will announce our September sales results for the 5-week period ending Sunday, October 2, this coming Sunday. This 5-week period will include 34 selling days in the U.S. and Canada, recognizing the closing of our business in the observance of Labor Day in those 2 countries. Lastly, our fiscal '17 first quarter results, for the 12 weeks ending November 20, we will do it as we have done this time, we'll report after -- shortly after the market close on Wednesday, December 7 with the earnings call that afternoon at 2:00.
With that, Amanda, I'll turn it back to you for Q&A."

If you think back 5 or so years ago or even 10 years ago when we had probably 65, 70 units, we thought the market might be 90 1 day, and today, we have 90 or 91. And we think that they'll cert",700,"Well, first of all, in Canada, I think it's couple of reasons. If you think back 5 or so years ago or even 10 years ago when we had probably 65, 70 units, we thought the market might be 90 1 day, and today, we have 90 or 91. And we think that they'll certainly be over 100, and we keep adding a few to that concept. I think the fact that we're opening so many right now has to do as much with very strong sales over the last few years. We've been enjoying 5% to 8% -- 5% to 9% comps in local currency in each in the last few years up there. And so it keeps getting stronger. And just like in the U.S. and even in mature markets, we find that we can -- while there'll be some cannibalization, the net business that's added when we opened a unit, even though it's cannibalizing, net of cannibalization, we'll find that existing members will then be shopping more frequently because they're closer. And so I think it's a combination of those things. And I don't know what the new 5- or 10-year guesstimate is in Canada. I don't think we can open 7 a year, but once we decided to go to look and see where we're going and how strong we've been, we've -- this is the result of probably an effort that started over a year ago to put a few more in the pipeline up there. In terms of the U.S., I think the same story holds true. If you'd asked us 5 or so years ago by now how many would be in the U.S. versus outside the U.S., and we would have said probably we'd be down from 75% or 80% in the U.S. to 50%, and heading south of there is we saturate. We found in the U.S. that we can put more units in existing markets. I think we're getting -- in a couple of months, we're getting ready to open our 17th or so unit in the Puget Sound having opened our 16th or so unit just less than a year ago. And the other thing, of course, in the U.S. that I -- that we have perhaps up to the -- our expectation is markets that 5 or so years ago we didn't think we'd have any near-term interest in considering medium-sized markets where our direct competition -- the direct competition was there, and what we have found is we've done pretty well when we go to these markets. Now some of these markets are smaller. It takes a little longer, but there's clearly an opportunity for us there. And as we've gone into Tulsa and New Orleans and Birmingham and Rochester and lots of -- Toledo, these are markets that, again, weren't higher on the radar 7 or 8 years ago. And what we've seen is, is that our deal works. The last thing, of course, includes adding to some of the business centers. For many years, we only had 6 or 8 or so business centers. We opened 4 last year to be at 11, and we're planning to open 4 this year to be at 15, including our first business center in Canada. And so again, that just adds a few in the -- in both the Canada question and the U.S. question. It includes that opportunity on a small basis. And the side on that is, I think, as I mentioned, I think 2 of the 4 relos this year were -- 2 of the 4 business center openings this year were relos, 1 in -- back in many of your neck of the woods where we took an older, smaller parking lot, no gas station Hackensack Costco and relocated it to Teterboro nearby with a big-sized unit or lots of great parking, great ingress and egress and a gas station and converted the Hackensack unit into a -- into the business center. So just a small additional benefit in terms of having a use for units as we move some of those to bigger locations. So all that's, I think, been part of it."

We do all of those anyway. And I think probably the best, simplest answer is, is that just like when we buy a physical product better, lowered -- we can buy when there's lower freight, greater purchasing power or greater production efficiencies or whether we figure out with our supplier. We generally wanted 80% or 90% of that, the vast majority of it given back to the customer in terms of lower price because that's what drives us and drives our business. And if we do it more next year, we'll give 80% or 90% of that back. And it's not an exact number, but it's well closer to 80% or 90% than not. That same MO and philosophy occurred here. So when we sat down and negotiated all the various levers that relate to, what I call, this bucket of money, there's lots of ways one can use it, most importantly, by improving the reward on the card to the member that's going to utilize it. That'll drive value to that member and loyalty to us and also more business to us. And secondly, what's left over and when we originally did it, we did it such that we're going to keep a small amount of it. Now to the extent -- we're not going to change the rewards program every afternoon if we see that there's more money in the bucket, so that will additionally accrue to us. But it's not changing what we're doing with it. We're going to still do those other things. So again, I think, over time, we'll look at it, and you can rest assure to -- in a few years if the success of the card and the economics of the card to us, we're not going to allow ourselves to keep a lot of extra. But we started with a small amount of a big bucket is good, and it's a little better because the card's working in directions that we or even better than we expected. That's good. And we're still going to do those other things anyway."

And so that's the kind of stuff that hits your profitability, of course, too. There's -- if I look at -- there are some interesting things going on with some commodities. I was just looking at a chart. Coffee, the average -- these are average sale, but it's consistent with average cost, down 16%. A lot of things in the -- certain cheeses are down 10% to 20%. I believe eggs are way down right now. And so those things are all impacting you. Now it impacts you on selling eggs. It helps you a little bit in selling muffins because making not usually changing a 16 pack of muffins from making the numbers about what we sell them for, about $5.99 down to $5.89.

Across the board, we saw some bigger ticket purchases, which, again, that makes sense. People are waiting. Now there's all types of movement in both directions. You had existing -- a member with existing Visa cards in his or her wallet and maybe they're using that one, not ours, that's fine. We still have a negotiated good rate on certain things. You have people that were using debit their whole lives because they perhaps did not want an American Express card or they applied for one and did not get one. And so for 16 years, they used cash, check and debit. Now for the first time, they can use a credit card, and I'm sure that's where we saw many of these new sign-ups as well or part of them and -- but in terms of are they buying more with us, we -- anecdotally, we're hearing that from our warehouse managers who talk with their biggest wholesale customers.

I mean, arguably, there's probably 50 different factors that impact sales every day and every week and every month. And we look at -- try to look at the big picture here. We feel very good about what we're doing in merchandising-wise. We feel very good about what we've seen with the crossover to this. Our view has been we don't think that many people left Costco because they can't use their American Express card. American Express is a great brand, and it was a great relationship for many years. But the end of the day, they're coming to Costco because of our quality and our value. And when we look around -- and as you would well know, we get a lot of questions all the time, ""Well, are we impacted by the Internet, losing some?"" The Internet is taking from everybody. Our view is it takes a little less from us. And interestingly, when you look at the categories within our slightly lower sales over the last couple of months -- a few months, the categories that have bucked that trend have been discretionary nonfood categories like apparel and housewares and electronics. So now when we look at food and sundries, we absolutely do not believe it's delivery services. We do actually believe it's deflation more than anything. But again, everybody takes a little piece of something. It's a little piece that we would rather have ourselves or not lose. But again, we feel good about what we -- what issues we got going on. We think the -- and again, when I talk about the card being a 40 -- the new card being a reward to the member based on their previous spending habits, 40% to 50% greater reward, that's big. And when I talk about going from 1% to 2% on Costco purchases when they use that card, that's big. and -- but it does -- it's not big overnight where they just change their habits completely. And you'll see it first in business members, and that's where we have seen it. Mind you, there was some -- during the transition, there was probably a little loss of sales from some of those business numbers in some cases. I'm sure American Express didn't sit around not doing anything. They're good at what they do, and they were able to figure out how to get people. They're marketing elsewhere. But we think that our members at Costco, primarily for us -- I think, again, it's a lot of different things and different factors and, again, I -- having gone through our budget meeting forever but having gone every 4 weeks, just to name within the last few some of the initiatives I see going on merchandising-wise, I think we got a lot of good things going on.

So those 2 things alone were part of that. That's, frankly, I think one of the bigger things.

I was looking at my sheets here, hold on a second, and this is just year-over-year this past month. Walnuts are down 47%. That's our sell price. No, that's -- I'm sorry, that's our costs. Now a year ago, they had doubled from the prior year. So they're kind of back where they were. Almonds down 38%, whole eggs down 54%, large eggs down 53%. I'm just looking down the sheet at the top 50 items. So those things, particularly things like eggs, really add up. On the inflation page, just for fun, nothing -- well, I mean, there's some 20s and 30s, but if I look at the top 25 or so items, just in the last 4 weeks of the fiscal year, regular unleaded gasoline was down 12.8%. It was over $3.5 million of credit, if you will, to LIFO. We don't book it every month like that, but that would have been $3 million. So the biggest items on the deflation sheet adds to the LIFO credit of $2 million to $3.5 million, $2 million to $4 million. Biggest items on the inflationary sheet at $300,000 to $500,000 of LIFO charge. So again, it gives you a sense of where it's going. Yes, again, another data point is the U.S. inventories at LIFO. That's a U.S. accounting concept. I look at the indices where you start off from costs of the exact items at the beginning of fiscal '16 at 100.00 and where does it go to? Food and -- food is -- was down 2.75%, with half of that -- about 0.5% being just the last couple of months. Sundries was about down at less than 0.5% and not terribly changed in the last 3 months. Apparel, almost right at the same 100.00 a year ago, almost right there. Computers, you expect down a little under 2%. So it's all over the board. Again, so you have extreme categories like meat, which is high volume. But meat is also -- we turn it so much faster, and it has a higher churn. It turns, I would think, more than 50x -- more than 52x a year where if you have a -- that's a deflationary item. If you have an inflationary item that is turning 8x in non-foods, it's going to be a different story of how it impacts [indiscernible]."

I mean, we do that for a living daily and weekly, and they do it literally to their weekly comp shops in every market with direct warehouse comp [ph] competition. And certainly, in the fresh foods, people do more direct pricing competition on sale items at supermarkets, particularly on holiday, weekends and things like that, and soda pop. But at the end of the day, if anything, our view is the mote has continued to get bigger. In other words, our competitive position pricing-wise is as strong as -- is stronger than it's ever been, but we are not resting on that. We're constantly trying to figure out how to widen it. That's what we do. As it relates to guidance, we don't give guidance. The points of headwinds and tailwinds and anniversary of headwinds and tailwinds, things that I talked -- we talked about in the past, we're hopeful that just from a simple FX standpoint, for 2-plus years now, the dollar has strengthened year-over-year. So it was more than a 1-year anniversary. There's -- there was an inflection point of late, although nobody knows what tomorrow brings on that. But looks like it won't be as impactful negative -- to the negative. We got through the headwind of the conversion. That should be a net positive, but I think we'll be net positive in the next few years. And probably not easily calculable, but we'll figure that -- we'll try to figure that out. We know that we'll improve our SG&A, a component of what I'll call merchant and bank fees, in other words, things related to the new card offering. And again, we'll be more quantitative as we get through the next couple of quarters and it's more definable than just for 14 weeks. But again, it's good and we look forward to doing that. I mentioned the international membership fee increases in those certain areas. And that's -- again, that will improve over nearly a 2-year period by about $50 million pretax of the membership fee line. I imagine you'll see some of that offset on some of the margin line although not competitive -- to be more competitive but not reacting to competition. Trying to take the other things."

They're -- if it is your top of wallet, there are more places you can use it. That grows that small merchant. Who -- whoever card is being used at that small merchant, they pay a higher merchant fee. There is this whole equation of co-branding, and revenue share helps us. And so I believe we are already above what we were on the old card in terms of outside to inside spent. It's higher than it was after growing -- increasing it over a period of time, but we would have expected that. I -- we would have certainly hoped it, but we would have expected it. I don't think we necessarily knew what to expect to start with, and we're probably a little pleasantly surprised that it's already over that amount. And I think it will continue to grow and..."

And of course, over time, Amazon has picked up a lot, and there's not as many unique ones. We would have expected that. I mean, my family has an Amazon card, not a card, but an account. And although I don't let them buy a lot, no, just kidding. At the end of the day, we will expect that. The Internet, in general, is going to take its percentage of different categories. It's going to impact different categories and different retailers of such categories at different levels. I read the reports that some of you have written about that we and maybe 1 or 2 other retailers out there that are unique are Amazon-proof or Internet-proof. We don't buy that for a minute. We do believe that we do rely and we do expect we're going to be impacted less. We also don't believe we have to go crazy on the other side. We want -- but we want both. But our value proposition is best served for us when it's in-store getting members to come in and buying when they can see everything there that we have. And so we think that we can win on both cards. Have we lost a sale of something to an Internet provider out there, whether it's Amazon or someone else? I'm sure we have. Have we gained more often than not? Absolutely. As the whole media business, videos, CDs and books, many years later, books for us is a new normal, and it's still quite strong. Maybe it's 70% or 80% of what it used to be, but it's strong and growing. The other 2 have changed for a lot of reasons, including streaming. That being said, an area that a lot of traditional retailers are, again, fielding out there is apparel. We are now in our third year averaging, compounding over the 3 -- nearly 3.5-year period in the low to mid-teens. Probably the mid-teens, I don't have the numbers in front of me, and growing. And so -- and then I think on the fresh food side, we're glad that fresh is difficult. And we don't believe that everybody is going to just have everything delivered, but we're going to work hard to make sure that they want to come to see us.

I think for a long time, again, convenience wasn't a word we have thought about. There are certain things we're not prepared to do, again, sell smaller sizes and our pricing and have everything in the world available to you. Part [indiscernible] is what we do. I think going forward, even with millennials when -- our success in organic didn't start by 7 or 10 years ago us sitting around the table and saying, ""How are we going to go after this new generation with -- that want this stuff?"" We had -- we have great merchants and great operators in 8 different regions in the U.S. and elsewhere, and they are out there trying things. And every month is -- it got better, and in this case, the Bay Area region, their compatriots sough another -- tried some things in other regions. We turned around, and nobody can benefit as much and do it as big and as good as well as we do, and so I don't think we sat around strategically [ph] saying, ""How do we go after them?"" It evolved into that. Now that we're there, though, what else can we do for them? And whether it's food items or other things. We also worked -- our membership marketing people had done a study recently -- a presentation recently, and it showed whatever the previous generation was before, it was a gen whatever, and I know I'm one of those baby boomers, which is not a baby anymore. Our average age versus the U.S. population just in 3 or 4 years has come down to 2 years -- from a 4-year gap to a 2-year gap. Our goal is not necessarily to get it to a 0 gap. Our goal is to drive more business. But we look at the age group of millennials versus that same age group when the previous generation was that age. They're buying a little less but not a lot less. When we look at what we did, and these are, again, data points or sound bites, but what we did -- look what we did 2.5 years ago on LivingSocial, and now we have a full year of renewals on them. It was very interesting. Clearly, we would have expected more of those people to be millennials that signed up on that LivingSocial 10- or 12-day initiative that we did. And they -- and that was correct. What we were surprised at is that they actually shopped a little more frequently while a little less each time. But the aggregate of those 2, they bought more over that year, a little more, I mean, in the low single digits, but it was more. It didn't have a bracket around it. And they renewed at a slightly higher rate. Now the walk-in people that same months that had come in on their own to sign up, just walk in the counter, and the people that had walked in were, on average, a little older and about a 10 to 15 percentage point fewer penetration of millennials. And so that was encouraging to us. So while there are certainly extreme examples in New York, in the Bay Area and tech [ph], there's a lot of people that still aren't embarrassed to tell you that they shopped in-store. And we got to have a lot of reasons to get you there. I am also excited of what we see we're going to be doing on dot-com, but I'm not suggesting it's going to be trying to get your dinner there, delivered to your doorstep if you order by noon. That's not going to be us."

So -- and again, we -- over 90% of our members coming into a Costco buy our fresh food item. So they're coming there. Those are kind of things -- how do we get you in store? Because we get you in store, you're going to buy a lot more than you -- and we've seen that even with Google Express. That customer shopped a few less times in store, shopped several more times online as well, do both. They'll buy a little more over the course of the year, but they're buying a lot more each time when they go in store because they see all that stuff. And so that's what we kind of keep doing. I think the value thing, I would encourage to look at some of -- do your on own pricing study of exact like items, maybe you got to adjust for quantity because you got to buy 128 or something, 124 something instead of 24 or something. But at the end of the day, you'll be shocked shop difference in pricing, not just here. And so we think we got a lot of things going on for us.

Yes, I made a comment probably 6 months ago on one of these calls, in its own way, we think that this could be, in a way, a gift that keeps on giving. The value proposition of what we sell is great. Some of the new things that we've done merchandising-wise whether it's our ticket -- not our -- meaning the Costco tickets for events down in Southern California is a test. I'm talking about the ticketing programs that we have in-store, the ever-increasing quality of our fresh foods and what we've done in apparel. There's a lot of things going on that I think will help us. And again, I think the credit card -- the new value proposition is -- new value proposition will be one of them. When you think about the fact that effectively on virtually everything, you can get 4% off of Costco between -- if you're an executive member and use the co-branded Costco and Citi Visa Anywhere card. For a company that marks its goods up 10% or 12%, and I would think that we're considered one of them, we can buy pretty well and put our purchasing power in 3,700 items and only -- and then give you back up to 4% of that. That's a pretty good value, and we've seen that anecdotally in a big way already from businesses. And I think we'll continue to see it."

Today, we reported our fourth quarter and year-to-date fiscal '16 operating results for the 16- and 52-week periods ended this past August 28. For the quarter, earnings came in at $1.77 a share, up 2% or $0.04 over last year's fourth quarter earnings of $1.73 a share. 
In comparing the year-over-year fourth quarter earnings results, a couple of items of note in looking at the comparison. FX as compared to a year ago during the fourth quarter, foreign currencies in the countries and other areas where we operate were weaker overall versus the U.S. dollar primarily in Mexico, Canada, U.K. and Korea, this resulting in foreign -- in our foreign earnings in Q4 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $13 million after tax or $0.03 a share and had been -- exchange rate's been flat year-over-year. 
Gasoline profitability. Our profits from gasoline during the quarter as compared to last year's fourth quarter were lower by about $27 million pretax or $0.04 a share, primarily a function of last year's very strong profit results in the fourth quarter. Our numbers were fine this quarter, but we did pretty well last year as well.
IT modernization, that was about a $0.02 year-over-year impact. I'm not going to go through the detail on that, but that was about $60 million pretax or 4 basis points to the -- primarily to the SG&A line.
Income taxes. Both this year and last year's fourth quarter results had several positive -- net positive tax benefits that, in the aggregate, benefited each of the fourth quarter's earnings per share figures by $0.05. Excluding those positive tax items, this year's underlying Q4 tax rate was about 6/10 of a percentage point higher than last year's. That would have been about $0.02 a share, but again, year-over-year in the quarter, each of those fiscal quarters benefited by about $0.05 a share from positive items.
LIFO, last -- this year in the fourth quarter, we reported pretax LIFO credit of $31 million. That compares to last year in the fourth quarter of $14 million so both deflationary, although we've all talked about the increased levels of deflation of recent time. So the year-over-year delta's $17 million or about $0.02 a share related to higher deflation in LIFO credit in the quarter by -- higher by that amount.
In terms of sales for the fourth quarter, total reported sales were up 2%. Our 16-week reported comparable sales figures were flat year-over-year. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation. That was a little over 200 basis points of impact to the company and by weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, the latter about 1 percentage point of impact to sales. Excluding deflation, the flat U.S. comp sales figure for the fourth quarter would have been plus 2%. The reported Canadian comp figure of plus 2% would have been plus 5% ex gas and FX, and the reported minus 2% other international comp figure, ex these 2 factors, would have been plus 1%. Total comps were reported as 0 for the quarter and again, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 3%. And of course, the plus 3% adjusted figure is still being impacted by a bit of an increased general merchandise deflation outside of gasoline.
Openings in Q4. We opened 10 new locations and also completed 1 relo, and for the fiscal year, we opened 29 net new locations; on top of that, of 4 relocations, I believe 2 of them which were relocated in -- the old units converted into new business centers. Of the 29 locations, 21 were in the U.S.; 2 were in Canada; 2 were in Japan, and 1 each were in U.K., Taiwan, Australia and Spain.
This afternoon, I'll also review with you our membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussion about margin and SG&A, talk about e-commerce and a few other items of note, including an update on our recent switch to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. This occurred on June 20 after 6 weeks into the fourth quarter.
So onto the fourth quarter results quickly. Sales for the fourth quarter were $35.7 billion, up 2% from last year's fourth quarter sales of $35 billion, again, a flat comp on a reported basis, plus 3% excluding gas deflation and FX. The flat comp sales results on a reported basis, that consisted of an average transaction decrease of 2.8%. Again, excluding gas and FX deflation -- gas deflation and FX, the average transaction was slightly positive year-over-year and an average shopping frequency increase of right around 2.5%.
In terms of sales comparisons by geography, Texas, Bay Area and the Midwest regions within the United States showed the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Canada, Mexico, Spain and the U.K.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, sales for that within food and sundries, overall slightly negative year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Within that, though, spirits, sundries and deli came in best. Tobacco was the big negative, of course, as we've talked about that. That was down 21% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. If I look at the food and sundries category, that, again, on a comp basis, was slightly negative year-over-year for the quarter. Ex the tobacco department, it was plus 3. And you can see -- continue to see tobacco impacting us into the early spring.
Hardlines, overall up mid-single digit. The departments with the strong results were majors, electronics, sporting goods, health and beauty aids, hardware and tires. Within softlines, which was in the low single digits, apparel, small electrics and home furnishings were the standouts. Within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest of the 4 departments. Of course, meat has had a lot -- meat and other types of protein had a weakness relative to deflation. In ancillary businesses, hearing aids, pharmacy and optical showed the best results. 
I had mentioned earlier we recently seen a little pickup in the level of deflation overall. Some categories in the low to mid-single digits -- in the low- to mid-single-digit range and several fresh food categories, notably meat and pork and things like, in the 5% to 10% range in some cases. Overall, though, we're seeing a net increase in deflation but not in those levels and yes, some non-food levels as well -- non-food categories as well.
Moving to the line items on the income statement. Membership fees, we saw good results for the quarter. Reported were $832 million, up 9 basis points and $47 million or up 6% in dollars versus last year's fourth quarter. It would -- the $47 million would have been up $50 million if you would adjust it for FX.
In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 90% in U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide, a continuing increasing penetration of Executive Memberships as well. In terms of number of members at fourth quarter and year-end, at year-end, we had 36.8 million Gold Star members, up from 36.2 million 16 weeks earlier at the end of the third quarter. Primary Business ticked up to 7.3 million from 7.2 million. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million for a total of 47.6 million member households at Q4 end compared to 16 weeks earlier when it was 46.9 million. And including add-on cards in terms of people walking round with a Costco membership card in their wallet, 86.7 million at year-end, up from 85.5 million just 16 weeks earlier.
In terms of Executive Member sign-ups -- Executive Members we have -- of the 47.6 million member households, we have 17.4 million. That was an increase of 370,000 during the 16-week fourth quarter or about 23,000 a week increase. And that's a combination, of course, of new members signing up as an Executive Member as well as members converting to it. Members -- Executive Members now account for a little over 1/3 of our base and a little more than 2/3 of our sales, where Executive Membership -- Executive Members are offered.
In terms of membership renewal rates, we ended the year at 90.3% in the U.S. and Canada. That's ticked down from 90.4% at the end of Q3. In the first half, it was 90.5%; worldwide, 87.6%, which was the same at Q3 end, ticking down from 87.7% in the previous quarter, again, the second quarter.
As I've talked about in the last few quarters, in Canada, we finally, in Q4, saw a reversal of some reductions in renewal rates, which we had anticipated when we converted 1.5 years or so ago to a new program card up there. In that case, the portfolio from American Express wasn't purchased, so it was really had to start all over, and you don't have as many auto renewals to start with. But that's quickly changed, and we've -- again in Q4, we saw a slight increase in the renewal rate there. A little different reason but the same thing a little bit in the U.S. with having no new sign-ups for the last 9 months prior to June 20 as we were switching over on June 20. So overall, pretty much the same and we'll see where that goes from here.
Regarding membership fees, effective the beginning of this month, we increased membership fee -- annual membership fees by about 10% in 3 Asia locations, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, as well as in Mexico and the U.K. On an annual basis, as you know, fee increases hit the membership fee income line over about 23 months based on deferred accounting. For example, the first month, people that are seeing this in September, those are people that originally signed up presumably in September, and this is when they renew. People that don't -- didn't sign up or aren't renewing until next March, it'll be in March and for 12 months' end, so that's hence the 23 months overall. That will be about $50 million pretax to the membership income line. I'm sure there will be some offset in terms of what we do in terms of competitive pricing and everything.
Before continuing down the income statement line items, let me spend a minute updating you on our transition from American Express to Citi Visa in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. As I mentioned, this took place on June 20, the beginning of the seventh week into the fiscal fourth quarter. Beginning June 20, we stopped accepting American Express at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and on costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including, of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. There was a lot of effort, and as you know, there were a few operational glitches during the first few weeks after the cutover. We're now past that, and more importantly, the new card is fantastic for our members. In terms of increased cash back rewards, we estimate it's about a 40% to 50% improvement in the Reward program, which was already previously a very good reward program, to the members using the Citi Visa Anywhere card. And it's also great for us in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years and of course, lowering our effective cost of accepting credit and debit cards.
In terms of improved cash back member rewards, our former card provided a 3% cash back on gas, 2% on restaurant and travel, and 1% everywhere else, including everywhere at Costco other than the gas. With the new Citi Visa Anywhere card, 3% on gas now is 4%; 2% on restaurant and travel is now at 3%; and probably the most significant rewards improvement in terms of the total bucket here is the previous 1% reward on all other Costco purchases doubled from the previous 1% cash back reward now to 2%. We think this is big, and it's even bigger for our Executive Members who also earn a 2% Reward from us on most Costco purchases. So combined, an Executive Member using the new card with just a few exceptions will earn 4% back at Costco. We think that's exciting, and we think it'll be good for our business over the next several years. Now lastly for all other purchases outside of Costco on the card, it'll be -- it will remain at a 1% cash back reward.
A few basic stats on the new card. Approximately 11.4 million American Express co-branded cards, representing about 7 -- just under 7.5 million accounts, were transferred over to Citi during the conversion. Nearly 85% of those cards we considered active. That is the card had been used for purchases over the previous 60 days. Currently, over 85% of the accounts transferred over have now been activated with Costco. And since June 20 and just the past many weeks, 1.1 million members have applied for the new card and over 730,000 new accounts have been activated or a little over 1 million additional Citi Visa cards in circulation. It's still early. We launched only 14 weeks ago, but so far, we're beating our initial expectations in terms of conversion, usage and new sign-ups to the card.
In terms of gross margin, our reported gross margin was higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter by 28 basis points from -- up from 11.14% a year ago to 11.42%. Let you jot down the normal numbers that I asked you to jot down. We'll have 4 columns. Reported and without gas deflation Q3 '16 -- in Q3 '16 would be the first 2 columns. The third and fourth columns would both be Q4 '16 but then also reported without gas depreciation.
The core merchandise in Q3 on a reported basis was higher year-over-year by 16 basis points, but without gas deflation, down 2 basis points year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, up 29 basis points of this 16 and again, ex gas deflation, up 9 basis points. Ancillary businesses in Q3, plus 9 and plus 4 reported and without deflation. And in Q4 '16, ancillary businesses reported minus 4 and minus 9 without gas deflation.
2% Reward, 0 and a plus 2 in Q3 and a minus 2 and a 0 in Q4. LIFO, plus 2 and plus 2; and in Q4 '16, plus 4 and -- I'm sorry, plus 5 and plus 4. Other, in Q3 '16, both columns had a plus 7; and Q4, no issue, a 0 and 0. So all told and reported on a year-over-year basis in Q3 of '16 compared to the prior Q3, up 34 basis points on a reported basis and up 13 on a ex gas deflation basis. This year in the fourth quarter, of course, you saw the 28 basis point up. That would have been plus 4 ex gas deflation. I might add that the plus 7 a year ago, that was -- I'm sorry, in Q3, that was simply a onetime legal settlement that benefited margin.
As you can see, overall, again, our margin was higher by 28 but without gas, plus 4. The core merchandise component that you see -- that I've just mentioned, the plus 29 or the plus 9 ex gas deflation, putting our focus on to start with, our core gross margins, which is fresh foods -- food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the quarter by 12 basis points with food and sundries and hardlines showing higher year-over-year gross margins slightly, softlines being about flat year-over-year and fresh foods being ever so slightly down year-over-year.
Ancillary and other business gross margins were down 4 basis points, ex gas deflation, down 9, all a function of lower year-over-year gas prices -- gas profits. And as discussed earlier in the call -- but excluding gas, all other ancillary and other businesses' gross margins as a percent of their own sales were up 6 basis points. So margins were fine in the quarter overall. And again, LIFO added 4 basis points to the equation.
In terms of SG&A expenses, for the quarter year-over-year, we were up 34 basis points, coming in at 10.34 versus a 10.00 a year ago. And again, that 34, I'll have you jot down a couple of numbers, that 34 ex gas deflation is a minus 13 -- or higher by 13, not higher by 84. Again, the same 4 columns, Q3 '16 for reported and Q3 '16 for without gas and the same 2 column headings for Q4 '16 (sic) [Q3 '16] and Q4 '16.
Operation, core operations, minus 24 basis points, and a minus means higher, higher by 24 basis points in Q3 '16 on a reported basis, higher by 8 ex gas deflation; in the fourth quarter, higher by 24 and higher by 6; central, higher by 6 and higher by 4 in Q3; and then Q4, higher by 9 and higher by 7 ex gas deflation. Stock compensation, higher by 3 and higher by 2 in third quarter; and higher by 1 and flat in the Q4 columns. Then total, reported in Q3 '16 compared to Q3 '15 on a reported basis, SG&A was higher by 33 but really higher by 14 ex gas deflation, and the higher by 34 this time was higher by 13, so not that different on looking at it that way.
The operations component, the minus 6 core operations ex gas deflation, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits partly due to the slightly weaker sales and the deflation and particularly in fresh that impacts that number, somewhat offset by a variety of other controllable expense improvements, in particular lower year-over-year bank fees as a result of the Amex-Citi Visa switch during the quarter.
Central expense was higher year-over-year by 9; 7 ex gas. Increased IT spending related to modernization, that was 4 of those 7, and a couple other basis points higher from a few small legal settlements in the quarter. And again, stock compensation was really not an issue year-over-year.
Next on the income statement, preopening, pretty much in line with openings themselves. Last year, we had $27 million preopening expense. This year, it's $3 million lower or $24 million. Last year in the quarter, we had 13 openings. This year in the quarter, we had 11 and which includes that relo, pretty much in line again with what we've expected -- would expect.
All told, operating income in the fourth quarter came in at $1,191,000,000, which is $35 million higher or 3% higher year-over-year than last year's $1,156,000 -- $1,156,000,000. Below the operating income line, interest expense in the fourth quarter came in at $39 million this year versus $40 million last year, essentially flat year-over-year, essentially the same amount of debt outstanding at the various interest rates. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $11 million in the quarter, coming in at $29 million versus $40 million a year ago. Actual interest income was higher year-over-year by -- I'm sorry, was a little lower year-over-year. The big difference was the other category, which was $15 million, primarily various FX transactions. This year in the fourth quarter, if I added up all the various FX, which is marking to market items and FX from foreign exchange contracts, we made about $11 million pretax a year ago. It was a little outsized. We made $26 million. That generally fluctuates. Usually, it's plus or minus $5 million. Sometimes it's a little more or less.
Overall, pretax income was higher by 2% or $25 million higher, coming in at $1,181,000,000. 
In terms of taxes, I mentioned that earlier, both fiscal fourth quarters this year and last year each benefited by about $0.05 a share from various positive items, and excluding these items, the normalized rate this year was still up about 6/10 of a percent from a year earlier. And again, net income coming in at $779 million for the fiscal quarter was up 2% from a year ago.
A quick rundown of some other topics in this afternoon's release. We have provided you balance sheet information. One thing you'll -- that is not on the balance sheet that I'm always asked about is depreciation and amortization. For the fourth quarter, that came in at $408 million; and for the entire fiscal year, D&A came in at $1,255,000,000 million. 
One thing that I'll -- looked perhaps a little odd on the balance sheet was cash levels and accounts payable and the like. That has to do with modernization and switching our basic accounting platform over, and this has been a 2-plus-year effort. It was installed, and it's really the platform that a lot of the legacy systems will now sit on as we continue to develop them over the next couple of years. Not only was a big effort, it was an expensive effort. But nonetheless, to make sure that we had an extra week at the beginning since this -- soon as the system went in on day 1, we -- anything that was set up in the system, any merchandise or other payables that were set up in our system would be paid in -- during week 1 of the new fiscal year, we prepaid a week early the prior -- up to a week early, the prior Friday I believe. And so we paid about $1.7 billion extra in week 52 of this past fiscal year, and that's why you see -- you'll see the cash levels down and the payables levels down associated with that.
So again, one of those statistics we always share with you is accounts payable as a percent of inventory. Last year, fourth quarter end on a reported basis was 101%. What you'll see now, it's 85%, but again, taking out that $1.7 billion, it's 104%, actually a slight improvement in our payables ratio. And excluding construction payables and other types of non-merchandise payables, last year was at 89%, again on what I'll call a normalized basis, assuming we hadn't prepaid $1.7 billion of payables, the 89% would have been about a couple percentage points to 91%, so manage -- seem to be managing that okay.
In terms of average inventory per warehouse, last year fourth quarter end, it stood at exactly $13 million per warehouse. This year, it was -- came in at 12 -- just slightly over $12.5 million or about $460,000 lower or 3% lower. And really lower per warehouse inventory is pretty much spread across many categories, including the impact of deflation in many of the food and fresh departments as well as electronics. A little bit of it has to do with FX, but most of it is just coming down a little bit on inventory levels.
In terms of CapEx, in Q4, we spent approximately $850 million, and for all of fiscal '16, we came in right at $2.6 billion. That $2.6 billion, by the way, compares to $2.4 billion for the prior year fiscal year in '15. Our estimate for fiscal '17 CapEx is in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion so about the same level as compared to last year, perhaps a little higher, depends on timing.
Next, Costco Online. We're currently in the United States, Canada, U.K., Mexico and recently -- more recently launched in Korea and Taiwan. For the fourth quarter, sales and profits were up year-over-year. Total sales were up 12% in the quarter, 13% ex FX and for all of '16, 15% reported and plus 17% ex FX. On a comp basis, for the quarter, we were up 10% reported and 11% FX -- 11% excluding FX; and for the year, 14% and 17%.
Next discussion in terms of expansion, as I mentioned, in terms of net new locations this year, we opened 29. That's up from 23 openings in all of '15. This current year, we've got in our budget 31 net openings, 4 -- but 3 of them are relos and so something certainly in the high 20s and -- but I think something -- our current best guess is the 31. If you look back over the last couple of years, the 23 we opened in '15, that represented about a 3.5% square footage growth. In fiscal '16, the 29 units, recognizing they tend to be a little bigger and we've also expand a few units, it's about 4.5% square footage growth. And in '17, assuming we got to 31, that would be in the low to mid-4s as well in terms of percentage of square footage growth.
Our planned fiscal '17 locations, assuming the 31 number, would be 17 in the U.S.; 7 in Canada; and 1 each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico, France, our first in France, and also a unit in Iceland. And both France and Iceland are currently targeted for mid- to late spring -- late spring in calendar '17. And as we know, sometimes these may slip, but that's our best guess at this point. Note again that these are first locations in France and Iceland, and we look forward to seeing some of you over there. As of fourth quarter end, total square footage stood at 103.2 million square feet. 
In terms of common stock repurchases for the fourth quarter, we purchased $131 million worth of stock or 856,000 shares at an average price just over $153 a share. For all of fiscal '16, we purchased $477 million of stock. That compares to $493 million in 2015 and $333 million in 2014. 
In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share. We increased that this past spring a few months ago. That was 12.5% increase from the prior quarterly and annual rate. So this year at $0.45 a quarter, this yearly $1.80 a share dividend represents an annual cost to the company of just under $800 million.
Next Wednesday, October 5 at 6:00 p.m. Pacific time, we will announce our September sales results for the 5-week period ending Sunday, October 2, this coming Sunday. This 5-week period will include 34 selling days in the U.S. and Canada, recognizing the closing of our business in the observance of Labor Day in those 2 countries. 
Lastly, our fiscal '17 first quarter results, for the 12 weeks ending November 20, we will do it as we have done this time; we'll report after -- shortly after the market close on Wednesday, December 7, with the earnings call that afternoon at 2:00.
With that, Amanda, I'll turn it back to you for Q&A."

If you think back 5 or so years ago or even 10 years ago when we had probably 65, 70 units, we thought the market might be 90 one day, and today, we have 90 or 91. And we think that it'll ce",699,"Well, first of all, in Canada, I think it's a couple of reasons. If you think back 5 or so years ago or even 10 years ago when we had probably 65, 70 units, we thought the market might be 90 one day, and today, we have 90 or 91. And we think that it'll certainly be over 100, and we keep adding a few to that concept. I think the fact that we're opening so many right now has to do as much with very strong sales over the last few years. We've been enjoying 5% to 8% -- 5% to 9% comps in local currency in each of the last few years up there. And so it keeps getting stronger. And just like in the U.S. and even in mature markets, we find that we can -- while there'll be some cannibalization, the net business that's added when we open a unit, even though it's cannibalizing, net of cannibalization, we'll find that existing members will then be shopping more frequently because they're closer. And so I think it's a combination of those things. And I don't know what the new 5- or 10-year guesstimate is in Canada. I don't think we can open 7 a year, but once we decided to go to look and see where we're going and how strong we've been, we've -- this is the result of probably an effort that started over a year ago to put a few more in the pipeline up there. In terms of the U.S., I think the same story holds true. If you'd asked us 5 or so years ago by now how many would be in the U.S. versus outside the U.S., and we would have said probably we'd be down from 75% or 80% in the U.S. to 50%, and heading south of there is we saturate. We've found in the U.S. that we can put more units in existing markets. I think we're getting -- in a couple of months, we're getting ready to open our 17th or so unit in the Puget Sound having opened our 16th or so unit just less than a year ago. And the other thing, of course, in the U.S. that I -- that we have perhaps upped the -- our expectation is markets that 5 or so years ago we didn't think we'd have any near-term interest in considering, medium-sized markets where our direct competition -- or the direct competition was there, and what we've found is we've done pretty well when we go to these markets. Now some of these markets are smaller. It takes a little longer, but there's clearly an opportunity for us there. And as we've gone into Tulsa and New Orleans and Birmingham and Rochester and lots of -- Toledo, these are markets that, again, weren't higher on the radar 7 or 8 years ago. And what we've seen is, is that our deal works. The last thing, of course, includes adding to some of the business centers. For many years, we only had 6 or 8 or so business centers. We opened 4 last year to be at 11, and we're planning to open 4 this year to be at 15, including our first business center in Canada. And so again, that just adds a few in the -- in both the Canada question and the U.S. question. It includes that opportunity on a small basis. And aside on that is, I think, as I mentioned, I think 2 of the 4 relos this year were -- 2 of the 4 business center openings this year were relos, 1 in -- back in many of your neck of the woods where we took an older, smaller parking lot, no gas station Hackensack Costco and relocated it to Teterboro nearby with a big-sized unit or lots of great parking, great ingress and egress and a gas station and converted the Hackensack unit into a -- into the business center. So just a small additional benefit in terms of having a use for units as we move some of those to bigger locations. So all that's, I think, been part of it."

We do all of those anyway. And I think that probably the best, simplest answer is, is that just like when we buy a physical product better, lowered -- whether it's lower freight, greater purchasing power or greater production efficiencies or whether we figure out with our supplier, we generally wanted 80% or 90% of that, the vast majority of it, give it back to the customer in terms of lower price because that's what drives us and drives our business. And if we do it more next year, we'll give 80% or 90% of that back. And it's not an exact number, but it's well closer to 80% or 90% than not. That same MO and philosophy occurred here. So when we sat down and negotiated all the various levers that relate to, what I call, this bucket of money, there's lots of ways one can use it, most importantly, by improving the reward on the card to the member that's going to utilize it. And that'll drive value to that member and loyalty to us and also more business to us. And secondly, what's left over and when we originally did it, we did it such that we're going to keep a small amount of it. Now to the extent -- we're not going to change the rewards program every afternoon if we see that there's more money in the bucket, so that will additionally accrue to us. But it's not changing what we're doing with it. We're going to still do those other things. So again, I think, over time, we'll look at it, and you can rest assured in a few years if the success of the card and the economics of the card to us, we're not going to allow ourselves to keep a lot of that extra. But we start with a small amount of a big bucket is good, and if it's a little better because the card's working in directions that we -- or even better than we expected, that's good. And we're still going to do those other things anyway."

And so that's the kind of stuff that hits your profitability, of course, too. There's -- if I look at it, there are some interesting things going on with some commodities. I was just looking at a chart. Coffee, the average -- these are average sale, but it's consistent with average cost, down 16%. A lot of things in the -- certain cheeses are down 10% to 20%. I believe eggs are way down right now. And so those things are all impacting you. Now it impacts you on selling eggs. It helps you a little bit in selling muffins because we're not just really changing a 16 pack of muffins from -- I'm making the numbers up, I don't know what we sell them for, about $5.99 down to $5.89.

You have people that were using debit their whole lives because they perhaps did not want an American Express card or they applied for one and did not get one. And so for 16 years, they used cash, check and debit.

I mean, arguably, there's probably 50 different factors that impact sales every day and every week and every month. And we look at -- try to look at the big picture here. We feel very good about what we're doing in merchandising-wise. We feel very good about what we've seen with the crossover to this. Our view has been we don't think that many people left Costco because they can't use their American Express card. American Express is a great brand, and it was a great relationship for many years. But at the end of the day, they're coming to Costco because of our quality and our value. And when we looked around -- and as you would well know, we get a lot of questions all the time, ""Well, are we impacted by the Internet, losing some?"" The Internet is taking from everybody. Our view is it takes a little less from us. And interestingly, when you look at the categories within our slightly lower sales over the last couple of month -- a few months, the categories that have bucked that trend have been discretionary nonfood categories like apparel and housewares and electronics. So now when we look at food and sundries, we absolutely do not believe it's delivery services. We do actually believe it's deflation more than anything. But again, everybody takes a little piece of something. It's a little piece that we would rather have ourselves or not lose. But again, we feel good about what we -- what issues we got going on. We think the -- and again, when I talk about the card being a 40 -- the new card being a reward to the member based on their previous spending habits, 40% to 50% greater reward, that's big. And when I talk about going from 1% to 2% on Costco purchases when they use that card, that's big. And -- but it does -- it's not big overnight where they just change their habits completely. And you'll see it first in business members, and that's where we have seen it. Mind you, there was some -- during the transition, there was probably a little loss of sales from some of those business numbers in some cases. I'm sure American Express didn't sit around not doing anything. They're good at what they do, and they were able to figure out how to get people. They're marketing elsewhere. But we think that our members at Costco, primarily for us, I think, again, it's a lot of different things and different factors and, again, I -- having gone through our budget meeting forever but having gone every 4 weeks, just -- and even in the last few, some of the initiatives I see going on merchandising-wise, I think we got a lot of good things going on.

And I think again, though, I'm -- when I look at some of the things that we're doing internally, and I'm not trying to be cute here, but there's certain things I can't talk about yet, you will see some differences, and mostly the differences are from an offensive standpoint, not a defensive standpoint.

But there were 2 things last year in electronics that were big, that didn't -- the iPhone 6 launch last year was huge, and the iPhone 7 launch is not as huge. And the other thing is last year was the introduction of the Windows 10 and there are 2 things. Prior to a year-ago comparison, a few months prior to that, people were waiting for the Windows 10 launch. And so you had a lot of pent-up demand and the launch itself and compared to a year later. So those 2 things alone were part of that. That's, frankly, I think one of the bigger things. But again, I think as I've said jokingly and half-seriously and half-jokingly in the past, some of the things that we haven't done historically has -- gives us a great opportunity to do these. And there's some -- still some blocking and tackling like a couple of things that I just mentioned. We have greatly improved our delivery, but it was from bad to better. It still takes too long. And again, we're not going to get something to you in 2 hours, but you're going to see some -- logistically some things. And on handling returns, particularly big ticket returns, we haven't done a good job of that and that's already in process. And so you'll see some changes that will help. The biggest thing, though, is going to be the merchandise initiatives. And again, I think you're going to see we have added items and we are adding some items, but we're not trying to figure out, what, 20,000 additional items because that's not what we're going to do. But there'll be velocity items or repetitive items in the sundries area as well. And you're right, when you look on your radar screen, price is not way up there. But I challenge anybody on the call to compare the exact branded items and a big basket of them, not just an occasional loss leader or something, some retailer or a dot-com may have out there. You're going to see it's -- yes, it's more -- it's a lot -- it's savings here, but you'll be shocked how much savings. And again, we recognize also we've got to move a little direction, and we're doing that."

I was looking at my sheets here, hold on a second, and this is just year-over-year this past month. Walnuts are down 47%. That's our sell price. No, that's -- I'm sorry, that's our cost. Now a year ago, they had doubled from the prior year. So they're kind of back where they were. Almonds, down 38%; whole eggs, down 54%; large eggs, down 53%. I'm just looking down the sheet at the top 50 items. So those things, particularly things like eggs, really add up. On the inflation page, just for fun, nothing -- well, I mean, there's some 20s and 30s, but if I look at the top 25 or so items, just in the last 4 weeks of the fiscal year, regular unleaded gasoline was down 12.8% and was over $3.5 million of credit, if you will, to LIFO. We don't book it every month like that, but that would have been $3 million. So the biggest items on the deflation sheet add to the LIFO credit of $2 million to $3.5 million, $2 million to $4 million. Biggest items on the inflationary sheet add $300,000 to $500,000 of LIFO charge. So again, it gives you a sense of where it's going. Yes, again, another data point is the U.S. inventories at LIFO. That's a U.S. accounting concept. I look at the indices where you start off for costs on the exact items at the beginning of fiscal '16 at 100.00 and where does it go to? Food and -- food is -- was down 2.25%, with half of that -- about 0.5% being just the last couple of months. Sundries was about down at less than 0.5% and not terribly changed in the last 3 months. Apparel, almost right at the same, 100.00 a year ago, almost right there. Computers, as you expect, down a little under 2%. So it's all over the board. Again, so you have extreme categories like meat, which is high volume. But meat is also -- we turn it so much faster, and it has a higher churn. It turns, I would think, more than 50x -- more than 52x a year where if you have a -- that's a deflationary item. If you have an inflationary item that is turning 8x in non-foods, it's going to be a different story of how it impacts the numbers."

I mean, we do that for a living daily and weekly, and they do it literally to their weekly comp shops in every market with direct warehouse competition. And certainly, in the fresh foods, people do more direct pricing competition on sale items at supermarkets, particularly on holiday, weekends and things like that, and soda pop. But at the end of the day, if anything, our view is the moat has continued to get bigger. In other words, our competitive position pricing-wise is as strong as -- is stronger than it's ever been, but we are not resting on that. We're constantly trying to figure out how to widen it. That's what we do. As it relates to guidance, we don't give guidance. The points of headwinds and tailwinds and anniversary-ing of headwinds and tailwinds, things that I talked -- we talked about in the past, we're hopeful that just from a simple FX standpoint, for 2-plus years now, the dollar has strengthened year-over-year. So it was more than a 1-year anniversary. There's -- there was an inflection point of late, although nobody knows what tomorrow brings on that. But it looks like it won't be as impactful negative -- to the negative. We got through the headwind of the conversion. That should be a net positive, but I think it'll be net positive over the next few years and probably not easily calculable, but we'll figure that and we'll try to figure that out. We know that we'll improve our SG&A, a component of what I'll call merchant and bank fees, in other words, things related to the new card offering. And again, we'll be more quantitative as we get through the next couple of quarters and it's more definable than just for 14 weeks. But again, it's good and we look forward to doing that. I mentioned the international membership fee increases in those certain areas. And that's -- again, that will improve over nearly a 2-year period by about $50 million pretax to the membership fee line. I imagine you'll see some of that offset on some of the margin line although not from a competitive -- to be more competitive but not reacting to competition. Trying to think are there other things."

And of course, over time, Amazon has picked up a lot, and there's not as many unique ones. We would have expected that. I mean, my family has an Amazon card -- or not a card, but an account and -- although I don't let them buy a lot. No, just kidding. At the end of the day, we would expect that. The Internet, in general, is going to take its percentage of different categories. It's going to impact different categories and different retailers of such categories at different levels. I read the reports that some of you have written about that we and maybe 1 or 2 other retailers out there that are unique are Amazon-proof or Internet-proof. We don't buy that for a minute. We do believe that we do rely and we do expect we're going to be impacted less. We also don't believe we have to go crazy on the other side. We want -- but we want both. But our value proposition is best served for us when it's in-store, getting members to come in and buying when they can see everything there that we have. And so we think that we can win on both cards. Have we lost a sale of something to an Internet provider out there, whether it's Amazon or someone else? I'm sure we have. Have we gained more often than not? Absolutely. As the whole media business, videos, CDs and books, many years later, books for us is a new normal, and it's still quite strong. Maybe it's 70% or 80% of what it used to be, but it's strong and growing. The other 2 have changed for a lot of reasons, including streaming. That being said, an area that a lot of traditional retailers are getting killed in out there is apparel. We are now in our third year averaging, compounding over the 3 -- nearly 3.5-year period in the low to mid-teens. Probably the mid-teens, I don't have the numbers in front of me, and growing. And so -- and then I think on the fresh food side, we're glad that fresh is difficult. And we don't believe that everybody is going to just have everything delivered, but we're going to work hard to make sure that they want to come to see us.

I think for a long time, again, convenience wasn't a word we have thought about. There are certain things we're not prepared to do, again, sell smaller sizes and our pricing and have everything in the world available to you. Part of our strength is what we do. I think going forward, even with millennials when -- our success in organic didn't start by 7 or 10 years ago us sitting around the table and saying, ""How are we going to go after this new generation with -- that want this stuff?"" We had -- we have great merchants and great operators in 8 different regions in the U.S. and elsewhere, and they are out there trying things. And every month is -- it got better, and in this case, the Bay Area region, their compatriots sought another -- tried some things in other regions. We turned around, and nobody can benefit as much and do it in as big and as good, as well as we do, and so I don't think we sat around strategically saying, ""How do we go after them?"" It evolved into that. Now that we're there, though, what else can we do for them? And whether it's food items or other things. We also worked -- our membership marketing people had done a study recently -- a presentation recently, and it showed whatever the previous generation was before it was a gen-whatever, and I know I'm one of those baby boomers, which is not a baby anymore. Our average age versus the U.S. population just in 3 or 4 years has come down 2 -- 2 years -- from a 4-year gap to a 2-year gap. Our goal is not necessarily to get it to a 0 gap. Our goal is to drive more business. When we look at the age group of millennials versus that same age group when the previous generation was that age, they're buying a little less but not a lot less. When we look at what we did, and these are, again, data points or sound bites, but what we did -- look what we did 2.5 years ago on LivingSocial, and now we have a full year of renewals on them. It was very interesting. Clearly, we would have expected more of those people to be millennials that signed up on that LivingSocial 10- or 12-day initiative that we did. And they -- and that was correct. What we were surprised at is that they actually shopped a little more frequently, bought a little less each time. But the aggregate of those 2, they bought more over that year, a little more, I mean, in the low single digits, but it was more. It didn't have a bracket around it. And they renewed at a slightly higher rate. Now, then the walk-in people that same month that had come in on their own to sign up, just walk in the counter, and the people that had walked in were, on average, a little older and about a 10 to 15 percentage point fewer penetration of millennials. And so that was encouraging to us. So while there are certainly extreme examples in New York, in the Bay Area and Texas, there's a lot of people that still aren't embarrassed to tell you that they shopped in-store. And we got to have a lot of reasons to get you there. I am also excited of what we see we're going to be doing on dot-com, but I'm not suggesting it's going to be trying to get your dinner there, delivered to your doorstep if you order by noon. That's not going to be us."

So -- and again, we -- over 90% of our members coming into a Costco buy a fresh food item. So they're coming there. Those are kind of things -- how do we get you in store? Because we get you in store, you're going to buy a lot more than you -- and we've seen that even with Google Express. That customer will shop a few less times in store, shop several more times online as well, do both. They'll buy a little more over the course of the year, but they're buying a lot more each time when they go in store because they see all that stuff. And so that's what we got to keep doing. I think the value thing, I would encourage to look at some of -- do your own pricing study of exact like items, maybe you got to adjust for quantity because you got to buy 128 of something, 124 of something instead of 24 or something. But at the end of the day, you'll be shocked the difference in pricing, not just here. And so we think we've got a lot of things going on for us.

Yes, I made a comment probably 6 months ago on one of these calls, in its own way, we think that this could be, in a way, a gift that keeps on giving. The value proposition of what we sell is great. Some of the new things that we've done merchandising-wise whether it's our ticket -- and I don't mean in the Costco tickets for events; down in Southern California was a test. I'm talking about the ticketing programs that we have in-store, the ever-increasing quality of our fresh foods and what we've done in apparel. There's a lot of things going on that I think will help us. And again, I think the credit card -- the new value proposition is -- new value proposition will be one of them. When you think about the fact that effectively on virtually everything, you can get 4% off of Costco between -- if you're an Executive Member and use the co-branded Costco and Citi Visa Anywhere card. For a company that marks its goods up 10% or 12%, and I would think that we're considered one that -- we can buy pretty well and put our purchasing power in 3,700 items and only -- and then give you back up to 4% of that, that's a pretty good value.

Today, we reported our fourth quarter and year-to-date fiscal '16 operating results for the 16- and 52-week periods ended this past August 28. For the quarter, earnings came in at $1.77 a share, up 2% or $0.04 over last year's fourth quarter earnings of $1.73 a share. 
In comparing the year-over-year fourth quarter earnings results, a couple of items of note in looking at the comparison. FX as compared to a year ago during the fourth quarter, foreign currencies in the countries and other areas where we operate were weaker overall versus the U.S. dollar primarily in Mexico, Canada, U.K. and Korea, this resulting in foreign -- in our foreign earnings in Q4 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $13 million after tax or $0.03 a share and had been -- exchange rate's been flat year-over-year. 
Gasoline profitability. Our profits from gasoline during the quarter as compared to last year's fourth quarter were lower by about $27 million pretax or $0.04 a share, primarily a function of last year's very strong profit results in the fourth quarter. Our numbers were fine this quarter, but we did pretty well last year as well.
IT modernization, that was about a $0.02 year-over-year impact. I'm not going to go through the detail on that, but that was about $60 million pretax or 4 basis points to the -- primarily to the SG&A line.
Income taxes. Both this year and last year's fourth quarter results had several positive -- net positive tax benefits that, in the aggregate, benefited each of the fourth quarter's earnings per share figures by $0.05. Excluding those positive tax items, this year's underlying Q4 tax rate was about 6/10 of a percentage point higher than last year's. That would have been about $0.02 a share, but again, year-over-year in the quarter, each of those fiscal quarters benefited by about $0.05 a share from positive items.
LIFO, last -- this year in the fourth quarter, we reported pretax LIFO credit of $31 million. That compares to last year in the fourth quarter of $14 million so both deflationary, although we've all talked about the increased levels of deflation of recent time. So the year-over-year delta's $17 million or about $0.02 a share related to higher deflation in LIFO credit in the quarter by -- higher by that amount.
In terms of sales for the fourth quarter, total reported sales were up 2%. Our 16-week reported comparable sales figures were flat year-over-year. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation. That was a little over 200 basis points of impact to the company and by weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, the latter about 1 percentage point of impact to sales. Excluding deflation, the flat U.S. comp sales figure for the fourth quarter would have been plus 2%. The reported Canadian comp figure of plus 2% would have been plus 5% ex gas and FX, and the reported minus 2% other international comp figure, ex these 2 factors, would have been plus 1%. Total comps were reported as 0 for the quarter and again, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 3%. And of course, the plus 3% adjusted figure is still being impacted by a bit of an increased general merchandise deflation outside of gasoline.
Openings in Q4. We opened 10 new locations and also completed 1 relo, and for the fiscal year, we opened 29 net new locations; on top of that, of 4 relocations, I believe 2 of them which were relocated in -- the old units converted into new business centers. Of the 29 locations, 21 were in the U.S.; 2 were in Canada; 2 were in Japan, and 1 each were in U.K., Taiwan, Australia and Spain.
This afternoon, I'll also review with you our membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussion about margin and SG&A, talk about e-commerce and a few other items of note, including an update on our recent switch to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. This occurred on June 20 after 6 weeks into the fourth quarter.
So onto the fourth quarter results quickly. Sales for the fourth quarter were $35.7 billion, up 2% from last year's fourth quarter sales of $35 billion, again, a flat comp on a reported basis, plus 3% excluding gas deflation and FX. The flat comp sales results on a reported basis, that consisted of an average transaction decrease of 2.8%. Again, excluding gas and FX deflation -- gas deflation and FX, the average transaction was slightly positive year-over-year and an average shopping frequency increase of right around 2.5%.
In terms of sales comparisons by geography, Texas, Bay Area and the Midwest regions within the United States showed the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Canada, Mexico, Spain and the U.K.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, sales for that within food and sundries, overall slightly negative year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Within that, though, spirits, sundries and deli came in best. Tobacco was the big negative, of course, as we've talked about that. That was down 21% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. If I look at the food and sundries category, that, again, on a comp basis, was slightly negative year-over-year for the quarter. Ex the tobacco department, it was plus 3. And you can see -- continue to see tobacco impacting us into the early spring.
Hardlines, overall up mid-single digit. The departments with the strong results were majors, electronics, sporting goods, health and beauty aids, hardware and tires. Within softlines, which was in the low single digits, apparel, small electrics and home furnishings were the standouts. Within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest of the 4 departments. Of course, meat has had a lot -- meat and other types of protein had a weakness relative to deflation. In ancillary businesses, hearing aids, pharmacy and optical showed the best results. 
I had mentioned earlier we recently seen a little pickup in the level of deflation overall. Some categories in the low to mid-single digits -- in the low- to mid-single-digit range and several fresh food categories, notably meat and pork and things like, in the 5% to 10% range in some cases. Overall, though, we're seeing a net increase in deflation but not in those levels and yes, some non-food levels as well -- non-food categories as well.
Moving to the line items on the income statement. Membership fees, we saw good results for the quarter. Reported were $832 million, up 9 basis points and $47 million or up 6% in dollars versus last year's fourth quarter. It would -- the $47 million would have been up $50 million if you would adjust it for FX.
In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 90% in U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide, a continuing increasing penetration of Executive Memberships as well. In terms of number of members at fourth quarter and year-end, at year-end, we had 36.8 million Gold Star members, up from 36.2 million 16 weeks earlier at the end of the third quarter. Primary Business ticked up to 7.3 million from 7.2 million. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million for a total of 47.6 million member households at Q4 end compared to 16 weeks earlier when it was 46.9 million. And including add-on cards in terms of people walking round with a Costco membership card in their wallet, 86.7 million at year-end, up from 85.5 million just 16 weeks earlier.
In terms of Executive Member sign-ups -- Executive Members we have -- of the 47.6 million member households, we have 17.4 million. That was an increase of 370,000 during the 16-week fourth quarter or about 23,000 a week increase. And that's a combination, of course, of new members signing up as an Executive Member as well as members converting to it. Members -- Executive Members now account for a little over 1/3 of our base and a little more than 2/3 of our sales, where Executive Membership -- Executive Members are offered.
In terms of membership renewal rates, we ended the year at 90.3% in the U.S. and Canada. That's ticked down from 90.4% at the end of Q3. In the first half, it was 90.5%; worldwide, 87.6%, which was the same at Q3 end, ticking down from 87.7% in the previous quarter, again, the second quarter.
As I've talked about in the last few quarters, in Canada, we finally, in Q4, saw a reversal of some reductions in renewal rates, which we had anticipated when we converted 1.5 years or so ago to a new program card up there. In that case, the portfolio from American Express wasn't purchased, so it was really had to start all over, and you don't have as many auto renewals to start with. But that's quickly changed, and we've -- again in Q4, we saw a slight increase in the renewal rate there. A little different reason but the same thing a little bit in the U.S. with having no new sign-ups for the last 9 months prior to June 20 as we were switching over on June 20. So overall, pretty much the same and we'll see where that goes from here.
Regarding membership fees, effective the beginning of this month, we increased membership fee -- annual membership fees by about 10% in 3 Asia locations, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, as well as in Mexico and the U.K. On an annual basis, as you know, fee increases hit the membership fee income line over about 23 months based on deferred accounting. For example, the first month, people that are seeing this in September, those are people that originally signed up presumably in September, and this is when they renew. People that don't -- didn't sign up or aren't renewing until next March, it'll be in March and for 12 months' end, so that's hence the 23 months overall. That will be about $50 million pretax to the membership income line. I'm sure there will be some offset in terms of what we do in terms of competitive pricing and everything.
Before continuing down the income statement line items, let me spend a minute updating you on our transition from American Express to Citi Visa in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. As I mentioned, this took place on June 20, the beginning of the seventh week into the fiscal fourth quarter. Beginning June 20, we stopped accepting American Express at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and on costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including, of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. There was a lot of effort, and as you know, there were a few operational glitches during the first few weeks after the cutover. We're now past that, and more importantly, the new card is fantastic for our members. In terms of increased cash back rewards, we estimate it's about a 40% to 50% improvement in the Reward program, which was already previously a very good reward program, to the members using the Citi Visa Anywhere card. And it's also great for us in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years and of course, lowering our effective cost of accepting credit and debit cards.
In terms of improved cash back member rewards, our former card provided a 3% cash back on gas, 2% on restaurant and travel, and 1% everywhere else, including everywhere at Costco other than the gas. With the new Citi Visa Anywhere card, 3% on gas now is 4%; 2% on restaurant and travel is now at 3%; and probably the most significant rewards improvement in terms of the total bucket here is the previous 1% reward on all other Costco purchases doubled from the previous 1% cash back reward now to 2%. We think this is big, and it's even bigger for our Executive Members who also earn a 2% Reward from us on most Costco purchases. So combined, an Executive Member using the new card with just a few exceptions will earn 4% back at Costco. We think that's exciting, and we think it'll be good for our business over the next several years. Now lastly for all other purchases outside of Costco on the card, it'll be -- it will remain at a 1% cash back reward.
A few basic stats on the new card. Approximately 11.4 million American Express co-branded cards, representing about 7 -- just under 7.5 million accounts, were transferred over to Citi during the conversion. Nearly 85% of those cards we considered active. That is the card had been used for purchases over the previous 60 days. Currently, over 85% of the accounts transferred over have now been activated with Costco. And since June 20 and just the past many weeks, 1.1 million members have applied for the new card and over 730,000 new accounts have been activated or a little over 1 million additional Citi Visa cards in circulation. It's still early. We launched only 14 weeks ago, but so far, we're beating our initial expectations in terms of conversion, usage and new sign-ups to the card.
In terms of gross margin, our reported gross margin was higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter by 28 basis points from -- up from 11.14% a year ago to 11.42%. Let you jot down the normal numbers that I asked you to jot down. We'll have 4 columns. Reported and without gas deflation Q3 '16 -- in Q3 '16 would be the first 2 columns. The third and fourth columns would both be Q4 '16 but then also reported without gas depreciation.
The core merchandise in Q3 on a reported basis was higher year-over-year by 16 basis points, but without gas deflation, down 2 basis points year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, up 29 basis points of this 16 and again, ex gas deflation, up 9 basis points. Ancillary businesses in Q3, plus 9 and plus 4 reported and without deflation. And in Q4 '16, ancillary businesses reported minus 4 and minus 9 without gas deflation.
2% Reward, 0 and a plus 2 in Q3 and a minus 2 and a 0 in Q4. LIFO, plus 2 and plus 2; and in Q4 '16, plus 4 and -- I'm sorry, plus 5 and plus 4. Other, in Q3 '16, both columns had a plus 7; and Q4, no issue, a 0 and 0. So all told and reported on a year-over-year basis in Q3 of '16 compared to the prior Q3, up 34 basis points on a reported basis and up 13 on a ex gas deflation basis. This year in the fourth quarter, of course, you saw the 28 basis point up. That would have been plus 4 ex gas deflation. I might add that the plus 7 a year ago, that was -- I'm sorry, in Q3, that was simply a onetime legal settlement that benefited margin.
As you can see, overall, again, our margin was higher by 28 but without gas, plus 4. The core merchandise component that you see -- that I've just mentioned, the plus 29 or the plus 9 ex gas deflation, putting our focus on to start with, our core gross margins, which is fresh foods -- food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the quarter by 12 basis points with food and sundries and hardlines showing higher year-over-year gross margins slightly, softlines being about flat year-over-year and fresh foods being ever so slightly down year-over-year.
Ancillary and other business gross margins were down 4 basis points, ex gas deflation, down 9, all a function of lower year-over-year gas prices -- gas profits. And as discussed earlier in the call -- but excluding gas, all other ancillary and other businesses' gross margins as a percent of their own sales were up 6 basis points. So margins were fine in the quarter overall. And again, LIFO added 4 basis points to the equation.
In terms of SG&A expenses, for the quarter year-over-year, we were up 34 basis points, coming in at 10.34 versus a 10.00 a year ago. And again, that 34, I'll have you jot down a couple of numbers, that 34 ex gas deflation is a minus 13 -- or higher by 13, not higher by 84. Again, the same 4 columns, Q3 '16 for reported and Q3 '16 for without gas and the same 2 column headings for Q4 '16 (sic) [Q3 '16] and Q4 '16.
Operation, core operations, minus 24 basis points, and a minus means higher, higher by 24 basis points in Q3 '16 on a reported basis, higher by 8 ex gas deflation; in the fourth quarter, higher by 24 and higher by 6; central, higher by 6 and higher by 4 in Q3; and then Q4, higher by 9 and higher by 7 ex gas deflation. Stock compensation, higher by 3 and higher by 2 in third quarter; and higher by 1 and flat in the Q4 columns. Then total, reported in Q3 '16 compared to Q3 '15 on a reported basis, SG&A was higher by 33 but really higher by 14 ex gas deflation, and the higher by 34 this time was higher by 13, so not that different on looking at it that way.
The operations component, the minus 6 core operations ex gas deflation, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits partly due to the slightly weaker sales and the deflation and particularly in fresh that impacts that number, somewhat offset by a variety of other controllable expense improvements, in particular lower year-over-year bank fees as a result of the Amex-Citi Visa switch during the quarter.
Central expense was higher year-over-year by 9; 7 ex gas. Increased IT spending related to modernization, that was 4 of those 7, and a couple other basis points higher from a few small legal settlements in the quarter. And again, stock compensation was really not an issue year-over-year.
Next on the income statement, preopening, pretty much in line with openings themselves. Last year, we had $27 million preopening expense. This year, it's $3 million lower or $24 million. Last year in the quarter, we had 13 openings. This year in the quarter, we had 11 and which includes that relo, pretty much in line again with what we've expected -- would expect.
All told, operating income in the fourth quarter came in at $1,191,000,000, which is $35 million higher or 3% higher year-over-year than last year's $1,156,000 -- $1,156,000,000. Below the operating income line, interest expense in the fourth quarter came in at $39 million this year versus $40 million last year, essentially flat year-over-year, essentially the same amount of debt outstanding at the various interest rates. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $11 million in the quarter, coming in at $29 million versus $40 million a year ago. Actual interest income was higher year-over-year by -- I'm sorry, was a little lower year-over-year. The big difference was the other category, which was $15 million, primarily various FX transactions. This year in the fourth quarter, if I added up all the various FX, which is marking to market items and FX from foreign exchange contracts, we made about $11 million pretax a year ago. It was a little outsized. We made $26 million. That generally fluctuates. Usually, it's plus or minus $5 million. Sometimes it's a little more or less.
Overall, pretax income was higher by 2% or $25 million higher, coming in at $1,181,000,000. 
In terms of taxes, I mentioned that earlier, both fiscal fourth quarters this year and last year each benefited by about $0.05 a share from various positive items, and excluding these items, the normalized rate this year was still up about 6/10 of a percent from a year earlier. And again, net income coming in at $779 million for the fiscal quarter was up 2% from a year ago.
A quick rundown of some other topics in this afternoon's release. We have provided you balance sheet information. One thing you'll -- that is not on the balance sheet that I'm always asked about is depreciation and amortization. For the fourth quarter, that came in at $408 million; and for the entire fiscal year, D&A came in at $1,255,000,000 million. 
One thing that I'll -- looked perhaps a little odd on the balance sheet was cash levels and accounts payable and the like. That has to do with modernization and switching our basic accounting platform over, and this has been a 2-plus-year effort. It was installed, and it's really the platform that a lot of the legacy systems will now sit on as we continue to develop them over the next couple of years. Not only was a big effort, it was an expensive effort. But nonetheless, to make sure that we had an extra week at the beginning since this -- soon as the system went in on day 1, we -- anything that was set up in the system, any merchandise or other payables that were set up in our system would be paid in -- during week 1 of the new fiscal year, we prepaid a week early the prior -- up to a week early, the prior Friday I believe. And so we paid about $1.7 billion extra in week 52 of this past fiscal year, and that's why you see -- you'll see the cash levels down and the payables levels down associated with that.
So again, one of those statistics we always share with you is accounts payable as a percent of inventory. Last year, fourth quarter end on a reported basis was 101%. What you'll see now, it's 85%, but again, taking out that $1.7 billion, it's 104%, actually a slight improvement in our payables ratio. And excluding construction payables and other types of non-merchandise payables, last year was at 89%, again on what I'll call a normalized basis, assuming we hadn't prepaid $1.7 billion of payables, the 89% would have been about a couple percentage points to 91%, so manage -- seem to be managing that okay.
In terms of average inventory per warehouse, last year fourth quarter end, it stood at exactly $13 million per warehouse. This year, it was -- came in at 12 -- just slightly over $12.5 million or about $460,000 lower or 3% lower. And really lower per warehouse inventory is pretty much spread across many categories, including the impact of deflation in many of the food and fresh departments as well as electronics. A little bit of it has to do with FX, but most of it is just coming down a little bit on inventory levels.
In terms of CapEx, in Q4, we spent approximately $850 million, and for all of fiscal '16, we came in right at $2.6 billion. That $2.6 billion, by the way, compares to $2.4 billion for the prior year fiscal year in '15. Our estimate for fiscal '17 CapEx is in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion so about the same level as compared to last year, perhaps a little higher, depends on timing.
Next, Costco Online. We're currently in the United States, Canada, U.K., Mexico and recently -- more recently launched in Korea and Taiwan. For the fourth quarter, sales and profits were up year-over-year. Total sales were up 12% in the quarter, 13% ex FX and for all of '16, 15% reported and plus 17% ex FX. On a comp basis, for the quarter, we were up 10% reported and 11% FX -- 11% excluding FX; and for the year, 14% and 17%.
Next discussion in terms of expansion, as I mentioned, in terms of net new locations this year, we opened 29. That's up from 23 openings in all of '15. This current year, we've got in our budget 31 net openings, 4 -- but 3 of them are relos and so something certainly in the high 20s and -- but I think something -- our current best guess is the 31. If you look back over the last couple of years, the 23 we opened in '15, that represented about a 3.5% square footage growth. In fiscal '16, the 29 units, recognizing they tend to be a little bigger and we've also expand a few units, it's about 4.5% square footage growth. And in '17, assuming we got to 31, that would be in the low to mid-4s as well in terms of percentage of square footage growth.
Our planned fiscal '17 locations, assuming the 31 number, would be 17 in the U.S.; 7 in Canada; and 1 each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico, France, our first in France, and also a unit in Iceland. And both France and Iceland are currently targeted for mid- to late spring -- late spring in calendar '17. And as we know, sometimes these may slip, but that's our best guess at this point. Note again that these are first locations in France and Iceland, and we look forward to seeing some of you over there. As of fourth quarter end, total square footage stood at 103.2 million square feet. 
In terms of common stock repurchases for the fourth quarter, we purchased $131 million worth of stock or 856,000 shares at an average price just over $153 a share. For all of fiscal '16, we purchased $477 million of stock. That compares to $493 million in 2015 and $333 million in 2014. 
In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share. We increased that this past spring a few months ago. That was 12.5% increase from the prior quarterly and annual rate. So this year at $0.45 a quarter, this yearly $1.80 a share dividend represents an annual cost to the company of just under $800 million.
Next Wednesday, October 5 at 6:00 p.m. Pacific time, we will announce our September sales results for the 5-week period ending Sunday, October 2, this coming Sunday. This 5-week period will include 34 selling days in the U.S. and Canada, recognizing the closing of our business in the observance of Labor Day in those 2 countries. 
Lastly, our fiscal '17 first quarter results, for the 12 weeks ending November 20, we will do it as we have done this time; we'll report after -- shortly after the market close on Wednesday, December 7, with the earnings call that afternoon at 2:00.

If you think back 5 or so years ago or even 10 years ago when we had probably 65, 70 units, we thought the market might be 90 one day, and today, we have 90 or 91. And we think that it'll ce",699,"Well, first of all, in Canada, I think it's a couple of reasons. If you think back 5 or so years ago or even 10 years ago when we had probably 65, 70 units, we thought the market might be 90 one day, and today, we have 90 or 91. And we think that it'll certainly be over 100, and we keep adding a few to that concept. I think the fact that we're opening so many right now has to do as much with very strong sales over the last few years. We've been enjoying 5% to 8% -- 5% to 9% comps in local currency in each of the last few years up there. And so it keeps getting stronger. And just like in the U.S. and even in mature markets, we find that we can -- while there'll be some cannibalization, the net business that's added when we open a unit, even though it's cannibalizing, net of cannibalization, we'll find that existing members will then be shopping more frequently because they're closer. And so I think it's a combination of those things. And I don't know what the new 5- or 10-year guesstimate is in Canada. I don't think we can open 7 a year, but once we decided to go to look and see where we're going and how strong we've been, we've -- this is the result of probably an effort that started over a year ago to put a few more in the pipeline up there. In terms of the U.S., I think the same story holds true. If you'd asked us 5 or so years ago by now how many would be in the U.S. versus outside the U.S., and we would have said probably we'd be down from 75% or 80% in the U.S. to 50%, and heading south of there is we saturate. We've found in the U.S. that we can put more units in existing markets. I think we're getting -- in a couple of months, we're getting ready to open our 17th or so unit in the Puget Sound having opened our 16th or so unit just less than a year ago. And the other thing, of course, in the U.S. that I -- that we have perhaps upped the -- our expectation is markets that 5 or so years ago we didn't think we'd have any near-term interest in considering, medium-sized markets where our direct competition -- or the direct competition was there, and what we've found is we've done pretty well when we go to these markets. Now some of these markets are smaller. It takes a little longer, but there's clearly an opportunity for us there. And as we've gone into Tulsa and New Orleans and Birmingham and Rochester and lots of -- Toledo, these are markets that, again, weren't higher on the radar 7 or 8 years ago. And what we've seen is, is that our deal works. The last thing, of course, includes adding to some of the business centers. For many years, we only had 6 or 8 or so business centers. We opened 4 last year to be at 11, and we're planning to open 4 this year to be at 15, including our first business center in Canada. And so again, that just adds a few in the -- in both the Canada question and the U.S. question. It includes that opportunity on a small basis. And aside on that is, I think, as I mentioned, I think 2 of the 4 relos this year were -- 2 of the 4 business center openings this year were relos, 1 in -- back in many of your neck of the woods where we took an older, smaller parking lot, no gas station Hackensack Costco and relocated it to Teterboro nearby with a big-sized unit or lots of great parking, great ingress and egress and a gas station and converted the Hackensack unit into a -- into the business center. So just a small additional benefit in terms of having a use for units as we move some of those to bigger locations. So all that's, I think, been part of it."

We do all of those anyway. And I think that probably the best, simplest answer is, is that just like when we buy a physical product better, lowered -- whether it's lower freight, greater purchasing power or greater production efficiencies or whether we figure out with our supplier, we generally wanted 80% or 90% of that, the vast majority of it, give it back to the customer in terms of lower price because that's what drives us and drives our business. And if we do it more next year, we'll give 80% or 90% of that back. And it's not an exact number, but it's well closer to 80% or 90% than not. That same MO and philosophy occurred here. So when we sat down and negotiated all the various levers that relate to, what I call, this bucket of money, there's lots of ways one can use it, most importantly, by improving the reward on the card to the member that's going to utilize it. And that'll drive value to that member and loyalty to us and also more business to us. And secondly, what's left over and when we originally did it, we did it such that we're going to keep a small amount of it. Now to the extent -- we're not going to change the rewards program every afternoon if we see that there's more money in the bucket, so that will additionally accrue to us. But it's not changing what we're doing with it. We're going to still do those other things. So again, I think, over time, we'll look at it, and you can rest assured in a few years if the success of the card and the economics of the card to us, we're not going to allow ourselves to keep a lot of that extra. But we start with a small amount of a big bucket is good, and if it's a little better because the card's working in directions that we -- or even better than we expected, that's good. And we're still going to do those other things anyway."

And so that's the kind of stuff that hits your profitability, of course, too. There's -- if I look at it, there are some interesting things going on with some commodities. I was just looking at a chart. Coffee, the average -- these are average sale, but it's consistent with average cost, down 16%. A lot of things in the -- certain cheeses are down 10% to 20%. I believe eggs are way down right now. And so those things are all impacting you. Now it impacts you on selling eggs.

I mean, arguably, there's probably 50 different factors that impact sales every day and every week and every month. And we look at -- try to look at the big picture here. We feel very good about what we're doing in merchandising-wise. We feel very good about what we've seen with the crossover to this. Our view has been we don't think that many people left Costco because they can't use their American Express card. American Express is a great brand, and it was a great relationship for many years. But at the end of the day, they're coming to Costco because of our quality and our value. And when we looked around -- and as you would well know, we get a lot of questions all the time, ""Well, are we impacted by the Internet, losing some?"" The Internet is taking from everybody. Our view is it takes a little less from us. And interestingly, when you look at the categories within our slightly lower sales over the last couple of month -- a few months, the categories that have bucked that trend have been discretionary nonfood categories like apparel and housewares and electronics. So now when we look at food and sundries, we absolutely do not believe it's delivery services. We do actually believe it's deflation more than anything. But again, everybody takes a little piece of something. It's a little piece that we would rather have ourselves or not lose. But again, we feel good about what we -- what issues we got going on. We think the -- and again, when I talk about the card being a 40 -- the new card being a reward to the member based on their previous spending habits, 40% to 50% greater reward, that's big. And when I talk about going from 1% to 2% on Costco purchases when they use that card, that's big. And -- but it does -- it's not big overnight where they just change their habits completely. And you'll see it first in business members, and that's where we have seen it. Mind you, there was some -- during the transition, there was probably a little loss of sales from some of those business numbers in some cases. I'm sure American Express didn't sit around not doing anything. They're good at what they do, and they were able to figure out how to get people. They're marketing elsewhere. But we think that our members at Costco, primarily for us, I think, again, it's a lot of different things and different factors and, again, I -- having gone through our budget meeting forever but having gone every 4 weeks, just -- and even in the last few, some of the initiatives I see going on merchandising-wise, I think we got a lot of good things going on. Not that we're trying to solve a problem from yesterday, it's what we do every day."

Prior to a year-ago comparison, a few months prior to that, people were waiting for the Windows 10 launch. And so you had a lot of pent-up demand and the launch itself and compared to a year later. So those 2 things alone were part of that. That's, frankly, I think one of the bigger things. But again, I think as I've said jokingly and half-seriously and half-jokingly in the past, some of the things that we haven't done historically has -- gives us a great opportunity to do these. And there's some -- still some blocking and tackling like a couple of things that I just mentioned. We have greatly improved our delivery, but it was from bad to better. It still takes too long.

I was looking at my sheets here, hold on a second, and this is just year-over-year this past month. Walnuts are down 47%. That's our sell price. No, that's -- I'm sorry, that's our cost. Now a year ago, they had doubled from the prior year. So they're kind of back where they were. Almonds, down 38%; whole eggs, down 54%; large eggs, down 53%. I'm just looking down the sheet at the top 50 items. So those things, particularly things like eggs, really add up. On the inflation page, just for fun, nothing -- well, I mean, there's some 20s and 30s, but if I look at the top 25 or so items, just in the last 4 weeks of the fiscal year, regular unleaded gasoline was down 12.8% and was over $3.5 million of credit, if you will, to LIFO. We don't book it every month like that, but that would have been $3 million. So the biggest items on the deflation sheet add to the LIFO credit of $2 million to $3.5 million, $2 million to $4 million. Biggest items on the inflationary sheet add $300,000 to $500,000 of LIFO charge. So again, it gives you a sense of where it's going. Yes, again, another data point is the U.S. inventories at LIFO. That's a U.S. accounting concept. I look at the indices where you start off for costs on the exact items at the beginning of fiscal '16 at 100.00 and where does it go to? Food and -- food is -- was down 2.25%, with half of that -- about 0.5% being just the last couple of months. Sundries was about down at less than 0.5% and not terribly changed in the last 3 months. Apparel, almost right at the same, 100.00 a year ago, almost right there. Computers, as you expect, down a little under 2%. So it's all over the board. Again, so you have extreme categories like meat, which is high volume. But meat is also -- we turn it so much faster, and it has a higher churn. It turns, I would think, more than 50x -- more than 52x a year where if you have a -- that's a deflationary item. If you have an inflationary item that is turning 8x in non-foods, it's going to be a different story of how it impacts the numbers."

And certa",393,"Well, these -- first of all, as it relates to competitive reaction, the answer is really no. I mean, we do that for a living daily and weekly, and they do it literally to their weekly comp shops in every market with direct warehouse competition. And certainly, in the fresh foods, people do more direct pricing competition on sale items at supermarkets, particularly on holiday, weekends and things like that, and soda pop. But at the end of the day, if anything, our view is the moat has continued to get bigger. In other words, our competitive position pricing-wise is as strong as -- is stronger than it's ever been, but we are not resting on that. We're constantly trying to figure out how to widen it. That's what we do. As it relates to guidance, we don't give guidance. The points of headwinds and tailwinds and anniversary-ing of headwinds and tailwinds, things that I talked -- we talked about in the past, we're hopeful that just from a simple FX standpoint, for 2-plus years now, the dollar has strengthened year-over-year. So it was more than a 1-year anniversary. There's -- there was an inflection point of late, although nobody knows what tomorrow brings on that. But it looks like it won't be as impactful negative -- to the negative. We got through the headwind of the conversion. That should be a net positive, but I think it'll be net positive over the next few years and probably not easily calculable, but we'll figure that and we'll try to figure that out. We know that we'll improve our SG&A, a component of what I'll call merchant and bank fees, in other words, things related to the new card offering. And again, we'll be more quantitative as we get through the next couple of quarters and it's more definable than just for 14 weeks. But again, it's good and we look forward to doing that. I mentioned the international membership fee increases in those certain areas. And that's -- again, that will improve over nearly a 2-year period by about $50 million pretax to the membership fee line. I imagine you'll see some of that offset on some of the margin line although not from a competitive -- to be more competitive but not reacting to competition. Trying to think are there other things."

We have lots of little things that are positive for us that continue to drive value whether it's pharmacy, optical, hearing aid or whether it's Costco Travel. These are all things -- these are all -- our ticketing program in the warehouse. A new program which is brand new, we're just testing it in Southern California with Ticketmaster. You can go to Costcotickets.com and check it out. But again, some real savings on high-end stuff, and so there's a lot of things we're doing. We seem to have gotten some breakthroughs on the cosmetic side with SK-II. We hope that brings on others. But clearly, given some of the challenges that brick and mortar in that area are impacted by, we can sell the heck out of that stuff and provide great value to our members. And it's the kind of member that these -- we believe that these manufacturers want. Now talking to myself, I talk myself into it. We got to talk to them into it. In terms of gas stations, and hearing, we continue to add gas stations and hearing aids not just in exist -- to new locations but to existing locations.

And of course, over time, Amazon has picked up a lot, and there's not as many unique ones. We would have expected that. I mean, my family has an Amazon card -- or not a card, but an account and -- although I don't let them buy a lot. No, just kidding. At the end of the day, we would expect that. The Internet, in general, is going to take its percentage of different categories. It's going to impact different categories and different retailers of such categories at different levels. I read the reports that some of you have written about that we and maybe 1 or 2 other retailers out there that are unique are Amazon-proof or Internet-proof. We don't buy that for a minute. We do believe that we do rely and we do expect we're going to be impacted less. We also don't believe we have to go crazy on the other side. We want -- but we want both. But our value proposition is best served for us when it's in-store, getting members to come in and buying when they can see everything there that we have. And so we think that we can win on both cards. Have we lost a sale of something to an Internet provider out there, whether it's Amazon or someone else? I'm sure we have. Have we gained more often than not? Absolutely. As the whole media business, videos, CDs and books, many years later, books for us is a new normal, and it's still quite strong. Maybe it's 70% or 80% of what it used to be, but it's strong and growing. The other 2 have changed for a lot of reasons, including streaming. That being said, an area that a lot of traditional retailers are getting killed in out there is apparel. We are now in our third year averaging, compounding over the 3 -- nearly 3.5-year period in the low to mid-teens. Probably the mid-teens, I don't have the numbers in front of me, and growing. And so -- and then I think on the fresh food side, we're glad that fresh is difficult.

I think for a long time, again, convenience wasn't a word we have thought about. There are certain things we're not prepared to do, again, sell smaller sizes and our pricing and have everything in the world available to you. Part of our strength is what we do. I think going forward, even with millennials when -- our success in organic didn't start by 7 or 10 years ago us sitting around the table and saying, ""How are we going to go after this new generation with -- that want this stuff?"" We had -- we have great merchants and great operators in 8 different regions in the U.S. and elsewhere, and they are out there trying things. And every month is -- it got better, and in this case, the Bay Area region, their compatriots sought another -- tried some things in other regions. We turned around, and nobody can benefit as much and do it in as big and as good, as well as we do, and so I don't think we sat around strategically saying, ""How do we go after them?"" It evolved into that. Now that we're there, though, what else can we do for them? And whether it's food items or other things. We also worked -- our membership marketing people had done a study recently -- a presentation recently, and it showed whatever the previous generation was before it was a gen-whatever, and I know I'm one of those baby boomers, which is not a baby anymore. Our average age versus the U.S. population just in 3 or 4 years has come down 2 -- 2 years -- from a 4-year gap to a 2-year gap. Our goal is not necessarily to get it to a 0 gap. Our goal is to drive more business. When we look at the age group of millennials versus that same age group when the previous generation was that age, they're buying a little less but not a lot less. When we look at what we did, and these are, again, data points or sound bites, but what we did -- look what we did 2.5 years ago on LivingSocial, and now we have a full year of renewals on them. It was very interesting. Clearly, we would have expected more of those people to be millennials that signed up on that LivingSocial 10- or 12-day initiative that we did. And they -- and that was correct. What we were surprised at is that they actually shopped a little more frequently, bought a little less each time. But the aggregate of those 2, they bought more over that year, a little more, I mean, in the low single digits, but it was more. It didn't have a bracket around it. And they renewed at a slightly higher rate. Now, then the walk-in people that same month that had come in on their own to sign up, just walk in the counter, and the people that had walked in were, on average, a little older and about a 10 to 15 percentage point fewer penetration of millennials. And so that was encouraging to us. So while there are certainly extreme examples in New York, in the Bay Area and Texas, there's a lot of people that still aren't embarrassed to tell you that they shopped in-store. And we got to have a lot of reasons to get you there. I am also excited of what we see we're going to be doing on dot-com, but I'm not suggesting it's going to be trying to get your dinner there, delivered to your doorstep if you order by noon. That's not going to be us."

It's small but I think being able to sell directly SK-II and selling a heck of a lot of it in terms of the total marketing of that product, and people are talking about it. So -- and again, we -- over 90% of our members coming into a Costco buy a fresh food item. So they're coming there. Those are kind of things -- how do we get you in store? Because we get you in store, you're going to buy a lot more than you -- and we've seen that even with Google Express. That customer will shop a few less times in store, shop several more times online as well, do both. They'll buy a little more over the course of the year, but they're buying a lot more each time when they go in store because they see all that stuff. And so that's what we got to keep doing. I think the value thing, I would encourage to look at some of -- do your own pricing study of exact like items, maybe you got to adjust for quantity because you got to buy 128 of something, 124 of something instead of 24 or something. But at the end of the day, you'll be shocked the difference in pricing, not just here. And so we think we've got a lot of things going on for us.

But clearly, we feel good about what we're doing in store and what we're going to continue to do to drive that business."

There will be additional initiatives like there were for 16 years, whether it's tabling activities or other marketing pieces that we'll continue to do. Yes, I made a comment probably 6 months ago on one of these calls, in its own way, we think that this could be, in a way, a gift that keeps on giving. The value proposition of what we sell is great. Some of the new things that we've done merchandising-wise whether it's our ticket -- and I don't mean in the Costco tickets for events; down in Southern California was a test. I'm talking about the ticketing programs that we have in-store, the ever-increasing quality of our fresh foods and what we've done in apparel. There's a lot of things going on that I think will help us. And again, I think the credit card -- the new value proposition is -- new value proposition will be one of them. When you think about the fact that effectively on virtually everything, you can get 4% off of Costco between -- if you're an Executive Member and use the co-branded Costco and Citi Visa Anywhere card. For a company that marks its goods up 10% or 12%, and I would think that we're considered one that -- we can buy pretty well and put our purchasing power in 3,700 items and only -- and then give you back up to 4% of that, that's a pretty good value. And we've seen that anecdotally in a big way already from businesses. And I think we'll continue to see it."

For the 12-week fiscal first quarter that ended 2 weeks ago, Sunday, this past Sunday, earnings came in at $1.24 a share, up 14% or $0.15 a share over last year's earning -- reported earnings per share of $1.09. A few items to point out as was mentioned in today's release. This year's first quarter benefited from a non-recurring $51 million legal settlement. This $51 million pretax figure represented a 19 basis point benefit to gross margin and a benefit to first quarter's earnings per share of $0.07 a share.
Last year in the first quarter, there were 2 non-recurring items that we mentioned that, together, negatively impacted last year's earnings results. In that quarter, we recorded a $22 million pretax charge, which represented an 8 basis point impact to SG&A to the negative and a reduction in last year's first quarter earnings of $0.04 a share.
Stock compensation expense was 13% or $25 million higher year-over-year, so $0.04 a share more. There are about 4,800 people in -- of our employees that received restrictive stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October in our fiscal first quarter and then typically vest over a 5-year period with accelerated vesting when the recipient reaches 25, 30 and 35 years of employment with the company. Factors driving this increase included additional levels of accelerated vesting given the rising number of our employees achieving long tenure with the company; an increased stock price with a 5-year-ago grant coming off when the -- coming off with [indiscernible] when the stock price was in the $80s to last year's grant when the stock price was in the $150s; and of course, having a larger number of employees to the [ph] plan. Note that the $25 million year-over-year increase in Q1 is larger -- is a larger year-over-year dollar increase than we'd expect to record in each of the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters of this year given the October RSU grant cycle.
Next, gas profitability. Our profits from gas during the quarter as compared to last year's first quarter were lower by about $20 million pretax or $0.03 a share, primarily a function of last year's very strong profit results in the first quarter for gas.
Fifth, IT costs. These expenses negatively impacted SG&A in the first quarter on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $18 million or 5 basis points to SG&A, which is about $0.025 a share.
And lastly, when I get to the discussion on year-over-year gross margin and SG&A comparisons, I'll review with you the very positive impact that our new Citi Visa deal has had on margins, SG&A and of course, our bottom line.
Turning to the first quarter sales. Total reported sales were up 3%, and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure on a reported basis came in at 1% year-over-year. Comp sales were negatively impacted by weaker FX relative to the U.S. dollar and slightly impacted by gas price deflation for a combined negative impact to the reported account number of about 0.75% [ph] of sales. Excluding gas deflation, the reported 1% U.S. comp figure for Q1 remained at 1%. The reported Canadian comp figure of plus 4% would have been plus 5% ex gas deflation and FX. And the reported 0 other international comp figure, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 3%. Total comps reported 1% for the quarter, again, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 2%. And of course, this plus 2% total company adjusted figure is also being impacted by increases in deflation and other merchandising categories overall, primarily in food and hardline -- foods and hardlines.
In terms of new openings, in the first quarter, we opened 9 new locations, which included 1 relo so a net increase of 8. And later in the call, I'll discuss our upcoming expansion plans for the balance of the fiscal year. This afternoon, I'll also touch on membership trends and renewal rates, again, discuss margins and SG&A in Q1, update on the Citi Visa, the new Citi Visa relationship and the card and which we began offering in the U.S. and Puerto Rico this past June 20 during the fiscal fourth quarter of '16, talk about e-commerce and then a couple of other items of note.
So going down the income statement, again, sales for the first quarter for the 12 weeks ended November 20 were $27.5 billion, up 3% from last year's first quarter $26.6 million and again, on a comp basis, reported 1% in ex gas and FX, up 2%. Again, net up 2% still being impacted by other aspects of deflation that we hadn't called out historically.
For the quarter, the plus 1% reported comp results were a combination of an average transaction decrease of 1.3% on a reported basis and an average shopping frequency increase of 2.2% to the positive. Now the average transaction decrease of 1.3%, this includes again the combined headwinds of FX and gas that I mentioned, which is about 0.75% [ph], and I'm sure [ph] other levels of deflation in other categories. I'll give some examples of that later in the call.
In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, within the U.S., Northwest, Texas and Midwest show the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, U.K. and Korea.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter in terms of sales for those, within food and sundries, overall flat year-over-year with spirits, sundries and deli coming in best. Tobacco, of course, as I mentioned on the last call, was down a little over 20% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. These -- as I mentioned before, these big tobacco declines should anniversary this coming spring.
For hardlines, also flat year-over-year. The departments with the strong results were hardware, tires and health and beauty aids. To give you an example of deflation, which is impacting this department, in November, for example, our reported November sales, TV sales in dollars were up 2% and units were up 17% so quite a bit of deflation on big ticket items as well us some of the fresh foods items that I mentioned earlier. Within softlines, up low single-digit comps with apparels, small electrics and special events being the standouts. And within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest departments. And in ancillary businesses, hearing aids and optical show the best results.  Again, in recent months, we've seen additional deflation overall in the low to mid-single-digit range in many food and fresh meat categories and a little more in some of the other non-food areas, as I mentioned, like electronics.
Moving to the line items in the income statement. Membership fees, good results for the first quarter, coming in at 6% and 6 basis points as a percent of sales, up $37 million year-over-year. In terms of membership fees, it's good renewal rates, 90% U.S. and Canada -- actually, 90.3% and 88% worldwide, rounding up to 88%. Continued increasing penetration of the Executive Membership, and in terms of number of members in Q1 end, compared to fiscal year end, 12 weeks earlier, Gold Star, which stood at 36.8 million accounts. At Q1 end, it was 37.1 million. Primary business was 7.3 million both at fiscal year end and at Q1 end. Business add-ons, 3.5 million and [ph] 3.5 million. For total membership, household memberships, 47.6 million at fiscal year end and up to 47.9 million at first quarter end. And given that many of the people have 2 cards -- many of the accounts have 2 cards, at fiscal year end, we stood at 86.7 million of cardholders and at first quarter end, 87.3 million people with a membership card.
At November 20 first quarter end, Executive Members stood at 17.7 million member households, an increase of 348,000 since the end of the previous quarter. That's about 29,000 additional Executive Members per week increase during the 12-week quarter. And as I've said before, members -- Executive Members are a little over 1/3 of our base and a little bit more than 2/3 of our sales where Executive Members are offered.
In terms of renewal rates, our business renewal rate, which at fiscal year end stood at 94.4%, came in at 94.3% renewal rate as of first quarter end. Gold Star at 89.5% both at fiscal year end and first quarter end for a total 90.3% at fiscal year end, and it remained at 90.3% at first quarter end.  Worldwide at year-end, it was 87.6%, and it ticked to 87.5% at first quarter end.
As you know, it's been probably almost 2 years in Canada when we converted to the MasterCard, and with that, we saw, as we would have expected, a decline -- a slight decline in renewal rate. As what -- as occurred in Q4 '16 this past summer, we saw that finally reverse and saw an uptick in renewal rates in Canada, and that continued in Q1 of this fiscal year, too. And we're announcing the same thing in the U.S. It ticked down a little bit over the last couple of quarters, and it ticked down a little bit as well in Q1. We don't see any issues there at that point -- at this point.
Regarding membership fees, at the beginning of this past September or beginning of our fiscal year, we increased membership fees in our Asia operations, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, as well as in Mexico and the U.K. And again, that's because -- due to deferred accounting. It's about 15% of our membership fee income base and due to deferred accounting. And the fact that they're rolling over the next 12 months since September, that'll be a little less than a $0.01 a share a quarter.
Before continuing down the income statement line items, a quick update on the Citi Visa card offering. This past June 20, midway through the fourth quarter of fiscal '16, we stopped accepting AmEx, American Express, at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and at costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including, of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. The new card's great in terms of increased cash back rewards for our members and great for us as well in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years and of course, lowering our effective merchant fees related to the new program.
In terms of new card, as I -- as was mentioned over the last couple of quarters on these calls, there were approximately 11.4 million AmEx, American Express, co-branded cards or about 7.8 million accounts that were transferred from American Express to Citi for conversion to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. Over 85% of the accounts transferred over have been activated, and since the June 20 cutover several months ago, we have 1 million members that have signed up for and have been approved for the new Citi Visa card. Most of them have it on hand, but to the extent that was last couple of weeks, they may haven't gotten the card yet. In terms of conversion, usage and new sign-ups for the card, all good so far.
Now turning to gross margin, our reported gross margin in the fourth -- in the first quarter was higher year-over-year by 29 basis points coming in at 11.58% this year versus 11.29% last year. As usual, I'll have you jot down for the quarter a few numbers. We'll just make it 2 columns for the quarter: reported and without gas deflation. In terms of core merchandising, year-over-year in the first quarter, core merchandising was up 19 basis points, up 16 without gas deflation. Ancillary businesses down 5% -- minus 5 year-over-year and for the quarter, minus 6 without deflation; 2% reward minus 2 in the quarter on a reported basis, minus 1 without gas deflation; LIFO, minus 2 and minus 2; other, which is the big onetime -- the big non-recurring benefit we got from a litigation settlement, plus 19 basis points both for the reported and without gas. All told, for the quarter we reported again a 29 basis point improvement and ex gas deflation, 26 basis points. So overall, again, 26 basis points up on a kind of ex gas basis. The core merchandise component was higher by 19 basis points year-over-year and again, 16 without the gas deflation.
The majority of the core gross margin increase already taking out -- we've separated out already the onetime legal settlement, about 13 basis points of that 16 [ph] , if you will, was due to higher year-over-year revenue share and bounties associated with the new Citi Visa agreement. Some of those monies go to the revenue line as it's revenue share.
The gross margin of our -- notwithstanding that, the gross margin of our core merchandising categories, which are the food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, those -- that gross margin as percent of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the first quarter by 17 basis points with food and sundries, hardlines and fresh foods all showing higher year-over-year margins and softlines being down a little bit year-over-year. And then one of the impacts was the warmth of the season and outerwear issues.
Ancillary and other business gross margin was down 5 basis points, 6 basis points ex gas deflation in the quarter, all a function of lower year-over-year gas profits as I discussed earlier in the call. Ex gas lean operations, all other ancillary and other business gross margins were up 6 basis points.
2% Reward, again, ex gas, a negative impact of 1 basis point, and that's to the margin. That's a sales penetration, and the associated Executive Member rewards from our Executive Members continue to grow.
LIFO in the first quarter this year, we did not both get a LIFO credit or charge compared to a 2 basis point positive or $5 million pretax credit last year in the quarter. And lastly, the onetime non-recurring legal settlement, this benefited Q1 gross margin by 19 basis points as we discussed at beginning of the call.
Moving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentage in the first quarter year-over-year was higher by 16 basis points on a reported basis and by 13 basis points ex gas deflation. Again, I'll have you just jot down a few line items. Core operations for the quarter was higher or negative 8 basis points and without gas, a negative 6; central, higher by 9 and 9, both reported and without gas deflation; stock compensation expense, minus 7 and minus 6; other, plus 8 and plus 8. That's that rough $20 million or $22 million amount that I told you about earlier in the call that impacted SG&A to the positive last year versus no -- nothing this year. And again, reported SG&A was higher by 16 basis points in the quarter, higher by 13 ex gas deflation.
The core operations component of SG&A, again, in the chart, shows 8% higher and -- I'm sorry, 8 basis points higher year-over-year reported and 6 ex gas. This minus 6 consisted of higher payroll and benefits of about 31 basis points year-over-year. That's certainly impacted by the lower sales result, and certainly, that's impacted by the deflation. I'll give you a couple of examples of that later. This was primarily offset by lower year-over-year merchant fees as a result of the switch to Citi Visa. That had a benefit to the SG&A line of 25 basis -- plus 25 basis points impact to the positive.
Central expense was higher year-over-year in Q1 by 9. Increased IT spending, again, as I mentioned, was 5 of that. Stock compensation expense, higher by 5 or 6 without gas. And lastly, the other I'd mention, the plus 8 was nonrecurring in nature.
Next, on the income statement line, preopening expense, it was $4 million lower this year versus last year coming in at $22 million versus $26 million a year ago, really a function of openings. This year in Q1, we had 9 openings, last year 13. Each of those -- the 9 included 1 relo in the 13 last year and then first quarter included 2 relos, pretty much in line with that number of openings. All told, operating income in the first quarter came in up $82 million or 11% but up $9 million or 1% year-over-year, excluding the -- just the non-recurring items that I previously mentioned.
Below the operating income line, interest expense in the first quarter came in at $29 million this year versus $33 million in last year, lower due to the retirement of some senior notes in December of last year. Interest income and other was lower by $2 million in the quarter coming in at $26 million versus $28 million a year ago. Actual interest income and other -- actual interest came in [ph] the quarter was better year-over-year. This is offset by approximately $4.5 million in charges related to the FX transactions that usually fluctuate pluses or minus in the 0 to $10 million rage, so no surprises there.
Overall, reported pretax income on a reported basis was higher by 11%, again, higher by 1% ex those non-recurring items that I mentioned earlier in the call. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter came in at 34.4% for the quarter compared to 36.1% last year. We benefited from a couple of positive discrete items this year in Q1. Our effective -- anticipated effective rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35.2% as best we can tell at this point.
Overall, reported net income, $545 million this year, up from -- up $65 million from $480 million last year, so an increase of 14%, ex the non-recurring items that I mentioned, up 3%.
Next for a quick rundown of other topics. While the balance sheet is included in this morning's -- in this afternoon's press release, a couple of the balance sheet inflow items. Depreciation and amortization from the cash flow statement, which is not here, for the quarter came in at $297 million for the quarter. Accounts payable, if you look at -- one of the things we always look at is our accounts payable as a percent of inventories. It report -- on a reported basis, it was up from 100% a year ago in the quarter and 203%. If you take out non-merchandise payables, more of accounts payable merchandise versus inventories, it improved from a 90% to a 93% from last year's first quarter end to this year's first quarter end. Average inventory per warehouse was actually lower by about $67,000 [ph] per warehouse coming in at -- right at $14.9 million a year ago and $14.83 million per location this year.
FX was -- of that roughly $70,000 lower, FX was about $170,000 lower, just the impact of FX. So about 100 [ph] net if you would assume flat FX. That's about what majors was up. Electronics, it was up 117,000 [ph] So really not a lot of pluses and minuses over sub [ph] departments but pretty much in line and pretty much flat year-over-year.
In terms of CapEx, we spent approximately $670 million during the quarter, and our estimate for the whole year, as I mentioned, hasn't changed from last quarter end. Our expectation for fiscal year '17 is somewhere in the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion range compared to $2.6 billion for all of fiscal '16.
Next, Costco Online. We're now in, of course, in the U.S., Canada, U.K, Mexico and more recently, Korea and Taiwan. For the first quarter, sales and profits were up. Total online sales were up 8% in the quarter and 7% on a comp basis, pretty choppy. Essentially, the first several weeks and the last several weeks of the quarter were in the mid-singles with the middle part of it in the low doubles if you will. I want to point out that over the past 3 weeks, and that would include the last week of Q1, which is the Thanksgiving week, and the first 2 weeks of our second fiscal quarter, e-comm sales were up in the low to mid-teens and including similar results for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And of course, that's notwithstanding significant amount of TV sales, which were essentially flat in dollars and up 15% in units.
Lastly, as it relates to our online business, we're improving our offerings and enhancing our member experience. I touched on this a little bit last quarter's call. Our current focus comes in 3 primary areas in terms of improving merchandise first. We're adding more exciting high-end branded merchandise on an everyday basis. We're improving in-stocks of high-velocity items, and there's a few other things that we'll be doing coming the first couple of months of the new calendar year.
Second, we're improving the experience and functionality of our site. We're improving our search. We have and are continuing to do that. We've shortened the checkout process from many clicks to 2 and so a big improvement, recognizing this is new for us. We're simplifying and automating our returns process, a much better experience, particularly on big ticket items, and we've seen great improvement in that in the last several weeks. And we're improving our member's ability to track their orders. Again, that's something that we weren't terribly good at historically.
And we're improving -- and thirdly, we're improving our distribution logistics. We've increased the number of depots from where we fill online orders, so closer and faster and less expensive delivery. And again, look for more improved and quicker distribution comments for us in early calendar '17.
Next, in terms of expansion, I mentioned we had 8 net new units this year, this fiscal first quarter. We plan 2 for Q2, a net of 5 for Q3, so ex relocations and a net of 16 in Q4 for anticipated number for the year of net new units of 31, 34 less the 3 relos, so 31 net new locations. Last year, recall we opened 29 so about 4.5% square footage growth. If we get to the 31, that would be about the same, about 4.25 plus square footage growth. Assuming the 31 net new openings, fiscal '17 locations by country will be 16 in the U.S. Mind you that last year it was 21 out of 29 in the U.S., 8 in Canada, which is quite a number for Canada, and 1 each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico as well as France, our first in France, and also 1 in Iceland. Note that these include our first locations to open in France and Iceland. And again, those will be in late spring and early summer.
Now as you can tell by the quarterly dispersion of these, about half of the 31 planned openings are scheduled in Q4. To the extent a couple of those could slip into the next fiscal year, so be it. So somewhere in the high -- very high 20s, if not, 30 or 31 is what we would expect. As of first quarter end, our total square footage stood at 104.5 million square feet.
In terms of common stock repurchases, for the first quarter, we repurchased 809,000 shares for a total of $122 million or an average price of $151 a share. That compares to all of fiscal '16 when we repurchased $477 million, 3.2 million shares at an average price of just under $150 a share.
In terms of dividends, our currently quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share, and that was a 12.5% increase. And that was effective last spring, 12.5% increase from the prior $0.40 a share. So $0.45 a share in the quarter, so that yearly $1.80 dividend represents an annual cost to the company of just under $800 million.
Lastly, before I turn it back for Q&A, our fiscal 2017 second quarter schedule earnings release date for the 12-week second quarter ending February 12 will be after market close on Thursday, March 2 for the earnings call that afternoon at 2:00 Pacific Time.
I will now turn it back to Kimberlan for -- and open up for questions and answers."

In terms -- there's bounties that we received for signing up new members and applications that incents the warehouses to do that. There's revenue share on outside spend. I think that's a little more than we'd anticipated. We knew and felt that, over time, it would go up because of the acceptance of Visa in terms of the penetration of Visa throughout all types of merchants, and that happened a little faster than we had anticipated. There's also some other aspects of it. Again, there's lots of little pieces, but those are 2 of the bigger ones. On the merchant side -- on the fee side rather, I think some of it's related to the fact that we're making estimates of the different reward buckets, if you will, gas at 4 [ph] , Costco at 2 [ph] , those velocity categories at 3 [ph] . Again, there's all kinds of equations there that as that changes, there's some gearing, and so it's all good at this point."

And while it's raining on everybody as it relates to higher levels of deflation, we're known for deflating the sale price sooner and faster, and certainly, one other soundbite example would be meat sales. Just in the month of November, meat sales were up 6% in dollars and 16% in pounds. That's the kind of stuff that this deflation, it's impacting all retailers of course, and it's probably impacting a lower margin quicker to pass it on up or down and certainly down faster, so all those things go into play. So time will tell."

We're constantly going back to every supplier with our purchasing power, with our buying power as it relates to competition itself with private label, to figure out how can we bring the quantity up, the quality up and the price down. And we know we'll sell more, and each of us and our suppliers will make a little more times -- a little less more times. And that's what we do -- that's what we're always doing. We see that at every monthly budget meeting. And so I think that we'll continue to do what we do. We're certainly not going to benefit from every extra dollar of income. We're going to figure out how to use it to drive that competitive spirit and to drive our sales. And that's been a little tougher in this tough deflationary environment."

In fear, you'd say, okay, if you made a little more than [indiscernible] , did you put it back in the pricing. We're doing a lot in pricing anyway. And also, you don't change the reward structure everyday. It's a new program. I would assume, over time, and this is -- who knows? It's hypothetical, but over the next couple of years, if the performance of the program continues to go in the -- which way we expected to in the right direction and our piece of that action, if you will, versus the rewards that our members are getting, you'd expect us to see this -- change that over time. But we're way too early [indiscernible] think about that.

So I don't think -- first of all, we certainly haven't done anything different.

And we've got a lot that are doing the basics whether we know a members, existing member of buys a lot historically based on their prior 12 months.

Once they convert it over, they were all in the same deal. But everybody knew they're signing up for new card and there's going to be some people that get in, some people that don't.

The percent probably changes a little downwards so that would imply perhaps a little bit of improvement in dollars. But it should be all over the board. Gas is an extreme example. It's a low-margin competitive business. As prices tumbled dramatically across general competition, prices were lower, but not nearly proportional to the amount of savings to that retailer. We were able to improve our margins a little and widened the gap. That a win-win. Another silly example is organics. Organics, because there's perhaps a little bit of less price elasticity to organic prices, we're able to make a little more margin, not a lot and have a wider value proposition versus others. So those are good things for us. Generally speaking, when there was cost inflation on milk and cheese and things like that, we point out, as you know, historically, as some of those quarters, we kept chicken at $4.99 and margins were down essentially from something to nothing to the tune of $40 million a year on 1 item. That was 4, 5 years ago, 4 years ago. Conversely, when cheese prices fell, foodcourt margins were up nicely because we never really change the size of a slice of pizza. There's a lot of little things that don't fit in a square box or around a square box or around whole here. I would say, generally, a low inflation is good. It helps sales and we could be more competitive both up and down and when prices going up, probably a little bit more margin-beneficial but not a whole lot."

Probably the most extreme example would be the Bay Area where we started with Google. That was their first market and certainly that's where they're headquartered and it's doing fine. What we've found is an existing loyal member is coming in a few less times a year, is shopping several more times, most certainly the 0 but shopping more but for some of the 2 is more. They buy a lot less when they're doing it online than when they come in. And part of that is the experience of walking in and mid-or there. Not everything is offered but with us, so that good news is [indiscernible]."

Needless to say, there's a lot more inefficiency today. We continue to look at scan and go type things. We are not testing it currently but we are looking at it. I'm not suggesting we're going to do it. We have done self checkout for a while. We've chosen not to self checkout in higher volume units because we get people through without it. And as it relates to in terms of millennials and Generation Z, all those numbers are doing better for us and part of it is things like not that we sat down strategically how we get them, we have a great value proposition. Certainly, some of the things that we sell like organics, in my view, is a big impact to that. Certainly, some of the things we do, we've done a couple of test LivingSocial for the last couple of years, all of those things we think help. As it relates -- you asked question about Amazon and Amazon is also the word for everything out there that's delivered or .com and everything else, certainly they're doing a lot of things. We want to make sure we understand what all of these people are doing. We do and not just from a competitive price shop, whether it's to them or someone else, we recognized convenience is a value but there's also some things we can and can't do. So I think, we look at these things offensively, not defensively at this point. I don't think that -- I think we're encouraged when we see the level of millennials, if you will, that are signing up. When you see the average age of our membership coming down. It was just a couple of years ago when the average U.S. Costco adult member was 4-plus years older than the population as a whole. And now it's a little under 2. And that's without a lot of planning, but it's your product what we do. And I think part of that is the merchandise selection and our ability to change merchandise pretty quickly. Certainly, things like, again, organic stand up in a big way. I think the fact of what we're doing, even on some things that aren't directly -- they're all related to business, ASG and sustainability, how we take care of the employees, the culture, those are things again we didn't say we have to do better at that, we do best on that, we do a lot of good things like that. When it comes down to merchandising, we believe that organics, the KS, what we're very good at is driving value and we're probably not going to be the person that's the best at delivering smaller sized goods to your house. There are some things we're going to do between that and nothing. And again, stay tuned for calendar '17."

For the 12-week fiscal first quarter that ended 2 weeks ago, Sunday, this past Sunday, earnings came in at $1.24 a share, up 14% or $0.15 a share over last year's earning -- reported earnings per share of $1.09. A few items to point out as was mentioned in today's release. This year's first quarter benefited from a non-recurring $51 million legal settlement. This $51 million pretax figure represented a 19 basis point benefit to gross margin and a benefit to first quarter's earnings per share of $0.07 a share.
Last year in the first quarter, there were 2 non-recurring items that we mentioned that, together, negatively impacted last year's earnings results. In that quarter, we recorded a $22 million pretax charge, which represented an 8 basis point impact to SG&A to the negative and a reduction in last year's first quarter earnings of $0.04 a share.
Stock compensation expense was 13% or $25 million higher year-over-year, so $0.04 a share more. There are about 4,800 people in -- of our employees that received restrictive stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October in our fiscal first quarter and then typically vest over a 5-year period with accelerated vesting when the recipient reaches 25, 30 and 35 years of employment with the company. Factors driving this increase included additional levels of accelerated vesting given the rising number of our employees achieving long tenure with the company; an increased stock price with a 5-year-ago grant coming off when the -- coming off of the thing when the stock price was in the $80s to last year's grant when the stock price was in the $150s; and of course, having a larger number of employees to plan. Note that the $25 million year-over-year increase in Q1 is larger -- is a larger year-over-year dollar increase than we'd expect to record in each of the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters of this year given the October RSU grant cycle.
Next, gas profitability. Our profits from gas during the quarter as compared to last year's first quarter were lower by about $20 million pretax or $0.03 a share, primarily a function of last year's very strong profit results in the first quarter for gas.
Fifth, IT costs. These expenses negatively impacted SG&A in the first quarter on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $18 million or 5 basis points to SG&A, which is about $0.025 a share.
And lastly, when I get to the discussion on year-over-year gross margin and SG&A comparisons, I'll review with you the very positive impact that our new Citi Visa deal has had on margins, SG&A and of course, our bottom line.
Turning to the first quarter sales. Total reported sales were up 3%, and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure on a reported basis came in at 1% year-over-year. Comp sales were negatively impacted by weaker FX relative to the U.S. dollar and slightly impacted by gas price deflation for a combined negative impact to the reported account number of about 0.75% of sales. Excluding gas deflation, the reported 1% U.S. comp figure for Q1 remained at 1%. The reported Canadian comp figure of plus 4% would have been plus 5% ex gas deflation and FX. And the reported 0 other international comp figure, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 3%. Total comps reported 1% for the quarter, again, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 2%. And of course, this plus 2% total company adjusted figure is also being impacted by increases in deflation and other merchandising categories overall, primarily in food and hardline -- foods and hardlines.
In terms of new openings, in the first quarter, we opened 9 new locations, which included 1 relo so a net increase of 8. And later in the call, I'll discuss our upcoming expansion plans for the balance of the fiscal year. This afternoon, I'll also touch on membership trends and renewal rates, again, discuss margins and SG&A in Q1, update on the Citi Visa, the new Citi Visa relationship and the card and which we began offering in the U.S. and Puerto Rico this past June 20 during the fiscal fourth quarter of '16, talk about e-commerce and then a couple of other items of note.
So going down the income statement, again, sales for the first quarter for the 12 weeks ended November 20 were $27.5 billion, up 3% from last year's first quarter $26.6 million and again, on a comp basis, reported 1% in ex gas and FX, up 2%. Again, net up 2% still being impacted by other aspects of deflation that we hadn't called out historically.
For the quarter, the plus 1% reported comp results were a combination of an average transaction decrease of 1.3% on a reported basis and an average shopping frequency increase of 2.2% to the positive. Now the average transaction decrease of 1.3%, this includes again the combined headwinds of FX and gas that I mentioned, which is about 0.75% and I'm sure other levels of deflation in other categories. I'll give some examples of that later in the call.
In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, within the U.S., Northwest, Texas and Midwest show the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, U.K. and Korea.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter in terms of sales for those, within food and sundries, overall flat year-over-year with spirits, sundries and deli coming in best. Tobacco, of course, as I mentioned on the last call, was down a little over 20% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. These -- as I mentioned before, these big tobacco declines should anniversary this coming spring.
For hardlines, also flat year-over-year. The departments with the strong results were hardware, tires and health and beauty aids. To give you an example of deflation, which is impacting this department, in November, for example, our reported November sales, TV sales in dollars were up 2% and units were up 17% so quite a bit of deflation on big ticket items as well us some of the fresh foods items that I mentioned earlier. Within softlines, up low single-digit comps with apparels, small electrics and special events being the standouts. And within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest departments. And in ancillary businesses, hearing aids and optical show the best results.  Again, in recent months, we've seen additional deflation overall in the low to mid-single-digit range in many food and fresh meat categories and a little more in some of the other non-food areas, as I mentioned, like electronics.
Moving to the line items in the income statement. Membership fees, good results for the first quarter, coming in at 6% and 6 basis points as a percent of sales, up $37 million year-over-year. In terms of membership fees, it's good renewal rates, 90% U.S. and Canada -- actually, 90.3% and 88% worldwide, rounding up to 88%. Continued increasing penetration of the Executive Membership, and in terms of number of members in Q1 end, compared to fiscal year-end, 12 weeks earlier, Gold Star, which stood at 36.8 million accounts. At Q1 end, it was 37.1 million. Primary business was 7.3 million both at fiscal year-end and at Q1 end. Business add-ons, 3.5 million and 3.5 million. For total membership, household memberships, 47.6 million at fiscal year-end and up to 47.9 million at first quarter end. And given that many of the people have 2 cards -- many of the accounts have 2 cards, at fiscal year-end, we stood at 86.7 million of cardholders and at first quarter end, 87.3 million people with a membership card.
At November 20 first quarter end, Executive Members stood at 17.7 million member households, an increase of 348,000 since the end of the previous quarter. That's about 29,000 additional Executive Members per week increase during the 12-week quarter. And as I've said before, members -- Executive Members are a little over 1/3 of our base and a little bit more than 2/3 of our sales where Executive Members are offered.
In terms of renewal rates, our business renewal rate, which at fiscal year-end stood at 94.4%, came in at 94.3% renewal rate as of first quarter end. Gold Star at 89.5% both at fiscal year-end and first quarter end for a total 90.3% at fiscal year-end, and it remained at 90.3% at first quarter end.  Worldwide at year-end, it was 87.6%, and it ticked to 87.5% at first quarter end.
As you know, it's been probably almost 2 years in Canada when we converted to the MasterCard, and with that, we saw, as we would have expected, a decline -- a slight decline in renewal rate. As what -- as occurred in Q4 '16 this past summer, we saw that finally reverse and saw an uptick in renewal rates in Canada, and that continued in Q1 of this fiscal year, too. And we're announcing the same thing in the U.S. It ticked down a little bit over the last couple of quarters, and it ticked down a little bit as well in Q1. We don't see any issues there at that point -- at this point.
Regarding membership fees, at the beginning of this past September or beginning of our fiscal year, we increased membership fees in our Asia operations, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, as well as in Mexico and the U.K. And again, that's because -- due to deferred accounting. It's about 15% of our membership fee income base and due to deferred accounting. And the fact that they're rolling over the next 12 months since September, that'll be a little less than a $0.01 a share a quarter.
Before continuing down the income statement line items, a quick update on the Citi Visa card offering. This past June 20, midway through the fourth quarter of fiscal '16, we stopped accepting Amex, American Express, at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and at costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including, of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. The new card's great in terms of increased cash back rewards for our members and great for us as well in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years and of course, lowering our effective merchant fees related to the new program.
In terms of new card, as I -- as was mentioned over the last couple of quarters on these calls, there were approximately 11.4 million Amex, American Express, co-branded cards or about 7.8 million accounts that were transferred from American Express to Citi for conversion to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. Over 85% of the accounts transferred over have been activated, and since the June 20 cutover several months ago, we have 1 million members that have signed up for and have been approved for the new Citi Visa card. Most of them have it on hand, but to the extent that was last couple of weeks, they may haven't gotten the card yet. In terms of conversion, usage and new sign-ups for the card, all good so far.
Now turning to gross margin, our reported gross margin in the fourth -- in the first quarter was higher year-over-year by 29 basis points coming in at 11.58% this year versus 11.29% last year. As usual, I'll have you jot down for the quarter a few numbers. We'll just make it 2 columns for the quarter: reported and without gas deflation. In terms of core merchandising, year-over-year in the first quarter, core merchandising was up 19 basis points, up 16 without gas deflation. Ancillary businesses down 5% -- minus 5 year-over-year and for the quarter, minus 6 without deflation; 2% reward minus 2 in the quarter on a reported basis, minus 1 without gas deflation; LIFO, minus 2 and minus 2; other, which is the big onetime -- the big non-recurring benefit we got from a litigation settlement, plus 19 basis points both for the reported and without gas. All told, for the quarter we reported again a 29 basis point improvement and ex gas deflation, 26 basis points. So overall, again, 26 basis points up on a kind of ex gas basis. The core merchandise component was higher by 19 basis points year-over-year and again, 16 without the gas deflation.
The majority of the core gross margin increase already taking out -- we've separated out already the onetime legal settlement, about 13 basis points of that 16, if you will, was due to higher year-over-year revenue share and bounties associated with the new Citi Visa agreement. Some of those monies go to the revenue line as its revenue share.
The gross margin of our -- notwithstanding that, the gross margin of our core merchandising categories, which are the food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, those -- that gross margin as percent of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the first quarter by 17 basis points with food and sundries, hardlines and fresh foods all showing higher year-over-year margins and softlines being down a little bit year-over-year. And then one of the impacts was the warmth of the season and outerwear issues.
Ancillary and other business gross margin was down 5 basis points, 6 basis points ex gas deflation in the quarter, all a function of lower year-over-year gas profits as I discussed earlier in the call. Ex gas lean operations, all other ancillary and other business gross margins were up 6 basis points.
2% Reward, again, ex gas, a negative impact of 1 basis point, and that's to the margin. That's a sales penetration, and the associated Executive Member rewards from our Executive Members continue to grow.
LIFO in the first quarter this year, we did not both get a LIFO credit or charge compared to a 2 basis point positive or $5 million pretax credit last year in the quarter. And lastly, the onetime non-recurring legal settlement, this benefited Q1 gross margin by 19 basis points as we discussed at beginning of the call.
Moving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentage in the first quarter year-over-year was higher by 16 basis points on a reported basis and by 13 basis points ex gas deflation. Again, I'll have you just jot down a few line items. Core operations for the quarter was higher or negative 8 basis points and without gas, a negative 6; central, higher by 9 and 9, both reported and without gas deflation; stock compensation expense, minus 7 and minus 6; other, plus 8 and plus 8. That's that rough $20 million or $22 million amount that I told you about earlier in the call that impacted SG&A to the positive last year versus no -- nothing this year. And again, reported SG&A was higher by 16 basis points in the quarter, higher by 13 ex gas deflation.
The core operations component of SG&A, again, in the chart, shows 8% higher and -- I'm sorry, 8 basis points higher year-over-year reported and 6 ex gas. This minus 6 consisted of higher payroll and benefits of about 31 basis points year-over-year. That's certainly impacted by the lower sales result, and certainly, that's impacted by the deflation. I'll give you a couple of examples of that later. This was primarily offset by lower year-over-year merchant fees as a result of the switch to Citi Visa. That had a benefit to the SG&A line of 25 basis -- plus 25 basis points impact to the positive.
Central expense was higher year-over-year in Q1 by 9. Increased IT spending, again, as I mentioned, was 5 of that. Stock compensation expense, higher by 5 or 6 without gas. And lastly, the other I'd mention, the plus 8 was nonrecurring in nature.
Next, on the income statement line, preopening expense, it was $4 million lower this year versus last year coming in at $22 million versus $26 million a year ago, really a function of openings. This year in Q1, we had 9 openings, last year 13. Each of those -- the 9 included 1 relo in the 13 last year and then first quarter included 2 relos, pretty much in line with that number of openings. All told, operating income in the first quarter came in up $82 million or 11% but up $9 million or 1% year-over-year, excluding the -- just the non-recurring items that I previously mentioned.
Below the operating income line, interest expense in the first quarter came in at $29 million this year versus $33 million in last year, lower due to the retirement of some senior notes in December of last year. Interest income and other was lower by $2 million in the quarter coming in at $26 million versus $28 million a year ago. Actual interest income and other -- actual interest, I think, for the quarter was better year-over-year. This is offset by approximately $4.5 million in charges related to the FX transactions that usually fluctuate pluses or minus in the 0 to $10 million rage, so no surprises there.
Overall, reported pretax income on a reported basis was higher by 11%, again, higher by 1% ex those non-recurring items that I mentioned earlier in the call. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter came in at 34.4% for the quarter compared to 36.1% last year. We benefited from a couple of positive discrete items this year in Q1. Our effective -- anticipated effective rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35.2% as best we can tell at this point.
Overall, reported net income, $545 million this year, up from -- up $65 million from $480 million last year, so an increase of 14%, ex the non-recurring items that I mentioned, up 3%.
Next for a quick rundown of other topics. While the balance sheet is included in this morning's -- in this afternoon's press release, a couple of the balance sheet inflow items. Depreciation and amortization from the cash flow statement, which is not here, for the quarter came in at $297 million for the quarter. Accounts payable, if you look at -- one of the things we always look at is our accounts payable as a percent of inventories. It report -- on a reported basis, it was up from 100% a year ago in the quarter and 203%. If you take out non-merchandise payables, more of accounts payable merchandise versus inventories, it improved from a 90% to a 93% from last year's first quarter end to this year's first quarter end. Average inventory per warehouse was actually lower by about $67,000 per warehouse coming in at -- right at $14.9 million a year ago and $14.83 million per location this year.
FX was -- of that roughly $70,000 lower, FX was about $170,000 lower, just the impact of FX. So about $100,000 net if you would assume flat FX. That's about what majors was up. Electronics, it was up $117,000, So really not a lot of pluses and minuses over sub departments but pretty much in line and pretty much flat year-over-year.
In terms of CapEx, we spent approximately $670 million during the quarter, and our estimate for the whole year, as I mentioned, hasn't changed from last quarter end. Our expectation for fiscal year '17 is somewhere in the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion range compared to $2.6 billion for all of fiscal '16.
Next, Costco Online. We're now in, of course, in the U.S., Canada, U.K, Mexico and more recently, Korea and Taiwan. For the first quarter, sales and profits were up. Total online sales were up 8% in the quarter and 7% on a comp basis, pretty choppy. Essentially, the first several weeks and the last several weeks of the quarter were in the mid-singles with the middle part of it in the low doubles if you will. I want to point out that over the past 3 weeks, and that would include the last week of Q1, which is the Thanksgiving week, and the first 2 weeks of our second fiscal quarter, e-comm sales were up in the low to mid-teens and including similar results for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And of course, that's notwithstanding significant amount of TV sales, which were essentially flat in dollars and up 15% in units.
Lastly, as it relates to our online business, we're improving our offerings and enhancing our member experience. I touched on this a little bit last quarter's call. Our current focus comes in 3 primary areas in terms of improving merchandise first. We're adding more exciting high-end branded merchandise on an everyday basis. We're improving in-stocks of high-velocity items, and there's a few other things that we'll be doing coming the first couple of months of the new calendar year.
Second, we're improving the experience and functionality of our site. We're improving our search. We have and are continuing to do that. We've shortened the checkout process from many clicks to 2 and so a big improvement, recognizing this is new for us. We're simplifying and automating our returns process, a much better experience, particularly on big ticket items, and we've seen great improvement in that in the last several weeks. And we're improving our member's ability to track their orders. Again, that's something that we weren't terribly good at historically.
And we're improving -- and thirdly, we're improving our distribution logistics. We've increased the number of depots from where we fill online orders, so closer and faster and less expensive delivery. And again, look for more improved and quicker distribution comments for us in early calendar '17.
Next, in terms of expansion, I mentioned we had 8 net new units this year, this fiscal first quarter. We plan 2 for Q2, a net of 5 for Q3, so ex relocations and a net of 16 in Q4 for anticipated number for the year of net new units of 31, 34 less the 3 relos, so 31 net new locations. Last year, recall we opened 29 so about 4.5% square footage growth. If we get to the 31, that would be about the same, about 4.25 plus square footage growth. Assuming the 31 net new openings, fiscal '17 locations by country will be 16 in the U.S. Mind you that last year it was 21 out of 29 in the U.S., 8 in Canada, which is quite a number for Canada, and 1 each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico as well as France, our first in France, and also 1 in Iceland. Note that these include our first locations to open in France and Iceland. And again, those will be in late spring and early summer.
Now as you can tell by the quarterly dispersion of these, about half of the 31 planned openings are scheduled in Q4. To the extent a couple of those could slip into the next fiscal year, so be it. So somewhere in the high -- very high 20s, if not, 30 or 31 is what we would expect. As of first quarter end, our total square footage stood at 104.5 million square feet.
In terms of common stock repurchases, for the first quarter, we repurchased 809,000 shares for a total of $122 million or an average price of $151 a share. That compares to all of fiscal '16 when we repurchased $477 million, 3.2 million shares at an average price of just under $150 a share.
In terms of dividends, our currently quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share, and that was a 12.5% increase. And that was effective last spring, 12.5% increase from the prior $0.40 a share. So $0.45 a share in the quarter, so that yearly $1.80 dividend represents an annual cost to the company of just under $800 million.
Lastly, before I turn it back for Q&A, our fiscal 2017 second quarter schedule earnings release date for the 12-week second quarter ending February 12 will be after market close on Thursday, March 2 for the earnings call that afternoon at 2:00 Pacific Time.
I will now turn it back to Kimberlan for -- and open up for questions and answers."

I think that's a little more than we'd anticipated. We knew and felt that, over time, it would go up because of the acceptance of Visa in terms of the penetration of Visa throughout all types of merchants, and that happened a little faster than we had anticipated. There's also some other aspects of it. Again, there's lots of little pieces, but those are 2 of the bigger ones. On the merchant side -- on the fee side rather, I think some of it's related to the fact that we're making estimates of the different reward buckets, if you will, gas at 4%, Costco at 2%, those velocity categories at 3%. Again, there's all kinds of equations there that as that changes, there's some gearing, and so it's all good at this point."

Just in the month of November, meat sales were up 6% in dollars and 16% in pounds. That's the kind of stuff that this deflation, it's impacting all retailers of course, and it's probably impacting a lower margin quicker to pass it on up or down and certainly down faster, so all those things go into play.

It's hypothetical, but over the next couple of years, if the performance of the program continues to go in the -- which way we expected to in the right direction and our piece of that action, if you will, versus the rewards that our members are getting, you'd expect us to see this -- change that over time. But we're way too early to even think about that. Historically, as it relates to membership fee increases, we usually invest that back in the business, a lot of that in terms of competitiveness and pricing, and it kind of eases in over the next several years and into -- more fully into the bottom line notwithstanding the fact that membership fee increases take about 8 fiscal quarters to get into the income statement on the membership line because of deferred accounting. So I don't think -- first of all, we certainly haven't done anything different.

And when it gets to the anniversary-ing of it, there's been some huge swings, some huge example of swings on some nuts, which last year doubled and they're now down 35%. There's -- eggs, of course, are down well over 60% year-over-year, so -- and we're not -- if eggs were down even 50%, it doesn't mean that people are going to eat twice as many eggs to have flat sales. They're going to eat some more eggs but not that many. So -- by the way, a few of those things may help in the bakery -- the margins in the bakery. We're also not going change the package -- the cost of 16 muffins -- or 15 muffins. So overall, I think the feeling it has given that the last few months had been a little more deflationary. The view is, is that it's another few months of that, but they all believe that it's going to come back the other way.

The percent probably changes a little downwards, so that would imply perhaps a little bit of improvement in dollars. But it should be all over the board. Gas is an extreme example. It's a low-margin competitive business. As prices tumbled dramatically across general competition, prices were lower but not nearly proportional to the amount of savings to that retailer. We were able to improve our margins a little and widened the gap. That's a win-win. Another silly example is organics. Organics, the -- because there's perhaps a little bit of less price elasticity to organic prices, we're able to make a little more margin, not a lot and have a wider value proposition versus others. So those are good things for us. Generally speaking, when there was cost inflation on milk and cheese and things like that, we would point out, as you know historically in some of those quarters where we kept the chicken at $4.99 and margins went down essentially from something to nothing to the tune of $40 million a year on 1 item. That was 4, 5 years ago, 4 years ago. Conversely, when cheese prices fell, food court margins went up nicely because we've always -- we never really changed the price of a slice of pizza. So there's lots of little things that aren't -- don't fit in a square box or a round hole here. I would say, generally, a low inflation is good. It helps sales. It's -- and we could be more competitive both up and down, and when prices are going up, it probably is a little bit more margin beneficial but not a lot."

We think that some of the things that we do in-store will keep them coming. So far, it's not been an issue. And even -- one thing -- while we've tried to point out these things each quarter in terms of traffic, in terms of even when traffic was impacted a little bit and we're asked that $64,000 question, is it all these other things, we see some of the categories that 1 would think would have been impacted negatively by it aren't being impacted negatively. In terms of click and pickup, we looked at it, and we are not prepared to do that at this point. When we see it in other places, not just the other warehouse club, there's -- you need space for it or you need a lot less volume and a location for it. Neither of which we have. And we're not getting a lot of demands for it. We do that at the business centers. You can log [ph] order and get delivered. And so that's more for the business member, not the individual. And we recognize that we're not the retailer that are going to sell you a smaller pack size or something at even a little bit better -- higher margin. That's not what we do. Now time will tell over time. We're not -- there's a lot of things that are going on out there. We're looking at them. We've all seen the video from earlier this week about you just walk in. There's a lot of other brick and mortars that my guess would be far more impacted than us on that, but we'll have to wait and see. Again, we're going to -- if renewal rate trends change -- by the way, we even see in the markets where we've done things with Google and where we worked with Instacart as well, Google Express and Instacart. Probably the most extreme example would be the Bay Area, where we started with Google, and that was their first market. And certainly, that's where they're headquartered. And it's doing fine. What we've found is an existing loyal member is coming in a few less times a year, is shopping several more times, well, certainly several more because it was 0 but shopping more. But the sum of the 2 is more. They buy a lot less when they're doing it online than when they come in. And part of that is the experience of walking in and seeing it all there.

And that's without a lot of planning, but it's part of what we do. And I think part of that's the merchandise selection and our ability to change merchandise pretty quickly. And certainly, things like, again, organic stand out in a big way. I think the fact of what we're doing even on some things that aren't directly -- they're all related to the business but ESG and sustainability, how we take care of our employees, the culture, those are things that, again, we didn't say we have to do better at that. We do best at that. We do a lot of good things like that. When it comes down to merchandising, we believe that organics, the KS, what we're very good at is driving value, and we're probably not going to be a person that's the best at delivering smaller-sized goods to your house. There are some things we're going to do between that and nothing, and again, stay tuned for calendar '17."

And in light of that, there's been a lot of debate around the traffic just north of 2% or just under 3% depending on the month and a lot of questions around convenience. And I just wonder, as you review this online strategy, do you think there needs to be a major shift towards a broader SKU assortment? Obviously, Amazon's got Marketplace. Walmart's building marketplace. Target's chosen not to. Do you think as part of that convenience factor, Costco just needs to materially up their SKU count online?"

For the 12-week fiscal first quarter that ended 2 weeks ago, Sunday, this past Sunday, earnings came in at $1.24 a share, up 14% or $0.15 a share over last year's earning -- reported earnings per share of $1.09. A few items to point out as was mentioned in today's release. This year's first quarter benefited from a non-recurring $51 million legal settlement. This $51 million pretax figure represented a 19 basis point benefit to gross margin and a benefit to first quarter's earnings per share of $0.07 a share.
Last year in the first quarter, there were 2 non-recurring items that we mentioned that, together, negatively impacted last year's earnings results. In that quarter, we recorded a $22 million pretax charge, which represented an 8 basis point impact to SG&A to the negative and a reduction in last year's first quarter earnings of $0.04 a share.
Stock compensation expense was 13% or $25 million higher year-over-year, so $0.04 a share more. There are about 4,800 people in -- of our employees that received restrictive stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October in our fiscal first quarter and then typically vest over a 5-year period with accelerated vesting when the recipient reaches 25, 30 and 35 years of employment with the company. Factors driving this increase included additional levels of accelerated vesting given the rising number of our employees achieving long tenure with the company; an increased stock price with a 5-year-ago grant coming off when the -- coming off of the thing when the stock price was in the $80s to last year's grant when the stock price was in the $150s; and of course, having a larger number of employees to plan. Note that the $25 million year-over-year increase in Q1 is larger -- is a larger year-over-year dollar increase than we'd expect to record in each of the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters of this year given the October RSU grant cycle.
Next, gas profitability. Our profits from gas during the quarter as compared to last year's first quarter were lower by about $20 million pretax or $0.03 a share, primarily a function of last year's very strong profit results in the first quarter for gas.
Fifth, IT costs. These expenses negatively impacted SG&A in the first quarter on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $18 million or 5 basis points to SG&A, which is about $0.025 a share.
And lastly, when I get to the discussion on year-over-year gross margin and SG&A comparisons, I'll review with you the very positive impact that our new Citi Visa deal has had on margins, SG&A and of course, our bottom line.
Turning to the first quarter sales. Total reported sales were up 3%, and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure on a reported basis came in at 1% year-over-year. Comp sales were negatively impacted by weaker FX relative to the U.S. dollar and slightly impacted by gas price deflation for a combined negative impact to the reported account number of about 0.75% of sales. Excluding gas deflation, the reported 1% U.S. comp figure for Q1 remained at 1%. The reported Canadian comp figure of plus 4% would have been plus 5% ex gas deflation and FX. And the reported 0 other international comp figure, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 3%. Total comps reported 1% for the quarter, again, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 2%. And of course, this plus 2% total company adjusted figure is also being impacted by increases in deflation and other merchandising categories overall, primarily in food and hardline -- foods and hardlines.
In terms of new openings, in the first quarter, we opened 9 new locations, which included 1 relo so a net increase of 8. And later in the call, I'll discuss our upcoming expansion plans for the balance of the fiscal year. This afternoon, I'll also touch on membership trends and renewal rates, again, discuss margins and SG&A in Q1, update on the Citi Visa, the new Citi Visa relationship and the card and which we began offering in the U.S. and Puerto Rico this past June 20 during the fiscal fourth quarter of '16, talk about e-commerce and then a couple of other items of note.
So going down the income statement, again, sales for the first quarter for the 12 weeks ended November 20 were $27.5 billion, up 3% from last year's first quarter $26.6 million and again, on a comp basis, reported 1% in ex gas and FX, up 2%. Again, net up 2% still being impacted by other aspects of deflation that we hadn't called out historically.
For the quarter, the plus 1% reported comp results were a combination of an average transaction decrease of 1.3% on a reported basis and an average shopping frequency increase of 2.2% to the positive. Now the average transaction decrease of 1.3%, this includes again the combined headwinds of FX and gas that I mentioned, which is about 0.75% and I'm sure other levels of deflation in other categories. I'll give some examples of that later in the call.
In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, within the U.S., Northwest, Texas and Midwest show the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, U.K. and Korea.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter in terms of sales for those, within food and sundries, overall flat year-over-year with spirits, sundries and deli coming in best. Tobacco, of course, as I mentioned on the last call, was down a little over 20% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. These -- as I mentioned before, these big tobacco declines should anniversary this coming spring.
For hardlines, also flat year-over-year. The departments with the strong results were hardware, tires and health and beauty aids. To give you an example of deflation, which is impacting this department, in November, for example, our reported November sales, TV sales in dollars were up 2% and units were up 17% so quite a bit of deflation on big ticket items as well us some of the fresh foods items that I mentioned earlier. Within softlines, up low single-digit comps with apparels, small electrics and special events being the standouts. And within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest departments. And in ancillary businesses, hearing aids and optical show the best results.  Again, in recent months, we've seen additional deflation overall in the low to mid-single-digit range in many food and fresh meat categories and a little more in some of the other non-food areas, as I mentioned, like electronics.
Moving to the line items in the income statement. Membership fees, good results for the first quarter, coming in at 6% and 6 basis points as a percent of sales, up $37 million year-over-year. In terms of membership fees, it's good renewal rates, 90% U.S. and Canada -- actually, 90.3% and 88% worldwide, rounding up to 88%. Continued increasing penetration of the Executive Membership, and in terms of number of members in Q1 end, compared to fiscal year-end, 12 weeks earlier, Gold Star, which stood at 36.8 million accounts. At Q1 end, it was 37.1 million. Primary business was 7.3 million both at fiscal year-end and at Q1 end. Business add-ons, 3.5 million and 3.5 million. For total membership, household memberships, 47.6 million at fiscal year-end and up to 47.9 million at first quarter end. And given that many of the people have 2 cards -- many of the accounts have 2 cards, at fiscal year-end, we stood at 86.7 million of cardholders and at first quarter end, 87.3 million people with a membership card.
At November 20 first quarter end, Executive Members stood at 17.7 million member households, an increase of 348,000 since the end of the previous quarter. That's about 29,000 additional Executive Members per week increase during the 12-week quarter. And as I've said before, members -- Executive Members are a little over 1/3 of our base and a little bit more than 2/3 of our sales where Executive Members are offered.
In terms of renewal rates, our business renewal rate, which at fiscal year-end stood at 94.4%, came in at 94.3% renewal rate as of first quarter end. Gold Star at 89.5% both at fiscal year-end and first quarter end for a total 90.3% at fiscal year-end, and it remained at 90.3% at first quarter end.  Worldwide at year-end, it was 87.6%, and it ticked to 87.5% at first quarter end.
As you know, it's been probably almost 2 years in Canada when we converted to the MasterCard, and with that, we saw, as we would have expected, a decline -- a slight decline in renewal rate. As what -- as occurred in Q4 '16 this past summer, we saw that finally reverse and saw an uptick in renewal rates in Canada, and that continued in Q1 of this fiscal year, too. And we're announcing the same thing in the U.S. It ticked down a little bit over the last couple of quarters, and it ticked down a little bit as well in Q1. We don't see any issues there at that point -- at this point.
Regarding membership fees, at the beginning of this past September or beginning of our fiscal year, we increased membership fees in our Asia operations, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, as well as in Mexico and the U.K. And again, that's because -- due to deferred accounting. It's about 15% of our membership fee income base and due to deferred accounting. And the fact that they're rolling over the next 12 months since September, that'll be a little less than a $0.01 a share a quarter.
Before continuing down the income statement line items, a quick update on the Citi Visa card offering. This past June 20, midway through the fourth quarter of fiscal '16, we stopped accepting Amex, American Express, at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and at costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including, of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. The new card's great in terms of increased cash back rewards for our members and great for us as well in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years and of course, lowering our effective merchant fees related to the new program.
In terms of new card, as I -- as was mentioned over the last couple of quarters on these calls, there were approximately 11.4 million Amex, American Express, co-branded cards or about 7.8 million accounts that were transferred from American Express to Citi for conversion to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. Over 85% of the accounts transferred over have been activated, and since the June 20 cutover several months ago, we have 1 million members that have signed up for and have been approved for the new Citi Visa card. Most of them have it on hand, but to the extent that was last couple of weeks, they may haven't gotten the card yet. In terms of conversion, usage and new sign-ups for the card, all good so far.
Now turning to gross margin, our reported gross margin in the fourth -- in the first quarter was higher year-over-year by 29 basis points coming in at 11.58% this year versus 11.29% last year. As usual, I'll have you jot down for the quarter a few numbers. We'll just make it 2 columns for the quarter: reported and without gas deflation. In terms of core merchandising, year-over-year in the first quarter, core merchandising was up 19 basis points, up 16 without gas deflation. Ancillary businesses down 5% -- minus 5 year-over-year and for the quarter, minus 6 without deflation; 2% reward minus 2 in the quarter on a reported basis, minus 1 without gas deflation; LIFO, minus 2 and minus 2; other, which is the big onetime -- the big non-recurring benefit we got from a litigation settlement, plus 19 basis points both for the reported and without gas. All told, for the quarter we reported again a 29 basis point improvement and ex gas deflation, 26 basis points. So overall, again, 26 basis points up on a kind of ex gas basis. The core merchandise component was higher by 19 basis points year-over-year and again, 16 without the gas deflation.
The majority of the core gross margin increase already taking out -- we've separated out already the onetime legal settlement, about 13 basis points of that 16, if you will, was due to higher year-over-year revenue share and bounties associated with the new Citi Visa agreement. Some of those monies go to the revenue line as its revenue share.
The gross margin of our -- notwithstanding that, the gross margin of our core merchandising categories, which are the food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, those -- that gross margin as percent of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the first quarter by 17 basis points with food and sundries, hardlines and fresh foods all showing higher year-over-year margins and softlines being down a little bit year-over-year. And then one of the impacts was the warmth of the season and outerwear issues.
Ancillary and other business gross margin was down 5 basis points, 6 basis points ex gas deflation in the quarter, all a function of lower year-over-year gas profits as I discussed earlier in the call. Ex gas lean operations, all other ancillary and other business gross margins were up 6 basis points.
2% Reward, again, ex gas, a negative impact of 1 basis point, and that's to the margin. That's a sales penetration, and the associated Executive Member rewards from our Executive Members continue to grow.
LIFO in the first quarter this year, we did not both get a LIFO credit or charge compared to a 2 basis point positive or $5 million pretax credit last year in the quarter. And lastly, the onetime non-recurring legal settlement, this benefited Q1 gross margin by 19 basis points as we discussed at beginning of the call.
Moving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentage in the first quarter year-over-year was higher by 16 basis points on a reported basis and by 13 basis points ex gas deflation. Again, I'll have you just jot down a few line items. Core operations for the quarter was higher or negative 8 basis points and without gas, a negative 6; central, higher by 9 and 9, both reported and without gas deflation; stock compensation expense, minus 7 and minus 6; other, plus 8 and plus 8. That's that rough $20 million or $22 million amount that I told you about earlier in the call that impacted SG&A to the positive last year versus no -- nothing this year. And again, reported SG&A was higher by 16 basis points in the quarter, higher by 13 ex gas deflation.
The core operations component of SG&A, again, in the chart, shows 8% higher and -- I'm sorry, 8 basis points higher year-over-year reported and 6 ex gas. This minus 6 consisted of higher payroll and benefits of about 31 basis points year-over-year. That's certainly impacted by the lower sales result, and certainly, that's impacted by the deflation. I'll give you a couple of examples of that later. This was primarily offset by lower year-over-year merchant fees as a result of the switch to Citi Visa. That had a benefit to the SG&A line of 25 basis -- plus 25 basis points impact to the positive.
Central expense was higher year-over-year in Q1 by 9. Increased IT spending, again, as I mentioned, was 5 of that. Stock compensation expense, higher by 5 or 6 without gas. And lastly, the other I'd mention, the plus 8 was nonrecurring in nature.
Next, on the income statement line, preopening expense, it was $4 million lower this year versus last year coming in at $22 million versus $26 million a year ago, really a function of openings. This year in Q1, we had 9 openings, last year 13. Each of those -- the 9 included 1 relo in the 13 last year and then first quarter included 2 relos, pretty much in line with that number of openings. All told, operating income in the first quarter came in up $82 million or 11% but up $9 million or 1% year-over-year, excluding the -- just the non-recurring items that I previously mentioned.
Below the operating income line, interest expense in the first quarter came in at $29 million this year versus $33 million in last year, lower due to the retirement of some senior notes in December of last year. Interest income and other was lower by $2 million in the quarter coming in at $26 million versus $28 million a year ago. Actual interest income and other -- actual interest, I think, for the quarter was better year-over-year. This is offset by approximately $4.5 million in charges related to the FX transactions that usually fluctuate pluses or minus in the 0 to $10 million rage, so no surprises there.
Overall, reported pretax income on a reported basis was higher by 11%, again, higher by 1% ex those non-recurring items that I mentioned earlier in the call. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter came in at 34.4% for the quarter compared to 36.1% last year. We benefited from a couple of positive discrete items this year in Q1. Our effective -- anticipated effective rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35.2% as best we can tell at this point.
Overall, reported net income, $545 million this year, up from -- up $65 million from $480 million last year, so an increase of 14%, ex the non-recurring items that I mentioned, up 3%.
Next for a quick rundown of other topics. While the balance sheet is included in this morning's -- in this afternoon's press release, a couple of the balance sheet inflow items. Depreciation and amortization from the cash flow statement, which is not here, for the quarter came in at $297 million for the quarter. Accounts payable, if you look at -- one of the things we always look at is our accounts payable as a percent of inventories. It report -- on a reported basis, it was up from 100% a year ago in the quarter and 203%. If you take out non-merchandise payables, more of accounts payable merchandise versus inventories, it improved from a 90% to a 93% from last year's first quarter end to this year's first quarter end. Average inventory per warehouse was actually lower by about $67,000 per warehouse coming in at -- right at $14.9 million a year ago and $14.83 million per location this year.
FX was -- of that roughly $70,000 lower, FX was about $170,000 lower, just the impact of FX. So about $100,000 net if you would assume flat FX. That's about what majors was up. Electronics, it was up $117,000, So really not a lot of pluses and minuses over sub departments but pretty much in line and pretty much flat year-over-year.
In terms of CapEx, we spent approximately $670 million during the quarter, and our estimate for the whole year, as I mentioned, hasn't changed from last quarter end. Our expectation for fiscal year '17 is somewhere in the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion range compared to $2.6 billion for all of fiscal '16.
Next, Costco Online. We're now in, of course, in the U.S., Canada, U.K, Mexico and more recently, Korea and Taiwan. For the first quarter, sales and profits were up. Total online sales were up 8% in the quarter and 7% on a comp basis, pretty choppy. Essentially, the first several weeks and the last several weeks of the quarter were in the mid-singles with the middle part of it in the low doubles if you will. I want to point out that over the past 3 weeks, and that would include the last week of Q1, which is the Thanksgiving week, and the first 2 weeks of our second fiscal quarter, e-comm sales were up in the low to mid-teens and including similar results for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And of course, that's notwithstanding significant amount of TV sales, which were essentially flat in dollars and up 15% in units.
Lastly, as it relates to our online business, we're improving our offerings and enhancing our member experience. I touched on this a little bit last quarter's call. Our current focus comes in 3 primary areas in terms of improving merchandise first. We're adding more exciting high-end branded merchandise on an everyday basis. We're improving in-stocks of high-velocity items, and there's a few other things that we'll be doing coming the first couple of months of the new calendar year.
Second, we're improving the experience and functionality of our site. We're improving our search. We have and are continuing to do that. We've shortened the checkout process from many clicks to 2 and so a big improvement, recognizing this is new for us. We're simplifying and automating our returns process, a much better experience, particularly on big ticket items, and we've seen great improvement in that in the last several weeks. And we're improving our member's ability to track their orders. Again, that's something that we weren't terribly good at historically.
And we're improving -- and thirdly, we're improving our distribution logistics. We've increased the number of depots from where we fill online orders, so closer and faster and less expensive delivery. And again, look for more improved and quicker distribution comments for us in early calendar '17.
Next, in terms of expansion, I mentioned we had 8 net new units this year, this fiscal first quarter. We plan 2 for Q2, a net of 5 for Q3, so ex relocations and a net of 16 in Q4 for anticipated number for the year of net new units of 31, 34 less the 3 relos, so 31 net new locations. Last year, recall we opened 29 so about 4.5% square footage growth. If we get to the 31, that would be about the same, about 4.25 plus square footage growth. Assuming the 31 net new openings, fiscal '17 locations by country will be 16 in the U.S. Mind you that last year it was 21 out of 29 in the U.S., 8 in Canada, which is quite a number for Canada, and 1 each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico as well as France, our first in France, and also 1 in Iceland. Note that these include our first locations to open in France and Iceland. And again, those will be in late spring and early summer.
Now as you can tell by the quarterly dispersion of these, about half of the 31 planned openings are scheduled in Q4. To the extent a couple of those could slip into the next fiscal year, so be it. So somewhere in the high -- very high 20s, if not, 30 or 31 is what we would expect. As of first quarter end, our total square footage stood at 104.5 million square feet.
In terms of common stock repurchases, for the first quarter, we repurchased 809,000 shares for a total of $122 million or an average price of $151 a share. That compares to all of fiscal '16 when we repurchased $477 million, 3.2 million shares at an average price of just under $150 a share.
In terms of dividends, our currently quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share, and that was a 12.5% increase. And that was effective last spring, 12.5% increase from the prior $0.40 a share. So $0.45 a share in the quarter, so that yearly $1.80 dividend represents an annual cost to the company of just under $800 million.
Lastly, before I turn it back for Q&A, our fiscal 2017 second quarter schedule earnings release date for the 12-week second quarter ending February 12 will be after market close on Thursday, March 2 for the earnings call that afternoon at 2:00 Pacific Time.
I will now turn it back to Kimberlan for -- and open up for questions and answers."

There's also some other aspects of it. Again, there's lots of little pieces, but those are 2 of the bigger ones. On the merchant side -- on the fee side rather, I think some of it's related to the fact that we're making estimates of the different reward buckets, if you will, gas at 4%, Costco at 2%, those velocity categories at 3%. Again, there's all kinds of equations there that as that changes, there's some gearing, and so it's all good at this point."

And while it's raining on everybody as it relates to higher levels of deflation, we're known for deflating the sale price sooner and faster, and certainly, one other soundbite example would be meat sales. Just in the month of November, meat sales were up 6% in dollars and 16% in pounds. That's the kind of stuff that this deflation, it's impacting all retailers of course, and it's probably impacting a lower margin quicker to pass it on up or down and certainly down faster, so all those things go into play.

And we know we'll sell more, and each of us and our suppliers will make a little more times -- a little less more times. And that's what we do -- that's what we're always doing. We see that at every monthly budget meeting. And so I think that we'll continue to do what we do. We're certainly not going to benefit from every extra dollar of income.

It's hypothetical, but over the next couple of years, if the performance of the program continues to go in the -- which way we expected to in the right direction and our piece of that action, if you will, versus the rewards that our members are getting, you'd expect us to see this -- change that over time. But we're way too early to even think about that. Historically, as it relates to membership fee increases, we usually invest that back in the business, a lot of that in terms of competitiveness and pricing, and it kind of eases in over the next several years and into -- more fully into the bottom line notwithstanding the fact that membership fee increases take about 8 fiscal quarters to get into the income statement on the membership line because of deferred accounting. So I don't think -- first of all, we certainly haven't done anything different. As we've seen in some examples where we do comp shops versus certain others, where that moat has gotten bigger, if you will, that gap has gotten wider, we haven't said, hey, let's use this to get a few extra basis points of margin.

I think the things that we're doing are -- we're doing offensively, not defensively, but we were also probably a little stubborn along the way to suggest -- I mean, there are some extreme examples of when a member orders a big-ticket item, electronics or white goods or whatever, and the delivery window is much larger than anyone else's. I mean, when they want to know what -- they like to know what pops up the calendar, here it goes. When they want to return it, that process was not very good. And some of these are quick fixes. Search was not very good. That's been a quick fix to get a significant improvement, and we'll get some more improvement.

I think, usually when we ask, there's another [ph] 3 to 6 points of whatever. And when it gets to the anniversary-ing of it, there's been some huge swings, some huge example of swings on some nuts, which last year doubled and they're now down 35%. There's -- eggs, of course, are down well over 60% year-over-year, so -- and we're not -- if eggs were down even 50%, it doesn't mean that people are going to eat twice as many eggs to have flat sales. They're going to eat some more eggs but not that many. So -- by the way, a few of those things may help in the bakery -- the margins in the bakery. We're also not going change the package -- the cost of 16 muffins -- or 15 muffins. So overall, I think the feeling it has given that the last few months had been a little more deflationary. The view is, is that it's another few months of that, but they all believe that it's going to come back the other way. But this by no -- this is a lot of estimated semi-educated guesses among different departments."

The percent probably changes a little downwards, so that would imply perhaps a little bit of improvement in dollars. But it should be all over the board. Gas is an extreme example. It's a low-margin competitive business. As prices tumbled dramatically across general competition, prices were lower but not nearly proportional to the amount of savings to that retailer. We were able to improve our margins a little and widened the gap. That's a win-win. Another silly example is organics. Organics, the -- because there's perhaps a little bit of less price elasticity to organic prices, we're able to make a little more margin, not a lot and have a wider value proposition versus others. So those are good things for us. Generally speaking, when there was cost inflation on milk and cheese and things like that, we would point out, as you know historically in some of those quarters where we kept the chicken at $4.99 and margins went down essentially from something to nothing to the tune of $40 million a year on 1 item. That was 4, 5 years ago, 4 years ago. Conversely, when cheese prices fell, food court margins went up nicely because we've always -- we never really changed the price of a slice of pizza. So there's lots of little things that aren't -- don't fit in a square box or a round hole here. I would say, generally, a low inflation is good. It helps sales. It's -- and we could be more competitive both up and down, and when prices are going up, it probably is a little bit more margin beneficial but not a lot."

We think that some of the things that we do in-store will keep them coming. So far, it's not been an issue. And even -- one thing -- while we've tried to point out these things each quarter in terms of traffic, in terms of even when traffic was impacted a little bit and we're asked that $64,000 question, is it all these other things, we see some of the categories that 1 would think would have been impacted negatively by it aren't being impacted negatively. In terms of click and pickup, we looked at it, and we are not prepared to do that at this point. When we see it in other places, not just the other warehouse club, there's -- you need space for it or you need a lot less volume and a location for it. Neither of which we have. And we're not getting a lot of demands for it. We do that at the business centers. You can log [ph] order and get delivered. And so that's more for the business member, not the individual. And we recognize that we're not the retailer that are going to sell you a smaller pack size or something at even a little bit better -- higher margin. That's not what we do. Now time will tell over time. We're not -- there's a lot of things that are going on out there. We're looking at them. We've all seen the video from earlier this week about you just walk in. There's a lot of other brick and mortars that my guess would be far more impacted than us on that, but we'll have to wait and see. Again, we're going to -- if renewal rate trends change -- by the way, we even see in the markets where we've done things with Google and where we worked with Instacart as well, Google Express and Instacart. Probably the most extreme example would be the Bay Area, where we started with Google, and that was their first market. And certainly, that's where they're headquartered. And it's doing fine. What we've found is an existing loyal member is coming in a few less times a year, is shopping several more times, well, certainly several more because it was 0 but shopping more. But the sum of the 2 is more. They buy a lot less when they're doing it online than when they come in. And part of that is the experience of walking in and seeing it all there.

Needless to say, there's a lot more efficient things today. We continue to look at scan-and-go type things. We are not testing it currently, but we are looking at it. And I'm not suggesting we're going to do it. We have done self checkout for a while. We've chosen to not do self checkout in higher-volume units because we can get people through without it. And as it relates -- you had asked -- in terms of millennials and Generation Z, all those numbers are doing better for us, and part of it is things like not that we sat down and strategically, how do we get them. We have a great value proposition. Certainly, some of the things that we sell like organics is a -- in my view, is a big impact to that. Certainly, some of the things we do, we've done a couple of tests with LivingSocial over the last couple of years, all of those things, we think, help. As it relates -- you asked a question about Amazon, and Amazon is also the word for everything out there that's delivered or .com and everything else, and certainly, they're doing a lot of things. We want to make sure we understand what all of these people are doing. We do -- and not just from a competitive price shop and whether it's them or someone else. We recognize convenience is a value, but there's also some things that we can and can't do. So I think that we're looking at these things offensively, not defensively at this point. I don't think that -- I think we're encouraged when we see the level of millennials, if you will, that are signing up, when we see the average age of our membership coming down. Now it was just a couple years ago when the average U.S. Costco adult member was 4-plus years older than the population as a whole. Now it's a little under 2. And that's without a lot of planning, but it's part of what we do. And I think part of that's the merchandise selection and our ability to change merchandise pretty quickly. And certainly, things like, again, organic stand out in a big way. I think the fact of what we're doing even on some things that aren't directly -- they're all related to the business but ESG and sustainability, how we take care of our employees, the culture, those are things that, again, we didn't say we have to do better at that. We do best at that. We do a lot of good things like that. When it comes down to merchandising, we believe that organics, the KS, what we're very good at is driving value, and we're probably not going to be a person that's the best at delivering smaller-sized goods to your house. There are some things we're going to do between that and nothing, and again, stay tuned for calendar '17."

And in light of that, there's been a lot of debate around the traffic just north of 2% or just under 3% depending on the month and a lot of questions around convenience. And I just wonder, as you review this online strategy, do you think there needs to be a major shift towards a broader SKU assortment? Obviously, Amazon's got Marketplace. Walmart's building marketplace. Target's chosen not to. Do you think as part of that convenience factor, Costco just needs to materially up their SKU count online?"

For the 12-week fiscal first quarter that ended 2 weeks ago, Sunday, this past Sunday, earnings came in at $1.24 a share, up 14% or $0.15 a share over last year's earning -- reported earnings per share of $1.09. A few items to point out as was mentioned in today's release. This year's first quarter benefited from a nonrecurring $51 million legal settlement. This $51 million pretax figure represented a 19-basis-point benefit to gross margin and a benefit to first quarter's earnings per share of $0.07 a share.
Last year in the first quarter, there were 2 nonrecurring items that we mentioned that, together, negatively impacted last year's earnings results. In that quarter, we recorded a $22 million pretax charge, which represented an 8-basis-point impact to SG&A to the negative and a reduction in last year's first quarter earnings of $0.04 a share.
Stock compensation expense was 13% or $25 million higher year-over-year, so $0.04 a share more. There are about 4,800 people in -- of our employees that receive restrictive stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October in our fiscal first quarter and then typically vest over a 5-year period, with accelerated vesting when the recipient reaches 25, 30 and 35 years of employment with the company. Factors driving this increase included additional levels of accelerated vesting given the rising number of our employees achieving long tenure with the company; an increased stock price with a 5-year-ago grant coming off when the stock -- coming off of the thing when the stock price was in the $80s to last year's grant when the stock price was in the $150s; and of course, having a larger number of employees to plan. Note that the $25 million year-over-year increase in Q1 is larger -- is a larger year-over-year dollar increase than we'd expect to record in each of the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters of this year given the October RSU grant cycle.
Next, gas profitability. Our profits from gas during the quarter as compared to last year's first quarter were lower by about $20 million pretax or $0.03 a share, primarily a function of last year's very strong profit results in the first quarter for gas.
Fifth, IT costs. These expenses negatively impacted SG&A in the first quarter on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $18 million or 5 basis points to SG&A, which is about $0.025 a share.
And lastly, when I get to the discussion on year-over-year gross margin and SG&A comparisons, I'll review with you the very positive impact that our new Citi Visa deal has had on margins, SG&A and of course, our bottom line.
Turning to the first quarter sales. Total reported sales were up 3%, and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure on a reported basis came in at 1% year-over-year. Comp sales were negatively impacted by weaker FX relative to the U.S. dollar and slightly impacted by gas price deflation for a combined negative impact to the reported account number of about 0.75% of sales. Excluding gas deflation, the reported 1% U.S. comp figure for Q1 remained at 1%. The reported Canadian comp figure of plus 4% would have been plus 5% ex gas deflation and FX. And the reported 0% other international comp figure, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 3%. Total comps reported 1% for the quarter, again, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 2%. And of course, this plus 2% total company adjusted figure is also being impacted by increases in deflation and other merchandising categories overall, primarily in food and hardline -- foods and hardlines.
In terms of new openings, in the first quarter, we opened 9 new locations, which included 1 relo so a net increase of 8. And later in the call, I'll discuss our upcoming expansion plans for the balance of the fiscal year. This afternoon, I'll also touch on membership trends and renewal rates, again, discuss margins and SG&A in Q1, update on the Citi Visa, the new Citi Visa relationship and the card and which we began offering in the U.S. and Puerto Rico this past June 20 during the fiscal fourth quarter of '16, talk about e-commerce and then a couple of other items of note.
So going down the income statement, again, sales for the first quarter for the 12 weeks ended November 20 were $27.5 billion, up 3% from last year's first quarter $26.6 million and again, on a comp basis, reported 1% in ex gas and FX, up 2%. Again, that up 2% still being impacted by other aspects of deflation that we hadn't called out historically.
For the quarter, the plus 1% reported comp results were a combination of an average transaction decrease of 1.3% on a reported basis and an average shopping frequency increase of 2.2% to the positive. Now the average transaction decrease of 1.3%, this includes again the combined headwinds of FX and gas that I mentioned, which is about 0.75% and I'm sure other levels of deflation in other categories. I'll give some examples of that later in the call.
In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, within the U.S., Northwest, Texas and Midwest show the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, U.K. and Korea.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, in terms of sales for those, within food and sundries, overall flat year-over-year with spirits, sundries and deli coming in best. Tobacco, of course, as I mentioned on the last call, was down a little over 20% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. These -- as I mentioned before, these big tobacco declines should anniversary this coming spring.
For hardlines, also flat year-over-year. The departments with the strong results were hardware, tires and health and beauty aids. I'll give you an example of deflation, which is impacting this department. In November, for example, our reported November sales, TV sales in dollars were up 2% and units were up 17% so quite a bit of deflation on big ticket items as well us some of the fresh foods items that I mentioned earlier. 
Within softlines, up low single-digit comps with apparels, small electrics and special events being the standouts. And within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest departments. And in ancillary businesses, hearing aids and optical show the best results.  Again, in recent months, we've seen additional deflation overall in the low to mid-single-digit range in many food and fresh meat categories and a little more in some of the other non-food areas, as I mentioned, like electronics.
Moving to the line items in the income statement. Membership fees, good results for the first quarter, coming in up 6% and 6 basis points as a percent of sales, up $37 million year-over-year. In terms of membership fees, it's good renewal rates, 90% U.S. and Canada -- actually, 90.3% and 88% worldwide, rounding up to 88%. Continued increasing penetration of the Executive Membership, and in terms of number of members at Q1 end, compared to fiscal year-end, 12 weeks earlier, Gold Star stood at 36.8 million accounts. At Q1 end, it was 37.1 million. Primary business was 7.3 million both at fiscal year-end and at Q1 end. Business add-ons, 3.5 million and 3.5 million. For total membership, household memberships, 47.6 million at fiscal year-end and up to 47.9 million at first quarter end. And given that many of the people have 2 cards -- many of the accounts have 2 cards, at fiscal year-end, we stood at 86.7 million of cardholders and at first quarter end, 87.3 million people with a membership card.
At November 20 first quarter end, Executive Members stood at 17.7 million member households, an increase of 348,000 since the end of the previous quarter. That's about 29,000 additional Executive Members per week increase during the 12-week quarter. And as I've said before, members -- Executive Members are a little over 1/3 of our base and a little bit more than 2/3 of our sales where Executive Members are offered.
In terms of renewal rates, our business renewal rate, which at fiscal year-end stood at 94.4%, came in at 94.3% renewal rate as of first quarter end. Gold Star at 89.5% both at fiscal year-end and first quarter end for a total 90.3% at fiscal year-end, and it remained at 90.3% at first quarter end. Worldwide at year-end, it was 87.6%, and it ticked to 87.5% at first quarter end.
As you know, it's been probably almost 2 years in Canada when we converted to the MasterCard, and with that, we saw, as we would have expected, a decline -- a slight decline in renewal rate. As what -- as occurred in Q4 '16 this past summer, we saw that finally reverse and saw an uptick in renewal rates in Canada, and that continued in Q1 of this fiscal year, too. And we're announcing the same thing in the U.S. It ticked down a little bit over the last couple of quarters, and it ticked down a little bit as well in Q1. We don't see any issues there at that point -- at this point.
Regarding membership fees, at the beginning of this past September or beginning of our fiscal year, we increased membership fees in our Asia operations, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, as well as in Mexico and the U.K. And again, that's because -- due to deferred accounting. It's about 15% of our membership fee income base and due to deferred accounting. And the fact that they'll roll in over the next 12 months since September, that'll be a little less than a $0.01 a share a quarter.
Before continuing down the income statement line items, a quick update on the Citi Visa card offering. This past June 20, midway through the fourth quarter of fiscal '16, we stopped accepting Amex, American Express, at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and at costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including, of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. The new card's great in terms of increased cash back rewards for our members and great for us as well in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years and of course, lowering our effective merchant fees related to the new program.
In terms of new card, as I -- as was mentioned over the last couple of quarters on these calls, there were approximately 11.4 million Amex, American Express, co-branded cards or about 7.5 million accounts that were transferred from American Express to Citi for conversion to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. Over 85% of the accounts transferred over have been activated, and since the June 20 cutover, several months ago, we have 1 million members that have signed up for and have been approved for the new Citi Visa card. Most of them have it in hand, but to the extent it was the last couple of weeks, they may not have gotten the card yet. In terms of conversion, usage and new sign-ups for the card, all good so far.
Now turning to gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the fourth -- in the first quarter was higher year-over-year by 29 basis points coming in at 11.58% this year versus 11.29% last year. As usual, I'll have you jot down for the quarter a few numbers. We'll just make the 2 columns for the quarter reported and without gas deflation. In terms of core merchandising, year-over-year in the first quarter, core merchandising was up 19 basis points, up 16 without gas deflation. Ancillary businesses down 5% -- minus 5 year-over-year and for the quarter, minus 6 without deflation; 2% reward minus 2 in the quarter on a reported basis, minus 1 without gas deflation; LIFO, minus 2 and minus 2; other, which is the big onetime -- the big non-recurring benefit we got from a litigation settlement, plus 19 basis points both for the reported and without gas. All told, for the quarter we reported again a 29-basis-point improvement and ex gas deflation, 26 basis points. So overall, again, 26 basis points up on a kind of ex gas basis. The core merchandise component was higher by 19 basis points year-over-year and again, 16 without the gas deflation.
The majority of the core gross margin increase already taking out -- we've separated out already the onetime legal settlement, about 13 basis points of that 16, if you will, was due to higher year-over-year revenue share and bounties associated with the new Citi Visa agreement. Some of those monies go to the revenue line as its revenue share.
The gross margin of our -- notwithstanding that, the gross margin of our core merchandising categories, which are the food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, those -- that gross margin as a percent of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the first quarter by 17 basis points with food and sundries, hardlines and fresh foods all showing higher year-over-year margins and softlines being down a little bit year-over-year. I know one of the impacts was the warmth of the season and outerwear issues.
Ancillary and other business gross margin was down 5 basis points, 6 basis points ex gas deflation in the quarter, all a function of lower year-over-year gas profits as I discussed earlier in the call. Ex gas lean operations, all other ancillary and other business gross margins were up 6 basis points.
2% Reward, again, ex gas, a negative impact of 1 basis point, and that's to margin. That's a sales penetration, and the associated Executive Member rewards from our Executive Members continue to grow.
LIFO in the first quarter this year, we did not book get a LIFO credit or charge compared to a 2-basis-point positive or a $5 million pretax credit last year in the quarter. 
And lastly, the onetime non-recurring legal settlement, this benefited Q1 gross margin by 19 basis points as we discussed at beginning of the call.
Moving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentage in the first quarter year-over-year was higher by 16 basis points on a reported basis and by 13 basis points ex gas deflation. Again, I'll have you just jot down a few line items. Core operations for the quarter was higher or a negative 8 basis points and without gas, a negative 6; central, higher by 9 and 9, both reported and without gas deflation; stock compensation expense, minus 7 and minus 6; other, plus 8 and plus 8. That's that rough $20 million or $22 million amount that I told you about earlier in the call that impacted SG&A to the positive last year versus no -- nothing this year. And again, reported SG&A was higher by 16 basis points in the quarter, higher by 13 ex gas deflation.
The core operations component of SG&A, again, in the chart, shows 8% higher and -- I'm sorry, 8 basis points higher year-over-year reported and 6 ex gas. This minus 6 consisted of higher payroll and benefits of about 31 basis points year-over-year. That's certainly impacted by the lower sales result, and certainly, that's impacted by the deflation. I'll give you a couple of examples of that later. This was primarily offset by lower year-over-year merchant fees as a result of the switch to Citi Visa. That had a benefit to the SG&A line of 25 basis -- plus 25 basis points impact to the positive.
Central expense was higher year-over-year in Q1 by 9. Increased IT spending, again, as I mentioned, was 5 of that. Stock compensation expense, higher by 5 or 6 without gas. And lastly, the other item I mentioned, the plus 8 was nonrecurring in nature.
Next, on the income statement line, preopening expense, it was $4 million lower this year versus last year coming in at $22 million versus $26 million a year ago, really a function of openings. This year in Q1, we had 9 openings, last year 13. Each of those -- the 9 included 1 relo in the 13 last year and then first quarter included 2 relos, pretty much in line with that number of openings. All told, operating income in the first quarter came in up $82 million or 11% but up $9 million or 1% year-over-year, excluding the -- just the non-recurring items that I previously mentioned.
Below the operating income line, interest expense in the first quarter came in at $29 million this year versus $33 million in last year, lower due to the retirement of some senior notes in December of last year. Interest income and other was lower by $2 million in the quarter coming in at $26 million versus $28 million a year ago. Actual interest income and other -- actual interest income for the quarter was better year-over-year. This was offset by approximately $4.5 million in charges related to the FX transactions that usually fluctuate pluses or minus in the 0 to $10 million rage, so no surprises there.
Overall, reported pretax income on a reported basis was higher by 11%, again, higher by 1% ex those nonrecurring items that I mentioned earlier in the call. 
In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter came in at 34.4% for the quarter compared to 36.1% last year. We benefited from a couple of positive discrete items this year in Q1. Our effective -- anticipated effective rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35.2% as best we can tell at this point.
Overall, reported net income, $545 million this year, up from -- up $65 million from $480 million last year, so an increase of 14%; ex the nonrecurring items that I mentioned, up 3%.
Next for a quick rundown of other topics. While the balance sheet is included in this morning's -- in this afternoon's press release, a couple of the balance sheet inflow items. Depreciation and amortization from the cash flow statement, which is not here, for the quarter came in at $297 million for the quarter. Accounts payable, if you look at -- one of the things we always look at is our accounts payable as a percent of inventories. It report -- on a reported basis, it was up from 100% a year ago in the quarter end to 103%. If you take out non-merchandise payables, more of accounts payable merchandise versus inventories, it improved from a 90% to a 93% from last year's first quarter end to this year's first quarter end. Average inventory per warehouse was actually lower by about $67,000 per warehouse coming in at -- right at $14.9 million a year ago and $14.83 million per location this year.
FX was -- of that roughly $70,000 lower, FX was about $170,000 lower, just the impact of FX. So about $100,000 net if you would assume flat FX. That's about what majors was up. Electronics, it was up $117,000. So really, not a lot of pluses and minuses over sub departments but pretty much in line and pretty much flat year-over-year.
In terms of CapEx, we spent approximately $670 million during the quarter, and our estimate for the whole year, as I mentioned, hasn't changed from last quarter end. Our expectation for fiscal year '17 is somewhere in the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion range compared to $2.6 billion for all of fiscal '16.
Next, Costco Online. We're now in -- of course, in the U.S., Canada, U.K, Mexico and more recently, Korea and Taiwan. For the first quarter, sales and profits were up. Total online sales were up 8% in the quarter and 7% on a comp basis, pretty choppy. Essentially, the first several weeks and the last several weeks of the quarter were in the mid-singles with the middle part of it in the low doubles if you will. I want to point out that over the past 3 weeks, and that would include the last week of Q1, which is the Thanksgiving week, and the first 2 weeks of our second fiscal quarter, e-comm sales were up in the low to mid-teens and including similar results for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And of course, that's notwithstanding significant amount of TV sales, which were essentially flat in dollars and up 15% in units.
Lastly, as it relates to our online business, we're improving our offerings and enhancing our member experience. I touched on this a little bit last quarter's call. Our current focus comes in 3 primary area. In terms of improving merchandise first, we're adding more exciting high-end branded merchandise on an everyday basis. We're improving in-stocks of high-velocity items, and there's a few other things that we'll be doing coming the first couple of months of the new calendar year.
Second, we're improving the experience and functionality of our site. We're improving our search. We have and are continuing to do that. We've shortened the checkout process from many clicks to 2 and so a big improvement, recognizing this is new for us. We're simplifying and automating our returns process, a much better experience, particularly on big ticket items, and we've seen great improvement in that in the last several weeks. And we're improving our member's ability to track their orders. Again, that's something that we weren't terribly good at historically.
And we're improving -- and thirdly, we're improving our distribution logistics. We've increased the number of depots from where we fill online orders, so closer and faster and less expensive delivery. And again, look for more improved and quicker distribution comments from us in early calendar '17.
Next, in terms of expansion. I mentioned we had 8 net new units this year -- this fiscal first quarter. We plan 2 for Q2, a net of 5 for Q3, so ex relocations and a net of 16 in Q4 for anticipated number for the year of net new units of 31, 34 less the 3 relos, so 31 net new locations. Last year, recall we opened 29 so about 4.5% square footage growth. If we get to the 31, that would be about the same, about 4.25 plus square footage growth. Assuming the 31 net new openings, fiscal '17 locations by country will be 16 in the U.S. Mind you that last year it was 21 out of 29 in the U.S., 8 in Canada, which is quite a number for Canada, and 1 each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico as well as France, our first in France, and also 1 in Iceland. Note that these include our first locations to open in France and Iceland. And again, those will be in late spring and early summer.
Now as you can tell by the quarterly dispersion of these, about half of the 31 planned openings are scheduled in Q4. To the extent a couple of those could slip into the next fiscal year, so be it. So somewhere in the high -- very high 20s, if not, 30 or 31 is what we would expect. As of first quarter end, our total square footage stood at 104.5 million square feet.
In terms of common stock repurchases. For the first quarter, we repurchased 809,000 shares for a total of $122 million or an average price of $151 a share. That compares to all of fiscal '16 when we repurchased $477 million, 3.2 million shares at an average price of just under $150 a share.
In terms of dividends, our currently quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share, and that was a 12.5% increase. And that was effective last spring, 12.5% increase from the prior $0.40 a share. So $0.45 a share in the quarter, so that yearly $1.80 dividend represents an annual cost to the company of just under $800 million.
Lastly, before I turn it back for Q&A, our fiscal 2017 second quarter schedule earnings release date for the 12-week second quarter ending February 12 will be after market close on Thursday, March 2 for the earnings call that afternoon at 2:00 Pacific Time.
I will now turn it back to Kimberlan for -- and open up for questions and answers."

I think that's a little more than we'd anticipated. We knew and felt that, over time, it would go up because of the acceptance of Visa in terms of the penetration of Visa throughout all types of merchants, and that happened a little faster than we had anticipated. There's also some other aspects of it. Again, there's lots of little pieces, but those are 2 of the bigger ones. On the merchant side -- the fee side rather, I think some of it's related to the fact that we're making estimates of the different reward buckets, if you will, gas at 4%, Costco at 2%, those velocity categories at 3%. Again, there's all kinds of equations there that as that changes, there's some sharing, and so it's all good at this point."

As you know, we're going to invest in loyalty and growth. And while it's raining on everybody as it relates to higher levels of deflation, we're known for deflating the sale price sooner and faster, and certainly, one other sound bite example would be meat sales. Just in the month of November, meat sales were up 6% in dollars and 16% in pounds. That's the kind of stuff that this deflation, it's impacting all retailers of course, and it's probably impacting a lower margin quicker to pass it on up or down and certainly down faster, so all those things go into play. So time will tell."

We're constantly going back to every supplier with our purchasing power, with our buying power as it relates to -- and competition itself with private label, to figure out how can we bring the quantity up, the quality up and the price down. And we know we'll sell more, and each of us and our suppliers will make a little more times -- a little less more times. And that's what we do -- that's what we're always doing. We see that at every monthly budget meeting. And so I think that we'll continue to do what we do. We're certainly not going to benefit from every extra dollar of income. We're going to figure out how to use it to drive that competitive spirit and to drive our sales. And that's been a little tougher in this tough deflationary environment."

It's a new program. I would assume, over time, and this is -- who knows, it's hypothetical, but over the next couple of years, if the performance of the program continues to go in the -- which way we would expect it to in the right direction and our piece of that action, if you will, versus the rewards that our members are getting, you'd expect us to see us change that over time. But we're way too early to even think about that. Historically, as it relates to membership fee increases, we usually invest that back in the business, a lot of that in terms of competitiveness and pricing, and it kind of eases in over the next several years and into -- more fully into the bottom line notwithstanding the fact that membership fee increases take about 8 fiscal quarters to get into the income statement on the membership line because of deferred accounting. So I don't think -- first of all, we certainly haven't done anything different. As we've seen in some examples where we do comp shops versus certain others, where that moat has gotten bigger, if you will, that gap has gotten wider, we haven't said, hey, let's use this to get a few extra basis points of margin.

We know -- as Jim Sinegal said for 25-plus years and Craig Jelinek's said for now 5-plus years, we are clearly a top line company, and we're best when we drive sales. We probably aren't as good at leveraging expenses when sales come down than others because we're not going to do some things. But we're clearly taking the offensive. And again, there are some things that perhaps we should have done earlier, but we're already seeing some improvement in that. And we think -- we know that'll help."

They're actually looking at the futures contracts and more of the cost of the actual item, the orange or the poultry or the pork or whatever, whereas sometimes that's not the case. I think, usually when we ask, there's another 3 to 6 months of whatever. And when it gets to the anniversary-ing of it, there's been some huge swings, some huge examples of swings on some nuts, which last year doubled and they're now down 35%. There's -- eggs, of course, are down well over 60% year-over-year, so -- and we're not -- if eggs were down even 50%, it doesn't mean that people are going to eat twice as many eggs to have flat sales. They're going to eat some more eggs but not that many. So -- by the way, a few of those things may help in the bakery -- the margins in the bakery. We're also not going change the package -- the cost of 16 muffins -- or 15 muffins. So overall, I think the feeling is given that the last few months have been a little more deflationary, the view is, is that it's another few months of that, but they all believe that it's going to come back the other way. But this is by no -- this is a lot of estimated semi-educated guesses among different departments."

The percent probably changes a little downwards, so that would imply perhaps a little bit of improvement in dollars. But it could be all over the board. Gas is an extreme example. It's a low-margin competitive business. As prices tumbled dramatically, across general competition, prices were lower but not nearly proportional to the amount of savings to that retailer. We were able to improve our margins a little and widen the gap. That's a win-win. Another silly example is organics. Organics, the -- because there's perhaps a little bit of less price-sensitive elasticity to organic prices, we're able to make a little more margin, not a lot and have a wider value proposition versus others. So those are good things for us. Generally speaking, when there was cost inflation on milk and cheese and things like that, we would point out, as you know historically in some of those quarters where we kept the chicken at $4.99 and margins went down essentially from something to nothing to the tune of $40 million a year on 1 item. That was 4 or 5 years ago, 4 years ago. Conversely, when cheese prices fell, food court margins went up nicely because we've always -- we never really changed the price of a slice of pizza. So there's lots of little things that aren't -- don't fit in a square box or a round hole here. I would say, generally, a little inflation is good. It helps sales. It's -- and we could be more competitive both up and down, and when prices are going up, it probably is a little bit more margin beneficial but not a lot."

And again, we recognize there's things that we can and can't do. We think that we could and should do a lot more online, but we also, as you pointed out, want to get people into the warehouses. We think that some of the things that we do in-store will keep them coming. So far, it's not been an issue. And even -- one thing -- while we've tried to point out these things each quarter in terms of traffic, in terms of even when traffic was impacted a little bit and we're asked that $64,000 question, is it all these other things, we see some of the categories that one would think would have been impacted negatively by it aren't being impacted negatively. In terms of click and pickup, we've looked at it, and we are not prepared to do that at this point. When we see it in other places, not just the other warehouse club, there's -- you need space for it or you need a lot less volume and a location for it. Neither of which we have. And we're not getting a lot of demands for it. We do that at the business centers. You can log [ph] order and get delivered. And so that's more for the business member, not the individual. And we recognize that we're not the retailer that are going to sell you a smaller pack size or something at even a little bit better -- higher margin. That's not what we do. Now, time will tell over time. We're not -- there's a lot of things that are going on out there. We're looking at them. We've all seen the video from earlier this week about you just walk in. There's a lot of other brick and mortars that my guess would be far more impacted than us on that, but we'll have to wait and see. Again, we're going to -- if renewal rates trends changed -- by the way, we even see in the markets where we've done things with Google and where we work with Instacart as well, Google Express and Instacart, probably the most extreme example would be the Bay Area, where we started with Google, and that was their first market. And certainly, that's where they're headquartered. And it's doing fine. What we've found is an existing loyal member is coming in a few less times a year, is shopping several more times, well, certainly several more because it was 0 but shopping more. But the sum of the 2 is more. They buy a lot less when they're doing it online than when they come in. And part of that is the experience of walking in and seeing it all there.

Needless to say, there's a lot more efficient things today. We continue to look at scan-and-go type things. We are not testing it currently, but we are looking at it. And I'm not suggesting we're going to do it. We have done self-checkout for a while. We've chosen to not do self-checkout in higher-volume units because we can get people through without it. And as it relates -- you had asked in terms of millennials and Generation Z, all those numbers are doing better for us, and part of it is things like not that we sat down and strategically thought how do we get them. We have a great value proposition. Certainly, some of the things that we sell like organics is a -- in my view, is a big impact to that. Certainly, some of the things we do, we've done a couple of tests with LivingSocial over the last couple of years, all those things, we think, help. As it relates -- you asked a question about Amazon, and Amazon is also the word for everything out there that's delivered or .com and everything else, and certainly, they're doing a lot of things. We want to make sure we understand what all of these people are doing. We do -- and not just from a competitive price shop and whether it's them or someone else. We recognize convenience is a value, but there's also some things that we can and can't do. So I think that we're looking at these things offensively, not defensively at this point. I don't think that -- I think we're encouraged when we see the level of millennials, if you will, that are signing up, when we see the average age of our membership coming down. Now it was just a couple years ago when the average U.S. Costco adult member was 4-plus years older than the population as a whole. Now, it's a little under 2. And that's without a lot of planning, but it's part of what we do. And I think part of that's the merchandise selection and our ability to change merchandise pretty quickly. And certainly, things like, again, organic stand out in a big way. I think the fact of what we're doing even on some things that aren't directly -- they're all related to the business but ESG and sustainability, how we take care of our employees, the culture, those are things that, again, we didn't say we have to do better at that. We do best at that. We do a lot of good things like that. When it comes down to merchandising, we believe that organics, the KS, what we're very good at is driving value, and we're probably not going to be a person that's the best at delivering smaller-sized goods to your house. There are some things we're going to do between that and nothing, and again, stay tuned for calendar '17."

My other question was around the membership fee or potential membership fee increase next year that's been talked about quite a bit. I'm just curious if there's a sensitivity in what that threshold is, at which point you would not do it.

For the 12-week fiscal first quarter that ended 2 weeks ago, Sunday, this past Sunday, earnings came in at $1.24 a share, up 14% or $0.15 a share over last year's earning -- reported earnings per share of $1.09. A few items to point out as was mentioned in today's release. This year's first quarter benefited from a nonrecurring $51 million legal settlement. This $51 million pretax figure represented a 19-basis-point benefit to gross margin and a benefit to first quarter's earnings per share of $0.07 a share.
Last year in the first quarter, there were 2 nonrecurring items that we mentioned that, together, negatively impacted last year's earnings results. In that quarter, we recorded a $22 million pretax charge, which represented an 8-basis-point impact to SG&A to the negative and a reduction in last year's first quarter earnings of $0.04 a share.
Stock compensation expense was 13% or $25 million higher year-over-year, so $0.04 a share more. There are about 4,800 people in -- of our employees that receive restrictive stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October in our fiscal first quarter and then typically vest over a 5-year period, with accelerated vesting when the recipient reaches 25, 30 and 35 years of employment with the company. Factors driving this increase included additional levels of accelerated vesting given the rising number of our employees achieving long tenure with the company; an increased stock price with a 5-year-ago grant coming off when the stock -- coming off of the thing when the stock price was in the $80s to last year's grant when the stock price was in the $150s; and of course, having a larger number of employees to plan. Note that the $25 million year-over-year increase in Q1 is larger -- is a larger year-over-year dollar increase than we'd expect to record in each of the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters of this year given the October RSU grant cycle.
Next, gas profitability. Our profits from gas during the quarter as compared to last year's first quarter were lower by about $20 million pretax or $0.03 a share, primarily a function of last year's very strong profit results in the first quarter for gas.
Fifth, IT costs. These expenses negatively impacted SG&A in the first quarter on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $18 million or 5 basis points to SG&A, which is about $0.025 a share.
And lastly, when I get to the discussion on year-over-year gross margin and SG&A comparisons, I'll review with you the very positive impact that our new Citi Visa deal has had on margins, SG&A and of course, our bottom line.
Turning to the first quarter sales. Total reported sales were up 3%, and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure on a reported basis came in at 1% year-over-year. Comp sales were negatively impacted by weaker FX relative to the U.S. dollar and slightly impacted by gas price deflation for a combined negative impact to the reported account number of about 0.75% of sales. Excluding gas deflation, the reported 1% U.S. comp figure for Q1 remained at 1%. The reported Canadian comp figure of plus 4% would have been plus 5% ex gas deflation and FX. And the reported 0% other international comp figure, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 3%. Total comps reported 1% for the quarter, again, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 2%. And of course, this plus 2% total company adjusted figure is also being impacted by increases in deflation and other merchandising categories overall, primarily in food and hardline -- foods and hardlines.
In terms of new openings, in the first quarter, we opened 9 new locations, which included 1 relo so a net increase of 8. And later in the call, I'll discuss our upcoming expansion plans for the balance of the fiscal year. This afternoon, I'll also touch on membership trends and renewal rates, again, discuss margins and SG&A in Q1, update on the Citi Visa, the new Citi Visa relationship and the card and which we began offering in the U.S. and Puerto Rico this past June 20 during the fiscal fourth quarter of '16, talk about e-commerce and then a couple of other items of note.
So going down the income statement, again, sales for the first quarter for the 12 weeks ended November 20 were $27.5 billion, up 3% from last year's first quarter $26.6 million and again, on a comp basis, reported 1% in ex gas and FX, up 2%. Again, that up 2% still being impacted by other aspects of deflation that we hadn't called out historically.
For the quarter, the plus 1% reported comp results were a combination of an average transaction decrease of 1.3% on a reported basis and an average shopping frequency increase of 2.2% to the positive. Now the average transaction decrease of 1.3%, this includes again the combined headwinds of FX and gas that I mentioned, which is about 0.75% and I'm sure other levels of deflation in other categories. I'll give some examples of that later in the call.
In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, within the U.S., Northwest, Texas and Midwest show the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, U.K. and Korea.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, in terms of sales for those, within food and sundries, overall flat year-over-year with spirits, sundries and deli coming in best. Tobacco, of course, as I mentioned on the last call, was down a little over 20% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. These -- as I mentioned before, these big tobacco declines should anniversary this coming spring.
For hardlines, also flat year-over-year. The departments with the strong results were hardware, tires and health and beauty aids. I'll give you an example of deflation, which is impacting this department. In November, for example, our reported November sales, TV sales in dollars were up 2% and units were up 17% so quite a bit of deflation on big ticket items as well us some of the fresh foods items that I mentioned earlier. 
Within softlines, up low single-digit comps with apparels, small electrics and special events being the standouts. And within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest departments. And in ancillary businesses, hearing aids and optical show the best results.  Again, in recent months, we've seen additional deflation overall in the low to mid-single-digit range in many food and fresh meat categories and a little more in some of the other non-food areas, as I mentioned, like electronics.
Moving to the line items in the income statement. Membership fees, good results for the first quarter, coming in up 6% and 6 basis points as a percent of sales, up $37 million year-over-year. In terms of membership fees, it's good renewal rates, 90% U.S. and Canada -- actually, 90.3% and 88% worldwide, rounding up to 88%. Continued increasing penetration of the Executive Membership, and in terms of number of members at Q1 end, compared to fiscal year-end, 12 weeks earlier, Gold Star stood at 36.8 million accounts. At Q1 end, it was 37.1 million. Primary business was 7.3 million both at fiscal year-end and at Q1 end. Business add-ons, 3.5 million and 3.5 million. For total membership, household memberships, 47.6 million at fiscal year-end and up to 47.9 million at first quarter end. And given that many of the people have 2 cards -- many of the accounts have 2 cards, at fiscal year-end, we stood at 86.7 million of cardholders and at first quarter end, 87.3 million people with a membership card.
At November 20 first quarter end, Executive Members stood at 17.7 million member households, an increase of 348,000 since the end of the previous quarter. That's about 29,000 additional Executive Members per week increase during the 12-week quarter. And as I've said before, members -- Executive Members are a little over 1/3 of our base and a little bit more than 2/3 of our sales where Executive Members are offered.
In terms of renewal rates, our business renewal rate, which at fiscal year-end stood at 94.4%, came in at 94.3% renewal rate as of first quarter end. Gold Star at 89.5% both at fiscal year-end and first quarter end for a total 90.3% at fiscal year-end, and it remained at 90.3% at first quarter end. Worldwide at year-end, it was 87.6%, and it ticked to 87.5% at first quarter end.
As you know, it's been probably almost 2 years in Canada when we converted to the MasterCard, and with that, we saw, as we would have expected, a decline -- a slight decline in renewal rate. As what -- as occurred in Q4 '16 this past summer, we saw that finally reverse and saw an uptick in renewal rates in Canada, and that continued in Q1 of this fiscal year, too. And we're announcing the same thing in the U.S. It ticked down a little bit over the last couple of quarters, and it ticked down a little bit as well in Q1. We don't see any issues there at that point -- at this point.
Regarding membership fees, at the beginning of this past September or beginning of our fiscal year, we increased membership fees in our Asia operations, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, as well as in Mexico and the U.K. And again, that's because -- due to deferred accounting. It's about 15% of our membership fee income base and due to deferred accounting. And the fact that they'll roll in over the next 12 months since September, that'll be a little less than a $0.01 a share a quarter.
Before continuing down the income statement line items, a quick update on the Citi Visa card offering. This past June 20, midway through the fourth quarter of fiscal '16, we stopped accepting Amex, American Express, at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and at costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including, of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. The new card's great in terms of increased cash back rewards for our members and great for us as well in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years and of course, lowering our effective merchant fees related to the new program.
In terms of new card, as I -- as was mentioned over the last couple of quarters on these calls, there were approximately 11.4 million Amex, American Express, co-branded cards or about 7.5 million accounts that were transferred from American Express to Citi for conversion to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. Over 85% of the accounts transferred over have been activated, and since the June 20 cutover, several months ago, we have 1 million members that have signed up for and have been approved for the new Citi Visa card. Most of them have it in hand, but to the extent it was the last couple of weeks, they may not have gotten the card yet. In terms of conversion, usage and new sign-ups for the card, all good so far.
Now turning to gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the fourth -- in the first quarter was higher year-over-year by 29 basis points coming in at 11.58% this year versus 11.29% last year. As usual, I'll have you jot down for the quarter a few numbers. We'll just make the 2 columns for the quarter reported and without gas deflation. In terms of core merchandising, year-over-year in the first quarter, core merchandising was up 19 basis points, up 16 without gas deflation. Ancillary businesses down 5% -- minus 5 year-over-year and for the quarter, minus 6 without deflation; 2% reward minus 2 in the quarter on a reported basis, minus 1 without gas deflation; LIFO, minus 2 and minus 2; other, which is the big onetime -- the big non-recurring benefit we got from a litigation settlement, plus 19 basis points both for the reported and without gas. All told, for the quarter we reported again a 29-basis-point improvement and ex gas deflation, 26 basis points. So overall, again, 26 basis points up on a kind of ex gas basis. The core merchandise component was higher by 19 basis points year-over-year and again, 16 without the gas deflation.
The majority of the core gross margin increase already taking out -- we've separated out already the onetime legal settlement, about 13 basis points of that 16, if you will, was due to higher year-over-year revenue share and bounties associated with the new Citi Visa agreement. Some of those monies go to the revenue line as its revenue share.
The gross margin of our -- notwithstanding that, the gross margin of our core merchandising categories, which are the food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, those -- that gross margin as a percent of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the first quarter by 17 basis points with food and sundries, hardlines and fresh foods all showing higher year-over-year margins and softlines being down a little bit year-over-year. I know one of the impacts was the warmth of the season and outerwear issues.
Ancillary and other business gross margin was down 5 basis points, 6 basis points ex gas deflation in the quarter, all a function of lower year-over-year gas profits as I discussed earlier in the call. Ex gas lean operations, all other ancillary and other business gross margins were up 6 basis points.
2% Reward, again, ex gas, a negative impact of 1 basis point, and that's to margin. That's a sales penetration, and the associated Executive Member rewards from our Executive Members continue to grow.
LIFO in the first quarter this year, we did not book get a LIFO credit or charge compared to a 2-basis-point positive or a $5 million pretax credit last year in the quarter. 
And lastly, the onetime non-recurring legal settlement, this benefited Q1 gross margin by 19 basis points as we discussed at beginning of the call.
Moving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentage in the first quarter year-over-year was higher by 16 basis points on a reported basis and by 13 basis points ex gas deflation. Again, I'll have you just jot down a few line items. Core operations for the quarter was higher or a negative 8 basis points and without gas, a negative 6; central, higher by 9 and 9, both reported and without gas deflation; stock compensation expense, minus 7 and minus 6; other, plus 8 and plus 8. That's that rough $20 million or $22 million amount that I told you about earlier in the call that impacted SG&A to the positive last year versus no -- nothing this year. And again, reported SG&A was higher by 16 basis points in the quarter, higher by 13 ex gas deflation.
The core operations component of SG&A, again, in the chart, shows 8% higher and -- I'm sorry, 8 basis points higher year-over-year reported and 6 ex gas. This minus 6 consisted of higher payroll and benefits of about 31 basis points year-over-year. That's certainly impacted by the lower sales result, and certainly, that's impacted by the deflation. I'll give you a couple of examples of that later. This was primarily offset by lower year-over-year merchant fees as a result of the switch to Citi Visa. That had a benefit to the SG&A line of 25 basis -- plus 25 basis points impact to the positive.
Central expense was higher year-over-year in Q1 by 9. Increased IT spending, again, as I mentioned, was 5 of that. Stock compensation expense, higher by 5 or 6 without gas. And lastly, the other item I mentioned, the plus 8 was nonrecurring in nature.
Next, on the income statement line, preopening expense, it was $4 million lower this year versus last year coming in at $22 million versus $26 million a year ago, really a function of openings. This year in Q1, we had 9 openings, last year 13. Each of those -- the 9 included 1 relo in the 13 last year and then first quarter included 2 relos, pretty much in line with that number of openings. All told, operating income in the first quarter came in up $82 million or 11% but up $9 million or 1% year-over-year, excluding the -- just the non-recurring items that I previously mentioned.
Below the operating income line, interest expense in the first quarter came in at $29 million this year versus $33 million in last year, lower due to the retirement of some senior notes in December of last year. Interest income and other was lower by $2 million in the quarter coming in at $26 million versus $28 million a year ago. Actual interest income and other -- actual interest income for the quarter was better year-over-year. This was offset by approximately $4.5 million in charges related to the FX transactions that usually fluctuate pluses or minus in the 0 to $10 million rage, so no surprises there.
Overall, reported pretax income on a reported basis was higher by 11%, again, higher by 1% ex those nonrecurring items that I mentioned earlier in the call. 
In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter came in at 34.4% for the quarter compared to 36.1% last year. We benefited from a couple of positive discrete items this year in Q1. Our effective -- anticipated effective rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35.2% as best we can tell at this point.
Overall, reported net income, $545 million this year, up from -- up $65 million from $480 million last year, so an increase of 14%; ex the nonrecurring items that I mentioned, up 3%.
Next for a quick rundown of other topics. While the balance sheet is included in this morning's -- in this afternoon's press release, a couple of the balance sheet inflow items. Depreciation and amortization from the cash flow statement, which is not here, for the quarter came in at $297 million for the quarter. Accounts payable, if you look at -- one of the things we always look at is our accounts payable as a percent of inventories. It report -- on a reported basis, it was up from 100% a year ago in the quarter end to 103%. If you take out non-merchandise payables, more of accounts payable merchandise versus inventories, it improved from a 90% to a 93% from last year's first quarter end to this year's first quarter end. Average inventory per warehouse was actually lower by about $67,000 per warehouse coming in at -- right at $14.9 million a year ago and $14.83 million per location this year.
FX was -- of that roughly $70,000 lower, FX was about $170,000 lower, just the impact of FX. So about $100,000 net if you would assume flat FX. That's about what majors was up. Electronics, it was up $117,000. So really, not a lot of pluses and minuses over sub departments but pretty much in line and pretty much flat year-over-year.
In terms of CapEx, we spent approximately $670 million during the quarter, and our estimate for the whole year, as I mentioned, hasn't changed from last quarter end. Our expectation for fiscal year '17 is somewhere in the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion range compared to $2.6 billion for all of fiscal '16.
Next, Costco Online. We're now in -- of course, in the U.S., Canada, U.K, Mexico and more recently, Korea and Taiwan. For the first quarter, sales and profits were up. Total online sales were up 8% in the quarter and 7% on a comp basis, pretty choppy. Essentially, the first several weeks and the last several weeks of the quarter were in the mid-singles with the middle part of it in the low doubles if you will. I want to point out that over the past 3 weeks, and that would include the last week of Q1, which is the Thanksgiving week, and the first 2 weeks of our second fiscal quarter, e-comm sales were up in the low to mid-teens and including similar results for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And of course, that's notwithstanding significant amount of TV sales, which were essentially flat in dollars and up 15% in units.
Lastly, as it relates to our online business, we're improving our offerings and enhancing our member experience. I touched on this a little bit last quarter's call. Our current focus comes in 3 primary area. In terms of improving merchandise first, we're adding more exciting high-end branded merchandise on an everyday basis. We're improving in-stocks of high-velocity items, and there's a few other things that we'll be doing coming the first couple of months of the new calendar year.
Second, we're improving the experience and functionality of our site. We're improving our search. We have and are continuing to do that. We've shortened the checkout process from many clicks to 2 and so a big improvement, recognizing this is new for us. We're simplifying and automating our returns process, a much better experience, particularly on big ticket items, and we've seen great improvement in that in the last several weeks. And we're improving our member's ability to track their orders. Again, that's something that we weren't terribly good at historically.
And we're improving -- and thirdly, we're improving our distribution logistics. We've increased the number of depots from where we fill online orders, so closer and faster and less expensive delivery. And again, look for more improved and quicker distribution comments from us in early calendar '17.
Next, in terms of expansion. I mentioned we had 8 net new units this year -- this fiscal first quarter. We plan 2 for Q2, a net of 5 for Q3, so ex relocations and a net of 16 in Q4 for anticipated number for the year of net new units of 31, 34 less the 3 relos, so 31 net new locations. Last year, recall we opened 29 so about 4.5% square footage growth. If we get to the 31, that would be about the same, about 4.25 plus square footage growth. Assuming the 31 net new openings, fiscal '17 locations by country will be 16 in the U.S. Mind you that last year it was 21 out of 29 in the U.S., 8 in Canada, which is quite a number for Canada, and 1 each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico as well as France, our first in France, and also 1 in Iceland. Note that these include our first locations to open in France and Iceland. And again, those will be in late spring and early summer.
Now as you can tell by the quarterly dispersion of these, about half of the 31 planned openings are scheduled in Q4. To the extent a couple of those could slip into the next fiscal year, so be it. So somewhere in the high -- very high 20s, if not, 30 or 31 is what we would expect. As of first quarter end, our total square footage stood at 104.5 million square feet.
In terms of common stock repurchases. For the first quarter, we repurchased 809,000 shares for a total of $122 million or an average price of $151 a share. That compares to all of fiscal '16 when we repurchased $477 million, 3.2 million shares at an average price of just under $150 a share.
In terms of dividends, our currently quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share, and that was a 12.5% increase. And that was effective last spring, 12.5% increase from the prior $0.40 a share. So $0.45 a share in the quarter, so that yearly $1.80 dividend represents an annual cost to the company of just under $800 million.
Lastly, before I turn it back for Q&A, our fiscal 2017 second quarter schedule earnings release date for the 12-week second quarter ending February 12 will be after market close on Thursday, March 2 for the earnings call that afternoon at 2:00 Pacific Time.
I will now turn it back to Kimberlan for -- and open up for questions and answers."

In terms -- there's bounties that we receive for signing up new members and applications that incents the warehouses to do that. There's revenue share on outside spend. I think that's a little more than we'd anticipated. We knew and felt that, over time, it would go up because of the acceptance of Visa in terms of the penetration of Visa throughout all types of merchants, and that happened a little faster than we had anticipated. There's also some other aspects of it. Again, there's lots of little pieces, but those are 2 of the bigger ones. On the merchant side -- the fee side rather, I think some of it's related to the fact that we're making estimates of the different reward buckets, if you will, gas at 4%, Costco at 2%, those velocity categories at 3%. Again, there's all kinds of equations there that as that changes, there's some sharing, and so it's all good at this point."

As you know, we're going to invest in loyalty and growth. And while it's raining on everybody as it relates to higher levels of deflation, we're known for deflating the sale price sooner and faster, and certainly, one other sound bite example would be meat sales. Just in the month of November, meat sales were up 6% in dollars and 16% in pounds.

We're constantly going back to every supplier with our purchasing power, with our buying power as it relates to -- and competition itself with private label, to figure out how can we bring the quantity up, the quality up and the price down. And we know we'll sell more, and each of us and our suppliers will make a little more times -- a little less more times. And that's what we do -- that's what we're always doing. We see that at every monthly budget meeting. And so I think that we'll continue to do what we do. We're certainly not going to benefit from every extra dollar of income. We're going to figure out how to use it to drive that competitive spirit and to drive our sales. And that's been a little tougher in this tough deflationary environment."

I would assume, over time, and this is -- who knows, it's hypothetical, but over the next couple of years, if the performance of the program continues to go in the -- which way we would expect it to in the right direction and our piece of that action, if you will, versus the rewards that our members are getting, you'd expect us to see us change that over time. But we're way too early to even think about that. Historically, as it relates to membership fee increases, we usually invest that back in the business, a lot of that in terms of competitiveness and pricing, and it kind of eases in over the next several years and into -- more fully into the bottom line notwithstanding the fact that membership fee increases take about 8 fiscal quarters to get into the income statement on the membership line because of deferred accounting. So I don't think -- first of all, we certainly haven't done anything different.

They're actually looking at the futures contracts and more of the cost of the actual item, the orange or the poultry or the pork or whatever, whereas sometimes that's not the case. I think, usually when we ask, there's another 3 to 6 months of whatever. And when it gets to the anniversary-ing of it, there's been some huge swings, some huge examples of swings on some nuts, which last year doubled and they're now down 35%. There's -- eggs, of course, are down well over 60% year-over-year, so -- and we're not -- if eggs were down even 50%, it doesn't mean that people are going to eat twice as many eggs to have flat sales. They're going to eat some more eggs but not that many. So -- by the way, a few of those things may help in the bakery -- the margins in the bakery. We're also not going change the package -- the cost of 16 muffins -- or 15 muffins. So overall, I think the feeling is given that the last few months have been a little more deflationary, the view is, is that it's another few months of that, but they all believe that it's going to come back the other way. But this is by no -- this is a lot of estimated semi-educated guesses among different departments."

The percent probably changes a little downwards, so that would imply perhaps a little bit of improvement in dollars. But it could be all over the board. Gas is an extreme example. It's a low-margin competitive business. As prices tumbled dramatically, across general competition, prices were lower but not nearly proportional to the amount of savings to that retailer. We were able to improve our margins a little and widen the gap. That's a win-win. Another silly example is organics. Organics, the -- because there's perhaps a little bit of less price-sensitive elasticity to organic prices, we're able to make a little more margin, not a lot and have a wider value proposition versus others. So those are good things for us. Generally speaking, when there was cost inflation on milk and cheese and things like that, we would point out, as you know historically in some of those quarters where we kept the chicken at $4.99 and margins went down essentially from something to nothing to the tune of $40 million a year on 1 item. That was 4 or 5 years ago, 4 years ago. Conversely, when cheese prices fell, food court margins went up nicely because we've always -- we never really changed the price of a slice of pizza. So there's lots of little things that aren't -- don't fit in a square box or a round hole here. I would say, generally, a little inflation is good. It helps sales. It's -- and we could be more competitive both up and down, and when prices are going up, it probably is a little bit more margin beneficial but not a lot."

And again, we recognize there's things that we can and can't do. We think that we could and should do a lot more online, but we also, as you pointed out, want to get people into the warehouses. We think that some of the things that we do in-store will keep them coming. So far, it's not been an issue. And even -- one thing -- while we've tried to point out these things each quarter in terms of traffic, in terms of even when traffic was impacted a little bit and we're asked that $64,000 question, is it all these other things, we see some of the categories that one would think would have been impacted negatively by it aren't being impacted negatively. In terms of click and pickup, we've looked at it, and we are not prepared to do that at this point. When we see it in other places, not just the other warehouse club, there's -- you need space for it or you need a lot less volume and a location for it. Neither of which we have. And we're not getting a lot of demands for it. We do that at the business centers. You can log [ph] order and get delivered. And so that's more for the business member, not the individual. And we recognize that we're not the retailer that are going to sell you a smaller pack size or something at even a little bit better -- higher margin. That's not what we do. Now, time will tell over time. We're not -- there's a lot of things that are going on out there. We're looking at them. We've all seen the video from earlier this week about you just walk in. There's a lot of other brick and mortars that my guess would be far more impacted than us on that, but we'll have to wait and see. Again, we're going to -- if renewal rates trends changed -- by the way, we even see in the markets where we've done things with Google and where we work with Instacart as well, Google Express and Instacart, probably the most extreme example would be the Bay Area, where we started with Google, and that was their first market. And certainly, that's where they're headquartered. And it's doing fine. What we've found is an existing loyal member is coming in a few less times a year, is shopping several more times, well, certainly several more because it was 0 but shopping more. But the sum of the 2 is more. They buy a lot less when they're doing it online than when they come in. And part of that is the experience of walking in and seeing it all there.

Needless to say, there's a lot more efficient things today. We continue to look at scan-and-go type things. We are not testing it currently, but we are looking at it. And I'm not suggesting we're going to do it. We have done self-checkout for a while. We've chosen to not do self-checkout in higher-volume units because we can get people through without it. And as it relates -- you had asked in terms of millennials and Generation Z, all those numbers are doing better for us, and part of it is things like not that we sat down and strategically thought how do we get them. We have a great value proposition. Certainly, some of the things that we sell like organics is a -- in my view, is a big impact to that. Certainly, some of the things we do, we've done a couple of tests with LivingSocial over the last couple of years, all those things, we think, help. As it relates -- you asked a question about Amazon, and Amazon is also the word for everything out there that's delivered or .com and everything else, and certainly, they're doing a lot of things. We want to make sure we understand what all of these people are doing. We do -- and not just from a competitive price shop and whether it's them or someone else. We recognize convenience is a value, but there's also some things that we can and can't do. So I think that we're looking at these things offensively, not defensively at this point. I don't think that -- I think we're encouraged when we see the level of millennials, if you will, that are signing up, when we see the average age of our membership coming down. Now it was just a couple years ago when the average U.S. Costco adult member was 4-plus years older than the population as a whole. Now, it's a little under 2. And that's without a lot of planning, but it's part of what we do. And I think part of that's the merchandise selection and our ability to change merchandise pretty quickly. And certainly, things like, again, organic stand out in a big way. I think the fact of what we're doing even on some things that aren't directly -- they're all related to the business but ESG and sustainability, how we take care of our employees, the culture, those are things that, again, we didn't say we have to do better at that. We do best at that. We do a lot of good things like that. When it comes down to merchandising, we believe that organics, the KS, what we're very good at is driving value, and we're probably not going to be a person that's the best at delivering smaller-sized goods to your house. There are some things we're going to do between that and nothing, and again, stay tuned for calendar '17."
