6569181,323668559,926430,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. 2015 was an excellent year for PMI. Moderating declines in cigarette industry volume, notably in the EU region, coupled with market share gains, enabled us to record a full year organic cigarette shipmen",2445,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. 2015 was an excellent year for PMI. Moderating declines in cigarette industry volume, notably in the EU region, coupled with market share gains, enabled us to record a full year organic cigarette shipment volume decline of only 1%, our best performance since 2012. A particular note were the performances of Marlboro and L&M which grew cigarette volume by 0.9% and 3.9% respectively.
Strong pricing across all regions combined with substantially lower unfavorable volume mix compared to recent years resulted in net revenue and adjusted OCI growth excluding currency and acquisitions of 5.8% and 6.6%, respectively.
Despite significant incremental investments behind both and our cigarette brand portfolio are now tonight and disclosed in today's press release. Our adjusted OCI margin increased by 0.3 percentage points to 42.6%, excluding currency and acquisitions. The increase was driven by the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. 
Our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, grew by a very strong 12%, at the high end of the rate guidance range that we reaffirmed last November. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all of our key operating currencies was an unprecedented headwind for our business in 2015 and resulted in a full year adverse currency impact of $1.20 on our adjusted diluted EPS. 
In our fourth quarter, our organic cigarette volume declined by 2.4% due to lower cigarette industry volumes and lower market share, notably in the Asia region. Our cigarette volume was impacted by a one-time distributor inventory adjustment in Russia related to supply chain optimization. 
Excluding this adjustment, our quarterly volume decline was in line with out of the full year. Net revenues increased by 4%, excluding currency, with favorable pricing across all regions, more than offsetting unfavorable volume mix, mainly the EEMA, Latin America and Canada regions. As previously communicated, our incremental investments in 2015 were concentrated in the fourth quarter. This resulted in currency-neutral adjusted OCI and adjusted diluted EPS declines in the quarter.
Our full year 2015 results confirmed that our business fundamentals are strong and the incremental investments that we made throughout the year and in the fourth quarter, in particular, should further reinforce our momentum in 2016. 
Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2016 at prevailing exchange rates is a range of $4.25 to $4.35 versus $4.42 in 2015 and includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.60. This guidance represent the growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015.
This reflects a currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth rate above our mid- to long-term algorithm. Importantly, this guidance does not include any share repurchases. We revisit the potential for repurchases as the year unfold depending on the currency environment. The $0.60 of unfavorable currency impact are prevailing exchange rate included in our 2016 guidance is driven primarily by the Argentine peso, Indonesian rupee, Japanese yen and Russian ruble. This 4 currencies account for around 60% of the total impact. With currently hedged approximately 72% of our 2016 forecast sales to Japan, which are prevailing exchange rates, translates to an effective rate of JPY 118 to the U.S. versus JPY 110 in 2015. 
Pricing was the key driver of our full year 2015 financial performance. We recorded a total pricing impairments of $2.1 billion supported by strong contributions from all 4 regions. As a reminder, this variance includes an exceptional gain in Korea related to inventories built ahead of the January 2015 excise tax increase, which will not recur in 2016. 
This year, we anticipate the pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenues. Our performance in 2015 was underpinned by the improving cigarette industry volume trend and continued market share momentum. We estimate that international cigarette industry volume, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 2.4% in 2015, a further moderation compared to the declines in 2013 and 2014.  For this year, we forecast a decline of 2% to 2.5% on the same basis. 
Our continued market share momentum in 2015 is clearly demonstrated on this slide with international share, excluding China and the U.S., up by 0.2 points to 28.7% in share growth in the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. Our share in the Asia region was stable. 
Marlboro was a key driver of our market share momentum in 2015, increasing its international share, excluding China and the U.S. by 0.2 points to 9.6%. The brand had growing or stable share in all 4 regions and continue to benefit from the roll-out of architecture 2.0, which is now approaching 100 markets worldwide. 
Importantly, our 2015 share in the top 30 PMI OCI market grew by 0.7 points to 38%, with share up or essentially flat in 20 of its markets. These underscores the positive momentum of our business across the majority of our most profitable market. 
While pricing and market share gains are the foundation of our topline growth, we remain focused on effectively managing our cost base. Our mid-term targeted annual cost base increase is 1% to 3%, excluding RRPs and currency. 
In 2015, we decided to deploy additional investments, some of which will not recur in 2016 to support the strong momentum of our cigarette brand portfolio and accelerate the geographic expansion of. This resulted in a total cost base increase coming, excluding currency, of 3.6%, excluding RRPs, or 5.3%, including RRPs.
In 2016, we expect the total cost base, including RRPs, to increase by approximately 1%, excluding currency, reflecting productivity and cost saving programs and also helped by the moderating prices by key input, such as tobacco leaf, and nontobacco materials. 
Let me now discuss our performance in key geographies beginning with the EU region. Following declines of 7.3% and 3.1% in 2013 and 2014, respectively, there was a further moderation of the total cigarette industry volume decline to 0.9% in 2015. We attributed the moderation to improving economies, notably Southern Europe, a decline in the prevalence of illicit trade, less out-switching to the define cap category and a lower prevalence rate of the performance.
Our positive signature momentum in the region continued in 2015 with fourth quarter and full year share up by 0.3 points and 0.1 point, respectively. In the fourth quarter, our share increased in 5 of the 6 largest markets by cigarette industry volume, demonstrating the breadth of our share strength. 
As we have anticipated, our share in Italy was adversely impacted by the decline of Marlboro following its crossing of the EUR 5 per pack price point in the first quarter of 2015. Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield further enforced their positions in the region's top 3 cigarette industry branch  by volume for the second consecutive year. 
Full year market share for Marlboro increased by 0.2 points to 18.9%, driven by strong performances in France, Germany and Spain. Share for L&M increased by 0.1 point to 6.9%, while Chesterfield grew by 0.2 share points to 5.8%. 
The moderating cigarette industry volume decline, coupled with our market share gains and strong pricing, resulted in adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 4.6% in the EU region in 2015. This marked the regions first adjusted OCI increase from the same basis since 2009. 
In 2016, we forecast middle -- mid-single-digit currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the region. 
I will now turn to Russia, the largest market in our EEMA region where estimated cigarette industry volume declined by 8.4% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the full year. The declines were mainly due to significant excise tax-driven retail price increases, which we estimate average more than 20% year-over-year as well as lower consumer purchasing power.
Our full year 2015 market share increased by 0.9 points to 28.4%,  driven mainly by low price street and super low price mix, which benefited from advanced smoke down-trading and a wider distribution, particularly in the Eastern part of the country. Importantly, Parliament was up by 0.2 share point despite the overall premium segment decline of 0.7 points.
In January this year, the government implemented its planned 2016 excise tax increase resulting an average tax pass-on of around RUB 10 per pack or 14% on an industry weighted average base. In anticipation, we announced retail selling price increases across the majority of our portfolio of RUB 5  per pack last November and a further RUB 5  per pack this January, with the most recent increase likely to appear at retail in the second quarter.
Estimated cigarette industry volume in Turkey grew by 7.8% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year. This exceptional growth was driven mainly by a significant reduction in the prevalence of the illicit trade, which declined by over 5 percentage points to around 14% in 2016. Our market share in Turkey has strengthened, with the 3/4 of sequential growth. Fourth quarter share increased by 0.3 points to 44.2% and was driven by the superb performance of Marlboro, up by 1.2 points to 9.9%.  Marlboro shipment volume increased by 20.6% in the quarter. 
In January, the government increased the specific excise tax and the minimum excise tax, while living the ad valorem rate and changed, representing a further improvement in the excise tax structure. This resulted in a pass-on of around 40 cruise per pack at the retail level. We implemented retail sales price increase of 1 liter per pack across the majority of our portfolio, thus,, enhancing unit margin.
I will now touch on our Asia region beginning with Indonesia. Our estimated cigarette industry volume was stable in 2015 in line with our forecast and primarily due to the soft economy. While market share in the fourth quarter declined by 1 to 34.3%, reflecting the impact of retail price increases on our machine made brand, taken in advance of the January 2016 excise tax increase, our full year market share grew slightly to 35%. On an industry weighted average basis, the 2016 excise tax increase is around 15%. Despite the muted performance of the total market last year, we remain very optimistic about the profit growth opportunities in these key markets, thanks to its growing of population and rising income level.
In the Philippines, price gaps narrowed further in the fourth quarter following price increases at the bottom of the market. The gap between Marlboro and the superlow price brands of our primary local competitor now stands at around PHP 1 per cigarette, a narrowing of 50 centavos per cigarette or 33% since December 2013. The improved price gaps have been a key driver of a strong share performance. Based on Nielsen retail audit data, our full year 2015 share increased by 1.4 points to 73.4%. Marlboro was the primary driver of the share gain, increasing by an impressive 2.7 points to 21.1%. 
Fortune also gained share, growing by 0.7 points to 31.1%. Marlboro shipment volume increased by 18.8% in 2015 and drove a favorable mix. Encouragingly, we continued to improve profitability in this important market. 
In Japan, cigarette industry volume declined by 2.1% in 2015. This was less than what we had anticipated due mainly to trade inventory buildup 4 competitors recent new launches. Our cigarette market share performance was clearly below our expectations. Share declined by 0.6 points to 25.3% in 2015 due primarily to competitors' offerings in the new differentiated menthol segments.  Nevertheless, we remain confident in the long term outlook for our cigarette brand portfolio in Japan.
Turning to our products portfolio, let me briefly highlight the prior was that we made in 2015 on the commercialization of iQOS. During the year, we expanded the geographic presence of iQOS in our 2014 city launch market with the first wave of expansion in Japan reaching over 60% of the adult smoker population and the initial expansion in Italy beyond Milan to, Rome and Turin. We also launched iQOS in major cities across Switzerland and commenced city launches in Bucharest, Lisbon and Moscow. By the end of 2016, we expect iQOS to be present in key cities in around 20 markets globally. 
In Japan, which is by far our more advanced iQOS launch market in terms of geographic and adult smoke coverage, we estimate there were over 130,000 fully or predominantly converted iQOS users by the end of 2015. In the last week of December, we achieved an estimated offtake share of Marlboro sheet sticks of 1.1% in the expansion area and 1.7% in Tokyo. Importantly, our weekly offtake shares have grown steadily since the expansion began in September. Please note that share represent retail sales volumes for hit sticks as a percentage of the total estimated retail sales volume for cigarettes and heat sticks within a given geographic area. I look forward to sharing further the scientific and commercial progress that we've made with the iQOS during our presentation at the Cagney Conference later this month.
I will now cover our free cash flow, which increased by over $300 million in 2015 to reach $6.9 billion. This was a remarkable achievement considering the adverse currency impact of $1.9 billion for unmet earnings and was fueled by important working capital initiatives. As a reminder, the proceeds from the rights issue are not included in our free cash flow. In 2016, we forecast free cash flow broadly in line with last year's level, again, despite the anticipated adverse currency headwind at prevailing exchange rates.
We remain focused on rewarding our shareholders generously with the dividend currently serving as the primary use of our free cash flow. Last September, we increased our and annual dividend for the eighth consecutive year since the been in 2008, representing a total increase of approximately 122% at the compound annual growth rate of 12%. Our dividend yield at the end of last week was 4.5%. This is very attractive in comparison to the yields of our peer group company. 
In conclusion, 2015 was an excellent year for PMI, reflecting improved cigarette industry volume trends and very robust business fundamentals. Our superior cigarette brand portfolio, supported by a unique commercial organization, is driving strong pricing and continued market share gains. Marlboro is performing extremely well, with a continued rollout of the 2.0 architecture driving volume and share growth. We're very excited by our progress with the commercialization of iQOS, which is underscored by our favorable sheet stick offtake momentum in Japan. 
Our strong free cash flow continues to support our general dividends. Finally, the outlook for our business remains strong on a currency-neutral basis of 2016 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42.

That has a little bit distorted the numbers of the fourth quarter and also for PMI. Essentially, it's a one-off adjustment because we decided to have our own warehouse in certain parts of the country rather than our distributor in order to facilitate its distribution. And on top of it, it helps working capital. So that's the reason we implemented, but there is no swings in there, that's one-off. In terms of what's happening in the market, in terms of total market, we appreciate it's a bit difficult to forecast. Last year, we had forecasted total market will decline by 9%. We ended up much better. We forecast again, given the magnitude of the increases, another 9% this year. If we come out better, we are all very happy. That's why we see the market. Now in terms of down trading, clearly, the down-trading is not dramatic, but we see -- if we look at the year, 2% share shifting from the meat segment and premium segment to essentially the low price segment, not the superlow, which is fairly stable. And we gained share in both premium, low and superlow segment, so I think we're well positioned overall in this environment. Now, again, Russia, you know the economy is a bit weak, the ruble has devalued, but overall, I think in terms of portfolio position, we are in a very good place and we've already taken pricing. So I feel pretty good about Russia overall if the ruble was a bit less volatile than it is. Have I answered your questions?"

I hope that's going to be the case, but we have to assume some decline in Russia. So we assumed, as I said, around 9% at this stage.
The -- on the positive side here, we have Korea because last year, we had quite impressive decline about apples-to-apples, I would say, 20%, which, this year, hopefully, we're not going to see. And clearly, we see improving trends during the year. So a lot on positive side. We had good upside in Turkey last year because of the illicit trade reduction plus increased consumption. I don't think we're going to see the same increment in Turkey this year, obviously. But as the year unfolds, we will know better. In markets where we're less impacted clearly, it's India that had a big decline last year. It was excised and VAT increases. As you know, we have minimal exposure there and Brazil. Brazil is likely to continue this year, obviously, because we have a combination of VAT tax increases in certain states because they have autonomy to decide about the VAT rates. And also, an excise tax increase that comes in 2 tranches in Brazil, one in May and one in December. And so that's where I see it. Now Indonesia, again, is a bit early days. As you know, on one side, we had a slightly soft economy. Price, the pass on of the excise tax in the previous years of about 5% of price increase equivalent. This year, it's 7.5%. Not dramatic, but slightly higher. And on the other side, we have -- on the positive side, we have minimum wage increases in the range of 11%. So how this is going to pay  at the end of the year is very difficult to predict. Conservative, we have assumed some decline, but we'll see if that materializes or not.

But in general, because I get very often this question is U.K. going to become Australia? The first thing is the impact of plain packaging on Australia down-trading is extremely difficult to estimate, if any, because it's much more a question of pricing. Because if you remember, the margins at the bottom end of the market in Australia are still extremely high compared to the U.K. So I personally do not see an acceleration of the trends in the U.K. eventually plain packaging is implemented because there are already brands at very low margins at the bottom end of the market, and I don't think we'll see an acceleration of the trends. Now in the EU in general, I don't see much down trading here. Actually, the premium segment is stable and we grew share with Marlboro.

We have increased our segment share for the segment, so we're in a position to influence the segment. And, essentially, I believe -- I mean, we also announced a price increase today in Australia.

6569181,323668559,926748,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. 2015 was an excellent year for PMI. Moderating declines in cigarette industry volume, notably in the EU region, coupled with market share gains enabled us to record a full year organic cigarette shipment",2455,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. 2015 was an excellent year for PMI. Moderating declines in cigarette industry volume, notably in the EU region, coupled with market share gains enabled us to record a full year organic cigarette shipment volume decline of only 1%, our best performance since 2012. Of particular note were the performances of Marlboro and L&M, which grew cigarette volume by 0.9% and 3.9% respectively.
Strong pricing across all regions combined with substantially lower unfavorable volume mix compared to recent years resulted in net revenue and adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 5.8% and 6.6%, respectively.
Despite significant incremental investments behind both iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio announced last July and disclosed in today's press release, our adjusted OCI margin increased by 0.3 percentage points to 42.6%, excluding currency and acquisitions. The increase was driven by the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. 
Our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, grew by a very strong 12%, at the high end of the raised guidance range that we reaffirmed last November. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all of our key operating currencies was an unprecedented headwind for our business in 2015 and resulted in a full year adverse currency impact of $1.20 on our adjusted diluted EPS. 
In our fourth quarter, our organic cigarette volume declined by 2.4% due to lower cigarette industry volumes and lower market share, notably in the Asia region. Our cigarette volume was impacted by a one-time distributor inventory adjustment in Russia related to supply chain optimization.  Excluding this adjustment, our quarterly volume decline was in line with that of the full year. 
Net revenues increased by 4%, excluding currency, with favorable pricing across all regions, more than offsetting unfavorable volume mix, mainly in the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. As previously communicated, our incremental investments in 2015 were concentrated in the fourth quarter. This resulted in currency neutral-adjusted OCI and adjusted diluted EPS declines in the quarter.
Our full year 2015 results confirm that our business fundamentals are strong and the incremental investments that we made throughout the year and in the fourth quarter in particular should further reinforce our momentum in 2016. 
Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2016 at prevailing exchange rates is a range of $4.25 to $4.35 versus $4.42 in 2015 and includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.60. This guidance represent the growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. This reflects a currency neutral-adjusted OCI growth rate above our mid- to long-term algorithm. Importantly, this guidance does not include any share repurchases. We'll revisit the potential for repurchases as the year unfolds, depending on the currency environment. 
The $0.60 of unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rate included in our 2016 guidance is driven primarily by the Argentine peso, Indonesian rupee, Japanese yen and Russian ruble. These 4 currencies account for around 60% of the total impact. We've currently hedged approximately 72% of our 2016 forecast sales to Japan, which at prevailing exchange rates translates to an effective rate of JPY 118 to the U.S. dollar versus JPY 110 in 2015. 
Pricing was the key driver of our full year 2015 financial performance. We recorded a total pricing variance of $2.1 billion, supported by strong contributions from all 4 regions. As a reminder, this variance includes an exceptional gain in Korea related to inventories built ahead of the January 2015 excise tax increase, which will not recur in 2016. This year, we anticipate the pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenues. 
Our performance in 2015 was underpinned by the improving cigarette industry volume trend and continued market share momentum. We estimate that international cigarette industry volume, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 2.4% in 2015, a further moderation compared to the declines in 2013 and 2014. For this year, we forecast a decline of 2% to 2.5% on the same basis. 
Our continued market share momentum in 2015 is clearly demonstrated on this slide with international share, excluding China and the U.S., up by 0.2 points to 28.7% and share growth in the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. Our share in the Asia region was stable. 
Marlboro was a key driver of market share momentum in 2015, increasing its international share, excluding China and the U.S., by 0.2 points to 9.6%. The brand had growing or stable share in all 4 regions and continued to benefit from the rollout of Architecture 2.0, which is now approaching 100 markets worldwide. Importantly, our 2015 share in the top 30 PMI OCI markets grew by 0.7 points to 38%, with share up or essentially flat in 20 of these markets. This underscores the positive momentum of our business across the majority of our most profitable market. 
While pricing and market share gains are the foundation of our topline growth, we remain focused on effectively managing our cost base. Our mid-term targeted annual cost base increase is 1% to 3%, excluding RRPs and currency. In 2015, we decided to deploy additional investments, some of which will not recur in 2016, to support the strong momentum of our cigarette brand portfolio and accelerate the geographic expansion of iQOS. This resulted in the total cost base, excluding currency, of 3.6% excluding RRPs, or 5.3% including RRPs.
In 2016, we expect our total cost base, including RRPs, to increase by approximately 1%, excluding currency, reflecting productivity and cost-saving programs and also helped by the moderating prices for key inputs such as tobacco leaf, clove and nontobacco materials. 
Let me now discuss our performance in key geographies beginning with EU region. Following declines of 7.3% and 3.1% in 2013 and 2014, respectively, there was a further moderation of the total cigarette industry volume decline to 0.9% in 2015. We attribute the moderation to improving economies, notably Southern Europe; a decline in the prevalence of illicit trade; less outswitching to the fine cut category and a lower prevalence of e-cigarette or the e-vapor product.
Our positive cigarette share momentum in the region continued in 2015, with fourth quarter and full year share up by 0.3 points and 0.1 point, respectively. In the fourth quarter, our share increased in 5 of the 6 largest markets by cigarette industry volume, demonstrating the breadth of our share strength. 
As we had anticipated, our share in Italy was adversely impacted by the decline of Marlboro following its crossing of the EUR 5 per pack price point in the first quarter of 2015. Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield further reinforced their positions as the region's top 3 cigarette industry brands by volume for the second consecutive year. Full year market share for Marlboro increased by 0.2 points to 18.9%, driven by strong performances in France, Germany and Spain. Share for L&M increased by 0.1 point to 6.9%, while Chesterfield grew by 2 point (sic) [ 0.2 ] share points to 5.8%. 
The moderating cigarette industry volume decline, coupled with our market share gains and strong pricing, resulted in adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 4.6% in the EU region in 2015. This marked the regions first adjusted OCI increase on the same basis since 2009.  In 2016, we forecast middle single -- mid-single-digit currency neutral-adjusted OCI growth in the region. 
I will now turn to Russia, the largest market in our EEMA region, where estimated cigarette industry volume declined by 8.4% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the full year. The declines were mainly due to significant excise tax-driven retail price increases, which we estimate averaged more than 20% year-over-year, as well as lower consumer purchasing power.
Our full year 2015 market share increased by 0.9 points to 28.4%, driven mainly by low price Bond Street and super-low price Next, which benefited from adult smoker down-trading and a wider distribution, particularly in the eastern part of the country. Importantly, Parliament was up by 0.2 share points despite the overall premium segment's decline of 0.7 points.
In January this year, the government implemented its planned 2016 excise tax increase, resulting in an average tax pass-on of around RUB 10 per pack or 14% on an industry weighted average basis. In anticipation, we announced retail selling price increases across the majority of our portfolio of RUB 5 per pack last November and a further RUB 5 per pack this January, with the most recent increase likely to appear at retail in the second quarter.
Estimated cigarette industry volume in Turkey grew by 7.8% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year. This exceptional growth was driven mainly by a significant reduction in the prevalence of illicit trade, which declined by over 5 percentage points to around 14% in 2016. Our market share in Turkey has strengthened with three quarters of sequential growth. Fourth quarter share increased by 0.3 points to 44.2% and was driven by the superb performance of Marlboro, up by 1.2 points to 9.9%.  Marlboro shipment volume increased by 20.6% in the quarter. 
In January, the government increased the specific excise tax and the minimum excise tax, while living the ad valorem rate unchanged, representing a further improvement in the excise tax structure. This resulted in a pass-on of around 40 kurus per pack at the retail level. We implemented a retail selling price increase of 1 lira per pack across the majority of our portfolio, thus enhancing unit margin.
I will now touch on our Asia region beginning with Indonesia, where estimated cigarette industry volume was stable in 2015, in line with our forecast and primarily due to the soft economy. While market share in the fourth quarter declined by 1 point to 34.3%, reflecting the impact of retail price increases on our machine-made kretek brands taken in advance of the January 2016 excise tax increase, our full year market share grew slightly to 35%. On an industry weighted average basis, the 2016 excise tax increase is around 15%. Despite the muted performance of the total market last year, we remain very optimistic about the profit growth opportunities in this key market, thanks to its growing adult population and rising income level.
In the Philippines, price gaps narrowed further in the fourth quarter following price increases at the bottom of the market. The gap between Marlboro and the super-low price brands of our primary local competitor now stands at around PHP 1 per cigarette, a narrowing of 50 centavos per cigarette or 33% since December 2013. The improved price gaps have been a key driver of our strong share performance. Based on Nielsen retail audit data, our full year 2015 share increased by 1.4 points to 73.4%. Marlboro was the primary driver of this share gain, increasing by an impressive 2.7 points to 21.1%. Fortune also gained share, growing by 0.7 points to 31.1%. 
Marlboro shipment volume increased by 18.8% in 2015 and drove favorable mix. Encouragingly, we continue to improve profitability in this important market. 
In Japan, cigarette industry volume declined by 2.1% in 2015. This was less than what we had anticipated, due mainly to trade inventory buildup for competitors' recent new launches. Our cigarette market share performance was clearly below our expectations. Share declined by 0.6 points to 25.3% in 2015, due primarily to competitors' offerings in the new differentiated menthol taste segment.  Nevertheless, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our cigarette brand portfolio in Japan.
Turning to our Reduced-Risk Products portfolio. Let me briefly highlight the progress that we made in 2015 on the commercialization of iQOS. During the year, we expanded the geographic presence of iQOS in our 2014 city launch market, with the first wave of expansion in Japan reaching over 60% of the adult smoker population and the initial expansion in Italy beyond Milan to Modena, Rome and Turin. We also launched iQOS in major cities across Switzerland and commenced city launches in Bucharest, Lisbon and Moscow. By the end of 2016, we expect iQOS to be present in key cities in around 20 markets globally. 
In Japan, which is by far our more advanced iQOS launch market in terms of geographic and adult smoker coverage, we estimate that there were over 130,000 fully or predominantly converted iQOS users by the end of 2015. In the last week of December, we achieved an estimated offtake share for Marlboro HeatSticks of 1.1% in the expansion area and 1.7% in Tokyo. Importantly, our weekly offtake shares have grown steadily since the expansion began in September. 
Please note that offtake share represents retail sales volumes for HeatSticks as a percentage of the total estimated retail sales volume for cigarettes and HeatSticks within a given geographic area. I look forward to sharing further the scientific and commercial progress that we've made with iQOS during our presentation at the CAGNY conference later this month.
I will now cover our free cash flow, which increased by over $300 million in 2015 to reach $6.9 billion. This was a remarkable achievement considering the adverse currency impact of $1.9 billion on our net earnings and was fueled by important working capital initiatives. As a reminder, the proceeds from the Sampoerna rights issue are not included in our free cash flow. 
In 2016, we forecast free cash flow broadly in line with last year's level, again despite the anticipated adverse currency headwind at prevailing exchange rates.
We remain focused on rewarding our shareholders generously, with the dividend currently serving as the primary use of our free cash flow. Last September, we increased our annual dividend for the eighth consecutive year since the spin in 2008, representing a total increase of approximately 122% at a compound annual growth rate of 12%. Our dividend yield at the end of last week was 4.5%. This is very attractive in comparison to the yields of a peer group company. 
In conclusion, 2015 was an excellent year for PMI, reflecting improved cigarette industry volume trends and very robust business fundamentals. Our superior cigarette brand portfolio, supported by a unique commercial organization, is driving strong pricing and continued market share gains. Marlboro is performing extremely well, with the continued rollout of the 2.0 Architecture driving volume and share growth. We're very excited by our progress with the commercialization of iQOS, which is underscored by our favorable HeadStick offtake share momentum in Japan. Our strong free cash flow continues to support our generous dividends. 
Finally, the outlook for our business remains strong. On a currency-neutral basis, our 2016 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42. 
Thank you. Jacek and I will now be happy to answer your questions."

Now that had more impact for us in this quarter. There is another phenomenon that is -- had a lot of increased activity, I would say, towards the end of the year in Indonesia, which is a number of competitive offerings that sell essentially 20 sticks per pack at the price of 16. Now these propositions typically are not viable longer term, because if you remember, the excise tax in Indonesia is specific and on a per stick basis. But temporarily, you have some distortions because of these launches that should ease during the year. So that's essentially how what happened in Indonesia in the quarter."

First of all, let's start with this inventory that has a little bit distorted the numbers of the fourth quarter overall so for PMI. Essentially, it's an one-off adjustment, because we decided to have our own warehouses in certain parts of the country rather than our distributor in order to facilitate distribution. And on top of it, it helps working capital. So that's the reason we implemented, but there is no swings in there. That's one-off. In terms of what's happening in the market, in terms of total market, you appreciate it's a bit difficult to forecast. Last year, we had forecasted total market will decline by 9%. We ended up much better. We forecast again, given the magnitude of the price increases, another 9% this year. If we come out better, we'll all be very happy. That's why you see the market. Now in terms of down-trading, clearly there is down-trading. It's not dramatic, but we see -- if we look at the year, 2% share shifting from the mid-segment and premium segment to essentially the low-price segment, not the super-low, which is fairly stable. And we gained share in both premium, low and super-low segment. So I think we're well positioned overall in this environment. Now again, Russia, you know the economy is a bit weak, the ruble has devalued. But overall, I think in terms of portfolio position, we are in a very good place and we're already taking pricing. So I feel pretty good about Russia overall if the ruble was a bit less volatile than it is. Have I answered your questions?"

So just to facilitate your understanding, I would say that 40% of the incremental spending in the last quarter is nonrecurring in 2016, roughly, okay? And we clearly had also quite substantial incremental spending on iQOS in the fourth quarter. Now the nonrecurring items relate to obviously the implementation of the tobacco product directive in 2016, but some of the costs have to happen in 2015 and also some restructuring that we don't report under reported but -- in the normal earnings plus some one-off items.

I mean, if we look overall, clearly Russia, as I said, we have to make some assumptions. Last year, we were a bit positively surprised. I hope that's going to be the case, but we have to assume some decline in Russia. So we assumed, as I said, around 9% at this stage. The -- on the positive side, clearly you have Korea, because last year, we had quite impressive decline about, apples-to-apples I would say, 20%, which this year hopefully we're not going to see. And clearly, we see improving trends during the year. So that's on positive side. We had a good upside in Turkey last year because of the illicit trade reduction plus increased consumption. I don't think we're going to see the same increment in Turkey this year, obviously. But as the year unfolds, we will know better. In markets where we're less impacted clearly, it's India that had a big decline last year because of excise and VAT increases. As you know, we have minimal exposure there. And Brazil, and brazil is likely to continue this year, obviously, because we have a combination of VAT tax increases in certain states, because they have autonomy to decide about the VAT rates. And also, an excise tax increase that comes in 2 tranches in Brazil, one in May and one in December. So that's what I see it. Now Indonesia, again, is a bit early days. As you know, on one side, we had a slightly soft economy. Price, the pass-on of the excise tax in the previous years of 5% of price increase equivalent. This year, it's 7.5%. Not dramatic, but slightly higher. And on the other side, we have -- or the positive side, we have minimum wage increases in the range of 11%. So how this is going to play at the end of the year is very difficult to predict. Conservative, we have assumed some decline, but we'll see if that materializes or not.

But in general -- because I get very often this question, is U.K. going to become Australia? The first thing is the impact of plain packaging on Australia down-trading is extremely difficult to estimate, if any, because it's much more a question of pricing, because if you remember, the margins at the bottom end of the market in Australia are still extremely high compared to the U.K. So I personally do not see an acceleration of the trends in the U.K., if any, if eventually plain packaging is implemented, because there are already brands at very low margins at the bottom end of the market, and I don't think we'll see an acceleration of the trends. Now in the EU in general, I don't see much down-trading here. Actually, the premium segment is stable, and we grew share with Marlboro. So overall, I'm very positive about the trends in the European Union. And do not forget that we have a portfolio with Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield that covers comfortably all price segments.

6569181,323668559,927021,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. 2015 was an excellent year for PMI. Moderating declines in cigarette industry volume, notably in the EU region, coupled with market share gains, enabled us to record a full year organic cigarette shipmen",2455,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. 2015 was an excellent year for PMI. Moderating declines in cigarette industry volume, notably in the EU region, coupled with market share gains, enabled us to record a full year organic cigarette shipment volume decline of only 1%, our best performance since 2012. Of particular note were the performances of Marlboro and L&M, which grew cigarette volume by 0.9% and 3.9%, respectively.
Strong pricing across all regions, combined with substantially lower unfavorable volume mix compared to recent years, resulted in net revenue and adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 5.8% and 6.6%, respectively.
Despite significant incremental investments behind both iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio announced last July and disclosed in today's press release, our adjusted OCI margin increased by 0.3 percentage points to 42.6%, excluding currency and acquisitions. The increase was driven by the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. 
Our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, grew by a very strong 12%, at the high end of the raised guidance range that we reaffirmed last November. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all of our key operating currencies was an unprecedented headwind for our business in 2015 and resulted in a full year adverse currency impact of $1.20 on our adjusted diluted EPS. 
In the fourth quarter, our organic cigarette volume declined by 2.4% due to lower cigarette industry volumes and lower market share, notably in the Asia region. Our cigarette volume was impacted by a one-time distributor inventory adjustment in Russia related to supply chain optimization.  Excluding this adjustment, our quarterly volume decline was in line with that of the full year. 
Net revenues increased by 4%, excluding currency, with favorable pricing across all regions more than offsetting unfavorable volume mix, mainly in the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. As previously communicated, our incremental investments in 2015 were concentrated in the fourth quarter. This resulted in currency neutral-adjusted OCI and adjusted diluted EPS declines in the quarter.
Our full year 2015 results confirm that our business fundamentals are strong and the incremental investments that we made throughout the year and in the fourth quarter in particular should further reinforce our momentum in 2016. 
Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2016 at prevailing exchange rates is a range of $4.25 to $4.35, versus $4.42 in 2015 and includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.60. This guidance represents a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12%, compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. This reflects a currency neutral-adjusted OCI growth rate above our mid- to long-term algorithm. Importantly, this guidance does not include any share repurchases. We'll revisit the potential for repurchases as the year unfolds, depending on the currency environment. 
The $0.60 of unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rate included in our 2016 guidance is driven primarily by the Argentine peso, Indonesian rupee, Japanese yen and Russian ruble. These 4 currencies account for around 60% of the total impact. We've currently hedged approximately 72% of our 2016 forecast sales to Japan, which at prevailing exchange rates translates to an effective rate of JPY 118 to the U.S. dollar, versus JPY 110 in 2015. 
Pricing was the key driver of our full year 2015 financial performance. We recorded a total pricing variance of $2.1 billion, supported by strong contributions from all 4 regions. As a reminder, this variance includes an exceptional gain in Korea related to inventories built ahead of the January 2015 excise tax increase, which will not recur in 2016. This year, we anticipate the pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenues. 
Our performance in 2015 was underpinned by an improving cigarette industry volume trend and continued market share momentum. We estimate that international cigarette industry volume, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 2.4% in 2015, a further moderation compared to the declines in 2013 and 2014. For this year, we forecast a decline of 2% to 2.5% on the same basis. 
Our continued market share momentum in 2015 is clearly demonstrated on this slide, with international share, excluding China and the U.S., up by 0.2 points to 28.7% and share growth in the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. Our share in the Asia region was stable. 
Marlboro was a key driver of market share momentum in 2015, increasing its international share, excluding China and the U.S., by 0.2 points to 9.6%. The brand had growing or stable share in all 4 regions and continued to benefit from the rollout of Architecture 2.0, which is now approaching 100 markets worldwide. Importantly, our 2015 share in the top 30 PMI OCI markets grew by 0.7 points to 38%, with share up or essentially flat in 20 of these markets. This underscores the positive momentum of our business across the majority of our most profitable markets. 
While pricing and market share gains are the foundation of our top line growth, we remain focused on effectively managing our cost base. Our mid-term targeted annual cost base increase is 1% to 3%, excluding RRPs and currency. In 2015, we decided to deploy additional investments, some of which will not recur in 2016, to support the strong momentum of our cigarette brand portfolio and accelerate the geographic expansion of iQOS. This resulted in a total cost base, excluding currency, of 3.6% excluding RRPs, or 5.3% including RRPs.
In 2016, we expect our total cost base, including RRPs, to increase by approximately 1%, excluding currency, reflecting productivity and cost-saving programs and also helped by the moderating prices for key inputs such as tobacco leaf, clove and non-tobacco materials. 
Let me now discuss our performance in key geographies, beginning with EU region. Following declines of 7.3% and 3.1% in 2013 and 2014, respectively, there was a further moderation of the total cigarette industry volume decline to 0.9% in 2015. We attribute the moderation to improving economies, notably Southern Europe; a decline in the prevalence of illicit trade; less out-switching to the fine cut category; and a lower prevalence of e-cigarette or the e-vapor product.
Our positive cigarette share momentum in the region continued in 2015, with fourth quarter and full year share up by 0.3 points and 0.1 point, respectively. In the fourth quarter, our share increased in 5 of the 6 largest markets by cigarette industry volume, demonstrating the breadth of our share strength. 
As we had anticipated, our share in Italy was adversely impacted by the decline of Marlboro following its crossing of the EUR 5 per pack price point in the first quarter of 2015. Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield further reinforced their positions as the region's top 3 cigarette industry brands by volume for the second consecutive year. Full year market share for Marlboro increased by 0.2 points to 18.9%, driven by strong performances in France, Germany and Spain. Share for L&M increased by 0.1 point to 6.9%, while Chesterfield grew by 2 point (sic) [ 0.2 ] share points to 5.8%. 
The moderating cigarette industry volume decline, coupled with our market share gains and strong pricing, resulted in adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 4.6% in the EU region in 2015. This marked the region's first adjusted OCI increase on the same basis since 2009.  In 2016, we forecast middle single -- mid-single-digit currency neutral-adjusted OCI growth in the region. 
I will now turn to Russia, the largest market in our EEMA region, where estimated cigarette industry volume declined by 8.4% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the full year. The declines were mainly due to significant excise tax-driven retail price increases, which we estimate averaged more than 20% year-over-year, as well as lower consumer purchasing power.
Our full year 2015 market share increased by 0.9 points to 28.4%, driven mainly by low price Bond Street and super-low price Next, which benefited from adult smoker down-trading and a wider distribution, particularly in the eastern part of the country. Importantly, Parliament was up by 0.2 share points despite the overall premium segment's decline of 0.7 points.
In January this year, the government implemented its planned 2016 excise tax increase, resulting in an average tax pass-on of around RUB 10 per pack or 14% on an industry weighted average basis. In anticipation, we announced retail selling price increases across the majority of our portfolio of RUB 5 per pack last November and a further RUB 5 per pack this January, with the most recent increase likely to appear at retail in the second quarter.
Estimated cigarette industry volume in Turkey grew by 7.8% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year. This exceptional growth was driven mainly by a significant reduction in the prevalence of illicit trade, which declined by over 5 percentage points to around 14% in 2016. Our market share in Turkey has strengthened, with 3 quarters of sequential growth. Fourth quarter share increased by 0.3 points to 44.2% and was driven by the superb performance of Marlboro, up by 1.2 points to 9.9%. Marlboro shipment volume increased by 20.6% in the quarter. 
In January, the government increased the specific excise tax and the minimum excise tax, while leaving the ad valorem rate unchanged, representing a further improvement in the excise tax structure. This resulted in a pass-on of around TRY 0.40 per pack at the retail level. We implemented a retail selling price increase of TRY 1 per pack across the majority of our portfolio, thus enhancing unit margin.
I will now touch on our Asia region, beginning with Indonesia, where estimated cigarette industry volume was stable in 2015, in line with our forecast and primarily due to the soft economy. While market share in the fourth quarter declined by 1 point to 34.3%, reflecting the impact of retail price increases on our machine-made kretek brands taken in advance of the January 2016 excise tax increase, our full year market share grew slightly to 35%. On an industry weighted average basis, the 2016 excise tax increase is around 15%. Despite the muted performance of the total market last year, we remain very optimistic about the profit growth opportunities in this key market, thanks to its growing adult population and rising income level.
In the Philippines, price gaps narrowed further in the fourth quarter following price increases at the bottom of the market. The gap between Marlboro and the super-low price brands of our primary local competitor now stands at around PHP 1 per cigarette, a narrowing of PHP 0.50 per cigarette or 33% since December 2014. The improved price gaps have been a key driver of our strong share performance. Based on Nielsen retail audit data, our full year 2015 share increased by 1.4 points to 73.4%. Marlboro was the primary driver of this share gain, increasing by an impressive 2.7 points to 21.1%. Fortune also gained share, growing by 0.7 points to 31.1%. 
Marlboro shipment volume increased by 18.8% in 2015 and drove favorable mix. Encouragingly, we continue to improve profitability in this important market. 
In Japan, cigarette industry volume declined by 2.1% in 2015. This was less than what we had anticipated, due mainly to trade inventory buildup for competitors' recent new launches. Our cigarette market share performance was clearly below our expectations. Share declined by 0.6 points to 25.3% in 2015, due primarily to competitors' offerings in the new differentiated menthol taste segment. Nevertheless, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our cigarette brand portfolio in Japan.
Turning to our Reduced-Risk Products portfolio. Let me briefly highlight the progress that we made in 2015 on the commercialization of iQOS. During the year, we expanded the geographic presence of iQOS in our 2014 city launch markets, with the first wave of expansion in Japan reaching over 60% of the adult smoker population and initial expansion in Italy beyond Milan to Modena, Rome and Turin. We also launched iQOS in major cities across Switzerland and commenced city launches in Bucharest, Lisbon and Moscow. By the end of 2016, we expect iQOS to be present in key cities in around 20 markets globally. 
In Japan, which is by far our more advanced iQOS launch market in terms of geographic and adult smoker coverage, we estimate that there were over 130,000 fully or predominantly converted iQOS users by the end of 2015. In the last week of December, we achieved an estimated offtake share for Marlboro HeatSticks of 1.1% in the expansion area and 1.7% in Tokyo. Importantly, our weekly offtake shares have grown steadily since the expansion began in September. 
Please note that offtake share represents retail sales volumes for HeatSticks as a percentage of the total estimated retail sales volume for cigarettes and HeatSticks within a given geographic area. I look forward to sharing further the scientific and commercial progress that we've made with iQOS during our presentation at the CAGNY conference later this month.
I will now cover our free cash flow, which increased by over $300 million in 2015 to reach $6.9 billion. This was a remarkable achievement considering the adverse currency impact of $1.9 billion on our net earnings and was fueled by important working capital initiatives. As a reminder, the proceeds from the Sampoerna rights issue are not included in our free cash flow. 
In 2016, we forecast free cash flow broadly in line with last year's level, again despite the anticipated adverse currency headwind at prevailing exchange rates.
We remain focused on rewarding our shareholders generously, with the dividend currently serving as the primary use of our free cash flow. Last September, we increased our annual dividend for the eighth consecutive year since the spin in 2008, representing a total increase of approximately 122% and a compound annual growth rate of 12%. Our dividend yield at the end of last week was 4.5%. This is very attractive in comparison to the yields of a peer group company. 
In conclusion, 2015 was an excellent year for PMI, reflecting improved cigarette industry volume trends and very robust business fundamentals. Our superior cigarette brand portfolio, supported by a unique commercial organization, is driving strong pricing and continued market share gains. Marlboro is performing extremely well, with the continued rollout of the 2.0 Architecture driving volume and share growth. We're very excited by our progress with the commercialization of iQOS, which is underscored by our favorable HeatStick offtake share momentum in Japan. Our strong free cash flow continues to support our generous dividends. 
Finally, the outlook for our business remains strong. On a currency-neutral basis, our 2016 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42. 
Thank you. Jacek and I will now be happy to answer your questions."

But that, I guess, would confirm that you haven't made any formal requests yet, regardless of what your intentions might be. Okay. And then, I guess, just a broader question then. Your comments about the expectation for a 6% pricing variance this year implies about $1.6 billion in pricing, a bit below the $1.8 billion that we would typically think of as being sort of a midterm target, and I know that Korea accounts for a portion of that gap. But if we exclude that, is there more an issue of rounding, or do you see the potential for a more moderate level of pricing across the industry this year in light of macroeconomic weakness?"

Now that had more impact for us in this quarter. There is another phenomenon that is -- had a lot of increased activity, I would say, towards the end of the year in Indonesia, which is a number of competitive offerings that sell essentially 20 sticks per pack at the price of 16. Now these propositions typically are not viable longer term, because if you remember, the excise tax in Indonesia is specific and on a per stick basis. But temporarily, you have some distortions because of these launches that should ease during the year. So that's essentially how -- what happened in Indonesia in the quarter."

Essentially, it's an one-off adjustment, because we decided to have our own warehouses in certain parts of the country rather than our distributor in order to facilitate distribution. And on top of it, it helps working capital. So that's the reason we implemented, but there is no swings in there. That's one-off. In terms of what's happening in the market, in terms of total market, you appreciate it's a bit difficult to forecast. Last year, we had forecasted total market will decline by 9%. We ended up much better. We forecast again, given the magnitude of the price increases, another 9% this year. If we come out better, we'll all be very happy. That's how I see the market. Now in terms of down-trading, clearly there is down-trading. It's not dramatic, but we see -- if we look at the year, 2% share shifting from the mid-segment and premium segment to essentially the low-price segment, not the super-low, which is fairly stable. And we gained share in both premium, low and super-low segment. So I think we're well-positioned overall in this environment. Now again, Russia, you know the economy is a bit weak, the ruble has devalued. But overall, I think in terms of portfolio position, we are in a very good place and we're already taking pricing. So I feel pretty good about Russia overall, if the ruble was a bit less volatile than it is. Have I answered your questions?"

Now the nonrecurring items relate to obviously the implementation of the tobacco product directive in 2016, but some of the costs have to happen in 2015 and also some restructuring that we don't report on the reported, but in the normal earnings, plus some one-off items.

The -- on the positive side, clearly you have Korea, because last year, we had quite impressive decline, about apples-to-apples, I would say, 20%, which this year hopefully we're not going to see. And clearly, we see improving trends during the year. So that's on positive side. We had a good upside in Turkey last year because of the illicit trade reduction plus increased consumption. I don't think we're going to see the same increment in Turkey this year, obviously. But as the year unfolds, we will know better. In markets where we're less impacted, clearly, it's India that had a big decline last year because of excise and VAT increases. As you know, we have minimal exposure there. And Brazil, and Brazil is likely to continue this year, obviously, because we have a combination of VAT tax increases in certain states, because they have autonomy to decide about the VAT rates. And also, an excise tax increase that comes in 2 tranches in Brazil, one in May and one in December. So that's where I see it. Now Indonesia, again, is a bit early days. As you know, on one side, we had a slightly soft economy. Price, the pass-on of the excise tax in the previous years of about 5% of price increase equivalent. This year, it's 7.5%. Not dramatic, but slightly higher. And on the other side, we have -- or the positive side, we have minimum wage increases in the range of 11%.

I don't see any acceleration in down-trading in the U.K. in terms of trends. And if we try to correlate this to plain packaging, clearly there's no yet plain packaging in the U.K., I would say. But in general, because I get very often this question, is U.K. going to become Australia? The first thing is the impact of plain packaging on Australia down-trading is extremely difficult to estimate, if any, because it's much more a question of pricing, because if you remember, the margins at the bottom end of the market in Australia are still extremely high compared to the U.K. So I personally do not see an acceleration of the trends in the U.K., even if eventually plain packaging is implemented, because there are already brands at very low margins at the bottom end of the market, and I don't think we'll see an acceleration of the trends. Now in the EU in general, I don't see much down-trading here. Actually, the premium segment is stable, and we grew share with Marlboro. So overall, I'm very positive about the trends in the European Union. And do not forget that we have a portfolio with Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield that covers quite comfortably all price segments.

Now down-trading has continued, although recently at a lower pace. And as far as we are concerned, our share has stabilized, finally. We have increased our segment share for the discount segment. So we're in a position to influence the segment. And essentially, I believe -- I mean, we also announced a price increase today in Australia. So the way I see Australia is it has been a slight drag on our OCI this year, much, much less than last year. Conservatively, we forecast another small drag next year, but we'll see now how this pricing unfolds. So that's the situation in Australia. Obviously, our objective is not to have the excise tax increase out of the normal ones that are the CPI indexation."

6569181,323668559,927415,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. 2015 was an excellent year for PMI. Moderating declines in cigarette industry volume, notably in the EU region, coupled with market share gains, enabled us to record a full year organic cigarette shipmen",2455,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. 2015 was an excellent year for PMI. Moderating declines in cigarette industry volume, notably in the EU region, coupled with market share gains, enabled us to record a full year organic cigarette shipment volume decline of only 1%, our best performance since 2012. Of particular note were the performances of Marlboro and L&M, which grew cigarette volume by 0.9% and 3.9%, respectively.
Strong pricing across all regions, combined with substantially lower unfavorable volume mix compared to recent years, resulted in net revenue and adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 5.8% and 6.6%, respectively.
Despite significant incremental investments behind both iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio announced last July and disclosed in today's press release, our adjusted OCI margin increased by 0.3 percentage points to 42.6%, excluding currency and acquisitions. The increase was driven by the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. 
Our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, grew by a very strong 12%, at the high end of the raised guidance range that we reaffirmed last November. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all of our key operating currencies was an unprecedented headwind for our business in 2015 and resulted in a full year adverse currency impact of $1.20 on our adjusted diluted EPS. 
In the fourth quarter, our organic cigarette volume declined by 2.4% due to lower cigarette industry volumes and lower market share, notably in the Asia region. Our cigarette volume was impacted by a one-time distributor inventory adjustment in Russia related to supply chain optimization.  Excluding this adjustment, our quarterly volume decline was in line with that of the full year. 
Net revenues increased by 4%, excluding currency, with favorable pricing across all regions more than offsetting unfavorable volume mix, mainly in the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. As previously communicated, our incremental investments in 2015 were concentrated in the fourth quarter. This resulted in currency neutral-adjusted OCI and adjusted diluted EPS declines in the quarter.
Our full year 2015 results confirm that our business fundamentals are strong and the incremental investments that we made throughout the year and in the fourth quarter in particular should further reinforce our momentum in 2016. 
Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2016 at prevailing exchange rates is a range of $4.25 to $4.35, versus $4.42 in 2015 and includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.60. This guidance represents a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12%, compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. This reflects a currency neutral-adjusted OCI growth rate above our mid- to long-term algorithm. Importantly, this guidance does not include any share repurchases. We'll revisit the potential for repurchases as the year unfolds, depending on the currency environment. 
The $0.60 of unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rate included in our 2016 guidance is driven primarily by the Argentine peso, Indonesian rupee, Japanese yen and Russian ruble. These 4 currencies account for around 60% of the total impact. We've currently hedged approximately 72% of our 2016 forecast sales to Japan, which at prevailing exchange rates translates to an effective rate of JPY 118 to the U.S. dollar, versus JPY 110 in 2015. 
Pricing was the key driver of our full year 2015 financial performance. We recorded a total pricing variance of $2.1 billion, supported by strong contributions from all 4 regions. As a reminder, this variance includes an exceptional gain in Korea related to inventories built ahead of the January 2015 excise tax increase, which will not recur in 2016. This year, we anticipate the pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenues. 
Our performance in 2015 was underpinned by an improving cigarette industry volume trend and continued market share momentum. We estimate that international cigarette industry volume, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 2.4% in 2015, a further moderation compared to the declines in 2013 and 2014. For this year, we forecast a decline of 2% to 2.5% on the same basis. 
Our continued market share momentum in 2015 is clearly demonstrated on this slide, with international share, excluding China and the U.S., up by 0.2 points to 28.7% and share growth in the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. Our share in the Asia region was stable. 
Marlboro was a key driver of market share momentum in 2015, increasing its international share, excluding China and the U.S., by 0.2 points to 9.6%. The brand had growing or stable share in all 4 regions and continued to benefit from the rollout of Architecture 2.0, which is now approaching 100 markets worldwide. Importantly, our 2015 share in the top 30 PMI OCI markets grew by 0.7 points to 38%, with share up or essentially flat in 20 of these markets. This underscores the positive momentum of our business across the majority of our most profitable markets. 
While pricing and market share gains are the foundation of our top line growth, we remain focused on effectively managing our cost base. Our mid-term targeted annual cost base increase is 1% to 3%, excluding RRPs and currency. In 2015, we decided to deploy additional investments, some of which will not recur in 2016, to support the strong momentum of our cigarette brand portfolio and accelerate the geographic expansion of iQOS. This resulted in a total cost base, excluding currency, of 3.6% excluding RRPs, or 5.3% including RRPs.
In 2016, we expect our total cost base, including RRPs, to increase by approximately 1%, excluding currency, reflecting productivity and cost-saving programs and also helped by the moderating prices for key inputs such as tobacco leaf, clove and non-tobacco materials. 
Let me now discuss our performance in key geographies, beginning with EU region. Following declines of 7.3% and 3.1% in 2013 and 2014, respectively, there was a further moderation of the total cigarette industry volume decline to 0.9% in 2015. We attribute the moderation to improving economies, notably Southern Europe; a decline in the prevalence of illicit trade; less out-switching to the fine cut category; and a lower prevalence of e-cigarette or the e-vapor product.
Our positive cigarette share momentum in the region continued in 2015, with fourth quarter and full year share up by 0.3 points and 0.1 point, respectively. In the fourth quarter, our share increased in 5 of the 6 largest markets by cigarette industry volume, demonstrating the breadth of our share strength. 
As we had anticipated, our share in Italy was adversely impacted by the decline of Marlboro following its crossing of the EUR 5 per pack price point in the first quarter of 2015. Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield further reinforced their positions as the region's top 3 cigarette industry brands by volume for the second consecutive year. Full year market share for Marlboro increased by 0.2 points to 18.9%, driven by strong performances in France, Germany and Spain. Share for L&M increased by 0.1 point to 6.9%, while Chesterfield grew by 2 point (sic) [ 0.2 ] share points to 5.8%. 
The moderating cigarette industry volume decline, coupled with our market share gains and strong pricing, resulted in adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 4.6% in the EU region in 2015. This marked the region's first adjusted OCI increase on the same basis since 2009.  In 2016, we forecast middle single -- mid-single-digit currency neutral-adjusted OCI growth in the region. 
I will now turn to Russia, the largest market in our EEMA region, where estimated cigarette industry volume declined by 8.4% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the full year. The declines were mainly due to significant excise tax-driven retail price increases, which we estimate averaged more than 20% year-over-year, as well as lower consumer purchasing power.
Our full year 2015 market share increased by 0.9 points to 28.4%, driven mainly by low price Bond Street and super-low price Next, which benefited from adult smoker down-trading and a wider distribution, particularly in the eastern part of the country. Importantly, Parliament was up by 0.2 share points despite the overall premium segment's decline of 0.7 points.
In January this year, the government implemented its planned 2016 excise tax increase, resulting in an average tax pass-on of around RUB 10 per pack or 14% on an industry weighted average basis. In anticipation, we announced retail selling price increases across the majority of our portfolio of RUB 5 per pack last November and a further RUB 5 per pack this January, with the most recent increase likely to appear at retail in the second quarter.
Estimated cigarette industry volume in Turkey grew by 7.8% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year. This exceptional growth was driven mainly by a significant reduction in the prevalence of illicit trade, which declined by over 5 percentage points to around 14% in 2016. Our market share in Turkey has strengthened, with 3 quarters of sequential growth. Fourth quarter share increased by 0.3 points to 44.2% and was driven by the superb performance of Marlboro, up by 1.2 points to 9.9%. Marlboro shipment volume increased by 20.6% in the quarter. 
In January, the government increased the specific excise tax and the minimum excise tax, while leaving the ad valorem rate unchanged, representing a further improvement in the excise tax structure. This resulted in a pass-on of around TRY 0.40 per pack at the retail level. We implemented a retail selling price increase of TRY 1 per pack across the majority of our portfolio, thus enhancing unit margin.
I will now touch on our Asia region, beginning with Indonesia, where estimated cigarette industry volume was stable in 2015, in line with our forecast and primarily due to the soft economy. While market share in the fourth quarter declined by 1 point to 34.3%, reflecting the impact of retail price increases on our machine-made kretek brands taken in advance of the January 2016 excise tax increase, our full year market share grew slightly to 35%. On an industry weighted average basis, the 2016 excise tax increase is around 15%. Despite the muted performance of the total market last year, we remain very optimistic about the profit growth opportunities in this key market, thanks to its growing adult population and rising income level.
In the Philippines, price gaps narrowed further in the fourth quarter following price increases at the bottom of the market. The gap between Marlboro and the super-low price brands of our primary local competitor now stands at around PHP 1 per cigarette, a narrowing of PHP 0.50 per cigarette or 33% since December 2014. The improved price gaps have been a key driver of our strong share performance. Based on Nielsen retail audit data, our full year 2015 share increased by 1.4 points to 73.4%. Marlboro was the primary driver of this share gain, increasing by an impressive 2.7 points to 21.1%. Fortune also gained share, growing by 0.7 points to 31.1%. 
Marlboro shipment volume increased by 18.8% in 2015 and drove favorable mix. Encouragingly, we continue to improve profitability in this important market. 
In Japan, cigarette industry volume declined by 2.1% in 2015. This was less than what we had anticipated, due mainly to trade inventory buildup for competitors' recent new launches. Our cigarette market share performance was clearly below our expectations. Share declined by 0.6 points to 25.3% in 2015, due primarily to competitors' offerings in the new differentiated menthol taste segment. Nevertheless, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our cigarette brand portfolio in Japan.
Turning to our Reduced-Risk Products portfolio. Let me briefly highlight the progress that we made in 2015 on the commercialization of iQOS. During the year, we expanded the geographic presence of iQOS in our 2014 city launch markets, with the first wave of expansion in Japan reaching over 60% of the adult smoker population and initial expansion in Italy beyond Milan to Modena, Rome and Turin. We also launched iQOS in major cities across Switzerland and commenced city launches in Bucharest, Lisbon and Moscow. By the end of 2016, we expect iQOS to be present in key cities in around 20 markets globally. 
In Japan, which is by far our more advanced iQOS launch market in terms of geographic and adult smoker coverage, we estimate that there were over 130,000 fully or predominantly converted iQOS users by the end of 2015. In the last week of December, we achieved an estimated offtake share for Marlboro HeatSticks of 1.1% in the expansion area and 1.7% in Tokyo. Importantly, our weekly offtake shares have grown steadily since the expansion began in September. 
Please note that offtake share represents retail sales volumes for HeatSticks as a percentage of the total estimated retail sales volume for cigarettes and HeatSticks within a given geographic area. I look forward to sharing further the scientific and commercial progress that we've made with iQOS during our presentation at the CAGNY conference later this month.
I will now cover our free cash flow, which increased by over $300 million in 2015 to reach $6.9 billion. This was a remarkable achievement considering the adverse currency impact of $1.9 billion on our net earnings and was fueled by important working capital initiatives. As a reminder, the proceeds from the Sampoerna rights issue are not included in our free cash flow. 
In 2016, we forecast free cash flow broadly in line with last year's level, again despite the anticipated adverse currency headwind at prevailing exchange rates.
We remain focused on rewarding our shareholders generously, with the dividend currently serving as the primary use of our free cash flow. Last September, we increased our annual dividend for the eighth consecutive year since the spin in 2008, representing a total increase of approximately 122% and a compound annual growth rate of 12%. Our dividend yield at the end of last week was 4.5%. This is very attractive in comparison to the yields of a peer group company. 
In conclusion, 2015 was an excellent year for PMI, reflecting improved cigarette industry volume trends and very robust business fundamentals. Our superior cigarette brand portfolio, supported by a unique commercial organization, is driving strong pricing and continued market share gains. Marlboro is performing extremely well, with the continued rollout of the 2.0 Architecture driving volume and share growth. We're very excited by our progress with the commercialization of iQOS, which is underscored by our favorable HeatStick offtake share momentum in Japan. Our strong free cash flow continues to support our generous dividends. 
Finally, the outlook for our business remains strong. On a currency-neutral basis, our 2016 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42.

Essentially, it's an one-off adjustment, because we decided to have our own warehouses in certain parts of the country rather than our distributor in order to facilitate distribution. And on top of it, it helps working capital. So that's the reason we implemented, but there is no swings in there. That's one-off. In terms of what's happening in the market, in terms of total market, you appreciate it's a bit difficult to forecast. Last year, we had forecasted total market will decline by 9%. We ended up much better. We forecast again, given the magnitude of the price increases, another 9% this year. If we come out better, we'll all be very happy. That's how I see the market. Now in terms of down-trading, clearly there is down-trading. It's not dramatic, but we see -- if we look at the year, 2% share shifting from the mid-segment and premium segment to essentially the low-price segment, not the super-low, which is fairly stable. And we gained share in both premium, low and super-low segment. So I think we're well-positioned overall in this environment. Now again, Russia, you know the economy is a bit weak, the ruble has devalued. But overall, I think in terms of portfolio position, we are in a very good place and we're already taking pricing. So I feel pretty good about Russia overall, if the ruble was a bit less volatile than it is. Have I answered your questions?"

So just to facilitate your understanding, I would say that 40% of the incremental spending in the last quarter is nonrecurring in 2016, roughly, okay? And we clearly had also quite substantial incremental spending on iQOS in the fourth quarter. Now the nonrecurring items relate to obviously the implementation of the tobacco product directive in 2016, but some of the costs have to happen in 2015 and also some restructuring that we don't report on the reported, but in the normal earnings, plus some one-off items.

The -- on the positive side, clearly you have Korea, because last year, we had quite impressive decline, about apples-to-apples, I would say, 20%, which this year hopefully we're not going to see. And clearly, we see improving trends during the year. So that's on positive side. We had a good upside in Turkey last year because of the illicit trade reduction plus increased consumption. I don't think we're going to see the same increment in Turkey this year, obviously. But as the year unfolds, we will know better. In markets where we're less impacted, clearly, it's India that had a big decline last year because of excise and VAT increases. As you know, we have minimal exposure there. And Brazil, and Brazil is likely to continue this year, obviously, because we have a combination of VAT tax increases in certain states, because they have autonomy to decide about the VAT rates. And also, an excise tax increase that comes in 2 tranches in Brazil, one in May and one in December. So that's where I see it. Now Indonesia, again, is a bit early days. As you know, on one side, we had a slightly soft economy. Price, the pass-on of the excise tax in the previous years of about 5% of price increase equivalent. This year, it's 7.5%. Not dramatic, but slightly higher. And on the other side, we have -- or the positive side, we have minimum wage increases in the range of 11%.

But in general, because I get very often this question, is U.K. going to become Australia? The first thing is the impact of plain packaging on Australia down-trading is extremely difficult to estimate, if any, because it's much more a question of pricing, because if you remember, the margins at the bottom end of the market in Australia are still extremely high compared to the U.K. So I personally do not see an acceleration of the trends in the U.K., even if eventually plain packaging is implemented, because there are already brands at very low margins at the bottom end of the market, and I don't think we'll see an acceleration of the trends. Now in the EU in general, I don't see much down-trading here. Actually, the premium segment is stable, and we grew share with Marlboro.

We should not forget that in particularly in the last quarter, there were competitive introductions in the market. And clearly, because of the support of iQOS, we expanded nationally with no activities on our portfolio of cigarettes during that quarter. Okay? So that explains both the comparisons in terms of competitive pipelining and us focusing on iQOS and the higher decline in the share. Now from what we know today, approximately 40% of the people that switch and adopt iQOS come from our own brands, which is higher obviously than our market share in Japan. But I hope this is correct, because we are primarily targeting our own consumers as well, and it's Marlboro. So that's a little bit the proportion we see today, 40% coming from our portfolio and 60% from competitive brands."

6569181,330877802,959359,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 to a range of $4.40 to $4.50 at the prevailing exchange rates, that our vision is driven solely by",2020,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 to a range of $4.40 to $4.50 at the prevailing exchange rates, that our vision is driven solely by currency. Our guidance, therefore, now includes $0.45 of unfavorable currency that continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. 
We expect our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2016 to be skewed towards the second half of the year and the fourth quarter in particular.
The $0.15 moderations in the currency impact on our guidance reflects the depreciations of the U.S. dollar against the number of our key currencies since we last provided guidance in mid-February. As shown on this slide, the Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen and Russian ruble were the principal drivers of the variance. 
Let me now review our first quarter results, which, as expected, were heavily impacted by a difficult comparison versus our exceptionally strong first quarter results in 2016 that masked otherwise solid performance.
Organic cigarette volume in the quarter declined by 1.4% due mainly to the Asia region, principally Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines, and partially offset by the EU and Latin American and Canada regions as well as the favorable estimated impact of the leap year. As a reminder, our organic cigarette volume grew by 1.4% in the first quarter of 2015 [ph]. 
Our cigarette volume benefited from the strong performance of our international brands, where the top 7, including premium-priced Marlboro and above-premium Parliament, are growing. 
For the full year, we continue to forecast a decline in our organic cigarette volume of 1% to 1.5%. This compares favorably to our forecast of a cigarette industry volume decline, excluding China and the U.S., of 2% to 2.5%. 
On a currency-neutral basis, we recorded modest net revenue and adjusted diluted EPS growth in the quarter, while adjusted OCI declined slightly. As seen on this slide, our financial results faced particularly difficult comparisons in the quarter. The comparisons were challenging across all regions and even Asia, following the first quarter 2015 [ph] gain in Korea related to inventories built ahead of the January 2016 [ph]  Excise tax increase.
We recorded a pricing variance of $272 million in the first quarter, driven by the EU, EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions. Importantly, our pricing variance was slightly positive in the Asia region despite the unfavorable comparison related to the gain in Korea last year.
During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, notably Argentina, Germany, Indonesia and Russia as well as others shown on this slide. For the full year, we continue to anticipate the pricing variance of around 6% of our 2016 [ph] net revenues. 
Our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined slightly in the first quarter due mainly to Asia region, notably Indonesia and Japan, partly offset by the EU and Latin America & Canada regions. Marlboro's market share was stable on the same basis, with strong growth in the Asia, EU and LAC regions, offset by a decline in the EEMA region, due largely to North Africa.
Let me now discuss our regional results, beginning with the EU, where first quarter cigarette industry volume increased by 0.6%.
The strong industry performance continues to reflect the improving economies, notably in the Southern Europe, a decline in illicit trade, less out-switching for the fine cut category and a lower prevalence of e-vapor products. We also attribute some of the growth to the estimated favorable impact of immigration in select geographies.
Our positive momentum continued in the quarter, with regional cigarette share increasing by 0.6 points to 38.7%. Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield, the top 3 selling industry cigarette brands in the region, all grew share in the quarter, underscoring the growth trend of our portfolio.
We are progressing well with the commercializations of iQOS in the region. In Switzerland, iQOS is currently present in 6 key cities, representing approximately 1/3 of total cigarette industry volume. During the last week of March, we reached the HeatStick offtake share of 0.8% in the [indiscernible], the highest level since the launch last August. At 1.9% market share, HeatStick offtake share was even higher in the French-speaking part of the launch area, where we have concentrated the majority of our [indiscernible] thus far.
In Italy, HeatStick offtake share has been stable at around 0.2% in the expansions area covering Bologna, Milan, [indiscernible], Rome and Turin. We recently launched the latest version of the iQOS device and are refocusing our market approach and touch points to increase our effectiveness of our engagement. This includes the rollout of iQOS embassies, which leverage the iQOS flagship store concept that we have successfully deployed in Japan.
Turning to the EEMA region. We faced particularly difficult comparisons this year, following currency-neutral net revenue and adjusted OCI growth of 14.1% and 24.3%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2015 [ph]. 
We also faced challenges in some of our key EEMA markets. In Ukraine, the overall economic and geopolitical uncertainty contributed to a very competitive pricing environment, which began in late 2015 and is now starting to improve. In Algeria, sizable excise tax-driven retail price increases over the past year of approximately 21%, on an industry weighted average basis, put pressure on Marlboro share, though this was partly offset by the strong performance of L&M. We expect better performance in this market as the year unfolds and remain confident in the outlook for the region this year. 
In Russia, cigarette industry volume declined by 6% in the quarter, a resilient performance given the significant retail price increases over the past year of approximately 23% on an industry weighted average basis.
For the full year, we maintained our forecast for cigarette industry volume decline of around 9%. 
Our market share declined by 0.2 points to 27.8% in the February quarter-to-date period, which we attribute mainly to price increases for some of our products that reached adult smokers sooner than competitors' price increases.
The downtrading in our portfolio from the medium to lower-price segment was consistent with the broader industry trend. 
Our strong pricing resulted in another quarter of solid, double-digit, currency-neutral OCI growth, and we are targeting similar growth for the full year on the same basis.
In Turkey, cigarette industry volume grew by 11.7% in the first quarter, as the industry continued to benefit from a significant reduction in the illicit  trade. Our February quarter-to-date market share increased by 0.6 points to 43.9%, driven by the continued strength of Marlboro, which grew by 1.1 points to 10%. 
Currency-neutral OCI growth in the quarter was exceptional and benefited from our January price increases as well as higher cigarette volume, driven by the growth in both industry volume and market share.
Moving to the Asia region. Our financial results were similarly impacted by a difficult comparison, due principally to the gain in Korea that I mentioned earlier. Beyond this distortion, there were a number of positive developments in the quarter. Notably, Marlboro's regional cigarette market share and volume increased by 0.5 points and 5.1%, respectively. 
In Australia, the super-low price segment is showing signs of stabilization, and March price increases for cigarette brands in this segment were above the excise tax pass-on. Importantly, we grew our share in the quarter by 1.1 points to 36.4%, driven by Bond Street and Choice.
In the Philippines, price cuts were stable throughout the quarter and represented a significant narrowing compared to the first quarter of 2015. The narrowed price gaps between Marlboro and lower-price brands continue to support our strong overall share, which increased by 1.4 points to 73.6%.
Let me now cover some specific Asia region markets in more detail. In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume declined by 5.9% in the first quarter, due to mainly -- due mainly to the soft economy and the impact of industry weighted average price increases of around 11% in the quarter, which exceeded the inflation rate of around 4%.
The decline also reflects a difficult comparison versus the first quarter of 2015 in which cigarette industry volume grew by 6%. Our market share declined by 1.3 points to 34.1%, due primarily  to share loss in the machine-made kretek segment, reflecting the growth of competitors' plus 4 cigarette offers value propositions with 4 extra cigarettes per pack. The decline was partly offset by our favorable performance in the hand-rolled kretek segment, where we solidified our leadership positions and grew segment share. We expect our share loss in the quarter to be a temporary phenomenon, and we have a number of initiatives in place to restore growth, particularly in the machine-made kretek segment.
For the full year, we forecast a cigarette industry volume decline of 1% to 2% and are targeting double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth.
In Japan, cigarette industry volume increased by 2.3% in the first quarter, driven by estimated retail trade inventory movements and adult smoker purchases ahead of price increases for select competitors' brands effective April 1.
Excluding this favorable inventory movement, we estimate that cigarette industry volume was essentially flat. 
Our cigarette market share declined by 1.6 points, due to inventory movements, competitors' offerings in the differentiated menthol taste segment and cannibalization by HeatSticks. We continue to invest behind the pipeline of innovations for our cigarette brand portfolio, including the national rollout of Parliament Crystal Blast in March.
As you may be aware, last week, we submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance for approval to increase the prices of nearly all Lark variance and some Parliament variants by JPY 7 per pack effective August 1 -- by JPY 10 per pack effective August 1. This variant represents approximately 45% of our cigarette volume in Japan. 
We are very excited by the performance of iQOS in Japan. As seen on this cart, weekly HeatStick offtake share increased steadily for the end of the first quarter, reaching 2.4% in the expansion area and 3.4% in Tokyo during the last week of March. 
On a quarterly basis, we recorded a HeatStick offtake share of 1.8% in the expansions area and estimate that this equates to a first quarter national market share of approximately 0.8%. 
The positive HeatStick offtake share momentum is a clear indicator that iQOS is resonating with Japanese adult smokers. Importantly, we are seeing a steady increase in the proportion of iQOS purchasers who have predominately or fully converted to it, reaching approximately 60% in February. 
In addition, I am pleased to confirm that yesterday, we commend the full expansion of iQOS national.
Let me conclude my comments on regional performance with the Latin America & Canada region, where our cigarette volume increased by 2.4% in the quarter, driven principally by Mexico, partly offset by Argentina.
Regional market share increased by 1.1 points to 39.3%, reflecting growth in the majority of our key markets. Marlboro had a very strong quarter, with a share up by 1.2 points and volume growth of 8.5%.
Our strong net revenue and adjusted OCI growth rates, excluding currency, were driven mainly by pricing in Argentina and Canada.
In conclusion, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations with year-on-year performance adversely impacted by a difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2015. Nevertheless, the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to be strong. 
We are making exciting progress with the commercialization of iQOS, which is demonstrated, in particular, by the steady weekly growth in HeatStick's offtake share in Japan. Importantly, our iQOS conversion model is clearly working. We remain focused on generating strong free cash flow and continue to forecast full year 2016 free cash flow to be broadly in line with last year's level.
The outlook for 2016 remains strong. To reflect currency movements, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance, which, on a currency-neutral basis, continues to reflect the growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42. 
Thank you, and I am now happy to answer your questions."

I think the biggest challenge, which we have to compete with, if you like, in the quarter was essentially coming the lack of a pricing variance from Korea. And that's on a total PMI basis and obviously weighted quite largely on the Asia regions. If I were to add a lack of the pricing extra gain from Korea, our revenue was being 4.5% growth territory, and this is still despite a pretty challenging comp from Q1 over last year. So I think it's mostly the price, which was driving the revenues and obviously also the bottom line. And then obviously, you have a couple of accounts, which were coming from outside EU region, which were coming from the volume. I mean, the Russia, both total market and especially PMI performance, completely different comps. And Indonesia and Asia also contributed."

But so far, I think our plan absolutely valid for this year. And we're very excited not only by Japan. We have said -- like I said in my presentation, also very good results, which we achieved so far in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, but it's very encouraging. And in all places, which we have make iQOS available today, we're approaching or actually exceeding the conversions rate, which we're, at this stage, achieving an Japan.

Absent the iQOS partially comes but also increased investment, I guess the costs for the quarter would come about flat. Essentially, that would be flat. So all the cost growth in the quarter, one can attribute to the  investments behind iQOS. It's obviously ex currency but always on ex currency basis. To give a bit more light into how we see the quarters going forward, we still -- to confirm that our outlook for the total costs for  the year, and this is all inclusive again on ex currency basis, the conventional and RRP, Reduced-Risk Product,  on ex currency basis, the cost outlook still remains at about 1% for the full year. So we'll have obviously some comps issues in the quarters. If you look at the pacing of our growth rates, if I take it on an EPS level, second, third, fourth quarter, look, as much as we would be explaining the difficult comps in the Q1 of this year, I mean, clearly, we'll have a different situation, 180 degrees different situations in the Q4 of this year. So obviously, one should expect a quite a strong, very strong actually growth rate and EPS level in the Q4. And Q2 and Q3, we will be going somewhere below obviously the guidance, which we gave for the full year. This will very much also depend on the timing of some expenses and et cetera. I think revenue line is going to be cruising closer to what we said this for the full year, so somewhere in the corridor of 5% -- 5% to 6% quarter this year versus the quarters of the last year. We should see the evolutions of the revenue. So it's much more the differences, which we have in the comps coming from the investment, partially behind the conventional, but very much obviously driven by the deployment of iQOS."

But the input cost in general for Indonesia is, at this stage, pretty positive, I mean, a stable positive. So therefore, another compounding factor, compounding factors supporting our [indiscernible] that the Indonesia, our business in Indonesia can grow at a double-digit bottom line."

I think everyone is -- we don't see anything abnormal in speed of frequency in the light of the pricing being taken in Indonesia. Obviously, we have some positive adjustments due to the size of the relatively higher size of excise tax on their pass-on, which industry was confronted this year. So I think, as an industry, we follow what the competition price moves out there. It's nothing really abnormal taking theirs. Obviously, the prices are going a little bit higher due to, as I mentioned, higher pass-on to be passed to consumers. Now 4 extra stick price segments or some per-stick discounting, which has happened there, the segment of extra 4 sticks in the pack, which was sold at the price of the competitors' product with the 4 sticks life was, therefore, some time. I think until the relatively late, okay, let's say, maybe second half of last year, the segment wasn't about 3% to 4%, if I'm not mistaken, size of the total market. So it is a segment that's not very sizable segment. The other, very sizable segment in the market. This accelerated, I think, due to some offerings or introductions from some competitors. We're not very active in the segment. I think the recent -- the most recent reading of the size of the segment is somewhere in the range of 9%, maybe slightly above 9%. So it's growing. It accelerated the growth recently. I think in that environment, where the consumer is confronted with the frequent price increases and maybe of a slightly  higher nature than in the past, clearly, some form of the price also discounting. I mean, it might be attractive to some consumers. So that puts, obviously, especially if you look at to the quarterly shares, monthly shares, they put a pressure on some of our propositions in the market. But I mean, overall, I would say it's all on the situation."

Australia is not a drag, neither in the quarter, not able to think in our outlook for the full year. That's sort of a drag, not even near the drag, which we have had in the past periods. I mean, the situation, I think, the price increases are pleased, taking its face value as it is now, i.e. the price announcements versus the excise increase, we'll have to see how that develops. But it seems that the dynamics in terms of the discount growth segment, combined with this price increases from us and competitors might be a couple of steps in the right direction.

The transition periods are different in the different members. So logistically, it is a quite an exercise. They might be -- nothing has to happen, but it might be that there will be some distortions on a shipment level. I don't think it's been obviously part of the consumption or retail offtake, but it might be some difference on a shipment level in the quarters going forward. But it's difficult, frankly speaking to predict. There are a number of formats, which will have to be replaced. One format has to cease its existence at retail level, has to be replaced by the same cigarette but in a different pack format, et cetera.

Market share, I mean, it seems that this year, we are a little bit faster than competitions with rolling out the prices or maybe actually competition is a bit slower versus us in lowering out the prices, presumably for proper description of the situation. Russia also appears this year versus pretty strong share advancements last year. So 20, 30 basis points of share pressure. I mean, it doesn't really disturb us dramatically.

Now I have to admit one thing. This is not that we are trying to mask some of our performance in the conventional of business. However, 0.8, if I take the offtake shares from the places where iQOS is available today in Japan and recalculate this to have an equivalent in market sales market share compared to what we reported a conventional business, 0.8 in the quarter, knowing that there is cannibalizations from my own portfolio and very much skewed towards Marlboro, I would guess, if we just assume that half of that or close to half of that was for the cannibalization, clearly, iQOS already has an impact also on my conventional share performance. If I will just, as I said earlier, apply to use that number to explain the market share performance of Marlboro, about half of the Marlboro decline, I could -- i should actually attribute to the iQOS cannibalization. It's a good cannibalization. However, this is what we might observe for some time.

I mean, we had, as you remember, the market shares, conversions rates, which we had at Nagoya at the time of the city test, right, of the test market. No one, if you look at the progression of the share development in Nagoya, you wouldn't figure it out if we can accelerate the conversions and the market share to the levels that we have in a 60% of Japan, including Tokyo and other main cities.

I mean, obviously, there's always an estimate, but because the methodologies equally applied from year-on-year, I think we have a better account for about saying that there is a recent contributions of the illicit trade. And the contributions goes, I guess, depends now versus one what period, you're talking about a few couple of points of the growth is coming from the illicit trade. Now you would have to resume into Germany, which presumably has a much larger impact than, for example, U.K. when the illicit trade is still on the growth. Italy had a good results. And the Southern Europe actually is doing better. As you know, the recent moves also over last few months have found reinforcing, the border controls are reintroducing actually the border controls in between there, some EU states, EU markets and also outside. I mean, there clearly are another factor we feel contributes to tightening the domestic taxpaid market. I always give example of Turkey, which I know is outside EU. But Turkey has reduced the illicit trade year-on-year by about 10, 11 points, which is about half. I mean, the Turkish market normally wouldn't be growing -- or Turkish consumption, if you like, wouldn't be growing by a 10% or 11%. We're talking about the industry tax paid volumes growing for this magnitude. And this is clearly the recovery coming from a 10, 11 points almost of the recovery from the illicit trade. So I guess, you'll see the correlations. And that's -- I said to one of the questions earlier, it's more comfortable for us to talk about the illicit trade because there's quite a lot of data available or estimate available, and you can deduct for the high dose of a probability that this is a contributing factor. Immigrations more something which we hear about from -- read in the newspaper, et cetera. Clearly, this is -- there are movements in the dislocation of population, immigrations, et cetera, in some places. I think they do have a factor. They do have an impact on the industry."

As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 to a range of $4.40 to $4.50 at the prevailing exchange rates. The revision is driven solely by currency. Our guidance, therefore, now includes $0.45 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. 
We expect our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2016 to be skewed towards the second half of the year and the fourth quarter in particular.
The $0.15 moderations in the currency impact on our guidance reflects the depreciations of the U.S. dollar against the number of our key currencies since we last provided guidance in mid-February. As shown on this slide, the Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen and Russian ruble were the principal drivers of the variance. 
Let me now review our first quarter results, which, as expected, were heavily impacted by a difficult comparison versus our exceptionally strong first quarter results in 2015 that masked otherwise solid performance.
Organic cigarette volume in the quarter declined by 1.4% due mainly to the Asia region, principally Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines, and partially offset by the EU and Latin American & Canada regions as well as the favorable estimated impact of the leap year. As a reminder, our organic cigarette volume grew by 1.4% in the first quarter of 2015. 
Our cigarette volume benefited from the strong performance of our international brands, with the top 7, including premium-priced Marlboro and above-premium Parliament, all growing. 
For the full year, we continue to forecast a decline in our organic cigarette volume of 1% to 1.5%. This compares favorably to our forecast of a cigarette industry volume decline, excluding China and the U.S., of 2% to 2.5%. 
On a currency-neutral basis, we recorded modest net revenue and adjusted diluted EPS growth in the quarter, while adjusted OCI declined slightly. As seen on this slide, our financial results faced particularly difficult comparisons in the quarter. The comparisons were challenging across all regions and even Asia, following the first quarter 2015 gain in Korea related to inventories built ahead of the January 2015 excise tax increase.
We recorded a pricing variance of $272 million in the first quarter, driven by the EU, EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions. Importantly, our pricing variance was slightly positive in the Asia region, despite the unfavorable comparison related to the gain in Korea last year.
During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, notably Argentina, Germany, Indonesia and Russia as well as others shown on this slide. For the full year, we continue to anticipate a pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenues. 
Our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined slightly in the first quarter, due mainly to Asia region, notably Indonesia and Japan, partly offset by the EU and Latin America & Canada regions. Marlboro's market share was stable on the same basis, with strong growth in the Asia, EU and LAC regions, offset by a decline in the EEMA region, due largely to North Africa.
Let me now discuss our regional results, beginning with the EU, where first quarter cigarette industry volume increased by 0.6%.
The strong industry performance continues to reflect improving economies, notably in the Southern Europe, a decline in illicit trade, less out-switching to the fine cut category and a lower prevalence of e-vapor products. We also attribute some of the growth to the estimated favorable impact of immigration in select geographies.
Our positive momentum continued in the quarter, with regional cigarette share increasing by 0.6 points to 38.7%. Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield, the top 3 selling industry cigarette brands in the region, all grew share in the quarter, underscoring the broad strength of our portfolio.
We are progressing well with the commercialization's of iQOS in the EU region. In Switzerland, iQOS is currently present in 6 key cities, representing approximately 1/3 of total cigarette industry volume. During the last week of March, we reached the HeatStick offtake share of 0.8% in the launch area, the highest level since the launch last August. At 1.9% market share, HeatStick offtake share was even higher in the French-speaking part of the launch area, where we have concentrated the majority of our support thus far.
In Italy, HeatStick offtake share has been stable at around 0.2% in the expansions area, covering Bologna, Milan, Modena, Rome and Turin. We recently launched the latest version of the iQOS device and are refocusing our market approach and touch points to increase the effectiveness of our engagement. This includes the rollout of iQOS embassies, which leverage the iQOS flagship store concept that we have successfully deployed in Japan.
Turning to the EEMA region. We faced particularly difficult comparisons this year, following currency-neutral net revenue and adjusted OCI growth of 14.1% and 24.3%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2015. 
We also faced challenges in some of our key EEMA markets. In Ukraine, the overall economic and geopolitical uncertainty contributed to a very competitive pricing environment, which began in late 2015 and is now starting to improve. In Algeria, sizable excise tax-driven retail price increases over the past year of approximately 21%, on an industry weighted average basis, put pressure on Marlboro share, though this was partly offset by the strong performance of L&M. We expect better performance in this market as the year unfolds, and remain confident in the outlook for the region, this year. 
In Russia, cigarette industry volume declined by 6% in the quarter, a resilient performance given the significant retail price increases over the past year of approximately 23% on an industry weighted average basis.
For the full year, we maintained our forecast for a cigarette industry volume decline of around 9%. 
Our market share declined by 0.2 points to 27.8% in the February quarter-to-date period, which we attribute mainly to price increases for some of our products that reached adult smokers sooner than competitors' price increases.
The downtrading in our portfolio from the medium to lower-price segment was consistent with the broader industry trend. 
Our strong pricing resulted in another quarter of solid, double-digit, currency-neutral OCI growth, and we are targeting similar growth for the full year on the same basis.
In Turkey, cigarette industry volume grew by 11.7% in the first quarter, as the industry continued to benefit from a significant reduction in illicit  trade. Our February quarter-to-date market share increased by 0.6 points to 43.9%, driven by the continued strength of Marlboro, which grew by 1.1 points to 10%. 
Currency-neutral OCI growth in the quarter was exceptional and benefited from our January price increases as well as higher cigarette volume, driven by the growth in both industry volume and market share.
Moving to the Asia region. Our financial results were similarly impacted by a difficult comparison, due principally to the gain in Korea that I mentioned earlier. Beyond this distortion, there were a number of positive developments in the quarter. Notably, Marlboro's regional cigarette market share and volume increased by 0.5 points and 5.1%, respectively. 
In Australia, the super-low price segment is showing signs of stabilization, and March price increases for cigarette brands in this segment were above the excise tax pass-on. Importantly, we grew our share in the quarter by 1.1 points to 36.4%, driven by Bond Street and Choice.
In the Philippines, price gaps were stable throughout the quarter and represented a significant narrowing compared to the first quarter of 2015. The narrowed price gaps between Marlboro and lower-price brands continue to support our strong overall share, which increased by 1.4 points to 73.6%.
Let me now cover some specific Asia region markets in more detail. In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume declined by 5.9% in the first quarter, due to mainly -- due mainly to the soft economy and the impact of industry weighted average price increases of around 11% in the quarter, which exceeded the inflation rate of around 4%.
The decline also reflects a difficult comparison versus the first quarter of 2015, in which cigarette industry volume grew by 6%. Our market share declined by 1.3 points to 34.1%, due primarily to share loss in the machine-made kretek segment, reflecting the growth of competitors' plus 4 cigarette offers value propositions with 4 extra cigarettes per pack. The decline was partly offset by our favorable performance in the hand-rolled kretek segment, where we solidified our leadership positions and grew segment share. We expect our share loss in the quarter to be a temporary phenomenon, and we have a number of initiatives in place to restore growth, particularly in the machine-made kretek segment.
For the full year, we forecast a cigarette industry volume decline of 1% to 2% and are targeting double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth.
In Japan, cigarette industry volume increased by 2.3% in the first quarter, driven by estimated retail trade inventory movements and adult smoker purchases ahead of price increases for select competitors' brands, effective April 1.
Excluding this favorable inventory movement, we estimate that cigarette industry volume was essentially flat. 
Our cigarette market share declined by 1.6 points, due to inventory movements, competitors' offerings in the differentiated menthol taste segment and cannibalization by HeatSticks. We continue to invest behind a pipeline of innovations for our cigarette brand portfolio, including the national rollout of Parliament Crystal Blast in March.
As you may be aware, last week, we submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance for approval to increase the prices of nearly all Lark variants and some Parliament variants by JPY 7 per pack, effective August 1 -- by JPY 10 per pack, effective August 1. These variants represents approximately 45% of our cigarette volume in Japan. 
We are very excited by the performance of iQOS in Japan. As seen on this cart, weekly HeatStick offtake share increased steadily through the end of the first quarter, reaching 2.4% in the expansion area and 3.4% in Tokyo during the last week of March. 
On a quarterly basis, we recorded a HeatStick offtake share of 1.8% in the expansions area and estimate that this equates to a first quarter national market share of approximately 0.8%. 
The positive HeatStick offtake share momentum is a clear indicator that iQOS is resonating with Japanese adult smokers. Importantly, we are seeing a steady increase in the proportion of iQOS purchasers who have predominately or fully converted to it, reaching approximately 60% in February. 
In addition, I am pleased to confirm that yesterday, we commenced the full expansion of iQOS national.
Let me conclude my comments on regional performance with the Latin America & Canada region, where our cigarette volume increased by 2.4% in the quarter, driven principally by Mexico, partly offset by Argentina.
Regional market share increased by 1.1 points to 39.3%, reflecting growth in the majority of our key markets. Marlboro had a very strong quarter, with a share up by 1.2 points and volume growth of 8.5%.
Our strong net revenue and adjusted OCI growth rates, excluding currency, were driven mainly by pricing in Argentina and Canada.
In conclusion, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, with year-on-year performance adversely impacted by a difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2015. Nevertheless, the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to be strong. 
We are making exciting progress with the commercialization of iQOS, which is demonstrated, in particular, by the steady weekly growth in HeatStick's offtake share in Japan. Importantly, our iQOS conversion model is clearly working. We remain focused on generating strong free cash flow and continue to forecast full year 2016 free cash flow to be broadly in line with last year's level.
The outlook for 2016 remains strong. To reflect currency movements, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance, which, on a currency-neutral basis, continues to reflect a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42.

And that's on a total PMI basis and obviously weighted quite largely on the Asia regions. If I were to add a lack of the pricing extra gain from Korea, our revenue was being 4.5% growth territory, and this is still despite a pretty challenging comp from Q1 over last year. So I think it's mostly the price, which was driving the revenues and obviously also the bottom line.

Absent the iQOS, partially comes but also increased investment, I guess the costs for the quarter would come about flat. Essentially, that would be flat. So all the cost growth in the quarter, one can attribute to the investments behind iQOS. It's obviously an ex currency, always on ex currency basis, right? To give a bit more light into how we see the quarters going forward, we still -- to confirm that our outlook for the total costs for  the year, and this is all-inclusive again on ex currency basis, the conventional and RRP, Reduced-Risk Product, on ex currency basis, the cost outlook still remains at about 1% for the full year. So we'll have obviously some comps issues in the quarters. If you look at pacing of our growth rates, if I take it on a EPS level, second, third, fourth quarter, look, as much as we would been explaining the difficult comps in the Q1 of this year, I mean, clearly, we'll have a different situation, 180 degrees different situations in the Q4 of this year. So obviously, one should expect a quite a strong, very strong actually growth rate and EPS level in the Q4. And then Q2 and Q3, we will be going somewhere below obviously the guidance, which we gave for the full year. This will very much also depend on the timing of some expenses and et cetera. I think revenue line is going to be cruising closer to what we said is for the full year, so somewhere in the corridor of 5% -- 5% to 6% quarter, this year versus the quarters of the last year. We should see the evolutions of the revenue. So it's much more the differences, which we have in the comps coming from the investment, partially behind the conventional, but very much obviously driven by the deployments of iQOS."

I think everyone is -- we don't see anything abnormal in the speed of frequency if you like of the pricing being taken in Indonesia. Obviously we have some positive adjustments due to the size of the relatively higher size of excise tax on their pass-on, which industry was confronted this year. So I think, as an industry, we follow what the competition price moves are there. It's nothing really abnormal taking theirs. Obviously the prices are going a little bit higher due to this, as I mentioned, higher pass-on to be passed to consumers. Now 4 extra stick price segments or some per-stick discounting, which has happened there, the segment of extra 4 sticks in the pack, which was sold at the price of the competitors' product with the 4 sticks life was, therefore, some time. I think until the relatively late -- okay, let's say, maybe second half of the last year, the segment wasn't about 3% to 4%, if I'm not mistaken, size of the total market. So it is a segment that's not very sizable segment. The other, more sizable segments in the market. This accelerated, I think, due to some offerings or introductions from some competitors. We're not very active in the segment. I think the recent -- the most recent reading of the size of the segment is somewhere in the range of 9%, maybe slightly above 9%. So it's growing. It accelerated the growth recently. I think in that environment, when the consumer is confronted with the frequent price increases and maybe of a slightly higher nature than in the past, clearly, some form of the price also discounting. I mean, it might be attractive to some consumers. So that puts, obviously, especially if you look into the quarterly shares, monthly shares, they put a pressure on some of our propositions in the market.

They might be -- doesn't have to happen, but it might be that there will be some distortions on a shipment level. I don't think it's going to obviously impact the consumption or retail offtake, but it might be some difference on a shipment level in the quarters going forward. But it's difficult, frankly speaking to predict. There are a number of formats, which will have to be replaced. One format has to cease its existence at the retail level, has to be replaced by the same cigarette but in a different pack format, et cetera.

Market share, I mean, it seems that this year, we are a little bit faster than competitions. We're rolling out the prices or maybe actually competition is a bit slower versus us in lowering out the prices, presumably more appropriate description of the situation. Look, Russia also compares this year versus pretty strong share advancements last year. So 20, 30 basis points sort of share pressure. I mean, it doesn't really disturb us dramatically.

Now I have to admit one thing. This is not that we are trying to mask some of our performance in a conventional business. However, 0.8, if I take the offtake shares from the places where iQOS is available today in Japan and I recalculate this to have an equivalent in-market sales market share compared to what we reported on a conventional business, 0.8 in the quarter, knowing that there was cannibalizations from my own portfolio and very much skewed towards Marlboro, I would guess, if we just assume that half of that or close to half of that was for the cannibalization, clearly, iQOS already has an impact also on my conventional share performance. If I will just, as I said earlier, apply that to use that number to explain the market share performance of Marlboro, about half of the Marlboro decline, I could -- I should actually attribute to the iQOS cannibalization.

Maybe what's going to help is that some of the hedges are executed in the form of calls and put options, right? The color option strategy, which not necessarily have to have an impact if we see the development of the year -- of the yen going outside the bracket. And then the sum of that is done for the forwards, okay? Forwards, obviously, you can't walk away. But with that color options you have some flexibility, so you can take an advantage of what the spot rates can be."

And this is -- covers the trade channels, what I call route to the consumer, route to the trade, et cetera. So I think we're adjusting this one and trying to figure it out such a composition of all available to our blogs, which would result with manageable level of spending, if you like, versus the conversions rate, which we can achieve. Now Italy is -- I think we're going to crack the Italy also this year. I remain very positive on this. Despite the fact that for the couple of quarters growth, we're talking about the 0.2% market share. I mean, that's not much of an issue, I think, frankly speaking, at this stage. If I look at what we have achieved and achieving in part of Switzerland, and as you noticed, we, in some places, going deliberately, very focused in order to nail down the model properly on the smaller territory. And then we feel comfortable, we explore. I mean, let me remind you. I mean, we had, as you remember, the market shares, conversions rates, which we had at Nagoya at the time of the city test, right? Of the test market. No one, if you look at the progression of the share development in Nagoya, you wouldn't figure it out that we can accelerate the conversions and the market share to the levels which we have in 60% of Japan, including Tokyo and other main cities. So I think we're trying to get comfortable in the smaller territory, that we know that we can amplify and explore and amplify the right components of our marketing mix, broadly marketing mix. And then we go to the national level. And it's actually -- it's not part of a, obviously, higher cost spend, higher investment  by a more prudently invested into something, which really gives you a proper result. So -- and I am excited about the Japan. I'm very excited about the Switzerland. And I'm sure, we're going to demonstrate later on this year what we can do in Italy as well."

I mean, it's obviously always an estimate, but because the methodologies were equally applied from year-on-year, I think we have a better account for about saying that yes, there is a contributions of the illicit trade. And that contributions goes in, I guess, and well it depends now versus what period, you're talking about the few couple points of growth, is coming from the illicit trade. Now you would have to zoom into Germany, which presumably has a much larger impact than, for example, U.K. when the illicit trade is still on the growth. Italy had a good results, and then Southern Europe actually is doing better. As you know, the recent moves also over last few months of some reinforcing the border controls are reintroducing actually. The border controls in between there, some EU states, EU markets also outside. I mean, there clearly are another factor we feel contributes to tightening the domestic tax paid market. I always give example of Turkey, which I know is outside EU, and Turkey has reduced illicit trade year-on-year by about 10, 11 points, which is about half. I mean, the Turkish market normally wouldn't be growing -- or Turkish consumption, if you like, wouldn't be growing by a 10% or 11%. We're talking about the industry tax paid volumes growing for this magnitude. And this is clearly the recovery coming from a 10, 11 points almost of the recovery from illicit trade. So yes, you'll see the correlations. And that's -- I said to one of the questions earlier, it's more comfortable for us to talk about the illicit trade because there is quite a lot of data available or estimate available, and you can deduct for the high dose of a probability that this is a contributing factor. Immigrations more something which we hear about from -- read in the newspaper, et cetera. Clearly, this is -- there are movements in the dislocation of population, immigrations, et cetera, in some places. I think they do have a factor. They do have an impact on the industry."

The revision is driven solely by cu",2015,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 to a range of $4.40 to $4.50 at the prevailing exchange rates. The revision is driven solely by currency. Our guidance, therefore, now includes $0.45 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. 
We expect our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2016 to be skewed towards the second half of the year and the fourth quarter in particular.
The $0.15 moderations in the currency impact on our guidance reflects the depreciations of the U.S. dollar against the number of our key currencies since we last provided guidance in mid-February. As shown on this slide, the Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen and Russian ruble were the principal drivers of the variance. 
Let me now review our first quarter results, which, as expected, were heavily impacted by a difficult comparison versus our exceptionally strong first quarter results in 2015 that masked otherwise solid performance.
Organic cigarette volume in the quarter declined by 1.4% due mainly to the Asia region, principally Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines, and partially offset by the EU and Latin American & Canada regions, as well as the favorable estimated impact of the leap year. As a reminder, our organic cigarette volume grew by 1.4% in the first quarter of 2015. 
Our cigarette volume benefited from the strong performance of our international brands, with the top 7, including premium-priced Marlboro and above-premium, Parliament, all growing. 
For the full year, we continue to forecast a decline in our organic cigarette volume of 1% to 1.5%. This compares favorably to our forecast of a cigarette industry volume decline, excluding China and the U.S., of 2% to 2.5%. 
On a currency-neutral basis, we recorded modest net revenue and adjusted diluted EPS growth in the quarter, while adjusted OCI declined slightly. As seen on this slide, our financial results faced particularly difficult comparisons in the quarter. The comparisons were challenging across all regions and even Asia, following the first quarter 2015 gain in Korea related to inventories built ahead of the January 2015 excise tax increase.
We recorded a pricing variance of $272 million in the first quarter, driven by the EU, EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions. Importantly, our pricing variance was slightly positive in the Asia region, despite the unfavorable comparison related to the gain in Korea last year.
During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, notably Argentina, Germany, Indonesia and Russia, as well as others shown on this slide. For the full year, we continue to anticipate a pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenues. 
Our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined slightly in the first quarter, due mainly to Asia region, notably Indonesia and Japan, partly offset by the EU and Latin America & Canada regions. Marlboro's market share was stable on the same basis, with strong growth in the Asia, EU and LAC regions, offset by a decline in the EEMA region, due largely to North Africa.
Let me now discuss our regional results, beginning with the EU, where first quarter cigarette industry volume increased by 0.6%.
The strong industry performance continues to reflect improving economies, notably in the Southern Europe, a decline in illicit trade, less out-switching to the fine cut category and a lower prevalence of e-vapor products. We also attribute some of the growth to the estimated favorable impact of immigration in select geographies.
Our positive momentum continued in the quarter, with regional cigarette share increasing by 0.6 points to 38.7%. Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield, the top 3 selling industry cigarette brands in the region, all grew share in the quarter, underscoring the broad strength of our portfolio.
We are progressing well with the commercializations of iQOS in the EU region. In Switzerland, iQOS is currently present in 6 key cities, representing approximately 1/3 of total cigarette industry volume. During the last week of March, we reached the HeatStick offtake share of 0.8% in the launch area, the highest level since the launch last August. At 1.9% market share, HeatStick offtake share was even higher in the French-speaking part of the launch area, where we have concentrated the majority of our support thus far.
In Italy, HeatStick offtake share has been stable at around 0.2% in the expansions area, covering Bologna, Milan, Modena, Rome and Turin. We recently launched the latest version of the iQOS device and are refocusing our marketing approach and touch points to increase the effectiveness of our engagement. This includes the rollout of iQOS embassies, which leverage the iQOS flagship store concept that we have successfully deployed in Japan.
Turning to the EEMA region. We faced particularly difficult comparisons this year, following currency-neutral net revenue and adjusted OCI growth of 14.1% and 24.3%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2015. 
We also faced challenges in some of our key EEMA markets. In Ukraine, the overall economic and geopolitical uncertainty contributed to a very competitive pricing environment, which began in late 2015 and is now starting to improve. In Algeria, sizable excise tax-driven retail price increases over the past year of approximately 21%, on an industry weighted average basis, put pressure on Marlboro share, though this was partly offset by the strong performance of L&M. We expect better performance in this market as the year unfolds, and remain confident in the outlook for the region, this year. 
In Russia, cigarette industry volume declined by 6% in the quarter, a resilient performance given the significant retail price increases over the past year of approximately 23% on an industry weighted average basis. 
For the full year, we maintained our forecast for a cigarette industry volume decline of around 9%. 
Our market share declined by 0.2 points to 27.8% in the February quarter-to-date period, which we attribute mainly to price increases for some of our products that reached adult smokers sooner than competitors' price increases.
The downtrading in our portfolio from the medium to lower-price segment was consistent with the broader industry trend. 
Our strong pricing resulted in another quarter of solid, double-digit, currency-neutral OCI growth, and we are targeting similar growth for the full year on the same basis.
In Turkey, cigarette industry volume grew by 11.7% in the first quarter, as the industry continued to benefit from a significant reduction in illicit trade. Our February quarter-to-date market share increased by 0.6 points to 43.9%, driven by the continued strength of Marlboro, which grew by 1.1 points to 10%. 
Currency-neutral OCI growth in the quarter was exceptional and benefited from our January price increases, as well as higher cigarette volume, driven by the growth in both industry volume and market share.
Moving to the Asia region. Our financial results were similarly impacted by a difficult comparison, due principally to the gain in Korea that I mentioned earlier. Beyond this distortion, there were a number of positive developments in the quarter. Notably, Marlboro's regional cigarette market share and volume increased by 0.5 points and 5.1%, respectively. 
In Australia, the super-low price segment is showing signs of stabilization, and March price increases for cigarette brands in this segment were above the excise tax pass-on. Importantly, we grew our share in the quarter by 1.1 points to 36.4%, driven by Bond Street and Choice.
In the Philippines, price gaps were stable throughout the quarter and represented a significant narrowing compared to the first quarter of 2015. The narrowed price gaps between Marlboro and lower-price brands continue to support our strong overall share, which increased by 1.4 points to 73.6%.
Let me now cover some specific Asia region markets in more detail. In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume declined by 5.9% in the first quarter, due to mainly -- due mainly to the soft economy and the impact of industry weighted average price increases of around 11% in the quarter, which exceeded the inflation rate of around 4%.
The decline also reflects a difficult comparison versus the first quarter of 2015, in which cigarette industry volume grew by 6%. Our market share declined by 1.3 points to 34.1%, due primarily to share loss in the machine-made kretek segment, reflecting the growth of competitors' plus 4 cigarette offers, value propositions with 4 extra cigarettes per pack. The decline was partly offset by our favorable performance in the hand-rolled kretek segment, where we solidified our leadership positions and grew segment share. We expect our share loss in the quarter to be a temporary phenomenon, and we have a number of initiatives in place to restore growth, particularly in the machine-made kretek segment.
For the full year, we forecast a cigarette industry volume decline of 1% to 2% and are targeting double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth.
In Japan, cigarette industry volume increased by 2.3% in the first quarter, driven by estimated retail trade inventory movements and adult smoker purchases ahead of price increases for select competitors' brands, effective April 1.
Excluding this favorable inventory movement, we estimate that cigarette industry volume was essentially flat. 
Our cigarette market share declined by 1.6 points, due to inventory movements, competitors' offerings in the differentiated menthol taste segment and cannibalization by HeatSticks. We continue to invest behind a pipeline of innovations for our cigarette brand portfolio, including the national rollout of Parliament Crystal Blast in March.
As you may be aware, last week, we submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance for approval to increase the prices of nearly all Lark variants and some Parliament variants by JPY 7 per pack, effective August 1 -- by JPY 10 per pack, effective August 1. These variants represent approximately 45% of our cigarette volume in Japan. 
We are very excited by the performance of iQOS in Japan. As seen on this chart, weekly HeatStick offtake share increased steadily through the end of the first quarter, reaching 2.4% in the expansion area and 3.4% in Tokyo during the last week of March. 
On a quarterly basis, we recorded a HeatStick offtake share of 1.8% in the expansions area and estimate that this equates to a first quarter national market share of approximately 0.8%. 
The positive HeatStick offtake share momentum is a clear indicator that iQOS is resonating with Japanese adult smokers. Importantly, we are seeing a steady increase in the proportion of iQOS purchasers who have predominately or fully converted to it, reaching approximately 60% in February. 
In addition, I am pleased to confirm that yesterday, we commenced the full expansion of iQOS nationally.
Let me conclude my comments on regional performance with the Latin America & Canada region, where our cigarette volume increased by 2.4% in the quarter, driven principally by Mexico, partly offset by Argentina.
Regional market share increased by 1.1 points to 39.3%, reflecting growth in the majority of our key markets. Marlboro had a very strong quarter, with the share up by 1.2 points and volume growth of 8.5%.
Our strong net revenue and adjusted OCI growth rates, excluding currency, were driven mainly by pricing in Argentina and Canada.
In conclusion, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, with year-on-year performance adversely impacted by a difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2015. Nevertheless, the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to be strong. 
We are making exciting progress with the commercialization of iQOS, which is demonstrated, in particular, by the steady weekly growth in HeatStick's offtake share in Japan. Importantly, our iQOS conversion model is clearly working. 
We remain focused on generating strong free cash flow and continue to forecast full year 2016 free cash flow to be broadly in line with last year's level.
The outlook for 2016 remains strong. To reflect currency movements, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance, which, on a currency-neutral basis, continues to reflect a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42.

I think what we observed, what we forecast to observe this year, due to there's a bit of a softer -- due to the softer economy, et cetera, Indonesia may go into some decline this year, but pricing remains strong. The cost outlook for Indonesia, I mean, it seems pretty positive. And therefore, we're very confident that this year, as in the years in the past, I mean, Indonesia not only will grow double-digit bottom line, but also can remain a very significant contributor to overall PMI performance. So I'm very positive on Indonesia, both in the short and the longer term. But as many developing economies, they might have some periods of a relative slowdown and then they will go through acceleration."

I think it's maybe there are some movements in timing of movements between countries. I think the biggest challenge which we have to compete with, if you like, in the quarter was essentially coming the lack of a pricing variance from Korea. And that's on a total PMI basis and obviously weighted quite largely on the Asia regions. If I were to add a lack of the pricing or extra gain from Korea, our revenue would be in a 4.5% growth territory, and this is still despite a pretty challenging comp from Q1 of the last year. So I think it's mostly the price, which was driving the revenues and obviously, also the bottom line there. And then obviously, you have a couple of accounts, which were coming from outside EU region, which were coming mainly from the volume. I mean, the Russia, both total market and especially PMI performance, with completely different comps. And Indonesia and Asia also contributed."

But so far, I think our plan are absolutely valid for this year. And we're very excited not only by Japan. I mean, we have said -- like I said in my presentations, also very good results, which we achieved so far in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, but that's very encouraging. And in all places which we have make iQOS available today, we're approaching or actually exceeding the conversions rate, which we're, at this stage, achieving in Japan.

Absent the iQOS, partially comes but also increased investment, I guess the costs for the quarter would come about flat. Essentially, they would be flat. So all the cost growth in the quarter, you could -- one can attribute to the investments behind iQOS. It's obviously an ex currency, always on ex currency basis, right? To give a bit more light into how we see the quarters going forward, we still -- to confirm that our outlook for the total costs for  the year, and this is now all-inclusive again on ex currency basis, so conventional and RRP, Reduced-Risk Product, on ex currency basis, the cost outlook still remains at about 1% for the full year. So we'll have obviously some comps issues in the quarters. If you look at the pacing of our growth rates, if I take it on a EPS level, second, third, fourth quarter, look, as much as we would been explaining the difficult comps in the Q1 of this year, I mean, clearly, we'll have a different situation, 180 degrees different situations in the Q4 of this year. So obviously, one should expect a quite a strong, very strong actually growth rate and EPS level in the Q4. And then Q2 and Q3, we will be going somewhere below obviously the guidance, which we gave for the full year. This will very much also depend on the timing of some expenses, et cetera. I think revenue line is going to be cruising closer to what we said is for the full year, so somewhere in the corridor of 5% -- 5% to 6% quarter this year versus the quarters of the last year. We should see the evolutions of the revenue. So it's much more the differences which we have in the comps coming from the investment, partially behind the conventional, but very much obviously driven by the deployments of iQOS."

I think everyone is -- we don't see anything abnormal in the speed of frequency if you like of the pricing being taken in Indonesia. Obviously, we have some positive adjustments due to the size of the relatively higher size of excise tax on their pass-on, which industry was confronted this year. So I think, as an industry, if I follow what the competition price moves out there, it's nothing really abnormal taking theirs. Obviously, the prices are going a little bit higher due to this, as I mentioned, this higher pass-on to be passed to consumers. Now the 4 extra stick price segments or some per-stick discounting, which has happened there, that segment of extra 4 sticks in the pack, which was sold at the price of the competitors' product with the 4 sticks less was, there for some time, I think until the -- relatively late -- okay, let's say, maybe second half of the last year, the segment was at about 3% to 4%, if I'm not mistaken, size of the total market. So it is a segment, this not very sizable segment; the other, more sizable segments in the market. This accelerated, I think, due to some offerings or introductions from some competitors. We're not very active in that segment. I think the recent -- the most recent reading of the size of the segment is somewhere in the range of 9%, maybe slightly above 9%. So it grew. It accelerated the growth recently. I think in that environment, when the consumer is confronted with the frequent price increases and maybe of a slightly higher nature than in the past, clearly, some form of a price off, so discounting, I mean, it might be attractive to some consumers. So that puts, obviously, especially if you look into the quarterly shares, the monthly shares, they put a pressure on some of our propositions in the market.

Look, Russia also compares this year versus pretty strong share advancements last year. So 20, 30 basis points sort of a share pressure, I mean, it doesn't really disturb us dramatically. I mean, the more important is that the total volume of the industry somehow seems on a stronger side relative again to the price increases.

There are challenges which we are facing on a combustible business, and we're trying to get the right portfolio of innovations into the market to address the problem. I think the launch of the Parliament Crystal Blast towards the end of first quarter was just  another initiative which we're bringing to address the pressure which we have in this new taste menthol category, the capsule product, et cetera. So by no means we are refocusing our attention from a combustible to iQOS. Now, having said so, the story of iQOS is getting more and more exciting every time we look at the results from Japan. Now I have to admit one thing. This is not that we are trying to mask somehow our performance in a conventional business. However, 0.8, if I take the offtake shares from the places where iQOS is available today in Japan and I recalculate this to have an equivalent in-market sales market share compared to what we reported on a conventional business, 0.8 in a quarter, knowing that there was the cannibalizations from my own portfolio and very much skewed towards Marlboro, I would guess if we just assume that half of that or close to half of that was for the cannibalization, clearly, iQOS already has an impact also on my conventional share performance. If I will just, as I said earlier, apply that or we use that number to explain the market share performance of Marlboro, about half of the Marlboro decline, I could -- I should actually attribute to the iQOS cannibalization. It's a good cannibalization. However, this is what we might observe for some time. So Judy, we're trying to address both conventional and both RRPs, but we do have to recognize that it might be some obvious interactions between the both categories."

Now, Italy is -- I think we're going to crack the Italy also this year. I remain very positive on this, despite the fact that for the couple of quarters in the row, we're talking about a 0.2% market share. I mean, that's not much of an issue I think, frankly speaking, at this stage. If I look what we have achieved and achieving in part of Switzerland, and as you noticed, we, in some places, going deliberately, very focused in order to nail down the model properly on the smaller territory. And then we feel comfortable, we explore. I mean, let me remind you. I mean, we had, as you remember, the market shares, the conversions rates, which we had at Nagoya at the time of the city test, right, of the test market. And no one, if you look at the progression of the share development in Nagoya, you wouldn't figure it out that we can accelerate the conversions and the market share to the levels which we have in 60% of Japan, including Tokyo and other main cities. So I think we're trying to get comfortable in the smaller territory, that we know that we can amplify it and explore it and amplify the right components of our marketing mix, broadly marketing mix. And then we go to the national level. And it's actually -- it's not part of a -- obviously, higher cost spend, higher investment, but more prudently invest it into something which really gives you a proper result. So I am excited about Japan and very excited about Switzerland. And I am sure we're going to demonstrate later on this year what we can do in Italy as well."

And that contributions goes in a -- I guess, in a -- well it depends now versus what period, but you're talking about a few, couple points of growth, is coming from the illicit trade. Now, you would have to zoom into Germany, which presumably has a much larger impact than, for example, U.K. when the illicit trade is still on the growth. Italy had good results. I mean Southern Europe actually is doing better. As you know, the recent moves also over last few months of some reinforcing, the border controls are reintroducing actually. The border controls in between there, some EU states, EU markets and also outside, I mean, there clearly are another factor which also contributes to tightening the domestic tax paid market. I always give a example of Turkey, which I know is outside EU, but Turkey has reduced illicit trade year-on-year by about 10, 11 points, which is about half. I mean, the Turkish market normally wouldn't be growing -- or Turkish consumption, if you like, wouldn't be growing by a 10% or 11%. We're talking about the industry tax paid volumes growing for this magnitude. And this is clearly the recovery coming from a 10, 11 points almost of the recovery from illicit trade. So yes, you see the correlations and -- but I said to one of the questions earlier, it's more comfortable for us to talk about the illicit trade because there is quite a lot of data available or estimates available, and you can deduct with a high dose of a probability that this is a contributing factor. Immigration's more something which we hear about from reading the newspapers, et cetera. Clearly, there are movements in the dislocation of population, immigrations, et cetera. In some places, I think they do have a factor. They do have an impact on the industry."

As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to a range of $4.45 to $4.55 at the prevailing exchange rates. The revision is driven solely by",1757,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. 
As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to a range of $4.45 to $4.55 at the prevailing exchange rates. The revision is driven solely by currency. Our full year business outlook remains strong. Our guidance, therefore, now includes $0.40 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. We expect our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth in the third quarter to be broadly in line with that of the second quarter. And secondly, our full year 2016 adjusted diluted EPS growth on the same basis is expected to be heavily skewed towards the final quarter, largely reflecting a favorable comparison versus the fourth quarter of 2015, during which we made significant investments behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio. 
As seen on this slide, the $0.05 moderation in the currency impact on our guidance primarily reflects the appreciation of the Japanese yen and the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar since we last provided guidance in April. 
Let me now take you through our second quarter results. Our organic cigarette shipment volume declined by 4.8% or by 4.3%, excluding estimated inventory movements due in large part to decreases in low-margin volumes in Pakistan and the Philippines. This market accounted for approximately 2 points of the organic cigarette shipment volume decline. 
Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the second quarter increased by 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively, excluding currency. The growth in adjusted OCI reflected favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume/mix, particularly in the EEMA and Asia regions as well as higher costs related to the commercialization of iQOS. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 1.7 points -- percent excluding currency.
Our favorable pricing volumes of $344 million in the second quarter reflected positive contributions from all regions, notably, EU and EEMA. The favorable pricing in the Asia region was driven by Indonesia and the Philippines, partly offset by Japan and Korea. During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, including those shown on this slide, which should support favorable pricing in the second half of the year. In addition, earlier this month, we received approval from the Ministry of Finance in Japan to increase the retail price of select Parliament variants by JPY 10 per pack effective August 1. For the full year, we continue to anticipate a pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 [ph] net revenue. 
Our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.4 points in the quarter due mainly to the Asia region. Marlboro cigarette share increased slightly, with growth in the EU, Asia and Latin America & Canada regions, partly offset by a decline in the EEMA region. 
Turning now to our regional results. Cigarette industry volume in the EU region declined by more than 0.3%, excluding estimated inventory movements, reflecting a continuation of the 4 favorable trends listed on the slide that we have observed over recent quarters. We also attribute some of the industry resilience to the estimated favorable impact of immigration in select geographies. 
The continued moderation in the level of illicit trade is consistent with the findings of an annual study published by KPMG in May. It's concluded that the incidence of illicit trade in the EU declined by 0.6 points to 9.8% in 2015, with decreases in most major markets. For the full year, we forecast a decline in cigarette industry volume of around 1%.
Our cigarette market share in the EU region decreased by 0.2 points in the second quarter. The decline was due mainly to Germany and Italy, partly offset by share growth in 4 of the regions, our largest market by industry volume, where Marlboro share increased. In Germany, the sharp decline was due in large part to estimated inventory movement, though it also partly reflected the impact of L&M leaving its around 5 0 [ph] price point in 2015 [ph]. In Italy, the decline was due largely to the timing of competitors' price increases as well as smoker down-trading for the mid- and super-low price segment. 
Regional adjusted OCI increased by 3.5%, excluding currency, driven by higher pricing, notably in Germany and Italy and supported by the resilient cigarette industry volume performance. For the full year, we are targeting currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the high single-digit range, driven in part by a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter.
In the EEMA region, we recorded strong results in the quarter with adjusted OCI growth of 10.1%, excluding currency, driven by Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. In Russia, higher pricing drove another quarter of double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth, consistent with our full year target. Cigarette industry volume declined by 6.8% in the quarter and by 5.3% June year-to-date. Our cigarette market shares decline in the quarter was due mainly to the slower penetration of our competitors' price increases. Given the continued resilience of cigarette industry volume, we now forecast a full year 2016 industry decline of around 7%.
Turkey also recorded solid currency-neutral OCI growth in the quarter, driven by favorable volume/mix, reflecting higher cigarette shipment volume supported by Marlboro and higher pricing. 
Our strong currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the EEMA region came despite negative volume/mix in North Africa, where general macroeconomic and geopolitical instability continued to put pressure on cigarette industry volume and premium-priced products, including Marlboro. In Algeria, specifically, Marlboro has also been impacted by the combination of steep excise tax-driven price increases earlier this year and lower-than-anticipated adult smoker acceptance of the 2.0 architecture for Marlboro Round Taste. 
In the Latin America & Canada region, we recorded cigarette share growth of 0.7 points, driven by Brazil and Canada. Marlboro cigarettes share increased by 0.4 points, reflecting growth, notably in Brazil. Currency-neutral adjusted OCI declined in the quarter due largely to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina, following a significant excise tax increase in May, which resulted in retail price increases of approximately 50% on an industry weighted average basis. The decline was partly offset by favorable pricing, notably in Argentina and Canada.
Turning now to the Asia region. Our adjusted OCI declined by 5.4%, excluding currency. This was due mainly to unfavorable volume/mix and higher costs related to the commercialization of iQOS. The lower volume/mix was predominantly in Japan, primarily reflecting an unfavorable comparison with the second quarter of 2015 related to distributor inventory movement. For the full year, we are targeting regional adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency, in the mid- to high single-digit range, driven in part by a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter. Our positive full year outlook for the Asia region is supported by favorable development in several of our key markets. In the Philippines, price gaps between Marlboro and lower-price brands remained stable throughout the quarter and represented a significant narrowing compared to the second quarter of 2015. This continued to support our share growth and positive mix. In Indonesia, our quarterly market share is beginning to stabilize on a sequential basis and has benefited from our latest launches and geographical expansions in the machine-made kretek segment. For the full year, we are targeting double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth despite a cigarette industry volume decline forecast in the range of 1% to 2%. In Japan, we're also seeing signs of stabilizations in our cigarette market share on a sequential basis after excluding the estimated impact of inventory movement. Marlboro is responding well to the reduced price gap of the leading brand in the market, while recent launches, such as Lark 7.0 Splash in the differentiated menthol taste category, are showing positive momentum. 
I will now cover iQOS, beginning with our exceptional performance in Japan. HeatSticks market share has increased steadily since the national rollout in mid-April, reaching an estimated 2.7% for the last week of June. For the second quarter, HeatSticks market share reached 2.2%, more than double its first quarter share. Given the taxes of iQOS, we are working to effectively manage our HeatSticks capacity and iQOS device supply to ensure we can meet HeatSticks demand over the balance of 2016. The performance of iQOS in Japan has been supported by growing adult smoker conversion. Based on our most recent data, 70% of iQOS purchasers have either fully or predominantly converted to it. Our research in Japan also indicates 2 other positive developments. First, the level of HeatSticks cannibalizations from our own cigarette portfolio has declined to around 35% from around 40% when we began the initial geographic expansion of iQOS last September. Second, the growth of HeatSticks is resulting in uptrading, as adult smokers across all price segments are converting to a premium-priced product. The strong performance of iQOS in Japan highlighted potential in our other launch markets, which today are in early stages of commercialization and geographic coverage. Importantly, we are seeing encouraging HeatSticks offtake volume trends in all launch markets. Chart highlights our weekly index offtake volume performance during the first half of 2016 for the launch geographies, where iQOS has been present since the beginning of the year. 
The commercialization of iQOS continues to progress well across other metrics. As highlighted by Italy and Switzerland, we are generally achieving combined full and predominant conversion levels, in line with those in Japan. We're also seeing decreasing cannibalization rates in both Italy and Switzerland, consistent with Japan. In addition, iQOS was present in 10 markets by the end of June, following the -- its commercialization in select cities in Denmark, Germany and Monaco. We remain on track to launch iQOS in key cities in around 20 markets by the end of this year. 
In conclusion, our second quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, reflecting favorable developments across many of our key markets, though cigarette shipment volume was lower than anticipated due to Argentina, North Africa and Pakistan.
We are making exciting progress with the commercialization of iQOS and are on track with other launch plans for this year. We remain focused on generating strong free cash flow and continue to forecast the full year 2016 free cash flow broadly in line with last year's level. 
The outlook for 2016 remains strong. We are raising our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance, which, on a currency-neutral basis, continues to reflect a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42. 
Thank you, and I will be now happy to answer your questions."

Look, I think, at this stage, I think we'll be forced to say that we will likely miss our volume high expectations, initial expectations for the year. I think it will come definitely lower than 1.5% decline, which 1% to 1.5% decline. We might be as low as 3% for the full year. This will be coming from the few geographies, which not necessarily put a big pressure on our bottom line. But that's -- at this stage, that might be the outlook for the full year. It obviously may result in some industry volumes to be adjusted accordingly. I think, initially, we say that industry somewhere should be in the range of 2% to 2.5%, and industry might be lower by 2.5%. But we will have to see, okay? Just to be on the cautious side. Now when it comes to tax increases, yes, Argentina was a very large increase and resulted in a very high price increase. So there is, I think, at this moment, we would consider impact on the volume. And I think it may continue for some time, maybe not for the long time because this outsized tax increase happens in the high inflationary market. The time will be -- will help the consumers to accommodate to the price level, I would argue, faster than in our situation. And outside Argentina, frankly speaking, we have not had anything, which will be very disturbing on excise increase. I mean, Algeria, it's much more -- the whole context of North Africa, the political instability, what is happening at the border, in the individual markets, countries there, plus we have a specific to us, issue, which I highlighted in my remarks, connected with the rollout of architecture 2.0 for the Marlboro Red variant when we had -- I have to admit, the first market, in which we've been confronted with the last lower-than-expected acceptance of a new Marlboro. And as you know, we have roll out Marlboro to 100-plus market, and this is the only market in which we had some significant headwinds in -- from the beginning of the year. We're obviously working on addressing this. It's a marketing perception program, but it may take us some time to address it. So hopefully, part of that improvement, we should see already this year. I hope I answered your questions."

So I guess, mechanically, I can see how it works. But if the comparison to last year has elevated spending in fourth quarter seemed to be about a 3% to 4% tailwind for the full year, so in terms of closing the gap and getting up to that 10% to 12% range, are there any specific factors or sources of flexibility around the timing of reinvestment that you can point to just to sort of increase our confidence around the levers you have to pull to get up to that level of earnings growth?"

Thank you because, actually, it reminded me that I forgot to put it in the context of iQOS, right, that the volumes, which the guidance for the expectations for the volume, which we share, are obviously on the combustible cigarettes. And as you noticed presumably on the quarter already, we start quite a significant volume of iQOS, which are not included in this number. Now clearly, iQOS sales or HeatSticks sales for the year will, to some extent, offset the volume declines, which we'll have on a combustible business. That's on a positive side will not fully offset because we have a capacity limitations, which on the HeatSticks, which I may cover in a second. Having said so, I mean, some of the volumes, which may come short this year, they're coming from the relatively lower margin places, except for Algeria, when we have a problem with Marlboro. I mean, the Pakistan volumes, Philippines volumes, they come in statistics, if you like, but not really make a big impact or big change at the bottom line. So we're pretty comfortable, especially Philippines because the market is losing, and we're losing the extremely low-margin volumes or 0 margin volumes at the bottom of the market, and we're having some positive recovery for the mix for Marlboro. Now coming to iQOS is that, as you might have noticed, the shipments for the total PMI of iQOS in the quarter to $1.6 billion, they're almost 4x higher than what we had in the first quarter. So we can see the dynamics of the acceptance of iQOS. Obviously, it's very much driven by Japan, and we have to be very much focused on Japan this year because we don't have our limited capacity. You might remember, we have accelerated the launch plans of all markets, including Japan, by about a year, not being fully ready on the manufacturing side. Initially, our capacity was to be in the range of 5 billion units. We have made some efforts to increase that capacity by 1 billion or so this year, but I wouldn't expect any further miracles on a capacity this year. And we may continue with some pressure in a capacity for the beginning of this year. Right now, we're revising our CapEx plans. And in order to accelerate not only the increase or the acceleration of the 30 billion capacity plan, which we built in Italy, in order to be able to satisfy the market demand."

So I think the 6% is achievable. I think we feel confident about this. There is a pricing -- some price negativity due to the allowances of discounts, which we're giving to the iQOS purchasers, not the HeatSticks or iQOS purchasers in Japan. And although over a period of time, we'll have reduced, in the yen or device, the discount, due to the higher volume of the devices, which we're selling, I mean, that puts a little bit of a negative on the pricing variance into the lower behind iQOS.

Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, I mean, we have to bear in mind that we don't have a fully available capacity. And we are today, in a situation that we have a national coverage, the only place where we have a national coverage as Japan. And we know that those will switch to iQOS. 600-plus-thousand consumers in Japan, we cannot put them in a situation of out of stock because they then tell us that after 2 or 3 weeks of smoking of iQOS, they've actually done, don't like to, and they cannot switch back to cigarettes. So we're a little bit trapped now in the situation that we have to make sure that in Japan, has a continuously of a supply before we start what stronger on the pedal in other places. So we are preparing our iQOS stores, I think, by now, we have a more than 20 flagship stores in a number of geographies, obviously, including Japan. We're preparing the Internet. We're preparing the sales force, the whole commercializations. We can start. We're recruiting the first consumers, the first smokers in these places. But frankly speaking, at this stage, growing more resources would just generate a higher demand, and we are not in a situation where we can meet the demand with our supply constraints at this moment in time. So this is how we have to work. The second market, which is closed on national expansions, full expansion is Switzerland. And in Switzerland, we start moving, as you remember, the markets in the German parts. And I think we grew the volumes in that part me about 50% quarter-on-quarter. We continue growing the market share in the French part. We think we grow about 2% market share at the end of the Q2.

So I think the moment when we'll be able to amplify the Italy to the national coverage like we did in Japan, obviously, we need to discount the different channel from communications, which we have available in Italy versus in Japan.

As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to a range of $4.45 to $4.55 at the prevailing exchange rates. The revision is driven solely by currency. 
Our full year business outlook remains strong. Our guidance, therefore, now includes $0.40 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. We expect our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth in the third quarter to be broadly in line with that of the second quarter. Consequently, our full year 2016 adjusted diluted EPS growth on the same basis is expected to be heavily skewed toward the final quarter, largely reflecting a favorable comparison versus the fourth quarter of 2015, during which we made significant investments behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio. 
As seen on this slide, the $0.05 moderation in the currency impact on our guidance primarily reflects the appreciation of the Japanese yen and the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar since we last provided guidance in April. 
Let me now take you through our second quarter results. Our organic cigarette shipment volume declined by 4.8% or by 4.3% excluding estimated inventory movements due in large part to decreases in low-margin volumes in Pakistan and the Philippines. These markets accounted for approximately 2 points of the organic cigarette shipment volume decline. 
Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the second quarter increased by 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively, excluding currency. The growth in adjusted OCI reflected favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume/mix, particularly in the EEMA and Asia Regions as well as higher costs related to the commercialization of iQOS. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 1.7%, excluding currency.
Our favorable pricing volumes of $344 million in the second quarter reflected positive contributions from all regions, notably EU and EEMA. The favorable pricing in the Asia Region was driven by Indonesia and the Philippines, partly offset by Japan and Korea. During the said quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, including those shown on this slide, which should support favorable pricing in the second half of the year. In addition, earlier this month, we received approval from the Ministry of Finance in Japan to increase the retail price of select Parliament variants by JPY 10 per pack effective August 1. For the full year, we continue to anticipate a pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenues. 
Our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.4 points in the quarter due mainly to the Asia Region. Marlboro cigarette share increased slightly with growth in the EU, Asia and Latin America & Canada Regions, partly offset by a decline in the EEMA Region. 
Turning now to our regional results. Cigarette industry volume in the EU Region declined by more than 0.3%, excluding estimated inventory movements, reflecting a continuation of the 4 favorable trends listed on the slide that we have observed over recent quarters. We also attribute some of the industry resilience to the estimated favorable impact of immigration in select geographies. 
The continued moderation in the level of illicit trade is consistent with the findings of an annual study published by KPMG in May. It concluded that the incidence of illicit trade in the EU declined by 0.6 points to 9.8% in 2015 with decreases in most major markets. For the full year, we forecast the decline in cigarette industry volume of around 1%.
Our cigarette market share in the EU Region decreased by 0.2 points in the second quarter. The decline was due mainly to Germany and Italy, partly offset by share growth in 4 of the region's other largest market by industry volume, where Marlboro share increased. In Germany, the share decline was due in large part to estimated inventory movements, though it also partly reflected the impact of L&M leaving its round EUR 5 price point in 2015. In Italy, the decline was due largely to the timing of competitors' price increases as well as adult smoker down-trading to the mid- and super-low price segments. 
Regional adjusted OCI increased by 3.5%, excluding currency, driven by higher pricing, notably in Germany and Italy, and supported by the resilient cigarette industry volume performance. For the full year, we are targeting currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the high single-digit range, driven in part by a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter.
In the EEMA Region, we recorded strong results in the quarter with adjusted OCI growth of 10.1%, excluding currency, driven by Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. In Russia, higher pricing drove another quarter of double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth, consistent with our full year target. Cigarette industry volume declined by 6.8% in the quarter and by 5.3% June year-to-date. Our cigarette market share decline in the quarter was due mainly to the slower penetration of our competitors' price increases. Given the continued resilience of cigarette industry volume, we now forecast a full year 2016 industry decline of around 7%.
Turkey also recorded solid currency-neutral OCI growth in the quarter, driven by favorable volume/mix, reflecting higher cigarette shipment volume supported by Marlboro and higher pricing. Our strong currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the EEMA Region came despite negative volume/mix in North Africa, where general macroeconomic and geopolitical instability continued to put pressure on cigarette industry volume and premium-priced products, including Marlboro. In Algeria specifically, Marlboro has also been impacted by the combination of steep excise tax-driven price increases earlier this year and lower-than-anticipated adult smoker acceptance of the 2.0 Architecture for Marlboro Round Taste. 
In the Latin America & Canada Region, we recorded cigarette share growth of 0.7 points, driven by Brazil and Canada. Marlboro cigarette share increased by 0.4 points, reflecting growth, notably in Brazil. Currency-neutral adjusted OCI declined in the quarter due largely to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina following a significant excise tax increase in May, which resulted in retail price increases of approximately 50% on an industry weighted average basis. The decline was partly offset by favorable pricing, notably in Argentina and Canada.
Turning now to the Asia Region. Our adjusted OCI declined by 5.4%, excluding currency. This was due mainly to unfavorable volume/mix and higher costs related to the commercialization of iQOS. The lower volume/mix was predominantly in Japan, primarily reflecting an unfavorable comparison with the second quarter of 2015 related to distributor inventory movements. For the full year, we are targeting regional adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency, in the mid- to high single-digit range, driven in part by a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter. 
Our positive full year outlook for the Asia Region is supported by favorable development in several of our key markets. In the Philippines, price gaps between Marlboro and lower-priced brands remained stable throughout the quarter and represented a significant narrowing compared to the second quarter of 2015. This continued to support our share growth and positive mix. In Indonesia, our quarterly market share is beginning to stabilize on a sequential basis and has benefited from our latest launches and geographical expansions in the machine-made kretek segment. For the full year, we are targeting double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth despite a cigarette industry volume decline forecast in the range of 1% to 2%. In Japan, we are also seeing signs of stabilizations in our cigarette market share on a sequential basis after excluding the estimated impact of inventory movements. Marlboro is responding well to the reduced price gap with the leading brand in the market while recent launches, such as Lark 7.0 Splash Purple in the differentiated menthol taste category, are showing positive momentum. 
I will now cover iQOS, beginning with our exceptional performance in Japan. HeatSticks market share has increased steadily since the national rollout in mid-April, reaching an estimated 2.7% for the last week of June. For the second quarter, HeatSticks market share reached 2.2%, more than double its first quarter share. Given the success of iQOS, we are working to effectively manage our HeatSticks capacity and iQOS device supply to ensure we can meet HeatSticks demand over the balance of 2016. 
The performance of iQOS in Japan has been supported by growing adult smoker conversion. Based on our most recent data, 70% of iQOS purchasers have either fully or predominantly converted to it. Our research in Japan also indicates 2 other positive developments. First, the level of HeatSticks cannibalizations from our own cigarette portfolio has declined to around 35% from around 40% when we began the initial geographic expansion of iQOS last September. Second, the growth of HeatSticks is resulting in up-trading as adult smokers across all price segments are converting to a premium-priced product. 
The strong performance of iQOS in Japan highlights its potential in our other launch markets, which today are in early stages of commercialization and geographic coverage. Importantly, we are seeing encouraging HeatSticks offtake volume trends in all launch markets. The chart highlights our weekly indexed offtake volume performance during the first half of 2016 for the launch geographies where iQOS has been present since the beginning of the year. 
The commercialization of iQOS continues to progress well across other metrics. As highlighted by Italy and Switzerland, we are generally achieving combined full and predominant conversion levels in line with those in Japan. We're also seeing decreasing cannibalization rates in both Italy and Switzerland, consistent with Japan. In addition, iQOS was present in 10 markets by the end of June, following its commercialization in select cities in Denmark, Germany and Monaco. We remain on track to launch iQOS in key cities in around 20 markets by the end of this year. 
In conclusion, our second quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, reflecting favorable developments across many of our key markets, though cigarette shipment volume was lower than anticipated due to Argentina, North Africa and Pakistan. We are making exciting progress with the commercialization of iQOS and are on track with other launch plans for this year. We remain focused on generating strong free cash flow and continue to forecast full year 2016 free cash flow broadly in line with last year's level. The outlook for 2016 remains strong. We are raising our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance, which on a currency-neutral basis continues to reflect the growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42. 
Thank you. And I will be now happy to answer your questions."

Look, I think at this stage, I think we'll prefer to say that we will likely miss our volume high expectations, our initial expectations for the year. I think we'll come definitely lower than 1.5% decline, which are 1% to 1.5% decline. We might be as low as 3% for the full year. This will be coming from the few geographies which not necessarily put a big pressure on our bottom line, but that's -- at this stage, that might be the outlook for the full year. This obviously may result in some industry volumes to be adjusted accordingly. I think initially, we said that industry somewhere should be in the range of 2% to 2.5% and industry might be lower by 2.5%. But we will have to see, okay? Just to be on a cautious side. Now when it comes to tax increases, yes, Argentina was a very large increase and resulted in a very high price increase. So there is, I think, at this moment, we could see impact on the volume. And I think it may continue for some time, maybe not for the long time because this outsized tax increase happens in the high inflationary markets. I guess that time will help the consumers to accommodate to the price level, I would argue, faster than in our situation. And outside Argentina, frankly speaking, we have not had anything which will be very disturbing on excise increase. I mean, Algeria, it's much more -- the whole context of the North Africa, the political instability, what is happening at the borders in the individual markets, countries there. Plus we have a specific, to us, issue, which I highlighted in my remarks, connected with the rollout of Architecture 2.0 for the Marlboro Red variant when we had, I have to admit, the first market in which we've been confronted with the less or lower-than-expected acceptance of a new Marlboro. And as you know, we have rolled out Marlboro to 100-plus markets. And this is the only market in which we had some significant headwinds from the beginning of the year. We're obviously working on addressing that thing. It's a marketing perception program. But it may take us some time to address this. So hopefully, part of that improvement we should see already this year. I hope I answered your questions."

So that, just based on rough numbers, suggests about 50% growth in Q4 and basically would imply maybe that the margins are similar throughout the year rather than stepping down in Q4. So I guess, mechanically, I can see how it works. But the comparison to last year's elevated spending in the fourth quarter seemed to be about a 3% to 4% tailwind for the full year. So in terms of closing the gap and getting up to that 10% to 12% range, are there any other specific factors or sources of flexibility around the timing of reinvestment that you can point to just to sort of increase our confidence around the levers you have to pull to get up to that level of earnings growth?"

Thank you because actually, it reminded me that I forgot to put it in the context of iQOS, right, that the volumes, which we -- that the guidance or the expectations for the volume which we shared are obviously on the combustible cigarettes. And as you noticed presumably on the quarter already, we start having quite significant volumes of iQOS, which are not included in this number. Now clearly, iQOS sales or HeatSticks sales for the year will, to some extent, offset the volume declines, which we'll have on a combustible business. That, on a positive side, will not fully offset because we have capacity limitations, which I may -- on the HeatSticks, which I may cover in a second. Having said so, I mean, some of the volumes which may come short this year, they're coming from the relatively lower-margin places, except for Algeria, where we have a problem with Marlboro. I mean, the Pakistan volumes, the Philippines volumes, they count in the statistics, if you like, but they don't really make a big impact or big change at the bottom line. So we're pretty comfortable, especially Philippines because the market is losing and we're losing the extremely low-margin volumes or 0 margin volumes at the bottom of the market and we're having some positive recovery for the mix for Marlboro. Now coming to iQOS is that, as you might have noticed, the shipments for the total of PMI of iQOS in a quarter to $1.6 billion, they're almost 4x higher than what we had in the first quarter. So we can see the dynamics of the acceptance of iQOS. Obviously, it's very much driven by Japan, and we have to be very much focused on Japan this year because we don't have unlimited capacity. You might remember, we have accelerated the launch plans of all markets, including Japan, by about a year, not being fully ready on the manufacturing side. Initially, our capacity was to be in the range of 5 billion units. We have made some efforts to increase that capacity by 1 billion or so this year. But I wouldn't expect any further miracles on our capacity this year. And we may continue with some pressure on our capacity for the beginning of this year. We're right now revising our CapEx plans and in order to accelerate not only the increase or the acceleration of the 30 billion capacity plant, which we built in Italy, in order to be able to satisfy the market demand."

Now Japan's share, which we have disclosed today, allowed us to leave the total corporate share, i.e., for both combined categories, by more than 2 points. So I think that's significant, especially in Japan. Now what's more important is if we look at the exit shares of June, so you might think the last week, last 2 weeks, how it's been accruing in Japan, we have crossed the 5 points, 5% share of market mark in Tokyo, okay? And we're still growing. I mean, the volume growth is somewhere in the range of about 20-plus percent on a monthly basis. So we could see the push. We could see the consumers coming to iQOS stores and to other places in which devices are available almost fully prepared, fully, one could say, converted already to the use of iQOS as the conversion rate are double of what we had at the beginning of our iQOS journey in Japan. We estimate, Bonnie, that at this point in time, we might have about 600,000 exclusive or fully switched users of iQOS in Japan. It essentially translates with the 600,000 people in Japan who quit combustible smoking, and they fully adopted iQOS. I think it's spectacular."

Indonesia always plays the significant role because beginning of the year, they're not really in the net price increases, and now they're moving into the positive price territories. So I think the 6% is achievable. I think we feel confident about this. There is a pricing -- some price negativity due to the allowances of discounts, which we're giving to the iQOS purchasers, not the HeatSticks buyers, the iQOS purchasers in Japan. And although over a period of time, we'll have reduced in yen per device the discount due to the higher volume of the devices which we're selling, I mean, that puts a little bit of a negative on a pricing variance due to the allowances behind iQOS.

Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, I mean, we have to bear in mind that we don't have fully available capacity. And we are today in a situation that we have a national coverage -- the only place where we have a national coverage is Japan. And we know that those will switch to iQOS. So 600,000-plus consumers in Japan, we cannot put them in a situation of out of stock because they themselves told us that after 2 or 3 weeks of smoking iQOS, they actually don't want to, don't like to and they cannot switch back to cigarettes. So we're a little bit trapped now in this situation that we have to make sure that Japan has a continuity of the supply before we start to put foot stronger on the pedal in other places. So we're preparing our iQOS stores. I think, by now, we have more than 20 flagship stores in a number of geographies, obviously including Japan. We're preparing the Internet. We're preparing the sales force, the whole commercializations, we can start. We're recruiting the first consumers, the first smokers in these places. But frankly speaking, at this stage, throwing more resources would just generate a higher demand. And we are not in a situation where we can meet the demand with our supply constraints at this moment in time. So this is how we have to work. The second market which is close to national expansion, full expansion, is Switzerland. And in Switzerland, we start moving -- if you remember the market share in the German part. And I think we grew the volumes in that part by about 50% quarter-on-quarter. We continue growing the market share in the French part. We think we crossed about the 2% market share at the end of Q2. So it's not in our interest now, knowing that we don't have a continuity of supply at this moment, to push the march on iQOS."

And the HeatStick is the bottleneck which we have for now. And the same applies, to a large extent, to other places. Now if I compare Switzerland, I think iQOS is now available in 200-plus outlets. So we're not really in the full national coverage in any of these places. Moscow, we're in a couple of stores. We have one store in Lisbon. So it's really very small.

And assuming that we properly can estimate an underlying market in these places, it's a little bit of science and art actually together, I think we're approaching about 0.3, maybe 0 -- about the 0.3% [ph] in the market share. So versus where we've been at the beginning, remember, Milan was, for the longest time, 0.1, 0.2. 0.2 to 0.3 is quite a significant improvement. If I take it from a volume perspective, I mean, we see in Italy, like in another places, about 20% volume growth every month, month-per-month. So we're starting on a slow pace, [indiscernible], but the growth is there. So I think the moment when we'll be able to amplify Italy to the national coverage, like we did in Japan, obviously we need to discount the different channels of communications which we have available in Italy versus in Japan. But I think the prospects are there. I think we should see more and more of Japan -- of the Italy improvements or strong performance towards -- in the second part of the year.

As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to a range of $4.45 to $4.55 at the prevailing exchange rates. The revision is driven solely by cu",1752,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to a range of $4.45 to $4.55 at the prevailing exchange rates. The revision is driven solely by currency. 
Our full year business outlook remains strong. Our guidance, therefore, now includes $0.40 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. We expect our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth in the third quarter to be broadly in line with that of the second quarter. Consequently, our full year 2016 adjusted diluted EPS growth on the same basis is expected to be heavily skewed toward the final quarter, largely reflecting a favorable comparison versus the fourth quarter of 2015, during which we made significant investments behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio. 
As seen on this slide, the $0.05 moderation in the currency impact on our guidance primarily reflects the appreciation of the Japanese yen and the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar since we last provided guidance in April. 
Let me now take you through our second quarter results. Our organic cigarette shipment volume declined by 4.8% or by 4.3% excluding estimated inventory movements due in large part to decreases in low-margin volumes in Pakistan and the Philippines. These markets accounted for approximately 2 points of the organic cigarette shipment volume decline. 
Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the second quarter increased by 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively, excluding currency. The growth in adjusted OCI reflected favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume/mix, particularly in the EEMA and Asia Regions as well as higher costs related to the commercialization of iQOS. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 1.7%, excluding currency.
Our favorable pricing volumes of $344 million in the second quarter reflected positive contributions from all regions, notably EU and EEMA. The favorable pricing in the Asia Region was driven by Indonesia and the Philippines, partly offset by Japan and Korea. During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, including those shown on this slide, which should support favorable pricing in the second half of the year. In addition, earlier this month, we received approval from the Ministry of Finance in Japan to increase the retail price of select Parliament variants by JPY 10 per pack effective August 1. For the full year, we continue to anticipate a pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenues. 
Our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.4 points in the quarter due mainly to the Asia Region. Marlboro cigarette share increased slightly with growth in the EU, Asia and Latin America & Canada Regions, partly offset by a decline in the EEMA Region. 
Turning now to our regional results. Cigarette industry volume in the EU Region declined by more than 0.3%, excluding estimated inventory movements, reflecting a continuation of the 4 favorable trends listed on the slide that we have observed over recent quarters. We also attribute some of the industry resilience to the estimated favorable impact of immigration in select geographies. 
The continued moderation in the level of illicit trade is consistent with the findings of an annual study published by KPMG in May. It concluded that the incidence of illicit trade in the EU declined by 0.6 points to 9.8% in 2015 with decreases in most major markets. For the full year, we forecast the decline in cigarette industry volume of around 1%.
Our cigarette market share in the EU Region decreased by 0.2 points in the second quarter. The decline was due mainly to Germany and Italy, partly offset by share growth in 4 of the region's other largest market by industry volume, where Marlboro share increased. In Germany, the share decline was due in large part to estimated inventory movements, though it also partly reflected the impact of L&M leaving its around EUR 5 price point in 2015. In Italy, the decline was due largely to the timing of competitors' price increases as well as adult smoker down-trading to the mid- and super-low price segments. 
Regional adjusted OCI increased by 3.5%, excluding currency, driven by higher pricing, notably in Germany and Italy, and supported by the resilient cigarette industry volume performance. For the full year, we are targeting currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the high single-digit range, driven in part by a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter.
In the EEMA Region, we recorded strong results in the quarter with adjusted OCI growth of 10.1%, excluding currency, driven by Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. In Russia, higher pricing drove another quarter of double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth, consistent with our full year target. Cigarette industry volume declined by 6.8% in the quarter and by 5.3% June year-to-date. Our cigarette market share decline in the quarter was due mainly to the slower penetration of our competitors' price increases. Given the continued resilience of cigarette industry volume, we now forecast a full year 2016 industry decline of around 7%.
Turkey also recorded solid currency-neutral OCI growth in the quarter, driven by favorable volume/mix, reflecting higher cigarette shipment volume supported by Marlboro and higher pricing. Our strong currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the EEMA Region came despite negative volume/mix in North Africa, where general macroeconomic and geopolitical instability continued to put pressure on cigarette industry volume and premium-priced products, including Marlboro. In Algeria specifically, Marlboro has also been impacted by the combination of steep excise tax-driven price increases earlier this year and lower-than-anticipated adult smoker acceptance of the 2.0 Architecture for Marlboro Round Taste. 
In the Latin America & Canada Region, we recorded cigarette share growth of 0.7 points, driven by Brazil and Canada. Marlboro cigarette share increased by 0.4 points, reflecting growth, notably in Brazil. Currency-neutral adjusted OCI declined in the quarter due largely to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina following a significant excise tax increase in May, which resulted in retail price increases of approximately 50% on an industry weighted average basis. The decline was partly offset by favorable pricing, notably in Argentina and Canada.
Turning now to the Asia Region. Our adjusted OCI declined by 5.4%, excluding currency. This was due mainly to unfavorable volume/mix and higher costs related to the commercialization of iQOS. The lower volume/mix was predominantly in Japan, primarily reflecting an unfavorable comparison with the second quarter of 2015 related to distributor inventory movements. For the full year, we are targeting regional adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency, in the mid- to high single-digit range, driven in part by a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter. 
Our positive full year outlook for the Asia Region is supported by favorable development in several of our key markets. In the Philippines, price gaps between Marlboro and lower-priced brands remained stable throughout the quarter and represented a significant narrowing compared to the second quarter of 2015. This continued to support our share growth and positive mix. In Indonesia, our quarterly market share is beginning to stabilize on a sequential basis and has benefited from our latest launches and geographical expansions in the machine-made kretek segment. For the full year, we are targeting double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth despite a cigarette industry volume decline forecast in the range of 1% to 2%. In Japan, we are also seeing signs of stabilizations in our cigarette market share on a sequential basis after excluding the estimated impact of inventory movements. Marlboro is responding well to the reduced price gap with the leading brand in the market while recent launches, such as Lark 7.0 Splash Purple in the differentiated menthol taste category, are showing positive momentum. 
I will now cover iQOS, beginning with our exceptional performance in Japan. HeatSticks market share has increased steadily since the national rollout in mid-April, reaching an estimated 2.7% for the last week of June. For the second quarter, HeatSticks market share reached 2.2%, more than double its first quarter share. Given the success of iQOS, we are working to effectively manage our HeatSticks capacity and iQOS device supply to ensure we can meet HeatSticks demand over the balance of 2016. 
The performance of iQOS in Japan has been supported by growing adult smoker conversion. Based on our most recent data, 70% of iQOS purchasers have either fully or predominantly converted to it. Our research in Japan also indicates 2 other positive developments. First, the level of HeatSticks cannibalizations from our own cigarette portfolio has declined to around 35% from around 40% when we began the initial geographic expansion of iQOS last September. Second, the growth of HeatSticks is resulting in up-trading as adult smokers across all price segments are converting to a premium-priced product. 
The strong performance of iQOS in Japan highlights its potential in our other launch markets, which today are in earlier stages of commercialization and geographic coverage. Importantly, we are seeing encouraging HeatSticks offtake volume trends in all launch markets. The chart highlights our weekly indexed offtake volume performance during the first half of 2016 for the launch geographies where iQOS has been present since the beginning of the year. 
The commercialization of iQOS continues to progress well across other metrics. As highlighted by Italy and Switzerland, we are generally achieving combined full and predominant conversion levels in line with those in Japan. We're also seeing decreasing cannibalization rates in both Italy and Switzerland, consistent with Japan. In addition, iQOS was present in 10 markets by the end of June, following its commercialization in select cities in Denmark, Germany and Monaco. We remain on track to launch iQOS in key cities in around 20 markets by the end of this year. 
In conclusion, our second quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, reflecting favorable developments across many of our key markets, though cigarette shipment volume was lower than anticipated due to Argentina, North Africa and Pakistan. We are making exciting progress with the commercialization of iQOS and are on track with other launch plans for this year. We remain focused on generating strong free cash flow and continue to forecast full year 2016 free cash flow broadly in line with last year's level. The outlook for 2016 remains strong. We are raising our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance, which on a currency-neutral basis continues to reflect a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42. 
Thank you. And I will be now happy to answer your questions."

Look, I think at this stage, I think we'll prefer to say that we will likely miss our volume high expectations, our initial expectations for the year. I think we'll come definitely lower than 1.5% decline, which are 1% to 1.5% decline. We might be as low as 3% for the full year. This will be coming from the few geographies which not necessarily put a big pressure on our bottom line, but that's -- at this stage, that might be the outlook for the full year. This obviously may result in some industry volumes to be adjusted accordingly. I think initially, we said that industry somewhere should be in the range of 2% to 2.5% and industry might be lower by 2.5%. But we will have to see, okay? Just to be on a cautious side. Now when it comes to tax increases, yes, Argentina was a very large increase and resulted in a very high price increase. So there is, I think, at this moment -- we could see the impact on the volume. And I think it may continue for some time, maybe not for the long time because this outsized tax increase happens in the high inflationary markets. I guess the time will be -- will help the consumers to accommodate the price level, I would argue, faster than -- in our situation. And outside Argentina, frankly speaking, we have not had anything which will be very disturbing on excise increase. I mean, Algeria, it's much more -- the whole context of the North Africa, the political instability, what is happening at the borders in the individual markets, countries there. Plus we have a specific, to us, issue, which I highlighted in my remarks, connected with the rollout of Architecture 2.0 for the Marlboro Red variant when we had, I have to admit, the first market in which we've been confronted with the less or lower-than-expected acceptance of a new Marlboro. And as you know, we have rolled out Marlboro to 100-plus markets. And this is the only market in which we had some significant headwinds from the beginning of the year. We're obviously working on addressing that thing. It's a marketing perception problem. But it may take us some time to address this. So hopefully, part of that improvement we should see already this year. I hope I answered your questions."

So that, just based on rough numbers, suggests about 50% growth in Q4 and basically would imply maybe that the margins are similar throughout the year rather than stepping down in Q4. So I guess, mechanically, I can see how it works. But the comparison to last year's elevated spending in the fourth quarter seemed to be about a 3% to 4% tailwind for the full year. So in terms of closing the gap and getting up to that 10% to 12% range, are there any other specific factors or sources of flexibility around the timing of reinvestment that you can point to just to sort of increase our confidence around the levers you have to pull to get up to that level of earnings growth?"

I just want to remind that you know you remember the number presumably very well, where the EPS, minus almost 4% in the Q4 last year.

Thank you because actually, it reminded me that I forgot to put it in the context of iQOS, right, that the volumes, which we -- that the guidance or the expectations for the volume which we shared are obviously on the combustible cigarettes. And as you noticed presumably on the quarter already, we start having quite significant volumes of iQOS, which are not included in this number. Now clearly, iQOS sales or HeatSticks sales for the year will, to some extent, offset the volume declines, which we'll have on a combustible business. That, on a positive side, will not fully offset because we have capacity limitations, which I may -- on the HeatSticks, which I may cover in a second. 
Having said so, I mean, some of the volumes which may come short this year, they're coming from the relatively lower-margin places, except for Algeria, where we have a problem with Marlboro. I mean, the Pakistan volumes, the Philippines volumes, they count in the statistics, if you like, but they don't really make a big impact or big change at the bottom line. So we're pretty comfortable, especially Philippines because the market is losing and we're losing the extremely low-margin volumes or 0 margin volumes at the bottom of the market and we're having some positive recovery for the mix for Marlboro. 
Now coming to iQOS is that, as you might have noticed, the shipments for the total of PMI of iQOS in a quarter to $1.6 billion, they're almost 4x higher than what we had in the first quarter. So we can see the dynamics of the acceptance of iQOS. Obviously, it's very much driven by Japan, and we have to be very much focused on Japan this year because we don't have unlimited capacity. You might remember, we have accelerated the launch plans of all markets, including Japan, by about a year, not being fully ready on the manufacturing side. Initially, our capacity was to be in the range of 5 billion units. We have made some efforts to increase that capacity by 1 billion or so this year. But I wouldn't expect any further miracles on our capacity this year. And we may continue with some pressure on our capacity for the beginning of this year. We're right now revising our CapEx plans and in order to accelerate not only the increase or the acceleration of the 30 billion capacity plant, which we built in Italy, in order to be able to satisfy the market demand."

Now Japan's share, which we have disclosed today, allowed us to lift the total corporate share, i.e., for both combined categories, by more than 2 points. So I think that's significant, especially in Japan. Now what's more important is if we look at the exit shares of June, so you might think the last week, last 2 weeks, how it's been accruing [ph] in Japan, we have crossed the 5 points, 5% share of market mark in Tokyo, okay? And we're still growing. I mean, the volume growth is somewhere in the range of about 20-plus percent on a monthly basis. So we could see the push. We could see the consumers coming to iQOS stores and to other places in which devices are available almost fully prepared, fully, one could say, converted already to the use of iQOS as the conversion rate are double of what we had at the beginning of our iQOS journey in Japan. We estimate, Bonnie, that at this point in time, we must have about 600,000 exclusive or fully switched users of iQOS in Japan. It essentially translates to the 600,000 people in Japan who quit combustible smoking, and they fully adopted iQOS. I think it's spectacular."

Indonesia always plays the significant role because beginning of the year, they're not really in the net price increases, and now they're moving into the positive price territories. So I think the 6% is achievable. I think we feel confident about this. There is a pricing -- some price negativity due to the allowances of discounts, which we're giving to the iQOS purchasers, not the HeatSticks buyers, the iQOS purchasers in Japan. And although over a period of time, we'll have reduced in the -- in yen per device the discount due to the higher volume of the devices which we're selling, I mean, that puts a little bit of a negative on the pricing variance due to the allowances behind iQOS.

Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, I mean, we have to bear in mind that we don't have fully available capacity. And we are today in a situation that we have a national coverage -- the only place where we have a national coverage is Japan. And we know that those will switch to iQOS. So 600,000-plus consumers in Japan, we cannot put them in a situation of out of stock because they themselves told us that after 2 or 3 weeks of smoking iQOS, they actually don't want to, don't like to and they cannot switch back to cigarettes. So we're a little bit trapped now in this situation that we have to make sure that Japan has a continuity of the supply before we start to put foot stronger on the pedal in other places. So we're preparing our iQOS stores. I think, by now, we have more than 20 flagship stores in a number of geographies, obviously including Japan. We're preparing the Internet. We're preparing the sales force, the whole commercializations, we can start. We're recruiting the first consumers, the first smokers in these places. But frankly speaking, at this stage, throwing more resources would just generate a higher demand. And we are not in a situation where we can meet the demand with our supply constraints at this moment in time. So this is how we have to work. The second market which is close to national expansion, full expansion, is Switzerland. And in Switzerland, we start moving -- if you remember the market share in the German part. And I think we grew the volumes in that part by about 50% quarter-on-quarter. We continue growing the market share in the French part. We think we crossed about the 2% market share at the end of Q2. So it's not in our interest now, knowing that we don't have a continuity of supply at this moment, to push too much on iQOS."

So we're not really in the full national coverage in any of these places. Moscow, we're in a couple of stores. We have one store in Lisbon. So it's really very small.

And our share for total Italy is not a firm number because we're not really present in the whole Italy by taking the places where we are and assuming that we properly can estimate an underlying market in these places, it's a little bit of science and art actually together. I think we're approaching about 0.3, maybe 0 -- of up to 0.3% in the market share. So versus where we've been at the beginning, remember, Milan was, for the longest time, 0.1, 0.2. 0.2 to 0.3 is quite a significant improvement. If I take it from a volume perspective, I mean, we see in Italy, like in another places, about 20% volume growth every month, month-per-month. So we're starting from a slow base, I'll admit this thing, but the growth is there. So I think the moment when we'll be able to amplify Italy to the national coverage, like we did in Japan, obviously we need to discount the different channels of communications which we have available in Italy versus in Japan. But I think the prospects are there. I think we should see more and more of Japan -- of the Italy improvements or strong performance towards -- in the second part of the year. And the term of the volume trend as of Q1, Q2, which you had on the slide in my part of the presentation, you just highlight that we start pushing the right buttons there."

As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to a range of $4.45 to $4.55 at the prevailing exchange rates. The revision is driven solely by currency. 
Our full year business outlook remains strong. Our guidance, therefore, now includes $0.40 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. We expect our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth in the third quarter to be broadly in line with that of the second quarter. Consequently, our full year 2016 adjusted diluted EPS growth on the same basis is expected to be heavily skewed toward the final quarter, largely reflecting a favorable comparison versus the fourth quarter of 2015, during which we made significant investments behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio. 
As seen on this slide, the $0.05 moderation in the currency impact on our guidance primarily reflects the appreciation of the Japanese yen and the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar since we last provided guidance in April. 
Let me now take you through our second quarter results. Our organic cigarette shipment volume declined by 4.8% or by 4.3% excluding estimated inventory movements due in large part to decreases in low-margin volumes in Pakistan and the Philippines. These markets accounted for approximately 2 points of the organic cigarette shipment volume decline. 
Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the second quarter increased by 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively, excluding currency. The growth in adjusted OCI reflected favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume/mix, particularly in the EEMA and Asia Regions as well as higher costs related to the commercialization of iQOS. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 1.7%, excluding currency.
Our favorable pricing volumes of $344 million in the second quarter reflected positive contributions from all regions, notably EU and EEMA. The favorable pricing in the Asia Region was driven by Indonesia and the Philippines, partly offset by Japan and Korea. During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, including those shown on this slide, which should support favorable pricing in the second half of the year. In addition, earlier this month, we received approval from the Ministry of Finance in Japan to increase the retail price of select Parliament variants by JPY 10 per pack effective August 1. For the full year, we continue to anticipate a pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenues. 
Our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.4 points in the quarter due mainly to the Asia Region. Marlboro cigarette share increased slightly with growth in the EU, Asia and Latin America & Canada Regions, partly offset by a decline in the EEMA Region. 
Turning now to our regional results. Cigarette industry volume in the EU Region declined by more than 0.3%, excluding estimated inventory movements, reflecting a continuation of the 4 favorable trends listed on the slide that we have observed over recent quarters. We also attribute some of the industry resilience to the estimated favorable impact of immigration in select geographies. 
The continued moderation in the level of illicit trade is consistent with the findings of an annual study published by KPMG in May. It concluded that the incidence of illicit trade in the EU declined by 0.6 points to 9.8% in 2015 with decreases in most major markets. For the full year, we forecast the decline in cigarette industry volume of around 1%.
Our cigarette market share in the EU Region decreased by 0.2 points in the second quarter. The decline was due mainly to Germany and Italy, partly offset by share growth in 4 of the region's other largest market by industry volume, where Marlboro share increased. In Germany, the share decline was due in large part to estimated inventory movements, though it also partly reflected the impact of L&M leaving its around EUR 5 price point in 2015. In Italy, the decline was due largely to the timing of competitors' price increases as well as adult smoker down-trading to the mid- and super-low price segments. 
Regional adjusted OCI increased by 3.5%, excluding currency, driven by higher pricing, notably in Germany and Italy, and supported by the resilient cigarette industry volume performance. For the full year, we are targeting currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the high single-digit range, driven in part by a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter.
In the EEMA Region, we recorded strong results in the quarter with adjusted OCI growth of 10.1%, excluding currency, driven by Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. In Russia, higher pricing drove another quarter of double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth, consistent with our full year target. Cigarette industry volume declined by 6.8% in the quarter and by 5.3% June year-to-date. Our cigarette market share decline in the quarter was due mainly to the slower penetration of our competitors' price increases. Given the continued resilience of cigarette industry volume, we now forecast a full year 2016 industry decline of around 7%.
Turkey also recorded solid currency-neutral OCI growth in the quarter, driven by favorable volume/mix, reflecting higher cigarette shipment volume supported by Marlboro and higher pricing. Our strong currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the EEMA Region came despite negative volume/mix in North Africa, where general macroeconomic and geopolitical instability continued to put pressure on cigarette industry volume and premium-priced products, including Marlboro. In Algeria specifically, Marlboro has also been impacted by the combination of steep excise tax-driven price increases earlier this year and lower-than-anticipated adult smoker acceptance of the 2.0 Architecture for Marlboro Round Taste. 
In the Latin America & Canada Region, we recorded cigarette share growth of 0.7 points, driven by Brazil and Canada. Marlboro cigarette share increased by 0.4 points, reflecting growth, notably in Brazil. Currency-neutral adjusted OCI declined in the quarter due largely to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina following a significant excise tax increase in May, which resulted in retail price increases of approximately 50% on an industry weighted average basis. The decline was partly offset by favorable pricing, notably in Argentina and Canada.
Turning now to the Asia Region. Our adjusted OCI declined by 5.4%, excluding currency. This was due mainly to unfavorable volume/mix and higher costs related to the commercialization of iQOS. The lower volume/mix was predominantly in Japan, primarily reflecting an unfavorable comparison with the second quarter of 2015 related to distributor inventory movements. For the full year, we are targeting regional adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency, in the mid- to high single-digit range, driven in part by a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter. 
Our positive full year outlook for the Asia Region is supported by favorable development in several of our key markets. In the Philippines, price gaps between Marlboro and lower-priced brands remained stable throughout the quarter and represented a significant narrowing compared to the second quarter of 2015. This continued to support our share growth and positive mix. In Indonesia, our quarterly market share is beginning to stabilize on a sequential basis and has benefited from our latest launches and geographical expansions in the machine-made kretek segment. For the full year, we are targeting double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth despite a cigarette industry volume decline forecast in the range of 1% to 2%. In Japan, we are also seeing signs of stabilizations in our cigarette market share on a sequential basis after excluding the estimated impact of inventory movements. Marlboro is responding well to the reduced price gap with the leading brand in the market while recent launches, such as Lark 7.0 Splash Purple in the differentiated menthol taste category, are showing positive momentum. 
I will now cover iQOS, beginning with our exceptional performance in Japan. HeatSticks market share has increased steadily since the national rollout in mid-April, reaching an estimated 2.7% for the last week of June. For the second quarter, HeatSticks market share reached 2.2%, more than double its first quarter share. Given the success of iQOS, we are working to effectively manage our HeatSticks capacity and iQOS device supply to ensure we can meet HeatSticks demand over the balance of 2016. 
The performance of iQOS in Japan has been supported by growing adult smoker conversion. Based on our most recent data, 70% of iQOS purchasers have either fully or predominantly converted to it. Our research in Japan also indicates 2 other positive developments. First, the level of HeatSticks cannibalizations from our own cigarette portfolio has declined to around 35% from around 40% when we began the initial geographic expansion of iQOS last September. Second, the growth of HeatSticks is resulting in up-trading as adult smokers across all price segments are converting to a premium-priced product. 
The strong performance of iQOS in Japan highlights its potential in our other launch markets, which today are in earlier stages of commercialization and geographic coverage. Importantly, we are seeing encouraging HeatSticks offtake volume trends in all launch markets. The chart highlights our weekly indexed offtake volume performance during the first half of 2016 for the launch geographies where iQOS has been present since the beginning of the year. 
The commercialization of iQOS continues to progress well across other metrics. As highlighted by Italy and Switzerland, we are generally achieving combined full and predominant conversion levels in line with those in Japan. We're also seeing decreasing cannibalization rates in both Italy and Switzerland, consistent with Japan. In addition, iQOS was present in 10 markets by the end of June, following its commercialization in select cities in Denmark, Germany and Monaco. We remain on track to launch iQOS in key cities in around 20 markets by the end of this year. 
In conclusion, our second quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, reflecting favorable developments across many of our key markets, though cigarette shipment volume was lower than anticipated due to Argentina, North Africa and Pakistan. We are making exciting progress with the commercialization of iQOS and are on track with other launch plans for this year. We remain focused on generating strong free cash flow and continue to forecast full year 2016 free cash flow broadly in line with last year's level. The outlook for 2016 remains strong. We are raising our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance, which on a currency-neutral basis continues to reflect a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42. 
Thank you. And I will be now happy to answer your questions."

Look, I think at this stage, I think we'll prefer to say that we will likely miss our volume high expectations, our initial expectations for the year. I think we'll come definitely lower than 1.5% decline, which are 1% to 1.5% decline. We might be as low as 3% for the full year. This will be coming from the few geographies which not necessarily put a big pressure on our bottom line, but that's -- at this stage, that might be the outlook for the full year. This obviously may result in some industry volumes to be adjusted accordingly. I think initially, we said that industry somewhere should be in the range of 2% to 2.5% and industry might be lower by 2.5%. But we will have to see, okay? Just to be on a cautious side. Now when it comes to tax increases, yes, Argentina was a very large increase and resulted in a very high price increase. So there is, I think, at this moment -- we could see the impact on the volume. And I think it may continue for some time, maybe not for the long time because this outsized tax increase happens in the high inflationary markets. I guess the time will be -- will help the consumers to accommodate the price level, I would argue, faster than -- in our situation. And outside Argentina, frankly speaking, we have not had anything which will be very disturbing on excise increase. I mean, Algeria, it's much more -- the whole context of the North Africa, the political instability, what is happening at the borders in the individual markets, countries there. Plus we have a specific, to us, issue, which I highlighted in my remarks, connected with the rollout of Architecture 2.0 for the Marlboro Red variant when we had, I have to admit, the first market in which we've been confronted with the less or lower-than-expected acceptance of a new Marlboro. And as you know, we have rolled out Marlboro to 100-plus markets. And this is the only market in which we had some significant headwinds from the beginning of the year. We're obviously working on addressing that thing. It's a marketing perception problem. But it may take us some time to address this. So hopefully, part of that improvement we should see already this year. I hope I answered your questions."

So that, just based on rough numbers, suggests about 50% growth in Q4 and basically would imply maybe that the margins are similar throughout the year rather than stepping down in Q4. So I guess, mechanically, I can see how it works. But the comparison to last year's elevated spending in the fourth quarter seemed to be about a 3% to 4% tailwind for the full year. So in terms of closing the gap and getting up to that 10% to 12% range, are there any other specific factors or sources of flexibility around the timing of reinvestment that you can point to just to sort of increase our confidence around the levers you have to pull to get up to that level of earnings growth?"

I just want to remind that you remember the number presumably very well, where the EPS, minus almost 4% in the Q4 last year. So clearly, we'll come very strong -- with a very strong growth this year.

Thank you because actually, it reminded me that I forgot to put it in the context of iQOS, right, that the volumes, which we -- that the guidance or the expectations for the volume which we shared are obviously on the combustible cigarettes. And as you noticed presumably on the quarter already, we start having quite significant volumes of iQOS, which are not included in this number. Now clearly, iQOS sales or HeatSticks sales for the year will, to some extent, offset the volume declines, which we'll have on a combustible business. That, on a positive side, will not fully offset because we have capacity limitations, which I may -- on the HeatSticks, which I may cover in a second. Having said so, I mean, some of the volumes which may come short this year, they're coming from the relatively lower-margin places, except for Algeria, where we have a problem with Marlboro. I mean, the Pakistan volumes, the Philippines volumes, they count in the statistics, if you like, but they don't really make a big impact or big change at the bottom line. So we're pretty comfortable, especially Philippines because the market is losing and we're losing the extremely low-margin volumes or 0 margin volumes at the bottom of the market and we're having some positive recovery for the mix for Marlboro. Now coming to iQOS is that, as you might have noticed, the shipments for the total of PMI of iQOS in a quarter to $1.6 billion, they're almost 4x higher than what we had in the first quarter. So we can see the dynamics of the acceptance of iQOS. Obviously, it's very much driven by Japan, and we have to be very much focused on Japan this year because we don't have unlimited capacity. You might remember we have accelerated the launch plans of all markets, including Japan, by about a year, not being fully ready on the manufacturing side. Initially, our capacity was to be in the range of 5 billion units. We have made some efforts to increase that capacity by 1 billion or so this year. But I wouldn't expect any further miracles on our capacity this year. And we may continue with some pressure on our capacity for the beginning of this year. We're right now revising our CapEx plans and in order to accelerate not only the increase or the acceleration of the 30 billion capacity plant, which we built in Italy, in order to be able to satisfy the market demand."

Now Japan's share, which we have disclosed today, allowed us to lift the total corporate share, i.e., for both combined categories, by more than 2 points. So I think that's significant, especially in Japan.

And we're still growing. I mean, the volume growth is somewhere in the range of about 20-plus percent on a monthly basis. So we could see the push. We could see the consumers coming to iQOS stores and to other places in which devices are available almost fully prepared, fully, one could say, converted already to the use of iQOS as the conversion rate are double of what we had at the beginning of our iQOS journey in Japan. We estimate, Bonnie, that at this point in time, we must have about 600,000 exclusive or fully switched users of iQOS in Japan. It essentially translates to the 600,000 people in Japan who quit combustible smoking, and they fully adopted iQOS. I think it's spectacular."

Indonesia always plays the significant role because beginning of the year, they're not really in the net price increases, and now they're moving into the positive price territories. So I think the 6% is achievable. I think we feel confident about this. There is a pricing -- some price negativity due to the allowances of discounts, which we're giving to the iQOS purchasers, not the HeatSticks buyers, the iQOS purchasers in Japan. And although over a period of time, we'll have reduced in the -- in yen per device the discount due to the higher volume of the devices which we're selling, I mean, that puts a little bit of a negative on the pricing variance due to the allowances behind iQOS.

So we're essentially moving the yen into positive territory."

Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, I mean, we have to bear in mind that we don't have fully available capacity. And we are today in a situation that we have a national coverage -- the only place where we have a national coverage is Japan. And we know that those will switch to iQOS. So 600,000-plus consumers in Japan, we cannot put them in a situation of out of stock because they themselves told us that after 2 or 3 weeks of smoking iQOS, they actually don't want to, don't like to and they cannot switch back to cigarettes. So we're a little bit trapped now in this situation that we have to make sure that Japan has a continuity of the supply before we start to put foot stronger on the pedal in other places. So we're preparing our iQOS stores. I think, by now, we have more than 20 flagship stores in a number of geographies, obviously including Japan. We're preparing the Internet. We're preparing the sales force, the whole commercializations, we can start. We're recruiting the first consumers, the first smokers in these places. But frankly speaking, at this stage, throwing more resources would just generate a higher demand. And we are not in a situation where we can meet the demand with our supply constraints at this moment in time. So this is how we have to work. The second market which is close to national expansion, full expansion, is Switzerland. And in Switzerland, we start moving -- if you remember the market share in the German part. And I think we grew the volumes in that part by about 50% quarter-on-quarter. We continue growing the market share in the French part. We think we crossed about the 2% market share at the end of Q2. So it's not in our interest now, knowing that we don't have a continuity of supply at this moment, to push too much on iQOS."

So we're not really in the full national coverage in any of these places. Moscow, we're in a couple of stores. We have one store in Lisbon. So it's really very small.

And our share for total Italy is not a firm number because we're not really present in the whole Italy by taking the places where we are and assuming that we properly can estimate an underlying market in these places, it's a little bit of science and art actually together. I think we're approaching about 0.3, maybe 0 -- of up to 0.3% in the market share. So versus where we've been at the beginning, remember, Milan was, for the longest time, 0.1, 0.2. 0.2 to 0.3 is quite a significant improvement. If I take it from a volume perspective, I mean, we see in Italy, like in another places, about 20% volume growth every month, month-per-month. So we're starting from a slow base, I'll admit this thing, but the growth is there. So I think the moment when we'll be able to amplify Italy to the national coverage, like we did in Japan, obviously we need to discount the different channels of communications which we have available in Italy versus in Japan. But I think the prospects are there. I think we should see more and more of Japan -- of the Italy improvements or strong performance towards -- in the second part of the year. And the term of the volume trend as of Q1, Q2, which you had on the slide in my part of the presentation, you just highlight that we start pushing the right buttons there."

Following the comprehensive business review that we provided during our recent Investor Day event, I will focus today on a brief summary of our 2016 full year outlook and third quarter results and highli",1054,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Following the comprehensive business review that we provided during our recent Investor Day event, I will focus today on a brief summary of our 2016 full year outlook and third quarter results and highlight some important developments in select geographies. A detailed discussion of our third quarter and year-to-date September results can be found in our earnings release.
Let me begin with our full year outlook. As announced this morning, we are reaffirming our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be in the [ph] range of $4.53 to $4.58. Our guidance includes $0.35 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015.
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate strong, currency-neutral net revenue growth, driven primarily by the annualization of price increases and the growth of RRPs. We also anticipate a favorable cost comparison, driven by the significant investments that we made in the fourth quarter of 2015 behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio, including those related to the implementation of the EU Tobacco Products Directive.
Moving to our third quarter results. Net revenues and adjusted OCI increased by 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively, excluding currency, reflecting favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume/mix, particularly in the EEMA region. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 4%, excluding currency.
Our favorable pricing variance of $440 million in the third quarter was driven by positive contributions from all regions, notably EEMA. During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, including those shown on the slide, which should further support favorable pricing in the fourth quarter.
We recorded currency-neutral financial growth in the third quarter despite an organic cigarette shipment volume decline of 5.4%. The decrease was due mainly to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia as well as lower cigarette market share, notably in North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, partly offset by market share growth in the EU region.
Year-to-date September, our cigarette shipment volume declined by 3.9%, consistent with the year-to-date August decrease that I referenced at Investor Day. We continue to anticipate a similar decline for the full year 2016.
Our shipment volume for heated tobacco sticks reached 2.1 billion units in the third quarter, an increase of approximately 900 million units compared to the second quarter of this year. While principally driven by Japan, all iQOS-launched [ph] markets contributed to this growth. While our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.6 points in the third quarter due notably to North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, Marlboro cigarette share increased by 0.3 points, driven by the EU and Asia region.
Let me now move to select geographies, beginning with the EU region. Regional cigarette industry volume declined by 1.4% in the third quarter, contributing to a year-to-date September decrease of 0.2%. For the full year, we continue to expect a decline of around 1%. Our regional cigarette share in the quarter increased by 0.4 points, driven by the continued strong performance of Marlboro, which grew share in 4 of the region's top 6 markets by cigarette industry volume, notably Germany and Spain.
In Indonesia, we recorded sequential market share growth in the third quarter, driven by our strong performance in the full-flavor, machine-made kretek segment, notably following the geographical expansion of U Bold in June. To further enhance our position, in September, we launched Marlboro Filter Black kretek in 25 cities. Although it is early, we strongly believe that this offer will set [ph] the standard for the full-flavor, machine-made kretek segment.
In addition, this month, the Indonesian Ministry of Finance issued its 2017 excise tax regulation, which will result in a weighted average excise tax increase of approximately 10% industry-wide. As you may recall, the weighted average increase in 2016 was approximately 15%.
In Japan, our cigarette market share continued to stabilize and was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of last year. This performance is notable, given the impact of HeatSticks cannibalizations [ph] on our cigarette share and was supported by recent Lark and Marlboro launches.
IQOS continues to perform exceptionally well, with HeatSticks market share reaching 4.3% in the last week of September. In the third quarter, HeatSticks market share was 3.5%, an increase of 1.3 points compared to the second quarter of 2016. Importantly, the share gains have been achieved despite the limits we have placed on iQOS device sales since June.
PMI's total combined market share, including cigarettes and HeatSticks, was 27.9% in the third quarter, reflecting an increase of 2.5 points compared to the same period in 2015.
In North Africa, our third quarter market share was 24.6%, representing a sequential increase versus the second quarter. This growth was driven by the improving performance of Marlboro in Algeria, highlighting the early success of the initiatives that we shared during the Investor Day.
In Russia, the Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal earlier this month to raise the specific and the [ph] minimum excise tax levels for 2017 by approximately 10% above what is currently in the tax code. If the proposal is approved by the Duma and signed into law by the President, it will result, assuming full pass-on, in a total tax pass-on of approximately RUB 11 per pack in 2017. The ad valorem rate of 13% remains unchanged in the proposal.
I will finish my discussion of important developments [ph] with an update on the cigarette market in Argentina. While cigarette industry volume continues to be impacted by the significant excise tax-driven price increases in May, declining 14.1% in the third quarter, adult smokers appear to be adjusting relatively quickly to the higher retail prices, given the broader inflationary environment. The average monthly decline in August and September was 8%. We continue to expect a full year cigarette industry volume decline of around 12% in 2016 and a return to its low single-digit historical decline rate during 2017 once the May 2016 target increase has been lapped.
In conclusion, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and our full year outlook remains strong.

I think the consumer is adjusting to the prices pretty fast relative obviously [ph] to the price increase. I think this high inflation environment somehow helps. So I think, sequentially, we should see some -- less of the pressure from the volumes coming from -- or declines coming from Argentina. Algeria, which created quite a pressure on our volumes and Marlboro, including Marlboro this year, I mean, [ph] we start seeing the first signs of a recovery. It's going to take a while, but at least on the trend line, we crossed [ph] the lowest point. So I think already in Q4 and going into 2017, I think the pressure from Algeria or [ph] North Africa should ease. Indonesia, I think the tax proposal, which came from the Ministry of Finance, is manageable. I mean, you're looking for the just [ph] tax pass-on of about, say, 10% versus the 15% increase, which was -- which took place this year. So I think that should be helpful. In addition to the fact that I think -- at least judging for the last few quarters performance of our share there, I think we should have a less, if at all, share losses in 2017 than this year and, hopefully, a bit of stronger market than we have had in Indonesia this year. Philippines is a completely different story because, no question [ph], how much we manage our mix to the positive [ph] territory. And so far, we are very successful with up-trading the markets to Marlboro, which continues to grow, [ph] very strong growth. And actually, we would like to enjoy this momentum for a longer while even if there are some pressures on the total industry volumes coming from the lower parts of the market. I think we would be [ph] fine with this. Pakistan, which also put quite a dent on our volume this year, it's presumably the most difficult to predict sort of the market because the other forces, which obviously play a role there. I mean, the contraband, I think, recently had reached about 1/3 of the market. So the question is where is the level of separation? [ph] And so we can expect the worse than this. But again, from a financial perspective, it doesn't have that much of the impact -- doesn't have that much of a financial impact. So -- and Russia, the tax [ph] increase is also pretty manageable on the high side but comparable like we had at this year. And as I said earlier, I think Russia should also turn the corner when it comes to share decline. So next year, I guess, on a similar sort of the market dynamics, we should have a less of a volume leakage due to the negative share performance."

I guess, the number of currencies, if I look how currencies were playing against us this year, and remember, we started the Q1, I guess, with like a $0.19. Q2, we were at $0.08 on EPS. Q3, we're at $0.04. So clearly, we could see that the number of currencies are starting to put a less pressure on us. Currency, which I single out during the Investors Day, which many of us sometimes tend to forget, I mean, we have some exposures in North Africa, in particular, in Egypt. So it's an Egyptian pound is a little bit of the worry, and I don't know how it will relax the currency rule and how much it's going to translate into the devaluation. Other than that, ruble is prevailing pretty okay, euro, Japanese yen. We hedge, we already hedged some positions in the 2017. But the yen already started to contribute positively in the last few months, in the last quarter definitely. So we'll have to wait until February when, postelections, post tax position [indiscernible] we'll see how the market price the currencies a bit tight."

Following the comprehensive business review that we provided during our recent Investor Day event, I will focus today on a brief summary of our 2016 full year outlook and third quarter results and highlight some important developments in select geographies. A detailed discussion of our third quarter and year-to-date September results can be found in our earnings release.
Let me begin with our full year outlook. As announced this morning, we are reaffirming our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be in a range of $4.53 to $4.58. Our guidance includes $0.35 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015.
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate strong, currency-neutral net revenue growth, driven primarily by the annualization of price increases and the growth of RRPs. We also anticipate a favorable cost comparison, driven by the significant investments that we made in the fourth quarter of 2015 behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio, including those related to the implementation of the EU Tobacco Products Directive.
Moving to our third quarter results. Net revenues and adjusted OCI increased by 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively, excluding currency, reflecting favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume/mix, particularly in the EEMA region. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 4%, excluding currency.
Our favorable pricing variance of $440 million in the third quarter was driven by positive contributions from all regions, notably EEMA. During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, including those shown on the slide, which should further support favorable pricing in the fourth quarter.
We recorded currency-neutral financial growth in the third quarter despite an organic cigarette shipment volume decline of 5.4%. The decrease was due mainly to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia as well as lower cigarette market share, notably in North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, partly offset by market share growth in the EU region.
Year-to-date September, our cigarette shipment volume declined by 3.9%, consistent with the year-to-date August decrease that I referenced at Investor Day. We continue to anticipate a similar decline for the full year 2016.
Our shipment volume for heated tobacco sticks reached 2.1 billion units in the third quarter, an increase of approximately 900 million units compared to the second quarter of this year. While principally driven by Japan, all iQOS-launched markets contributed to this growth. While our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.6 points in the third quarter due notably to North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, Marlboro cigarette share increased by 0.3 points, driven by the EU and Asia region.
Let me now move to select geographies, beginning with the EU region. Regional cigarette industry volume declined by 1.4% in the third quarter, contributing to a year-to-date September decrease of 0.2%. For the full year, we continue to expect a decline of around 1%. Our regional cigarette share in the quarter increased by 0.4 points, driven by the continued strong performance of Marlboro, which grew share in 4 of the region's top 6 markets by cigarette industry volume, notably Germany and Spain.
In Indonesia, we recorded sequential market share growth in the third quarter, driven by our strong performance in the full-flavor, machine-made kretek segment, notably following the geographical expansion of U Bold in June. To further enhance our position, in September, we launched Marlboro Filter Black kretek in 25 cities. Although it is early, we strongly believe that this offer will set the standard for the full-flavor, machine-made kretek segment.
In addition, this month, the Indonesian Ministry of Finance issued its 2017 excise tax regulation, which will result in a weighted average excise tax increase of approximately 10% industry-wide. As you may recall, the weighted average increase in 2016 was approximately 15%.
In Japan, our cigarette market share continued to stabilize and was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of last year. This performance is notable, given the impact of HeatSticks cannibalizations on our cigarette share and was supported by recent Lark and Marlboro launches.
IQOS continues to perform exceptionally well, with HeatSticks market share reaching 4.3% in the last week of September. In the third quarter, HeatSticks market share was 3.5%, an increase of 1.3 points compared to the second quarter of 2016. Importantly, the share gains have been achieved despite the limits we have placed on iQOS device sales since June.
PMI's total combined market share, including cigarettes and HeatSticks, was 27.9% in the third quarter, reflecting an increase of 2.5 points compared to the same period in 2015.
In North Africa, our third quarter market share was 24.6%, representing a sequential increase versus the second quarter. This growth was driven by the improving performance of Marlboro in Algeria, highlighting the early success of the initiatives that we shared during the Investor Day.
In Russia, the Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal earlier this month to raise the specific and the minimum excise tax levels for 2017 by approximately 10% above what is currently in the tax code. If the proposal is approved by the Duma and signed into law by the President, it will result, assuming full pass-on, in a total tax pass-on of approximately RUB 11 per pack in 2017. The ad valorem rate of 13% remains unchanged in the proposal.
I will finish my discussion of important developments with an update on the cigarette market in Argentina. While cigarette industry volume continues to be impacted by the significant excise tax-driven price increases in May, declining 14.1% in the third quarter, adult smokers appear to be adjusting relatively quickly to the higher retail prices, given the broader inflationary environment. The average monthly decline in August and September was 8%. We continue to expect a full year cigarette industry volume decline of around 12% in 2016 and a return to its low single-digit historical decline rate during 2017 once the May 2016 target increase has been lapped.
In conclusion, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and our full year outlook remains strong.
Thank you, and I will be happy now to answer your questions."

I mean, at the Premium segment, at least judged by the share of Marlboro and especially Parliament, I mean, that will hold pretty strong pretty well. There is a down-trading. We observe a down-trading in the market but more between the mid- and the value segments. So this is where the extra price promotions or delays in the price implementations are most frequent. We're also launching our own initiatives in these segments. So I guess, also the share pressure which we have in Russia this year, I think we should start being on a positive share territory in 2017."

But in a current environment with the restrictions for smoking, et cetera, as you notice, I mean, iQOS continues to gain the penetrations and the market share. So I don't think it's going to stall the growth prospects of iQOS in Japan."

Specifica",512,"I wouldn't change -- we wouldn't change the expectations for the industry volumes, which we have shared during the Investors Day. I think the trends are pretty much null at this stage. I think there are some improvements will continue into 2017. Specifically, to us, I think -- I start maybe with the Latin America and Argentina. I think the consumer is adjusting to the prices pretty fast relative, obviously, to the price increase. I think this high inflation environment somehow helps. So I think, sequentially, we should see some -- less of the pressure from the volumes coming from -- or declines coming from Argentina. Algeria, which created quite a pressure on our volumes, and Marlboro -- including Marlboro this year, I mean, we start seeing the first signs of a recovery. It's going to take a while, but at least on the trend line, we close the lowest point. So I think already in Q4 and going into 2017, I think the pressure from Algeria, North Africa should ease. Indonesia, I think the tax proposal which came from the Ministry of Finance is manageable. I mean, you're looking for the just tax pass-on of about, say, 10% versus the 15% increase, which was -- which took place this year. So I think that should be helpful. In addition to the fact that I think -- at least judging for the last few quarters' performance of our share there, I think we should have less, if at all, share losses in 2017 than this year and, hopefully, a bit of stronger market than we have had in Indonesia this year. Philippines is a completely different story because it's all questions, how much we manage our mix to the positive territory. And so far, we are very successful with up-trading the markets to Marlboro, which continues to grow, very strong growth. And actually, we would like to enjoy this momentum for a longer while even if there are some pressures on the total industry volumes coming from the lower parts of the market. I think we would be fine with this. Pakistan, which also put quite a dent on our volume this year, that's presumably the most difficult to predict sort of the market because the other forces, which obviously play a role there. I mean, the contraband, I think, recently had reached about 1/3 of the market. So the question is where is the level of separation? And that said, so we can expect the worse than this. But again, from a financial perspective, it doesn't have that much of the impact -- doesn't have that much of a financial impact. So -- and Russia, the tax increase is also pretty manageable on the high side but comparable like we had at this year. And as I said earlier, I think Russia should also turn the corner when it comes to share decline. So next year, I guess, on a similar sort of the market dynamics, we should have less of a volume leakage due to the negative share performance."

We will have also brands in Indonesia in some other category, which are not necessarily on the higher end of the margin spectrum. So I would rather say brand like a Jackpot in Philippines would presumably trade, so we are actually treating this more tactically. Fortune is a little bit different. It's a brand which we do manage and we stay focused. But we do also recognize that at least at this stage, Marlboro, due to the closure of the price gap, is a more attractive proposition for the consumer, and we're absolutely fine with that. And Indonesia, I mean, many of these local brands, the brands which we do support, but we also try to focus on this less dilutive to our margins."

I think our national offtake share the last week of -- or third week of September, which we have shared in Investors Day, 5.2%, now turns to be 5.5%. Then you consider pretty rapid share advancements, you're talking 20, 30 basis points in a span of a couple of few weeks. I have the same in Italy when I think the share in Italy, the launch area of 60 basis points, 0.6%, and now I think we lifted this last week of -- sorry, third week of October, I think the rating would be 0.8%.

So it's a lot of things which will net over the period of time, the timing of the shipment, the inventories, et cetera. If I take Q3 on the year-to-date basis versus Q3 year-to-date basis last year, I think that the total -- due to the shipment -- timing of the shipment inventories will be above $200 million -- excuse me, 200 million units, 200 million units."

Following the comprehensive business review that we provided during our recent Investor Day event, I will focus today on a brief summary of our 2016 full year outlook and third quarter results and highlight some important developments in select geographies. A detailed discussion of our third quarter and year-to-date September results can be found in our earnings release.
Let me begin with our full year outlook. As announced this morning, we are reaffirming our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be in a range of $4.53 to $4.58. Our guidance includes $0.35 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015.
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate strong, currency-neutral net revenue growth, driven primarily by the annualization of price increases and the growth of RRPs. We also anticipate a favorable cost comparison, driven by the significant investments that we made in the fourth quarter of 2015 behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio, including those related to the implementation of the EU Tobacco Products Directive.
Moving to our third quarter results. Net revenues and adjusted OCI increased by 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively, excluding currency, reflecting favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume/mix, particularly in the EEMA region. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 4%, excluding currency.
Our favorable pricing variance of $440 million in the third quarter was driven by positive contributions from all regions, notably EEMA. During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, including those shown on the slide, which should further support favorable pricing in the fourth quarter.
We recorded currency-neutral financial growth in the third quarter despite an organic cigarette shipment volume decline of 5.4%. The decrease was due mainly to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia as well as lower cigarette market share, notably in North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, partly offset by market share growth in the EU region.
Year-to-date September, our cigarette shipment volume declined by 3.9%, consistent with the year-to-date August decrease that I referenced at Investor Day. We continue to anticipate a similar decline for the full year 2016.
Our shipment volume for heated tobacco sticks reached 2.1 billion units in the third quarter, an increase of approximately 900 million units compared to the second quarter of this year. While principally driven by Japan, all iQOS-launched markets contributed to this growth. While our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.6 points in the third quarter due notably to North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, Marlboro cigarette share increased by 0.3 points, driven by the EU and Asia region.
Let me now move to select geographies, beginning with the EU region. Regional cigarette industry volume declined by 1.4% in the third quarter, contributing to a year-to-date September decrease of 0.2%. For the full year, we continue to expect a decline of around 1%. Our regional cigarette share in the quarter increased by 0.4 points, driven by the continued strong performance of Marlboro, which grew share in 4 of the region's top 6 markets by cigarette industry volume, notably Germany and Spain.
In Indonesia, we recorded sequential market share growth in the third quarter, driven by our strong performance in the full-flavor, machine-made kretek segment, notably following the geographical expansion of U Bold in June. To further enhance our position, in September, we launched Marlboro Filter Black kretek in 25 cities. Although it is early, we strongly believe that this offer will set the standard for the full-flavor, machine-made kretek segment.
In addition, this month, the Indonesian Ministry of Finance issued its 2017 excise tax regulation, which will result in a weighted average excise tax increase of approximately 10% industry-wide. As you may recall, the weighted average increase in 2016 was approximately 15%.
In Japan, our cigarette market share continued to stabilize and was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of last year. This performance is notable, given the impact of HeatSticks cannibalizations on our cigarette share and was supported by recent Lark and Marlboro launches.
iQOS continues to perform exceptionally well, with HeatSticks market share reaching 4.3% in the last week of September. In the third quarter, HeatSticks market share was 3.5%, an increase of 1.3 points compared to the second quarter of 2016. Importantly, the share gains have been achieved despite the limits we have placed on iQOS device sales since June.
PMI's total combined market share, including cigarettes and HeatSticks, was 27.9% in the third quarter, reflecting an increase of 2.5 points compared to the same period in 2015.
In North Africa, our third quarter market share was 24.6%, representing a sequential increase versus the second quarter. This growth was driven by the improving performance of Marlboro in Algeria, highlighting the early success of the initiatives that we shared during the Investor Day.
In Russia, the Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal earlier this month to raise the specific and the minimum excise tax levels for 2017 by approximately 10% above what is currently in the tax code. If the proposal is approved by the Duma and signed into law by the President, it will result, assuming full pass-on, in a total tax pass-on of approximately RUB 11 per pack in 2017. The ad valorem rate of 13% remains unchanged in the proposal.
I will finish my discussion of important developments with an update on the cigarette market in Argentina. While cigarette industry volume continues to be impacted by the significant excise tax-driven price increases in May, declining 14.1% in the third quarter, adult smokers appear to be adjusting relatively quickly to the higher retail prices, given the broader inflationary environment. The average monthly decline in August and September was 8%. We continue to expect a full year cigarette industry volume decline of around 12% in 2016 and a return to its low single-digit historical decline rate during 2017 once the May 2016 target increase has been lapped.
In conclusion, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and our full year outlook remains strong.
Thank you, and I will be happy now to answer your questions."

I mean, at the Premium segment, at least judged by the share of Marlboro and especially Parliament, I mean, that will hold pretty strong pretty well. There is a down-trading. We observe a down-trading in the market but more between the mid- and the value segments. So this is where the extra price promotions or delays in the price implementations are most frequent. We're also launching our own initiatives in these segments. So I guess, also the share pressure which we have in Russia this year, I think we should start being on a positive share territory in 2017."

Specific",515,"I wouldn't change -- we wouldn't change the expectations for the industry volumes, which we have shared during the Investors Day. I think that trends are pretty much null at this stage. I think there are some improvements will continue into 2017. Specifically, to us, I think -- I start maybe with the Latin America and Argentina. I think the consumer is adjusting to the prices pretty fast relative, obviously, to the price increase. I think this high inflation environment somehow helps. So I think, sequentially, we should see some -- less of the pressure from the volumes coming from -- or declines coming from Argentina. Algeria, which created quite a pressure on our volumes, and Marlboro -- including Marlboro this year, I mean, we start seeing the first signs of a recovery. It's going to take a while, but at least on the trend line, we crossed the lowest point. So I think already in Q4 and going into 2017, I think the pressure from Algeria, North Africa should ease. Indonesia, I think the tax proposal which came from the Ministry of Finance is manageable. I mean, you're looking for the just tax pass-on of about, say, 10% versus the 15% increase, which was -- which took place this year. So I think that should be helpful. In addition to the fact that I think -- at least judging for the last few quarters' performance of our share there, I think we should have less, if at all, share losses in 2017 than this year and, hopefully, a bit of stronger market than we have had in Indonesia this year. Philippines is a completely different story because it's all questions, how much we manage our mix to the positive territory. And so far, we are very successful with up-trading the markets to Marlboro, which continues to grow, and it's a very strong growth. And actually, we would like to enjoy this momentum for a longer while even if there are some pressures on the total industry volumes coming from the lower parts of the market. I think we would be fine with this. Pakistan, which also put quite a dent on our volume this year, that's presumably the most difficult to predict sort of the market because the other forces, which obviously play a role there. I mean, the contraband, I think, recently had reached about 1/3 of the market. So the question is where is the level of separation? And that said, so we can expect the worse than this. But again, from a financial perspective, it doesn't have that much of the impact -- doesn't have that much of a financial impact. So -- and Russia, the tax increase is also pretty manageable on the high side but comparable like we had at this year. And as I said earlier, I think Russia should also turn the corner when it comes to share decline. So next year, I guess, on a similar sort of the market dynamics, we should have less of a volume leakage due to the negative share performance."

So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your strategy with some of these brands. You touched on how the greater -- remember, at the Investor Day, you touched on having a greater focus on a fewer number of brands going forward. So I guess I'm assuming this is consistent with the sharper declines we've been seeing for some of the smaller brands. And I guess I was also hoping you could confirm that. Although these brands are declining rapidly, they're contributing nicely to margins as they're likely promoted less."

So we actually, for the positive mix, are improving pretty fast our financial situation there, our financial results there. We will have also brands in Indonesia in this other category, which are not necessarily on the higher end of the margin spectrum. So I would rather say brand like a Jackpot in Philippines would presumably trade, so we are actually treating this more tactically. Fortune is a little bit different. It's a brand which we do manage and we stay focused. But we do also recognize that at least at this stage, Marlboro, due to the closure of the price gap, is a more attractive proposition for the consumer, and we're absolutely fine with that. And Indonesia, I mean, many of these local brands, the brands which we do support, but we also try to focus on what is dilutive to our margins."

I think our national offtake share the last week of -- or third week of September, which we have shared in Investors Day, 5.2%, now turns to be 5.5%.

Following the comprehensive business review that we provided during our recent Investor Day event, I will focus today on a brief summary of our 2016 full year outlook and third quarter results and highlight some important developments in select geographies. A detailed discussion of our third quarter and year-to-date September results can be found in our earnings release.
Let me begin with our full year outlook. As announced this morning, we are reaffirming our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be in a range of $4.53 to $4.58. Our guidance includes $0.35 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015.
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate strong, currency-neutral net revenue growth, driven primarily by the annualization of price increases and the growth of RRPs. We also anticipate a favorable cost comparison, driven by the significant investments that we made in the fourth quarter of 2015 behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio, including those related to the implementation of the EU Tobacco Products Directive.
Moving to our third quarter results. Net revenues and adjusted OCI increased by 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively, excluding currency, reflecting favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume/mix, particularly in the EEMA region. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 4%, excluding currency.
Our favorable pricing variance of $440 million in the third quarter was driven by positive contributions from all regions, notably EEMA. During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, including those shown on the slide, which should further support favorable pricing in the fourth quarter.
We recorded currency-neutral financial growth in the third quarter despite an organic cigarette shipment volume decline of 5.4%. The decrease was due mainly to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia as well as lower cigarette market share, notably in North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, partly offset by market share growth in the EU region.
Year-to-date September, our cigarette shipment volume declined by 3.9%, consistent with the year-to-date August decrease that I referenced at Investor Day. We continue to anticipate a similar decline for the full year 2016.
Our shipment volume for heated tobacco sticks reached 2.1 billion units in the third quarter, an increase of approximately 900 million units compared to the second quarter of this year. While principally driven by Japan, all iQOS-launched markets contributed to this growth. While our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.6 points in the third quarter due notably to North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, Marlboro cigarette share increased by 0.3 points, driven by the EU and Asia region.
Let me now move to select geographies, beginning with the EU region. Regional cigarette industry volume declined by 1.4% in the third quarter, contributing to a year-to-date September decrease of 0.2%. For the full year, we continue to expect a decline of around 1%. Our regional cigarette share in the quarter increased by 0.4 points, driven by the continued strong performance of Marlboro, which grew share in 4 of the region's top 6 markets by cigarette industry volume, notably Germany and Spain.
In Indonesia, we recorded sequential market share growth in the third quarter, driven by our strong performance in the full-flavor, machine-made kretek segment, notably following the geographical expansion of U Bold in June. To further enhance our position, in September, we launched Marlboro Filter Black kretek in 25 cities. Although it is early, we strongly believe that this offer will set the standard for the full-flavor, machine-made kretek segment.
In addition, this month, the Indonesian Ministry of Finance issued its 2017 excise tax regulation, which will result in a weighted average excise tax increase of approximately 10% industry-wide. As you may recall, the weighted average increase in 2016 was approximately 15%.
In Japan, our cigarette market share continued to stabilize and was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of last year. This performance is notable, given the impact of HeatSticks cannibalizations on our cigarette share and was supported by recent Lark and Marlboro launches.
iQOS continues to perform exceptionally well, with HeatSticks market share reaching 4.3% in the last week of September. In the third quarter, HeatSticks market share was 3.5%, an increase of 1.3 points compared to the second quarter of 2016. Importantly, the share gains have been achieved despite the limits we have placed on iQOS device sales since June.
PMI's total combined market share, including cigarettes and HeatSticks, was 27.9% in the third quarter, reflecting an increase of 2.5 points compared to the same period in 2015.
In North Africa, our third quarter market share was 24.6%, representing a sequential increase versus the second quarter. This growth was driven by the improving performance of Marlboro in Algeria, highlighting the early success of the initiatives that we shared during the Investor Day.
In Russia, the Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal earlier this month to raise the specific and the minimum excise tax levels for 2017 by approximately 10% above what is currently in the tax code. If the proposal is approved by the Duma and signed into law by the President, it will result, assuming full pass-on, in a total tax pass-on of approximately RUB 11 per pack in 2017. The ad valorem rate of 13% remains unchanged in the proposal.
I will finish my discussion of important developments with an update on the cigarette market in Argentina. While cigarette industry volume continues to be impacted by the significant excise tax-driven price increases in May, declining 14.1% in the third quarter, adult smokers appear to be adjusting relatively quickly to the higher retail prices, given the broader inflationary environment. The average monthly decline in August and September was 8%. We continue to expect a full year cigarette industry volume decline of around 12% in 2016 and a return to its low single-digit historical decline rate during 2017 once the May 2016 target increase has been lapped.
In conclusion, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and our full year outlook remains strong.
Thank you, and I will be happy now to answer your questions."

I mean, at the Premium segment, at least judged by the share of Marlboro and especially Parliament, I mean, that will hold pretty strong pretty well. There is a down-trading. We observe a down-trading in the market but more between the mid- and the value segments. So this is where the extra price promotions or delays in the price implementations are most frequent. We're also launching our own initiatives in these segments. So I guess, also the share pressure which we have in Russia this year, I think we should start being on a positive share territory in 2017."

Specific",515,"I wouldn't change -- we wouldn't change the expectations for the industry volumes, which we have shared during the Investors Day. I think that trends are pretty much null at this stage. I think there are some improvements will continue into 2017. Specifically, to us, I think -- I start maybe with the Latin America and Argentina. I think the consumer is adjusting to the prices pretty fast relative, obviously, to the price increase. I think this high inflation environment somehow helps. So I think, sequentially, we should see some -- less of the pressure from the volumes coming from -- or declines coming from Argentina. Algeria, which created quite a pressure on our volumes, and Marlboro -- including Marlboro this year, I mean, we start seeing the first signs of a recovery. It's going to take a while, but at least on the trend line, we crossed the lowest point. So I think already in Q4 and going into 2017, I think the pressure from Algeria, North Africa should ease. Indonesia, I think the tax proposal which came from the Ministry of Finance is manageable. I mean, you're looking for the just tax pass-on of about, say, 10% versus the 15% increase, which was -- which took place this year. So I think that should be helpful. In addition to the fact that I think -- at least judging for the last few quarters' performance of our share there, I think we should have less, if at all, share losses in 2017 than this year and, hopefully, a bit of stronger market than we have had in Indonesia this year. Philippines is a completely different story because it's all questions, how much we manage our mix to the positive territory. And so far, we are very successful with up-trading the markets to Marlboro, which continues to grow, and it's a very strong growth. And actually, we would like to enjoy this momentum for a longer while even if there are some pressures on the total industry volumes coming from the lower parts of the market. I think we would be fine with this. Pakistan, which also put quite a dent on our volume this year, that's presumably the most difficult to predict sort of the market because the other forces, which obviously play a role there. I mean, the contraband, I think, recently had reached about 1/3 of the market. So the question is where is the level of separation? And that said, so we can expect the worse than this. But again, from a financial perspective, it doesn't have that much of the impact -- doesn't have that much of a financial impact. So -- and Russia, the tax increase is also pretty manageable on the high side but comparable like we had at this year. And as I said earlier, I think Russia should also turn the corner when it comes to share decline. So next year, I guess, on a similar sort of the market dynamics, we should have less of a volume leakage due to the negative share performance."

And then I do have another question, I guess, on your other brand volume, which was down considerably in the quarter. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your strategy with some of these brands. You touched on how the greater -- remember, at the Investor Day, you touched on having a greater focus on a fewer number of brands going forward. So I guess I'm assuming this is consistent with the sharper declines we've been seeing for some of the smaller brands. And I guess I was also hoping you could confirm that. Although these brands are declining rapidly, they're contributing nicely to margins as they're likely promoted less."

So we actually, for the positive mix, are improving pretty fast our financial situation there, our financial results there. We will have also brands in Indonesia in this other category, which are not necessarily on the higher end of the margin spectrum. So I would rather say brand like a Jackpot in Philippines would presumably trade, so we are actually treating this more tactically. Fortune is a little bit different. It's a brand which we do manage and we stay focused. But we do also recognize that at least at this stage, Marlboro, due to the closure of the price gap, is a more attractive proposition for the consumer, and we're absolutely fine with that. And Indonesia, I mean, many of these local brands, the brands which we do support, but we also try to focus on what is dilutive to our margins."

So we continue the growth, and the same is for Japan. I think our national offtake share the last week of -- or third week of September, which we have shared in Investors Day, 5.2%, now turns to be 5.5%. Then you consider pretty rapid share advancements, you're talking 20, 30 basis points in a span of a couple of few weeks. I have the same in Italy when I think the share in Italy, the launch area was 60 basis points, 0.6%, and now I think we lifted this last week of -- sorry, third week of October, I think the rating would be 0.8%.
